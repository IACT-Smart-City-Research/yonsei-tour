review_title,review_body
A real shopping experience ,This market was recommended by my hotel staff after I complained about the somehow expensive prices at the malls and it didn’t disappoint. Not only is it a good shopping experience but it is a good place to interact with the locals and offers a wide range of street food. I totally enjoyed the experience 
Closes early!,"Most people have said on the internet that you can shop here until the wee hours of the morning, but be warned that vendors DO pack up at 8 or 9PM and then it becomes a dead zone, I have tried going 4 times at night and this is the result, it is best to go during the day. "
Must eat Vegetable Hotteok and Must make Spectacles,1. 40 minute wait in mid- afternoon for savory vegetable hotteok located just across from Courtyard by Marriot NDM was worth it! Greasy but oh so tasty. Likened to Chinese Scallion pancake. Nice. 2. Shop for prescription glasses or sunnies in the many spectacle shops at the market. Prices and styles are very competitive. We settled on Polaris Spectacles shop where we found the English- speaking Mr Kim to be very patient and attentive. A pair of Varilux progressive lens which would have cost me SGD 350 back home cost just half the price here. And it took just 4 working days to get them ready for me. 
Came here at night and couldn’t find food ,Came here at night and couldn’t find the food alley. I walked around everywhere and couldn’t find it. Finally got internet and found it was north of the market 
Shopping and Street foods,"Here you can find most of Seoul famous street foods and shopping area for clothing, hats...etc, but most stores usually close earlier by 10pm."
Busy corner wit too many shops,"This place is worth looking at. Especially the jewelry building with hundreds of small shops.Anyways, not really a place where I would go shopping "
Very good for shopping small items and souvenirs,"I spent a couple of hours in Namdaemun Market. There are numerous small shops there. You can find many souvenirs and odds and ends there. Don't forget to bargain. The vendors won't be offended by this. Remember, this is not a food street. It is a place for buying/selling stuff. The prices are cheaper than those in more formal stores."
Market Exploration,"Don’t be scared to explore every nook and cranny of this fascinating market. From 10am to 5am you will find many treasures, depending on the time. Also, if you want to practice your haggling skills then this is a good place to start. (Don’t haggle food though; however, don’t me nervous about asking for a big portion.)I’ve come here with family or friends, but keep the little ones close because there is a lot of hustle/bustle taking place. Since it is a traditional style market, try some food you’ve never eaten before. I discovered cow lungs mixed with spicy red sauce and rice is delicious. This is a great place to buy cheap clothes for kids. Also, the silky grandma pants are wild looking and comfortable. I got 2 pair for 5$ once. I wouldn’t take kids here at night, but Seoul is very safe. There might be a lot of drunks singing at the moon, and if you fancy getting drunk and shopping, then by all means shop here. If visiting Korea, then this is wayyyyyyy more of a “korean” experience as opposed to doing something mundane like visiting Seoul Tower. Like I said—-explore. Go in buildings. Walk around. Haggle if you can. Don’t get ripped off. Try something exotic to eat. Howl at the moon with traditional Korean alcohol."
"Good place for cheap shopping, tourism, and souvenirs","I came here during December 2018 to buy Christmas souvenirs for my nephews!! They have cute clothes----Babies to adults!! Got a couple of nice shirts for my dad, and family. It's a nice market to experience shopping and sightseeing in Korea :)!!!"
Best Dumplings in the world ,A must visit for the food. My partner tells me the shopping was overrated and expensive. May aswell ship in the stores for better quality. 
Interesting market place,Interesting market place for varieties of Korean food and souvenirs and other stuffs too but mainly food and souvenirs.
Great food and best currency exchange,Hair-tail alley is a must visit it was so good I went three times on a seven day trip. Currency exchange rates are better here compared to myeongdong. 
Market,"A very typical Seoul market with endless roads that can be confusing, many shops selling the same things. Worth going for the interesting cultural experiences and sensory stimulation. "
Shopping area,"Night market style arrangement but open day and night. Can find anything is this market, but u need to bargain. "
It’s ok,"We came here for glasses to be made, good price and ready in 30 mins. Lots of tourist gifs, clothes, household. Notice some of the prices are expensive, compared to underground shopping places."
Shopping and strolling,"Went for a stroll trough seoul and I've stumbled on namdaemun market.It has great variety of food, clothing and other appearal. It's also. Cheaprr too!A plus thing is that they don't keep yelling at people(props)."
Great deals,"Food, clothing, knock offs and everything else you could think of. Fun to walk around and even with a lot of people, you'll feel safe."
Delicious and tasty Hot Stone Bibimbap,"I was referred to Food Alley(a small narrow lane opposite to Bldg C) by a Korean tourist representative and happened a lady who speaks well English mentioned they have English menu. Why not? I gave it a try and chose Bibimbap and turned out to be so far the best I had ever eaten. The seaweed was marinated well which made the rice smells good fragrance. If you like spicy, do tell them as I could not take too spicy food. Price wise, standard. Service, good and place is clean and tidy. Go for it, if you could. "
Great to go,"Very colourful place to go, lot of people, food, souvenirs, and what ever you want to find and not that expensive"
Definitely worth a visist,"Huge market with loads of clothes, food, souvenieres, etc. We spent about an hour walking around window shopping and eventually bought a few things as well. Loads of knockoff brands sold, make sure to bargain! Lots of small side streets that I think are really worth it to go down, there are some really tiny restaurants with some amazing local Korean food. A lot of the shops closed down at around 6pm, but a lot of the street food vendors set up around 5 and that was definitely very worth it! A lot of amazing food for very reasonable prices, and a great taste of Korean culture along the way. Metro line 4 takes you straight to the market."
a fun day in Seoul,"I was a teacher in Korea for 6 years, some of the time I lived in Seoul, other times in the provinces. Always I would make time for Namdaemun Market. If I needed something I knew I could go there and find it. The best items on my list were outdoor gear. The market had many vendors for hiking and climbing boots and shoes, crampons, clothing hats, walking sticks, energy bars, you name it, they have it. Plus you get to people watch. There was one elderly Korean lady who set up her old sewing machine in the alley way and was making her living in public. I was in so much awe of all that was around me, Korea really is a magical place in many ways."
busy street,"This street is one of the busiest streets in Seoul. You get to see a lot of clothes shops, fruit shop, candy shops and traditional sweet shops. It's worth visiting the place if you don't have other things to do."
Not special ,"Looks mostly like any market anywhere in the world, with some exaptions. Nice to walk through, but dont spend more then an hour tops"
"nice to walk and see the market for the first time, but to come 2-3 time will consider","nothing much to buy here all selling the same thing, only one cart selling cheap souvenirs vs all the stores I checked out. The seller can even give me a discount since I buy more souvenirs. Bought 1 dress after I asked for a discount and fixed price for other stores for 1 cardigan and 1 shirt. "
Bargain Market,"If you are looking for any bargains in Seoul then I recommend going to Namdaemun Market near the centre of Seoul. A busy bristling market full of people, clothing, food, accessories and lots more. This market fills every corner of the 6-8 streets that holds it within a small square area of Seoul and is a great place to explore and buy presents for back home. Namdaemun market appears to be mostly a clothing market and accessories like bags, sunglasses and watches but it also has plenty of food and drink vendors stationed around the various corners of the market. You can find some cheap bargains in here including dress trousers, football tops, bags and much more. And some of the imitations would fool anyone on the more luxurious branded items. It was so good I went back three times during my two week break in Seoul and I still think I only explored half the market so I guess I will just have to go back next time."
Nice quaint night market,This area is well known and a must see. Especially if you like a bargain or street food. There are several adjoining streets and an interesting place to go at night. It's also not too far to walk for Myoungdong night market. 
Loved shopping and people watching here,"I learned that this was the place to come for eyewear.It is full of shops selling frames from around the world.I found a pair of Grriffi frames and Anne&Valentin frames-both at a very nice savings. You can give the shop your glasses and they can make the prescription for you ,but I opted to have that done back home where it could be adjusted if there was a problem. Not all shops are created equal-shop around before you decide.I visited all of the big Seoul street markets,but enjoyed this one for all the local residents using it. Lots of souvenirs were here from China just like the other markets, but there were huge multifloor buildings filled with everything imaginable and with widely varied quality. I loved poking around and watching local buyers and sellers visit.A great place to lose yourself in the hustle and bustle-IF you have time."
Busy Typical Market,It is a large market and had everything one might want to purchase and some that you would not want to buy. It had some atmosphere but it was still just a market. The streets serving food had more character and interest.
Find it all,"Everything you could want from Korea is available-at this market. Hundreds of outside vendors selling food, clothes, trinkets and so much more. If you are in Seoul you must go to this market. "
Birthday Trip,"We walked this market a few times while we were in Seoul. Many vendors and stores offering overwhelmingly beauty supplies, sneakers and food etc. Name it, you can find it there. We spent about an hour here the first time and kept going back. We purchased a few souvenirs, teas and makeup mask at very reasonable price. "
🎋♨️✈️Namdaemun Market something for everyone ,"♨️✈️Namdaemun MarketNamdaemun Market is in the vicinity of Myeongdong Market. A conventional shopping hub where one could buy from an assortment of goods ranging from food, sports wear, bags, clothing, textiles,ginseng, accessories, cosmetics, kitchenware.Who knows one could strike a bargain or get a great discount. A must visit."
"Clothes, Trinkets, Food... like a Local","I'm always drawn to local farmer's markets and this was that, although so much more. There are fish vendors, steamed pork bun vendors (which were amazing!), clothing stalls (LOTS of clothing stalls), drugstores, spice vendors, handbags, cooking utensil shops, confectionaries, art supplies... It seems like every turn you take, you'll find something a little unexpected.For instance, the art supply store: it was about the size of my bathroom at home, yet it was packed with all sorts of things - canvases, paints, paintbrushes, at VERY reasonable prices. In fact, good quality oil paints at cheaper prices than I can get in the states. Ditto for spices. And K-beauty stores. I watched a woman make udon noodles from scratch and a man filet some fish. It was a fun experience that could be as short as a half hour or a half day trip. I'm definitely glad that we went, and I would assuredly go back. It's a great place to find authentic gifts to bring home, but a terrific place to people watch!"
Tourist gifts start here,"If you are looking for tourist gifts then I would definitely start here before venturing out to the more popular street markets as I found some great bargains here!Of course they do sell similar items but it's also a place where the locals mingle with all the tourist so it's a great place to people watch, definitely worth trying out some of the food stores too, I got some fried doughnuts and they were yummy!"
Lots of shops ,"Most shops are clothing, but this place is pretty big with several blocks of streets and alleys. Along with basements and multi floors of stores after stores. From my group, lots of ladies bought many skin care product, souvenirs and food here. "
Traditional market with street vendors,"It is a traditionalMarket place with shops and street vendors . We bought some socks , sun hats and dried fruit. I also saw some knock off clothing and bags along with fur coats . There were also food vendors and we got to try some traditional korean soup. Overall an interesting placeTo see for those who want to experience a more local vibe"
Take It All in,"There is much to see here. At first I was not interested as I had been to another market and I didn't really know why I would want to explore more stalls and why I would need numerous, inexpensive trinkets. Still, I kept walking and the next thing you know I was very interested in the market. It's interesting to see coffee shops, run by a single person, tucked between perhaps a little jewelry stand and a store selling hats. You will see all types of products, from leather jackets to $3 earrings. You will find all types of fried foods, being prepared right before your eyes. We'll find a complete alleyway of nothing but restaurants. Other food kiosks are scattered about. On one side of the market is fronted by quite a few camera shops and I even bought a lens. Well, I guess that says I was having a pretty good time."
great bargain spot for shoes and bags,"Visited this place on our ten day summer holiday last week. Lively place with hundreds of shops and stalls selling all types of Korean made shoes, bags, scarves and a lot of other goods. Lots of fake item shops, make sure you bargain well and hard. Great food stalls as well."
Can spend half a day here,"Loved the market. One can easily spend half a day window shopping or shopping and trying out some street food. Pity that we got to spend only a couple of hours there since we were specifically looking for luggage. Would have loved to browse through the shops much longer and walk around. Definitely go there while visiting Seoul. Price wise, I did not see any great deals, some shops are open to bargaining and some are not. Nothing was really marked down. Nevertheless a great place to browse and look at things that you do not need :)"
The biggest market in Seoul,"I spent half a day to visit this market and I didn't finish my tour! It's absolutely huge, you'd get lost inside it.I was a little bit disappointed about the clothing and jewellery, not good quality and they all look like each others.Much better is the food! Actually I didn't try anything, but the smell was so delicious that you can bet it was something really traditional and tipical of that place.All inside the market there are many of these street food places, and you have the opportunity to try different dishes for a low price.For sure it is very contaminated by tourism, and it has probably lost most of its characteristic atmosphere. Anyway I enjoyed my visit there, I only wished to have had more time to explore it better!"
I expected more,"The Namdaemun market starts just from the Namdaemun Gate (Sungnyemun Gate).It's a pretty big market with food, clothings, accessories, beauty products, electronic stuff, fake goods and many others, but forget theSouth-East Asia market.Prices aren't so cheap as people may think.I expected more."
The Best Souvenir Market,"Love taking souvenirs home and sharing it with family and friends but on a tight budget? Namdaemun Market got your back! They have tons of different souvenirs to choose from such as kitchenwares, clothings for adults and kids, stationeries, accessories, to beauty products, and more. They also have food alleys that's definitely budget-friendly.Another thing that I love here is that the tourist information people are everywhere! They have english-speaking personnel and other language experts that you can talk to and ask about directions and all. They're easy to find since they're wearing red uniforms and hold placards.VERY TOURIST-FRIENDLY!"
Shopping,So there is the day time shopping and night time shopping. If your looking for kids clothes you can come after 10pm to 5am. On #6 you can find many kids clothing stores. The key to getting a discount is buy more than one piece. I think the minimum is 3 and up. So we bought on this trip maybe 9 of the same kids sleep sack different colors and sizes to give to friends and it was much cheaper. For example a kids hat I bought was 15000won each but if I buy more than 3 it’s 9000won. If I buy three I save 3000won and get 3 hats! Anyway this is the deal and for accessories you need to buy by the dozens and many styles. The last time I came I bought hairpins for my kids and friends. They come out to 50cents each very cheap. There is usually less people at night and this is when the wholesale customers come so just be aware to get deals you must buy more. Also make sure you bring cash. This also helps since most money exchanges close before 10pm. Good luck shopping. 
Good if its your first time.,"A good place to walk around as it is a big market which sells a variety of things from food to clothes to Kitchen utensil. However, encountered some unpleasant experience with some store owners. Who only focused their attention to Japanese tourist. Where I was in the midst of considering to make a purchase and a group of Japanese came along, the store owners just left me abruptly and attended to the Japanese."
Cheap LOTTE snacks and cheap souvenirs,"If you're looking for a cheap souvenirs or even snacks like in LOTTE mart, you can go here. You also can find some traditional snacks in the evening."
Big market but nothing special,"The market is big and bustling. It is more about lower quality, cheaper and fake goods. We thought it might have had more hand crafted things but it didn't."
Large market,"The market covers several blocks of the city and just about anything can be bought here. Not really a tourist market, much more a real market. There are several good cheap eating places tucked away in the alleys. Many of the establishments have pictures to help choose your food. Good location for cheap eats."
All you need in the heart of Seoul,There are two main shopping districts in Seoul for buying bulk items. Namdaemun and Dondaemun. You'll find a lot of what you're looking for in Namdaemun plus you'll find plenty of places to feast your palate and stop for a drink after shopping. A must see place while you're in Seoul. It's a short walk from the subway where you can go anywhere in Seoul.
Too many shops,It was really difficult to buy anything as there were too many shops. Most of the shops sell very similar things from clothing to souvenirs. There malls are tightly packed with stalls selling yet again similar things. Also the fashion was more suitable for the older generation. Food was a let down here. The interesting was the guards from Deoksugung patrol here daily.
My mini family vacation ,"We visited Seoul again after few yrs back in 2017,2016 & 2012 via Singapore.We went to Namdaemun market few times whenever we were in seoul and there are many things here & have many choices to choose especially a shopholic like me ^^ This year our second homestay located near to Namdaemun gate 5 and we love walking just across it."
Namdaemun Market,Namdaemun Market is a good place for local food and other traditional custom. It opens up to midnight.
"Amazing local market and shops, could spend all day here.","In contrast to many other places in the world, Seoul is not super touristy and Namdaemun even less so. There's mainly Korean locals who shop and dine in the area so you won't really be got with tourist traps or tourist prices. Be careful eating at the street stalls though, you don't know if they're sanitising that stuff properly. Lots of good souvenir shops too."
Local Markets and Local Culture,Enjoyed so much more than Insadong market because it was more authentic and less typical retail. Many products were the same. Allow at least 2 hours. Enjoy!
"Big market, many street food stalls but avoid the alley restaurants displaying their sample dishes","Big market selling lots of souvenirs and cheap wares. Plenty of food stalls to try, but avoid the alley restaurants displaying their wax dishes and calling you in - we tried one and the dishes that arrived looked nothing like what was advertised, tasteless and we got only half the dumplings displayed for the same price - was then told the front displays were “samples” only. Then they pretended they didn’t know what to do with a credit card - asking for cash - when there’s their machine right there and finally put it through on the card to give us a proper receipt. Really dodgy."
It’s a market ,"It is extremely huge and you’ll probably get lost, it goes underground overground and the streets go on and on. Anything you can imagine you will find here. So big that I actually lost interest and left with only some watermelon.....maybe it’s some twisted Korean reverse psychology so make women shop less. "
Shopping and food district,A market where you can find very good street food and nice shops.I like this place and enjoyed the street food
Souvenir are here!,"We bought some magnet souvenir and keychain here. We ask the information and they were very friendly. We loves the souvenirs. Overall, Namdaemun Market is very good place to buy souvenir"
Eat... eat...eat...,"I love this Energetic Market so much.There is lot of popular street food shop in local.Mandu , Kal-guksu, Hotteok...Fresh fruit Juice."
Huge market,"Huge market south of Sungnyemum Gate. Visited on Sunday afternoon. Appeared less vibrant than Myeongdong (I had visited Saturday afternoon), and didn't have the food stalls. But prices were cheaper (unless I didn't bargain hard enough at Myeongdong). Worth an hour (or two if you are wanting to shop), good for souvenirs."
Must visit in Seoul,"A leisurely 15 mins walk from Myeongdong. Love the street food available. A great place for sight, smell and taste. Ate traditional korean bbq. It was fantastic and very reasonably priced. There's a small lane lined with small restos selling mackerel, beef soup etc. So yummy. There are stores selling cheap souvenirs to clothes, eyeglasses, contact lens. You name it they got it here."
Go in the morning,Great place to shop for souvenirs. Go in the morning because it’s quite happening. Buy souvenirs here as it is quite cheap compare to other places.
Inexpensive and good traditional street food,This open-air market is the perfect place to go and try a large variety of Korean food. Very cheap and good. Definitely suggested.
A rabbit warren to get lost in!,"Quaint it ain't. Namdaemun Market is huge. Not just a rabbit warren of streets selling everything you can imagine: from kitchenware to clothing, from bags to braised pig knuckles, there are numerous warehouse-sized buildings to explore. To get a good deal, you need to bargain."
"Shop, Eat & Drink",The area is buzzing with vendors and above and underground shops to sell you almost everything under the sun. You can walk and pick your spots totry a taste of Seoul or you can walk through the alley corridors to slide into ine of the many restaurants to eat like a local. It's the Korean version of the early days of Canal street in NYC.
Traditional market in Seoul ,"It’s a Traditional market with food and souvenirs, Kids clothing, matured ladies clothing, lots lots products, very cheap price if compare the underground street. Walking distance from Mengdong.Suggest to go at day time, shops will close at night. "
"Some will love it, others not so much","It's a market . . . many stores sell the same merchandise all at the same prices . . . lots of junk, very little treasures . . . food stalls which are mostly less than appetizing (and some with very questionnable hygenic practices) . . . and less appealing on a hot,humid, odiferous day than on a cooler, less smelly day. So, you either love it or you hate it -- it's an individual preference."
reminded me of Hong Kong markets,"We visited in the afternoon and there were lots and lots of stores that sell similar stuff. They sell clothes, shoes, souvenirs, kpop merchandise... the prices were more or less the same but some were cheaper. We did not spend much time there though since the place did not look appealing (it may have looked more alive at night) and it is easy to get lost.If you want to shop for souvenir, this could be a good place to go."
Crowded and confusing,"Much talked about this site thus the need to venture it. Indeed there are lots of shops/stores to venture but it was not my forte as I dont really like crowded area and confusing lanes. Maybe, I am not prepared for it. However we did some shopping here and as soon as we are done, we took off. No doubts there are loads of stuff selling here. Some might enjoy it thou. "
Maze of Stalls,"This is the oldest and largest traditional market in Korea. It is spread out over many blocks with about 10,000 vendors. Nowhere else in Korea can you find such an array of items. It was an interesting place to wander through even without buying anything. And it's named for the Namdaemun South Gate nearby which I visited also while in this area."
You might get lost ,This is a huge market selling different items. There are some maps saying which street sells what but we just took a wonder around. We saw a lot of shops selling shoes or hats or phone accessories. There was also a home-wear section. Some shops selling Korean souvenirs. We visited a second time as I really wanted to try a corn dog and there was a whole row of venders I think it was near gate 4 (if from here you walk down into the centre of the market). We also got some Korean sweets and found a postcard!
Average compared to Myeongdong ,"The amount of shops were lesser and less touristy as compared to Myeongdong. There were, I think, more food stalls though. "
A waste of time. ,"Majority of the clothings sold are very dated. Good for shopping of children clothings but not adult. Some vendors there are pretty unfriendly too. Pricing of souveniers are either the same or higher than what you can find at express bus terminal shopping area. I would suggest not to waste your time to make a trip here. Yes there are many stalls there but if you are looking to buy clothings, 95% of the shops are selling extremely dated clothings, after taking out food & beverage stalls, only 2% are worth a look, but pricing is higher than what you can get elsewhere. Truely a total waste of time. "
Not very good for food...disappointed,"Maybe it was because I visited Nandaemun on a weekday evening, maybe it’s because I’d just come from Taiwan where the night markets are world-renowned, but this is a very unremarkable market selling a limited selection of food. Besides fixed shops offering baked goods and pigs’ feet, there are stalls selling skewers which average about 3,000-5,000 won. Each stall sells almost exactly the same selection at almost the same price. There are alleyways off the main streets in which you can find sit-down restaurants selling the usual Korean fare - bulgogi, noodles, cuttlefish etc. I went into one of these and had spiced cold noodles with boiled egg. From the stalls I had rather some chewy octopus skewers and average chicken skewers, some bland fried shrimp and a nondescript sugared dumpling. I wouldn’t repeat the experience. Overall I was really disappointed. Having lived in China I came expecting a high standard of street food but this was nothing to write home about. I have seen much better markets in very rural areas of other parts of Asia, so I was surprised at just how uninspiring this one was given that Seoul is such a large and international city. In fact I would venture to say it’s the worst market I’ve ever been to. As for the products for sale, they are primarily Supreme imitation hoodies and other paraphernalia, and trinket shops. I can’t say I find that kind of thing interesting but if you do you might enjoy that side of the market."
Go for the crab but there are other options if you are short of time,There were some good bits to visiting Namdaemun markets . We didn’t see the deep fried baby crab anywhere else and the dumplings were excellent. The busy hot and narrow food alleys with kitchens along the walkways were a sight to see if not too enticing to eat at. Nevertheless I thought the Gwangjang Market had much better food quality and variety and the Myeongdong street stalls had much more atmosphere in the evening so if you were time pressed I’d do these first. 
Nice local market,"Namdaemun Market is quite a large place, selling a variety of products - clothing, bags, food, etc. If you want something cheap, best come here instead of going to the department stores. Also lots of places to sit down and have a coffee or snack."
Loved this market ,Plenty of shops selling so much stuff- even if you don't wish to buy this is an interesting market to visit. Lots of areas to get lost in. Lots of atmosphere. 
Selling same products ,"Nothing much to see or buy. Within 10 minutes, we left the place for good. Will recommend if you are interested for photo taking. "
Worth an hour or two,This busy market is a great place to get souvenirs and really anything you could possibly need. Grad something on a stick to eat and wander round.
Lively little market,We happened on Namdaemun market by chance on our first night in Seoul and wandered up and down the stalls which varied from the mundane (cheap tea-shirts and nick-nacks) to the fascinating - preserved ginseng roots and pigs trotters. There were several street food stalls including one stall with delicious dumplings and soft pork rolls.Small lanes run off to the left and right lined with small shops and stalls. Whilst there were a few tourists like ourselves we were outnumbered by locals. Well worth exploring.
Filled with tourist traps!,"Went during lunch hour under the hot mid day sun. The market in general is covered but the stores are quite cramped and it gets pretty heated. Was looking for the counter seats eating area like in Gwangjang Market, but walked a few rounds and still cannot find it. Ended up in some mediocre Korea “restaurant” that sells a range of Korea food. So they say jack of all trade master of none, the food was not fantastic and they expect one main dish per pax. If you are there, please walk into a small alley which u see ppl queueing for grilled fish and steam egg. May be a better choice for authentic Korea food."
Ok,OK Market full of tat. If you like fake supreme stuff you will be in heaven. Some OK street food but otherwise I'd skip this bit of town! 
Just another market,Very crowded market with lots of different shops selling the exact same stuff as all the other markets. They seem to have a high demand on phone cases in this country. We had very nice heotteok here.
Cheaper than Myeongdong,I love Namdaemun more than Myeongdong because the goods and the foods here are cheaper. But the market is a traditional one so it's a little bit dirty and crowded.
Not my cup of tea,"I didn’t particularly care for this market. Too much cheap stuff in jam packed spaces and hoards of people. People rummaging through clothes scattered across tables, cheap knock off handbags, tee-shirts, etc. I did enjoy delicious bibimbap at a small restaurant nestled just beyond the cinnamon donut street food vendor. A lovely owner who stirred my food for me and was so very kind. I preferred Myeongdong neat LOTTE and Dongdaemun neat JW Marriott and Doota."
Nice place,Typical Asian market. Very nice to visit and get an impression of how people live eat and dress. Every time we are in Seoul we visit this place.
Huge Numbers of Merchants Selling Similar items,"If you are in Seoul, you definitely need to check out their markets. It is organized chaos and something to behold. All manner of food stuffs (although seaweed seems to predominate) and ready to eat street food vendors. One of my guides indicated there were some 27,000 retailers here. All small shops. The quality seemed good for the most part. It was fun to get a little container of fried crabs and just walk around munching and seeing the various wares. Beware though, there are very few garbage cans so be prepared to carry your empty containers for a while. All the items are quite cheap. The crabs were 5000 won (about $5 USD) for a big tub. It is just a short walk from the main Seoul Railway station along the elevated walkway, the 7107. There are other shops selling clothes, tools, and souvenirs as well."
Interesting ,"This market is worth a visit. Many curious things are traded here. For example there is s shop that sells gift packaging materials, so if you are looking for a special wrapping for a gift this is the place."
Mass shopping experience! GF candy to take home!,"Remember this is not the Galleria Mall here...we are talking huge quantities of cheap mass produced items. They have. clothing, furs , suitcases, food (massive food market starts at 4:00). Look for the candy vendor that makes candy from cornstarch. They insert a filling that tastes like a snickers! No kidding. Easy to take home and they last for weeks. Good for GF folks "
Food,"Went there for street food but it is almost inexistant and scattered all around the huge market.If you are after something similar to markets in Thailand, this is not the place"
Nice street food. ,Enjoyed the street food. Deep fried baby crabs especially. The shopping is not very interesting but still worth looking at. A good place to find very local food
Great,This is a great market to visit although very very busy! It was very interesting walking around looking at all the stuff people sell! 
Bustling but nothing special ,Saw a myriad of stalls and large numbers of shoppers but was disappointed by what seemed to be quite average items being sold
Cool Market,"It’s a great market, just be prepared to do a little digging. Found good deals on shirts, scarves, every day use kinds of items."
Awesome!!,I visited Namdaemun. I could feel the traditional market of Seoul. The grilled fish restaurant inside Namdaemun was delicious. I recommend it. It was nice to walk to Myeongdong after eating at Namdaemun restaurant.
Ahhh,..its a good place to buy some item for gift..its cheap and all items is there..you just need to keep looking for it..
Fantastic Market with Great Prices ,"It seems as though every time I find myself in Seoul, I find myself at Namdaemun Market. I love this place especially if you know what to look for. They offer cheap prescription sunglasses to affordable brassware. The weekdays are the best time to go here as the weekends are crazy packed and it's difficult to even walk in the streets. If you haven't been, check it out! "
Food and shopping street,Food and clothing stalls in the middle of the road and stores along the street. Place for cheap clothes and local food. 
Fantastic smells and variety of street food ,This Market was very close to my hotel so I went down several times in the evening Lots of street food on offer it is very vibrant with lots of different people sending different types of things from pot scrubbers to jeans to three piece suites and more. Very interesting experience well worth a look
Not as interesting as Myeongdong,"I believe this place is cheaper than Myeongdong, but not as interesting. You can go here if you want to shop at a really low price. We were able to buy a lot from here, and most of our souvenirs came from this market."
"Always something to see, eat or do.","Namdaemun Market is a must when visiting Seoul. Nighttime visit is a lot better than during the day. My wife always finds several things to buy every time we visit. Remember where the restrooms are, sometimes they are hard to find. Tourist information teams can be found throughout the market. They will be dressed in all red. They have free maps of Seoul and the market in English. No need to dress up for the visit.My favorite are steamed pigs feet. The vendor will a small bag containing onions, sometimes garlic and one or two other items that compliment the feet. I always get a couple to take back to the hotel room.Recommend wearing of tennis shoes because you will definitely be doing some walking."
Bargain hunters heaven!,This is one of the largest traditional outdoor market in the middle of Seoul. Varieties of foods and goods are endless here. Love tasting some quick snacks from street vendors location in central part of the market alley. It still retains its charms from bygone era of shopping from old time.
Mommy of 4,Lots of fun with so many different shops! Don’t miss out on the socks! So many choices! A fun environment!
As the sun was setting,"We visited Namdaemun Market right as the sun went down, so I'm not sure if some of the stores were getting ready to close for the night, but we still found some awesome deals. My friend bought a cute winter jacket for $5!!! We bought some toddler hanboks for W35000, which is pretty reasonable."
Shoppers paradise for hunters,"We stayed in Tmark Grand Hotel just opposite this market and my wife went crazy shopping in here for clothes for our daughter, so many stalls to choose from, so many new and stylish clothes for our kid. Bring lots of cash or stick to a budget, try getting some discount and it works sometimes.In the evenings there are many food stalls selling all kinds of snacks so you will never go hungry."
many wholesalers for clothes,"Do go to the information booth to get a map of the place first so that you can plan which section to explore.Good for buying cheap clothes, currency exchange with attractive rates.We came here to buy children's clothing."
Quiet on a Friday night.,"We came here on a Friday night and it wasn’t anywhere near as hustling and bustling as we expected. It was around 8pm and most stalls were winding down. A few tourists were around, but we didn’t get the buzz a lot of the other reviews mention. We found a quiet restaurant for dinner and then left. During the day I can see this being an incredible atmosphere!"
Overwhelming ,Namdaemun is a shopping area which is overwhelming. While it is conveniently located and shops are inside airconditioned buildings seeing so many stalls one after the after from one floor to the other can be overwhelming. But the goods sold are definitely cheaper and you could probably find some good bargains. 
Bargain everywhere!,"You're looking for souvenirs, local items made in Korea, Namdaemun market is the place. I bought some of their local snacks like dried fruits and vegetables, sweet potato chips, and many other kinds of flavour. We got free bag of mix veggies and fruits chips for each item I bought, great deal. Namdaemun is one station away from Myeongdong."
shopping,"This place full of cheap stuff, such as souvenirs, clothes, etc. And sometimes, the seller will give you some bonus. There's a lot of street food too."
Amazing Place,I'm not sure if anyone knows how many stalls there are in Namdaemun Market! The street food stalls are interesting and it's worth trying a few to get into the spirit of things. They have a fried pancake which is then stuffed with either meat or vegetables that is absolutely delicious. The steamed dumplings with either pork or kimchi stuffing are also very good!
Dissapointing,"Not necessary to visit this place. So many better places to go. This market is filled with cheap t-shirt and hair accessories, knock off bags, etc. Nothing that you would go to Seoul for. If you do feel you need to go, be sure to go down some of the smaller alleys, as those are better than the main streets. Some good food stalls in the small alleys at least:)."
Shopping and Food,"Place to shop for souvineers and snacks. Variety street food, fishcake, lobster tail, waffle, ice cream, and more. "
Rock bottom price,Prices don't get any lower in Nandaemun market. Traditionally they cater for wholesale but some do entertain tourist buyers. Be prepared to use sign language as many don't speak English and jostle a bit as the alley can be quite narrow and cramp.
You should know what you need,"I visited this place to find a special vintage camera, there're lots of stores for that purpose near the Sungnyemun Gate. The market itself is rather messy, lots of chinese products of all kind. No good souvenirs or fashion clothes. There's a tourist info desk ot far from subway gate 5."
Best Exchange and Local Food,We stayed 9 days in Seoul next to the Seoul station..we asked to the hostel reception for the best price exchange..He said Namdaemun and Myeongdong back streets have better rate from banks.. That was right especially in the midpoint there were two places that have very good rate. After Seoul we went to Pusan and Jeju.. we couldn't find good rate..if you start from Korea journey from Seoul..I advice you can make all exchange in Namdaemun market.. and in that time you can eat very delicious Korean local food on the street..
Rows of indoor and outdoor shops,"Shoes, apparel, souvenirs, kitchen utensils, kids clothing, handicrafts, bags, street food - you can get all of these in this huge market. There are shops in the building right next to the market as well. We went in early afternoon so the crowd is not too bad. "
Open market,It is a good experience here to shop at the open air market for a variety of items such as food and clothings. There are also plenty of wholesale shops here but they cater only to businesses and does not sell to individuals. You will need time to go into the alleys to explore the variety of shops that sells household items and many other types of things. Namdaemun market is said to be the largest in Korea.
A Big Bustling Market – Not to be Missed,"Visited on a Sunday afternoon. The place was full of activity, with shops selling everything Korean one can ask for – souvenirs, clothes, all varieties of Ginseng and other medicines....and of course an endless choice of food. A great place for bargain hunters and those who enjoy browsing. One must have plenty of time to look around – there is so much to see and discover. The food stalls in particular are a great attraction – one can have a full meal just sampling the items being made at the live counters. It is on the City Tour Bus Route – just hop off soon after you start at Koreana Hotel and spend as much time as you want, before hopping back on the Bus and carrying on.....! A great experience indeed!!"
Great bargains,Visited Namdaemum for the first time. Love the varieties of merchandise here. The market is open early in the morning. Do go early before the big crowds descend. Try out your bargaining skills. :)You can get pretty good stuff ranging from scarves to Korean traditional tableware. I came back here couple more times. Don't forget to check out the little eateries in the small alleys for the authentic local cuisine. 
Cheap price,"There are a lot of bargain souvenirs, street foods, pricey and cheap goods. 1 station from myeongdong station.many choices on different items"
Fun!,"Like any market ... a great place to find soooo many great treasures! A lot of people in the Market and so many ways to travel within the market but there are info booths to help you out and also people in red jackets in the ‘intersection’ areas to help you.And don’t for get to ask for a deal! A great place to buy souvenirs! Oh, and you have to try the homemade dumpling booth ... there are a few but see the pictures for the one we went to! Absolutely delicious!!"
This market has lots of clothes bags and shoes ,"This open air market was across the street from our hotel and is mostly hidden through many lane ways , it’s amazing that from street side you wouldn’t know how much market is there until you start walking through it. Lots of good vendors but this market mostly clothes. It’s a must on your list. On a side note the currency exchange in this market have the best exchange rates all very good and clean."
Anything you can buy in one place; the market,Anything you can buy asking interpretation staffs who walk around the market for visitors'/foreigners' help if you need their kind service as free of charge.
Just as all other markets in Asia ,"This market is positively rated in most guide books. From my point of view it’s a bit overrated. It’s almost the same in such markets in Asia-colourful, noisy, overcrowded."
Great time shopping,"What a fun outdoor market. You can find anything in the market and it’s a lot of fun looking and haggling. It is easy access via subway, lots of great places to eat, and lots of cheap stuff to see and buy. "
"Busy, busy, busy","Of the two markets I went to, Namdaemun and Gwangjang, I prefer Gwangjang. Namdaemun doesn’t have near as many food stands as Gwangjang. For me, most of what was for sale at Namdaemun is junk. I didn’t buy anything. Still, Namdaemun is worth the time. Wouldn’t go again, but would recommend to friends. "
day and night market,"not a bad market to visit, basically sell lots of clothing and the street food here are cheap. clothes are quite cheap too."
Eat like a local,Weekday night is not too crowded and going here before getting dark is also a good idea to avoid the crowd.Try the local street foods of Namdaemun.
Hand cut noodles! ,Woke up in the early hours looking for some noodle in the area. Came across a small food area in Namdaemun Market that offers hand cut noodles. So yumm! Approx. 5000 won. 
Shopping lover,"Namdaemun is very famous for its cheap and affordable price if you want to do shopping. They sell clothes,shoes,socks and many more! "
Quite a let down ,This was supposed to be an old established night market of Seoul. However we found it quite deserted with few stalls. Our disappointment was saved some what by nice pork knuckle sold by a small Chinese restaurant located within the market.
Interesting place,"Ginseng everywhere :) If you want to see a real authentic market, do not hesitate to visit it. Recommended..."
A great place to browse the different items for sale,"Although I didn't buy anything there, it's a great experience to browse the different items for sale. As I was walking around, I found the dumpling people are talking about in Tripadvisor. I bought all types of dumpling to try.....yummy! If you eat there, you can help yourself with the danmuji ( yellow pickled radish) which are placed beside the stall. There are no chairs and you have to stand and eat. Along the lanes are small restaurants. If you are adventurous, you can go in and try the local food. If you stay in Myeongdong shopping area, you can walk to Namdaemun market - less than 900 meters."
Reasonable,A perfect place to buy souvenirs with bargain-able price. So many items to look at. Huge area and requires lots of walking. Must try to famous food stalls.
A very budget friendly market ,"Some stores are closed on Sunday. But most of them are open everyday, crowd starts to fill the market around 9am. Mostly dry goods and preserved food. There are small restaurants nearby. Your ₩20,000 can buy a lot of souvenirs."
Crowded huge place ,This area is huge and basically you can find everything there. I did not buy anything so I am not aware of prices. Area have also many nice camera shops. 
Cheap souvenirs ,"This is the place to find cheap souvenirs. We had a good tour around the market, we spent some time here browsing for nice souvenirs. They sell so much stuffs here. Clothing/ accessories/ footwear/ snacks/ food. We did not try any of the food there, though some of them had Halal signs. Some sellers speak Bahasa Malaysia. Just a few Malay words. Interesting! We went there just to find souvenirs. There are other places you all should check out if you want to buy fashionable clothes, shoes, cosmetic products. "
Cheap stuff from China and funky food,This is the opposite for the fancy and expensive shopping streets. Lots of little stalls selling all sorts of stuff in cheap prices. Couple of interesting food vendors as well. Nice to look around :)
Night market,"We went for the night market, the only thing that attracted me is the local food restaurant street. Recommended: Pepper beef soup with rice and bimbibabSkip: Kimchi Fried Rice"
Traditional outdoor market of Korea,"Whole sale market. Touristy but very traditional place at the same time.There would be everything you need.You can also get some cool stuff for souvenir.Calguksu street represent this place. Calguksu bibimbob nangmeonw combo is signiture meue of this place.It costs only 6,000 or 7,000 won."
Blast from the past,Cool market. Not the modern market but the old school market selling both new and old school stuff. Lots of stuff to see and experience. Overall a nice experience.
best place to shop like the locals.,start early. look for lengdang building for brooches and all the ladies bling bling accessories. the street are narrows and crowded with shops and shoppers. best place to change foreign currency.
"Lot to see, Lot to buy and Lot to Enjoy","A must visit place in Seoul, this market is the largest one in Seoul covering over 16 acres. There is very thing here, be it cloths, toys, stationary or street food and a best place to buy Souvenirs for your near and dear ones. There are lot of shops specializing in selling refurbished cameras and accessories. If you are buying anything be ready to use your bargaining skills. And if you do not want to do any shopping, it is still worth visiting here."
Casual walk,I am totally amazed by the changes through the years at Namdaemun..In fact Namdaemun is never my top option to visit. But I have changed my mind since after experiencing the changes which took place. Neater and easier to walk around with less grouchy vendors. More signs for tourists to locate different zones and with helpful guides in uniform around who speak several languages to assist with maps given.Various yummy authentic food available at reasonable prices such as Hairtail Alley which is a must try.Lovely easy connection to Seoullo7017 the pedestrians walkway from Namdaemun after all the feasting..easy going walk.
Awesome experience,"Wholesale market for costume jewelry,clothing,perserved item and a lot more to mentioned.I even bought raw ginseng from here ,from an old couple who runs a small shop.Should try their abalone porridge and red bean porridge.Thumbs up ,yummy !"
Lively,"Lively market. We arrived around 7pm so most clothing shops were already closed. However at the street level all the little food stalls were bursting with life so we tried some of the food, some of which were rather interesting! We felt safe eating these ‘street food’ because they fried/warmed them up on the spot. The shopkeepers were friendly too. A great experience."
Good market,We went there a few times.it is very big and sells everything from food to fashion you can eat good cheap korean food there aswell as good street food can get very busy in the evening.you have to go if in seoul
Souvenir and streetfood heaven,This is the best place to go for souvenirs and street food because it is much cheaper and less crowded than Myeongdong or other famous shopping places in Seoul. 
Cheap gifts and Woman accessories galore,"Come here if you want cheap gifts, t-shirts, fridge magnets, key chains etc. If you are into accessories, head to e-Lengdang 2nd floor. This is a heaven for accessories."
Daughter got a dodgy stomach after the street food ,"Be careful where you eat, my daughter got a bad stomach here.She ate the round patty with vegetables inside, Try and eat the street food that is made freshly in front of you,"
Place with traditional foods available & cheap clothings,"Went there by bus number 3 from Namsan Seoul Tower, 6 stops only. Quite a big market, as went during winter month of December, too cold to stay too long. Have good kimchi buns, fish cakes soups & food Valley with seatings to eat in comfort. Many shops to see, can bargain a little if buy more. Not all welcome bargains."
Feels like Bangkok Chatuchak market,"When you start walking into the market, for those who have been to Bangkok Chatuchak market, there is a sense of deja vu. This place similarly has different section for clothing, accessories, etc. You must look for their food alley which serve very local food. Compared to BKK, this market is slightly more spacious so one won't feel as claustrophobic."
Interesting!,We happened across this market while searching for a restaurant. It was a fascinating place to wander. 
Bought some great souvenirs,Thoroughly enjoyed strolling around this area and we bought some lovely souvenirs at the handicraft center.From crane bird boxes to Korea fridge magnets and chopstick-holders Did not yet find a great place to eat local food but we’ll try again tomorrow! 
Know to bargain?,"Actually a typical local market that people here to look for bargain. Sometime you may not get a good bargain either as you must know how to bargain. Lots of clothing, shoes, food and food stuff. Nothing special but is enjoyable to walk around and enjoy the atmosphere. One of the stall that selling the hot steam bun is really good.. Long queue and prepare to wait for your food. "
"Ho hum, same, same, same","Okay market, but same thing over and over again. Gave 2 stars for the food only, great Korean BBQ. Okay experience just to tick the box, but you get the gist of it after 20 minutes."
Namdaenun Market,An interesting Korean mixed goods market to visit when in Seoul. You can bargain for affordable products from clothings to food items from Korea
Too many stores,"I read about good review of Namdaemun Market. But for me, as a shopper for good value stuff, this place is not great. Yes, plenty of shops and many many choices. But it's mainly for reseller. I stopped by one of the store and wanted to find out the price. The sales lady asked me if I'm a seller. I gave up and walked away. "
Must visit a street market in Seoul!,"I knew I wanted to spend the day at one of the famous markets, they are so fun, loud, interesting, and you get a true sense of the culture from meeting the street vendors and trying all the exotic dishes. This market in particular I was told is the biggest one in all of Seoul, my friends and I spent nearly five hours there and feel like I barely covered a small section."
Len & Marlene ,"There is nothing you can not find in the market. It extends for blocks on end. Street vendor food is great, especially the hoteok and there is lots to buy and bargaining is part of the fun."
Worth a visit to see a street market in Seoul,"We arrived in the early evening on a Monday, and noted that some of the shops on the peripheral were selling produce that locals were buying. Walking along the vibrant streets in Namdaemun Market, you will see many shops selling souvenirs, clothing, etc, as well as street stalls selling local food. Worth a visit to see a street market in Seoul. "
over rated tourist trap,"i wanted a place to buy traditional foodstuff like ginseng, mushrooms and fruit. This was a mistake. I should have gone to the one at Jegidong when I last visited 3 years ago. This one, though nearer the city, sold mainly expensive fake toys and clothes. It is massive, with many 'gates' but each selling similar products. A total waste of time."
Shopping and local food,"Good to come in the day as you can catch many good deals in the many stores here. Fresh food sold in the Market, stationary stores , great gift giving ideas all in this one place- a whole sale centre where you can buy almost anything including costume jewellery, wedding gifts, korean handicraft souvenirs etc "
Typical Street Market,"We enjoyed the assorted food stalls - interest and different Korean fare. The shops offer a variety of clothing, luggage and other items, some, like tools, for locals."
"Neighbourhood Market, Souvenir valley.","Cheaper souvenir and more choices. From keychain, mirror, pen, shirts and many more. Compare to Myeongdong Market. Can find halal Kebab within walking distance from the Namdaemun train."
Mostly clothes,Namdaemun is a market that mostly sells clothing. There are a few other types of shops sprinkled in but the majority are clothes and shoes. The quality is similar to what you can get in the underground subway shopping but prices are higher than what you will see at the subway shops.
Tour trip,The place where one could buy cheaper souvenirs than elsewhere. Grab anything that is cheap here as I regret for not buying much from here
Other reviews got it right!,"Went on a Sunday late morning. Seems like some of the alleys are not opened. An alley called the accessories alley is totally quiet and empty, the pushcarts are all covered up and the shops are not opened. However the Main Street is busy, with all the food stalls selling the different local food items. Many of the pushcarts are selling the same items but some are more patronised than others. Even if you dun know how to order/eat, just observe the locals and follow what they do. Besides food, there are many stalls selling imitation branded stuff. Some are such bad fakes- the words Tommy Hilfiger printed on a hoodie with another Brand’s logo. Reminds me of night markets in Bangkok. Have yet to explore the Kulguksu lane and the fish lane, but both looked busy. "
Great Place for budget shopping and eating,We were able to walk here from our Hotel Manu using the Seoullo 7017 elevated walkway and an elevator down to street level. We found it to be much cleaner that the public markets in the Philippines and also a wide variety of street food and small eateries. We had some hot Korean Soup in one of them which was OK although we had to just look at pictures and point since nobody spoke English there. There was some fruit at an outlet on the sidewalk which I couldn't identify... it might have been figs.. which we probably should have tried but didn't. We actually wanted to spend more time in this place but it started raining so we didn't want to get any more wet and hadn't brought out umbrella.
Nice,"I love this market, lots of good food. Things to buy for soveniers and nicely located near the metro Hyeon, exit 4 and 5. You won't go wrong in coming here. There are guides to help you around if you are lost. Love it so much that I even came for a last walk on my day of flying off before I checked out from my guesthouse. Wonderful place "
Everything is available there!!!,"I went in the morning when the shops and stalls were just opening, and it wasn't too busy. I'd recommend in the late afternoon and at night when its crowded and hustle bustle. It would add to the atmosphere and excitement of the huge market.The market seemed to be orderly, with womens clothing grouped together, electronics all in one area, children's items in one area, etc. So there is some order to the market! I recommend just wandering down the allies and exploring without a plan. Please keep in mind there is no English to be found, so bring your guide map! There were 2 young girls wearing red information vests who spoke wonderful English to your destination and provide you maps.Definitely go to this market! There's a great feeling here and you can pick up anything and everything you could possibly think of and need."
Nice place to taste local food,"Great place if you are a foodie and love to explore local food at its simplest. Plenty of choices to eat tasty and inexpensive specialties for which the best recommendation is the fact that locals really do eat here. And once you filled up your belly, you can dive into shopping of food and other goods souvenirs, as Namdeaemun is not only a food place."
Bazaar Korean style,"If you enjoy a bazaar atmosphere, this is for you. Indoors and passageways full of men, women and children wear, custom jewelery, items for the house, you name it, is here. Even several Christmas shops. There are wholesale only shops among the offerings but they will tell you if you happen to walk in one. Plenty of food stalls to maintain the energy. "
"Souvenirs, bedding, octopus...","Everything you could possibly need is available in this incredible market. From army clothing to jewellery, fish to bedding. Get a map from one of the friendly guides and just follow your nose and experience the authentic Korean market. Granted there’s a lot of tat on the stalls but there is in any market. I would recommend seeing the fish part of the market, and the food stalls. At the end of our walkabout, we saw this food cart with a queue. As everyone in the queue was Korean, we thought it must be good so lined up not knowing what exactly they were queuing for. 15 minutes later we bought two deep fired veggie pancakes for 2,000 KRW - about £1.40. We walked up to Sungnyemun Gate and tucked into them. They were absolutely fabulous."
Lively and Fun,"I stayed near this traditional market during a recent visit to Seoul and visited three times. Huge, the place has eight numbered gates; more than 10,000 stores in buildings and stalls; merchandise ranging from flowers to military equipment; and food carts. It seems to be the liveliest in the morning, when I encountered thick crowds, and rather quiet in the late afternoon. The market obviously attracts shoppers, based on the transactions I saw taking place, but also visitors with cameras, soaking up the atmosphere and enjoying photo ops.I went for the atmosphere but ended up returning to seek out inexpensive souvenirs, such as bookmarks and fans. Though I looked at other items, including clothing and accessories, nothing appealed. Much better quality can be found in nearby department stores but with higher prices.My favorite part of the market proved to be the ubiquitous food carts, where vendors prepare all kinds of yummy-looking fare. I finally got in a long line waiting for a hotteok (deep-fried veggie pancake) by Gate 2. It took about 20 minutes before I could put my order in and I received the hotteok almost immediately. The cost was 1,000 KRW, about $1 U.S. I stood on the street, eating this tasty delight and savoring every bite.It is easy to get lost in this complex of pedestrian streets and buildings, so I suggest getting a map from the market's information kiosk before starting to explore. Enter from Gate 2 at Namdaemun-ro or Gate 5 at Toegye-ro. The kiosk stands on the street that connects the two gates, near the souvenir shops.Namdaemun Market is easily accessed by subway (lines 1, 2, 4) and many bus lines. It takes about 15 minutes to walk there from Seoul Station."
The best place to shop for Souvenir,"Whatever, wherever, whichever people says about buying souvenir from Korea, for me, this is THE PLACE. Without a single iota of doubt, this is the place to be to look for Korean souvenirs ranging from fridge magnets, unique Korean Cutleries, and so on. But the best time to visit is after lunch time since lots of shops will be fully operational by then. So prepare the money and shops (souvenirs)."
Welcome to the oldest traditional market in Korea!,"Are you hungry? There's a variety of things to eat! Do you prefer to shop? Don't worry, Namdaemun's got you covered!Do you just want to see new and exciting things? Well, what are you waiting for - go to Namdaemun!Even if you don't want to spend money, I would highly recommend still going to experience the atmosphere of a traditional market. There are people everywhere, shop owners are shouting about the items they are selling to those who might be interested, and deliverymen are swerving in and out of the crowds.Also, side note - please go eat the Hotteok here! IT IS DIVINE AND AMAZING! Especially when the weather is cold!"
Best noodle soup in Seoul,"This review will focus on Kalguksu Alley or “noodle alley” that is inside the Namdaemun Market. It is difficult to find. I had a local Korean friend with me and we had to ask about 4 people. It was kind of fun to find because it is literally hidden. I would recommend using a maps app and not giving up. Once you do find it take a seat at any of the many soup stalls. You’ll be knocking elbows with fellow eaters. There’s no way around this due to the very small space and high demand of the food served. The alley is only about 20 yards long. Most stalls serve soup noodles and bibimbap. When you’re finished, pay and leave. There will probably be people literally standing behind you waiting their turn. This is an “only in Seoul” type of experience. Please try it. "
Lunch at the market,"This market is packed with many locals and tourists. There is an assortment of food and drink (both restaurants and street food), fresh produce, garments and clothes and many others.There is a portion with many stores selling all sorts of cheap accessories and raw materials to make accessories and embelishments. "
Huge Local market,"we went there on our last day and regreted, wish we had more time going around the maze of shops, and locals do their shopping here too, prices are about 5% cheaper compare to Myeongdong or underground mall. good for nice bags and some local eats. be sure to come with a suitcase and an empty stomack, and ya, there will be a few ""tour guides"" in red ready to help. they have various language available."
"Locals , must eat buns , tery pig'sleg","There are many kinds of food . There is a shop selling hot steaming buns ! Their original ones taste fantastic, prefer the original to kimchi one! First time trying out the pig's leg there.... not bad but tasted better ones. A place to buy bath cloth !"
Traditional local market in the heart of Seoul,"It's a nice local market, perfect for shopping souvenirs to take home :) Try the dumplings and the ginger tea, those are so good!"
Must visit market,"Huge market with various things. All the stores are in their own building. They sell hair accessories, jewellery, kids clothing, ladies clothing and many more. Took the metro and stop at seoul station, walked the seoullo walkaway towards Namdaemun market"
Authentic local market,"This place is for an older crowd... comparing to Myeongdong street market. Authentic, has its own charm of traditional Korean market. Buy anything under the sun. Lots to eat. KPop mania items. Pots, pans, great bargains."
Fun spot for food and shopping ,One if our favourite spots to visited day or night. Crazy variety of street food at great value. Also interesting to shop for souvenirs and do some bargaining. 
Good local market,"The market is clean and easy to Find. IT has good places for clothes, accessories, eye glasses and souvenirs. Some local Food stuff are also available. Prices are cheap and a lot OF locals are here for marketing OF their Daily needs. We were only a handful OF Tourist present in The morning. A good place to feel The local pulse OF The City."
Outdoor market...eh,We visited this market area one morning while waiting for Shinsegae department store to open.All the clothes and “jewelry” looked like cheap low quality stuff.The food stalls were ok. There was one food stall that sold fish cake that was very popular.
Cheap finds and good street food,"Very busy during the weekends. Do not forget to visit the Community Lounge, which serves free cookies, tea, and other snacks - not to mention the "
Traditional market,"the best thing you can buy in this market is pearl, the prices are reasonable it is amazing place to visit in Seoul "
Huge shopping area,"The entire market is enormous, especially if you enter the many malls within the area itself. I entered two of such malls and wanted to purchase some jewelry but was told that it’s not for sale to individuals, only business(wholesale). This was a little disappointing. However, the street food is delicious, the hotteok in particular is a must try! It’s not necessary to walk the whole market as majority of the stuff on sale is repeated throughout, and may be a little too old-fashioned for some tourist."
Dirt cheap good coats/jackets,"not a bad place to find a $5 US dollar deal for a coat or sweater on October. If you find your size, you’re lucky. Korea has many oversize style sweater. I found a gem among the stalls. It’s really fun to browse and look. Prices on clothes are way better than Myeongdong. There are more locals here and the pigs foot restaurant we entered is just for local. A taxi driver recommended this location for the seafood Korean soup soondubu. I couldn’t find it bec there are many unique local treats. If I had more time I will check out all restaurants/fruit standsAirconditioned stalls accepts credit cards, cash only for the $5-10 deals. "
Amazing,"I almost got lost in this market . It is a must. Please note that if you are lost or looking for specific information on the area, touristic officers are located almost at every 2 streets or in the most populous area of the market."
Hundreds of shops,"Very central and walking distance from the metro. There are hundreds of shops and stalls. The usual are available, shoes, clothes ,souvenirs etc, etc. There are dozens of food stalls. Worth the visit for budget shopping."
Kind old lady who sells snacks and cookies at a cheaper price,"There is this old lady (ajumma) who sells almonds and all the real o brownie cheaper than anyone else in seoul. I compared prices across lotte, gs25, 7-11 and all the other stores but hers were the cheapest and has the same expiry date as others.She was very kind and she offered us to try the almonds of various flavours for free.I took a photo of her stall which I will share once I find it. Her shop is very small and narrow along the main street down Namdaemun market."
Would Go Back for Hairtail Alley!,"If you're a fan of spicy braised fish soup or galchi jorim, this is the place for you! Hairtail Alley (found in Nandaemun Market) has clusters of small eateries selling this specialty---hairtail! I first learned of this this place from a YouTuber, and he made it look so good, I knew I had to try the dish when I visited. I'm so glad I did. The soup was to die for. I'm now a fan and trying to recreate a version of the dish at home."
Shopping,Decent market. Not unlike it's sister markets around the world. Good selection of stuff. Best if visited to observe / experience local culture. Good 2-3 hour trip. 
Similar to a flee market,"Came here two days ago around 3 in the afternoon. Pretty big and busy. It’s very similar to a flee market. Lots of cheap looking clothes, some K-pop merchandises and street food. All the sellers were older people. Seems like if you stop to look, they expect you to buy. My sister got yelled at by one of them because she was looking at some food and was still deciding if she wanted it or not. Ended up not buying anything there. Still a good place to explore but prefer Myeongdong instead."
"It's a big market, that's all.","You can easily get lost inside this market. It's huge and most of the shops look alike. It's a shopping area mainly for clothing and personal items. If you are just buying a few pieces of clothing, I guess you are better off shopping in other areas like Myendong(?) where you can see more variety of goods to buy."
Can try to visir,Seriously i doesnt really like this place but since i m in korea why not. My kids like this place. Locals buying here cos i think it cheap but nothing after all.Place pack with ppl n cars 
A bit dsappointing,"This market was just opposite our hotel so we wandered over there on our first day, but have to say it was very underwhelming. Many of the goods looked to be straight out of China, not particularly good quality, the sort of things you can see in markets anywhere. There were plenty of street food stalls but nothing that really appealed. Most of the shops were packing up from 7pm and nothing much was open after 8pm, so visit during the day, or just head to Myeongdong instead. "
Great experience,"Asian market place in downtown Seoul. Hustle, bustle, sights, sounds, and smells. Certainly worth the visit."
Great place for souvenirs and bargains,We visited this market on our last day; my husband got a good quality souvenir t-shirt for just $4. There’s a lot of junk but it’s fun to look around and plenty of places to eat or grab a coffee. The information center near Gate 5? turned out to be two people standing around handing out maps which were very useful. There’s a good stationery store on the aptly named Stationery Street and a ton of camera stores all on one street.
Shop till you drop,I did buy some fruit and fried snacks from the stands. They were pretty tasty. I was able to buy several hats and scarves. I did find some good deals. The sellers were willing to bargain on some of the items. The prices are were okay overall. I did find purses cheaper at other markets. 
Hairtail alley ,Small alley down from gate 5 on left side as not easy to find famous spicy fish stew plenty of places to choose from all doing the stew fantastic food 
Street food was great! ,"Looks like this is the best market in Seoul as it’s been going for a very long time. Street food here is great, lots of options and the donuts were unreal. The clothing is pretty terrible and there is a lot of supreme stuff that is clearly fake. Worth a visit tho for the atmosphere. "
A lot of vendors selling same low quality items,"The market is massive and stretches on. There are specific markets within the market for shoes or underwear etc. I was looking for some shoes but almost all were low quality synthetics. I did find one that had good quality leather shoes but he does have anything above US size 9.Found most of the items were low quality and probably from China, although they insist that it is made in Korea.It’s fun to walk around and maybe yo might find something you like. There is also a market for vintage clothing and flea market.It will take a day to explore all. There are neighbourhoods you can also wonder off near the market where you can have a meal or see some of the older houses."
Great to Visit!!,Found there is a lot to see and there is a nice selection of things a person can purchase. The street food was amazing!!! Glad I had the chance to visit!
If you know what you're looking for,"This is the place. We buy golf wear and other clothes (women's, men, children). Great selection at great negotiable prices! Everything from pants, shorts, jackets, suits, sport coats. Careful, you'll probably get asked about brand knock offs too so just ignore them."
Come to taste its Complexity!,"well, you wouldn’t mind the crowd; Endless markets to shop; Endless road to roam; Endless line to grab a bite of « the » glassnoodle pancake(hotteok). Namdaemoon markets to have a sneak peak at KoreA"
Namdaemun market,I love only the street food here but I think that's enough for me. The tastes are okay. I dont buy anything there.
Huge market in Seoul,"Not much English is spoken here but you can easily point and they'll understand what you want. There are so many different stores, such as fresh food, dumplings (these are a must!), trinkets and there's this one little cart at one of the entrances where there is usually a massive line for either a sweet or savoury bun. I waited in line, and the vegetable noodle bun I bought was delicious on my empty stomach. You can really spend hours here and I'd highly recommend visiting."
Top visit in Seoul!,"I am a market lover, so.... this was a must. And it is! A traditional Korean market, you will find everything here: clothes, souvenirs, food, it is a must with Dandaemun market and Insadong if you are in Seoul!"
Amazing ,Crazy market — a must see when in Seoul - most impressive are are the food stalls - prices are OK not so cheap though- it requires energy to stay there for some time :) 
nice goods,"it was worth buying at namdaemun market though there is difficulty in communicating with the vendors, prices are reasonable. "
Delicious street food vendors,Get Ho-Dduk in the front of Gate 2 entrance - honey filling and japchae filling. Then walk up the street (into the market shopping area) for about 200-300 yards and get dumplings and donuts.
A place for souvenirs,"My family and I went here to get souvenirs for the rest of the family. The best things (I guess!) that I got here were the brooches. There is a building with one floor full of little shops with the staffs making all sorts of jewelleries and ornaments. Brooches,bangles, bracelets, rings, you name it, are all here. Then change to another level and you will see they sell vintage decorative stuff for your homes, tshirts and baby clothes. Maybe you can bargain (I didn't cuz I never really know how to lol) and get yourself a good price for the things you buy. Take your time as namdaemun market is a big area. "
Tucked away but worth a visit,"This is fully a market place, so be prepared to be bustled around by people walking fast and haggling! I didn’t buy anything because I was just looking, but there are loads of little souvenirs things you could get and some great food too! "
Good place to buy street food ,"I really like this place. People are so friendly and there are many street shops where you can buy souvenirs and eat. There is a mandu place inside the market that is really good and really cheap. You have to go there. They give you 5 Mandu for 3000 won and you will have side 단무지 for free and water. There are many tourists so, sometimes make sure to ask for a discount in some stores. "
Place to buy souvenirs,"Huge numbers of shops, selling everything from t-shirts, souvenirs, kitchen tools etc. Nice place to stroll around for 1-2 hours. Price is reasonable. "
Cheapest items to buy for souvenirs specially shirts,We were able to get 3 statement shirts for krw11000 & purse for 6000. You can huggle w/ prices in this market than Meongdong or Domdaemum & Hongik
Huge,"So much to see, buy, eat,. These markets are huge with something differnt to see around the clock. Food cooked fresh and served quickly by friendly staff. Lots of food choices whether it is something quick and easy by a street vendor or a sit down meal in one of the food alleyways."
Interesting market with some good deals,"Most of the market is covered, which is nice on a rainy day. It is very cramped but worth a visit. The souvenirs were cheaper than at other places in Seoul"
Huge market,"You can find anything from fresh flowers, homeware, clothes and even toilet curtains! Bought 10 pairs of socks for $7.00 here. Very cheap and handy."
5 days in Seoul,If you a looking for lots of choices for inexpensive items this is a good place to good. Good place for souvenirs. Also found a currency exchange booth with very good rates.
It’s okay..,"It is a place I think everyone should visit, but this thing is over hyped big time. Yes there are lots of vendors, most of them selling the same “stuff.” I went because I wanted to try some street food, but I didn’t.. I understand Kimchi is the most famous dish in S Korean, but the smell of it makes me sick, which is weird because I love cabbage. Needless to say with the lack of shopping for anything worth buying and the constant smell of Kimchi, we didn’t make it long. "
"Street food, street shopping",This is a great place to try the street food of Seoul. I also enjoyed walking around and viewing all the shops and the folks buying and selling.
BIG MARKET,"The place is near Courtyard by Marriott Hotel, you could visit it by walking .... We had the chance to visit the market and bought some souvenir items on a cheaper price..."
One of the biggest and best,Definitely worth a visit! One of the great market's we have seen. Try not to get lost as you stroll endless stalls. Something for everyone here.
its really good place in seoul ,actually so many kinds have korean traditional things and also really cool item very get to easy when you coming korea please try there
Open air market to visit.,"Namdaemun Market is an open air market not to far from Myong Dong in Seoul, South Korea. You can find many things from clothes to cookware and everything in between. Put your sneakers on because you will be there all day looking for bargains. The market also has many food stalls to feed your hunger as well as the hunger to shop. Haggling is expected. Just go and experience it. Very few places like it on the planet."
feel the Korean culture,"been to Namdaemum Market million times and never get tired. Although it is a top tourist place, you can still feel the local culture and get some unique stuff. However, the price there is not the cheapest one, so don't be fooled. in addition, you really need to walk around and compare the price. Don't just buy the stuff from the first stand you encounter. Most of the vendors here are selling the same things, so shop around, compare the price, and try to negotiate. Most importantly, have fun! Oh don't forget to stop by the Kalguksu Alley (right near the exit 5 of Hoehyeon Station) for a delicious noodle soup!!!"
Bustling in the day ,"Compared to dongdaemun, namdaemun market feels much more local and authentic. I went in the late morning and both locals and tourists were bustling around doing their daily chores or shopping for souvenirs respectively. Check out the small alleys (stew alley, hairtail fish alley) for a claustrophobic but fun look at ajummas serving up their best food. Burdeng mall and Mama were great malls for childrens' clothes and accessories (way better than dongdaemun) but the streetside kiosks and stalls offer better prices (2000krw for 1 piece of clothing!!), that is if you manage to find pieces you like in the jumble of clothes. "
Excellent ,Alot of shopping for clothes and bags and souvenirs. Highly recommended for people to go visit. Must go. 
Buzzing Market ,You can easy get lost in the streets of this market. Right next to Myeong-dong. Another place you can shop for a vast myriad of goods!
Visit to E-Lengdang,"On the last day of my trip, I went to Namdaemun Market to get some souvenirs for some people back in town. I wanted to get some beautiful brooches for my mom and most people know E-Lengdang in Namdaemun market is where you can get really beautiful brooches. I’d like to recommend one shop that sells brooches. The seller was very generous and had given us 3 free brooches after we bought some from her. She had told us that she uses real swarovski crystals for her brooches. The more expensive the brooches are, the more beautiful it is. Her shop is on the second floor and it is number 404. I have provided how the shop looks like and how beautiful the brooches that she sells! If you are looking to find beautiful brooches, you may visit this shop. Her brooches are the most beautiful I’ve found in E-Lengdang. Have a great trip!"
Fun Market,"I stayed literally across the road from this market for 3 months when i was in Seoul which was great in terms of cheap shopping and grocery's and after a few weeks the ajuma's and ahjussi's were very nice always saying hello to me and giving me free food and snicks which was lovely, around 2/3pm the street food carts set up and it is sooooooo good and quite a lot cheaper than myeongdong!there is also a tourist centre just off the main strip of the market where i was able to get a new sim card after my other one ran out and for a discount, the agassi's were very helpful and set up the new sim card for me as well as getting me a cup of tea while i waited"
Great street food and shopping ,"The street food is really good, and priced cheap. You can buy any sort of clothing and gifts you want. Very low prices, but you get what you pay for. Try the food stalls at night. "
Too hyped,"Mostly cheap made items such as clothing, toys and ornaments. We did not really enjoy it that much as we couldn't find the unique locally made items we were hoping for."
Too hyped,This market is nothing but most of China made cheap goods.Only very few local made items are sold.A sweet made of flour and honey is the speciality and should be tried. It's even more amazing to watch how this sweet is made.
"Traditional Korean Market, very interesting to explore",Quite big and busy. A lot of interesting souvenir items to buy. But you can easily lost your way. Make sure you use Kakao Map for navigation. 
Not as exciting as Myeongdong,"If you have time for only one place - Namdaemun or Myeongdong - I would highly recommend the latter. Because Myeongdong is still very much bustling with activities past 8pm, whereas Namdaemun is a dead town by 8pm.I would only presume that because Namdaemun is closer to the downtown area, therefore it might be more convenient to the people working in that area. As for tourists - head down to Myeongdong. You won't regret it. "
An inner city market,This is the first place i visited during my recent visit to South Korea. The place was at walking distance from city hall where i was staying. The markets here closes early but good for buying Korean stuff and gifts.
Worth a visit,"Easy to get to from Meyeondong, it is within walking distance from Lotte Departmental Stall too. Many different types of malls catering to different things,e.g. clothes, bags, etc. It will take hours to cover the area so you may want to spare some time here. Many food places too! "
Traditional market with great choice,"Traditional market for travelers that love to explore the local activities. Here you can find what you want to have such as street food/snacks, simple local food/bbq, clothes/bags/umbrella, souvenirs, home appliances, food material, kitchen equipment, electronic devices (camera), flower, accessories, fake jewelry, etc. You can try to bargain here with your best chance to get lower prices. The market is quite clean and spacious except the alleys that are located in the building. FYI: take a map from the information box to guide you. "
Shopping!,"Great day and night, cheap fresh food, souvenirs and general cheap items for sale.Safe friendly atmosphere with no pressure to purchase. "
Good for bargains,"Close to Myeongdong, this is a great place to pick up traditional artefacts and souvenirs at decent prices. The market opens late but is closed on some days - so check before you travel."
Cheap souvenirs,"This is the best place for souvenirs, we compared Myeongdong, Insadong and Namdaemun. Namdaemun is the cheapest among all these locations for souvenirs including t-shirts, key chains, magnets, masks, etc..."
Namdaemun Market Seoul Korea,"A big traditional market where you can get practically everything here..from children clothes, slippers, bags and souvenirs.. A lot of food carts and is good place to try all Korean snacks..Easy to access by train."
Nice market selling everything,"This market was located opposite our hotel so it was very easy to access. The market seems to sell pretty much everything including clothes, kitchenware, fruit and vegetables, cooked food, hats, shoes, souvenirs etc. The market is actually quite large and there is a part called ""children's market"" but it had already closed by the time we were there. In front of the market along the main road are many shops selling camera gear, new and used lenses and camera bodies including all the famous brands so I think this was the main place for cameras in Seoul.Despite being quite a large market there are far more interesting markets in Seoul such as the Dongdaemun Market for fashion and the Myeong Dong Street Market which was very lively and seemed much more popular."
Bring tape measure for clothes shopping,"We went here for clothes shopping. Store owners do not allow you to try on the clothes they are selling, so having a tape measure with us helped us to decide whether an item was the right size. A lot of the stalls were pretty expensive though (we spent most of the time by the clothing buildings near Hoehyoen station, Exit 5). Just found less than a handful of stores with the prices we were looking for, and ended up with a couple purchases. Even in the summer, there were still stores by the road selling fur coats! Would have wanted to spend more time exploring, but the heat of the day got to us.There's a lot of stores selling dried fruits, vegetables, even meat! I saw dried okra, dried peppers, dried strawberries, dried octopus (both spicy and not spicy)... the choices were endless!There's a road with stores selling stationery, wrapping paper and gift bags that had pretty attractive options. We saw a couple of skincare stores as well in the area - not sure if the prices are good compared to Myeongdong. There are information booths, but the one we saw was closed during lunch break."
Traditional,As the Korean say “from needle to a cow” that all what you may find t the Namdaemun marketIt’s an old traditional market by Seoul old gate Like flee market you get different things ManalOman
Less than an hour visit,"Several short streets for shopping like casual shoes, T-shirts and bags. Not pricey but quality matches the price. Not many street food stalls. Popular food to try would be the stuffed donuts and HotDeok. Spent less than an hour here. "
Nice place to visit,"This is very good market for street shopping. You can find everything clothes, toys, cosmetic and street food."
Lot's of fun but not amazing prices.,"Got there at 7:30 A.M. on a Saturday. Market not busy yet, which was GREAT. Lot's of fun looking around and asking and checking. Some of the markets are indoors so there was air-conditioning. I didn't buy much because the prices were generally not good deals like I've seen in China and Malaysia, but it was fun looking."
So much fabric!,"We went to the design plaza first, highlight was my daughter got to play the piano outside! Then onto the markets... its 4 storeys of fabrics, ground floor lovely quilts, outside are zips and brocades, top 3 floors all material. Unless you are geographically minded, but it when you see it. I found a beaut green linen, decided to look around first and couldn't find the vendor again. Also, no places to sit or have a cold drink inside so be prepared. It was 33 degrees c when we went and even with air conditioning my kids were too hot and grumpy to go all around the building butI had no choice but to take them. Fabulous selection, patterns etc. Next time I'm finding a baby sitter"
"Lots of stalls, cheap and Good!",A nice place to spend your money and to enjoy the local culture. We did buy our souvenir for our friends there. There is a nice lady selling cheap souvenir. It was nice to see made in korea! :0 Usually cheap souvenir are made in China! :)
Must Eat Food at Namdaemun Market - Hairtail Fish,"If you are looking for what to eat in Namdaemun Market, then i guess Hairtail Fish ( Stew or Fried ) would be be most popular choice. I have not seen this Korea food being offered in other places while i was visiting Seoul and Busan during my 9 day trip in June 2018, so i suppose that this might be the only place easiest to find for such a type of Korea specialty.This fish dish is so popular that there was even 2 alley within the Namdaemum market dedicated to selling this dish. With many shops offering almost the same time, you would just need to look for one that would seem to be the most popular.As there was no English signboards for most of the shops, we simply resorted to pointing at what the other tables were having and we were not disappointed.My family of 3 person order 1 portion of Hairtail Fish and 1 portion of Fried Assorted Fish which came with some free side dishes such as pickles, beans, Eggs, and fried fish and rice. Iced water is always provided free at the table as well.But do note that this fish does have quite abit of bones and the stew is mildly spicy. But overall, i think this is a perfect cuisine if you want to try something typical of this market.Getting to this market might be tricky, but thankfully there are Local Guides Dressed in RED which are fluent in English and will be able to direct you to this alley. "
Traditional type of market.,"I would say this market is fairly traditional. A lot of gods, a lot of fake brands, narrow lanes and crowded. If you want to buy clothes from the market, or well, from most places, be prepared! Take your measures beforehand and bring your tape-measure! There are no such thing as a dressing room or trying the clothes on ;).The market felt big with numerous small isles both directions from what we called the ”main path”. As with most makets, it is a lot of ”same same” , meaning the same goods over and over. All in all, it was an experience but to us, Dongdaemun market with Gwangjang market next to it was better."
Good Place for a Food Tour,I went on a food tour of Namdaemun Market and sampled several types of food and drinks at the various food stalls and restaurants. There were quite a number of food outlets in the market. There were stalls selling all sorts of items in the market. There were also shopping centres with multiple floors. There were lanes with stalls selling only specific items such as military clothing and stationery.A free map of Namdaemun Market is available at the Tourist Information Center in the Market.
Cheap and good stuffs,"Namdaemun market was good. They have lots of clothings,toys and accessories for children. Their price for kids and adults clothes are reasonable. Souvenirs at namdamun market is cheaper compared to other places. Basically of all the places like Myeongdong street, namdaemun is better in terms of cheaper price and more variety of items. We enjoyed our shopping at namdaemun market."
Namdaemun market,This market is a must for visitors - to see the various goods there are for sale ... from clothes to food .. but one must try to bargain for a good buy..
Bargains fashions and souvenir. Best dumpling ,"A wholesale place to get your clothing, accessories and gifts. The shops inside the building or upper floor offer cheaper price. The dumpling in this market is the best. Really love the kimchi dumpling and pork dumpling. If you are there, you should try it !!!"
Kind of sketchy,This area is older and smaller. Many small stores filled with stuff. The inside of the buildings are even worse. People have crammed their wares into a small area and sit like a flea market for you to come by. It’s neat to see but nothing seemed light to buy. At one point I used the bathroom which was a hole in the ground. Cool to walk through but lower quality options. 
Fascinating large market,"At the beginning you assume this is just a large street market. Then you go into the buildings where there are three or four floors of market stalls and realise it is enormous. I found it a fascinating place to visit but there was nothing I wanted to buy. There are a lot of jewellery stalls inside the buildings, and quite a lot making jewellery as well as selling it."
"Trash market, avoid it!","I read in many places about this ""icon"" and Seoul's must visit market but after visiting it I would warmly advice anyone to do yourself a favor and don't go there unless you got a spare half day with nothing else to do.Almost ALL stuff there is very very poor manufactured trash that looks coming from a third world country.It is a kind of stuff you can buy in any city in the world such as mainly women's garments but I must stress it's all garbage quality while prices are like buying from a regular shop.There is some Korean look stuff like hats and fans and again only for women, but does it make sense going to Namdaemun Market?ALL stuff is without prices so you must be able to speak Korean and willing to bargain just to buy trash!There are also some shops which sell international alcohol but again there are no prices so in these cases I don't even bother asking the price but walk away.It was a very disappointing experience and frankly speaking I don't get why people on forums talk so much about this ""iconic"" trash & trash place!Do yourself a favor and avoid this place!"
Happening market,Namdaemun is pretty extensive so we didn't visit every nook and cranny though we did manage to get quite a few of the souvenirs and gifts we brought back from there. There is also a good street food scene and we had really nice tteokbokki from there and sampled some fish cakes. There was an interesting stall owner who would play the clarinet between sales which was cute. We also chanced upon this fairly hidden food alley which might have been kalguksu (noodle) alley. A good place to visit if you like to shop and eat! Also not too far from Myeongdong so easy to wander over if that's your base. 
Great market...,"Our hotel was just 10 mins away, so we usually go through the Namdaemun market everyday. It’s one big market that sells the same or similar things. The market was confusing at first since every stores looked alike, but after a few times of getting lost we finally figured out the directions. From this market is about another 8-10 mins walk to the other popular M market. There were also a few food stands but not sure if it’s good or not."
Shopping ,Lots of items. I found some really low priced souvenirs but you have to ask as they are on the second floor and inside
Lots to see and buy. ,This market is quite interesting. Lots to shop and so much to see. It is a whole day activity. I suggest you take the metro to get to this market as it leads you straight to the beginning of the market. 
A beautiful Korean market,"Namdaemum Market in Seoul is worth visiting for a number of reasons. First, it's a good cultural experience: you see lots of artefacts and food items you might not have the chance of finding at home (if you are a Westerner). Second, if you need souvenirs to take home, here you have a rich range, all at hand and at very convenient prices. Third, if you are fond of intercultural experience, the market is a good place for communicating with the locals and for exchanging opinions on the products (and on South Korea, in general) with other foreigners.The only danger you may face is that of getting lost!"
"Food sucks, clothes sucks","Nothing interesting. Do not go in fish restaurant area, it was a terrible experience. Bad food bad service. "
Bring ur shopping bags,"Be sure not to reach too early as the shops are mostly open only after 9:30am. So, have a good breakfast before you head down. Do take note that this market isn’t open on Sunday. Right across The Courtyard at Marriot, Namdaemun Market is made up of street stalls, shops lining the streets on ground level of old buildings and old shopping malls (selling wholesale clothes, jewelry etc). Just roam and explore, u will find surprises in every corner. Stuff mostly for kids and women, not so much for men. Chanced upon a mall that sell nothing but children clothes. They are meant to be for wholesale and pre-order but they do sell single pieces too. Saw so many of these children clothes selling at Doota Mall (Dongdaemun) at double or triple the price. Be sure not to buy them at Doota. There is also another mall that sells just clothes for adults. It’s hard to give directions as they are like hidden gems amongst the many street stalls. If u happen to be in the mall selling jewelry, don’t be alarm if the stall owners refuse to sell single pieces to you. They are for bulk purchases and pre-order. You are lucky if u found a couple of friendly ones that don’t mind selling the jewelry in pieces to you. The hair clips especially are very pretty. "
Street Food Vendos in Namdaemun Market will cheat you.,"Went to visit Namdaemun Market late night. Got 5 small dishes and 2 sodas with my wife. The bill came out to ₩111,000 or $109.00. Are you kidding me? That price is more than our food bills for 3 days combined. A ver bad experience indeed."
Good place to visit,"There are many alleys filled with shops selling a variety of things ranging from food to tshirts to fashion accessories. Quite a number of buildings with wholesale accessories (earrings, necklaces etc) shops. The Alpha stationery building was a letdown. At a small alley selling bibimbup and noodles, we ordered 2 dishes and got a number of other dishes for free! Truly authentic Korean food!"
Market for souvenirs and food,Went early morning to check the market.Bought some korean spoon set.Tried their breads and gimbap for breakfast.
Shopping,"Food and shopping are the best. Local food and wholesale is found here, walking distance from Mydeong shopping area, grab a sandwich along the way, shoes n shirts at cheap price. Be prepare to walk and enjoy the fun of shopping, step into the aircon building and open another area to shop."
"If you like ill mannered crowds, this is your place","Full of low quality overpriced Chinese products, people shoving and elbowing without pause, nasty fermented Korean food smells, and rats all over the place. "
Not lucky,"2nd time coming here and still seem to miss the action. The last time we were too early coming before our flight, this time we were too late as most of the stalls and shops were closing. We were there just before dinner of about 7.30pm. The girls were disappointed."
Variety ,Variety of localy priduced clothes and goods. From tshirt to tops to leather jackets to hats they have it all. And the street food stalls spread around exit 5 to fill your tummy if you are hungry or treat your taste buds
"Great for food, clothings and souvenirs",It has something for everybody here and have sufficient variety that it is quite a good place to get everything. 
Interesting spot to stop by,"Nice place to see all fresh Korean food. Plenty of vendors convince you to get some food. During winter they'd provide heater under the long chair which it was nicely warm.They are selling dumpling with the soup (Mandu), blood pudding (sundae), raw octopus, chilli pickled cabbage (kimchi), hot&spicy rice cake (toppokki), Korean sushi roll (gimbap), etc.Very convenient to reach as it located in the centre."
"Bustling and exciting, even in the midst of winter","Namdaemun market feels like a friendly street market environment, which is a welcome reprieve from other ""pushy"" and rude again markets in other Asian countries. Go and sample delicious street cuisine and explore various clothing stalls to find something unique."
Wander and Explore,"Great place to wander, try foods (yes, the place seems a bit sketchy, but feel free to eat! You’ll be fine and may have your best meal!), pick up souvenirs, and enjoy!"
Fish stew alley,"Loved the fish stew alley...we ended up coming here about 4-5 times. Awesome spicy fish stew for about 8,000 krw and also getting the local experience where many Koreans come. Once you find the food district, they have alleyways all dedicated to the same type of food...the hairtail fish stew was one made of chili, radish and the fish and that was all they carried. So if you are in a group and some cannot handle it, this is not the place to go.Aside from the food, this is a market which sells cheap goods...not a whole lot of bargaining here and the goods can be quite expensive for fake products so beware."
Really big,"It is a market were you can find multiple things ( hand bags, stationary, jewel, clothing, too, umbrellas and more). It is a huge complex and besides what you see in the street there are doors with an inside commerce."
A nice market with lots of variety,There are several markets in Seoul this one has a nice verity but I found the prices higher than some of the more specialized markets.That being said the food options were good and there was lots of interesting items for sale.
Namdemum market,"A traditional market for people of all ages. It depicts quite well the kind of lifestyle people have, from the young to elderly. The market sells clothes, household stuff and food."
Fun place to hangout ,Doesn’t matter how old you are but you will have a good time here day or night!!! And I think they keep most An Korea old style trade and have a lot new thing too !! They sell everything here and lot a good food too I mean all kind of food west or east what ever!!! We love come here to eat and walk around 
Lots to shop!,"# Easy to get here via Subway Line 4 (Hoehyeon Station, Exit 5).# Variety of stalls & shops of clothing, shoes, bags, souvenirs, handicrafts, food, fruits & groceries too. Do get the market's map, it is big and all streets almost looking the same as all streets filled with variety of goods.# Some stalls can get good bargains if intended to buy lots. Generally, all stall/shop owners are very polite. They don't force buying from them.# English is not widely use in this market, but all stall/shop owners are approachable. When comes to pricing & bargaining, calculator will be the tool & medium to conclude the deal.  "
Nice Local Market Place,"Visited twice one time on a Sunday. Shops were closed but streets were lined with hawkers and clothes sellers. Prices were very good too.During another weekday visit, the place came to live with shops all open and streets were still filled with foodstalls and clothes sellers. Plenty to see and do and buy as well.Shopping here is good and with more competitive prices than Bangkok for clothes as well. Tourists Guides are positioned on the streets to help tourists with questions and information. Nice place to visit near Myeongdong."
Enjoyable visit,"We spent about 1.5 hrs waking around and exploring the market. Plenty to see if you go in the morning if you like look at fresh produce and seafood. They sell lots of accessories, souvenirs and clothes but don’t expect high fashion and chic products here. The street food here is more traditional and tastier than in Myeong-Dong. Look for the yummy freshly made dumplings right in the middle of the market, they are cheap and delicious. "
Pretty good place to get souvenirs and snacks... all in one,"Much cheaper here than in the supermarkets and/or Myeongdong for souvenirs such as seaweed, purses and Korean cutlery sets. There's loads to see here and can easily spend a morning here. They have a little food street too and the market is divided into different sections like kidswear, accessories, clothes, etc. We enjoyed strolling through the market and got a few last minute gifts. Worth a visit."
Great market district,Don’t hesitate to go visit the place. This is amazing to see the shopping temptations all over the area. 
Fish stew alley!!,Look for the alley with fish stew... There are many shops there and they serve simple food. Did not disappoint even when I’ve tried a few different shops. Prices are not that expensive too - 6-8k per pax could give you a wonderful meal. 
So many things to see!,"Mostly shops lol But if you are looking for fancy korean (Kpop/Kdrama) jewelries, this is the place to be! And they also have a lot of kids' wear! Clothes for ahjussis and ahjummas are widely available as well hahaha There are also restos in some areas, odeng that's only 500₩ and heotteok tho not as good as the ones I had in Busan, but still good enough. This place is worth a visit. "
Lovely place to visit to see the local sights and smells,We had a lovely time at the Namdaemun Market. There were an assortment of wares on sales as well as street food to taste. A great attraction in Seoul 
Tasty scrolling om the market,"Big, big and more big. A lot af market stall.Walk, see and buy. IT takes you a lot of time to walk around the whole marker, but no problem, you can visit this market every day and iT is naar the centrum and the grand station"
Good place,Good place for budget travellers. Many items are relatively cheap. But Bangkok and KL are way much better and cheaper
How to REALLY experience Seoul,"Great real street market feeling. Here is where locals do their market shopping, with a few tourists in between. You'll find typical Korean food - not always to the taste of Westeners, so be prepared for it! But if you like typical local street food, then this is definitely the place to go!"
"Don't just shop here, stop and eat","We had many of our meals over here and got to know many of the local stall holders and the food was to die for. You can always get a bargain but do your homework first. know the exchange rate from your own currency to won and know the cost of items back home. always good to get a bargain but not at either your expense or the expense of the stall holder. You will not see all this market has to offer in a couple of hours and don't be afraid to go down the alleyways and side streets, this is a huge place as are many of the markets. You will find some great bargains and memorable food. Don't forget to take your camera. "
Easy market experience,"This market is easy to get to via taxi - I just showed them a photo of it on Trip Advisor and the driver knew right where to go. I spent a couple hours walking through the streets and shops. Plenty of people there and a lot of great street food. The vendors mostly speak English which made communication easy. When it was time to go, taxi's were waiting at most of the gates. "
A bit of everything,"Namdaemun Market is busy and filled to the brim with great street food, cheap souvenirs, and a general variety of goods. If this is what you're looking for, then it's definitely worth a visit. There are so many vendors that you could probably spend the good part of a day if you wanted to visit them all. However we spent less than an hour because it just wasn't for us; the crowds were extreme and most of them tourists, and stall owners would be calling us from every side trying to sell this and that - most of it things you would find hard to explain a real need for.I do have to praise the food. It is cheap, and most of it is fresh and made before you. It's also eaten by locals which is always a good sign. I just didn't see much value in the shops' stock and didn't enjoy the busy tourist crowds. There are other markets I would rather frequent."
Awesome Food,"The streets here are wider than Myeong Dong and prices of food might be cheaper too. Since we were travelling with stroller, we were not able to penetrate or go in Myeong Dong as the place was packed when we went. So we opted to go here instead.We bought some socks, belt, jeans, facial wash, and ate tons of street food. We loved the store that sold dumplings and meat buns. "
A popular market near Myeondong and Shinsegae,"This market is very big with lots of entrance leading to different sections. It is an open air market with buildings on the side which, each building specialized in different products. There are sections and building specialized in infant to children's clothes, shoes and accessories, men's items, jewelries, mattresses, ladies shoes, clothes etc. There is even a section where you can find alteration services. Things a relatively cheap and even cheaper if buy in bulk as they sell stuff in wholesale prices. Do drop by this market if you are in the vicinity and their shops open early too."
One of the best in the city...,"A great local atmosphere, you will find diversity of food, articles and accessories, closing, and much more, this is a place to go in the morning and get a fantastic breakfast with locales...."
Shoppers' Paradise!!!,"Loved the assortment of shops here! From the street stalls to the stores inside multistorey building, every shopper should be able to find something to take home! Besides clothing and cosmetics, there are entire levels selling ladies' accessories, clothing, cooking ware, home decor, artificial flowers, etc. If you are a keen shopper, you will need to plan easily 2-4 hours here. There is also at least 2 side streets selling local Korean dishes."
Piles of junk,"Huge area, many multi store buildings. Most of the merchandise is junk, just there is really really, really many kinds and piles of junk."
Good Deals,"A diversified market. From clothing, bags, stationery, accessories, shoes, cameras to hiking gear. They have it. They also have restaurants and cafes that serve very good Korean food. "
Largest shopping area. Best prices and selection?,"Our guide said this was the best market in Seouk for shopping. Many vendors have their own factories to produce goods for sale at better quality and prices than elsewhere. Certain types of goods are concentrated on named streets. Lots and lots of shops and places to eat - some just stalls, others are full service sit down. We spent almost 2 hours strolling and eating in the neighborhood."
An interesting and exotic market through the eyes of an European. ,"A very busy market in the heart of the city where toy get literally from A to Z.Qualitywise not necessarily to notch, but fun to browse through the narrow alleys and to take in the bit so familiar scents. If you have a tenancy to be claustrophobic, I would not recommend a visit during busy hours. At times you're blocked but people, hardly able to move forward or backward, neither left or right... and in parts underground. I enjoy observing the hustle and bustle of people and browsing for a typical Joann item (like brass dishes or similar)Generally it's mostly about clothing, but my size is never available neither my style. Very close by for larger wallets the first Shinsegae hosting upscale designer boutiques and a nice food section in B1On the other end of the market, the name giving Nandaemun, the former city gate and national treasure No.1 ( it sadly burned down ca. 10 yrs ago, but was restored to it's full glory)All in all go and visit as it's truly any experience!"
Enjoyable,"When you love bargain items, this is a must visit market. You can find korean made clothes, accessories, kitchen utensils and many more. Many coffee stalls too. Easy to access."
Great place for a large variety of goods!,"Namdaemun is one of the best markets to visit in Seoul and sells a very large variety of goods. If you want clothes, food, souvenirs or even cameras then this is the place to come. The market is divided into general areas where you can find specific items (children's clothing section, camera section, etc). The market is particularly famous for its camera section which offers decent prices on both new and second hand cameras from all brands. Fuji and Olympus users may have some trouble here, but Nikon, Canon, and Sony are well represented. For electronics alone though, Yongsan is better."
Junk,This market is full of counterfeited goods and just junk in general. Myeongdong and Insadong are both much better.
It's a clean market,I am so amazed in this very clean market. I enjoyed variety of goods being sold. If you are a foreigner in this country and love to cook this is the best place to buy the ingredients. I think the prices are reasonable enough. You just have to go around first to know who sell with least price.
Street Food,This market seems to be a lower market compared to the Myeongdong Market just a block down the road. I thought that there was a bit more food options here and it was cheaper. Walked past a Hotteok stand and had to get one cause it just smelt so nice. There were plenty of shops and stalls lining the road which seemed to be cheaper too. Plenty of entrances around so shouldn't be too difficult to find.Seems more like a local market than a tourist one which is why I thought it was a nice change.
Good shopping ,"Great place for shopping! There are many shops selling fashion accessories and many eateries. Very much accessible by metro and public bus. As the roads there are much congested, getting a taxi can be quite challenging. Very much a crowded place with locals and tourists so be very careful when there. Take good care of your belongings."
Very poor attitude,"We went to a shop there to get some dumplings (Gamekol Son Wangmandu as shown in the picture), and the staff was not welcoming to tourist at all. We didn't know Korean at all, so we tried to order by following the last customer's order, and to use body gesture and English to signal the staff we want to have what she ordered as well. However, the staff just grabbed our money rudely and ignore us totally until we repeated ask for someone to get our order. We were very disappointed as we have had very nice experience throughout our trip with others shops owned by Korean owners who know no English at all as well."
Repetitive warren of sub-par merch,"Namdaemun Market is very large and repetitive. It is a dense maze of uninteresting clothing and trinkets. The street food in Korea in general is not very interesting considering how accessible and varied the restaurants are; mostly variations on fried things all breaded in the same batter. In terms of absolute number of food stalls in the entire Namdaemun area, it might be a large-ish number but they are sparsely scattered between an astronomical number of all-the-same clothing/textile/trinket stalls, all of which just look kind of depressing."
Nothing special,You can find all kinds of cheap things on this market. From souvenirs to clothes and shoes. Also there are a few street food stalls. 
Fun browsing and shopping experience,"Namdaemun Market is the largest traditional market in South Korea with selling a variety of goods from clothes to accessories, ginseng and spectacles etc… The market is adjacent to Myeongdong and takes about 10-15 minutes by foot to get there. Although Namdaemun Market might not be that far away, the chilly autumn breeze certainly made it a walk to remember.It can be considered as a wholesale market so items sold here are usually priced reasonably and you save the more you buy. Of course, you may also try your hand at bargaining. We were there to get some ginseng (there's a ginseng street). Definitely a place worth visiting! For more on the experience and photos, please check out my blog. ^^"
Cheaper street food and souvenirs here than at the Myeongdong Shopping Street,"If you are planning to go on bargain shopping while in Seoul, look no further--Namdaemun Market is the place to visit. Anything from coats, bags, shoes, souvenirs and even street food, you can find them all here at much cheaper prices than at the famous Myeongdong Shopping Street. You can also grab a delicious meal at the many restaurants scattered around the area (also at cheaper prices). Your trip to Seoul would definitely not be complete without a visit to the Namdaemun Market. P.S. This stop is also part of the hop-on hop-off tour on the Seoul City Sightseeing Bus (Route A: Downtown Palace). "
Thanks most economical market in Seoul,The market is 150 years old and having a excellent culture maintenance of Korean the product of the market is quite cheap and you can buy any kind of the souvenir from this market to make your trip a memorable one
Enjoy the market,"The true, authentic atmosphere of Seoul can be found in this place. It is a market for locals, in which you will be able to find everything!! Great experience! "
Love this place!,"I tried a lot of tokbokki but I really liked the tokbokki here in Namdaemun market. Stores sells a lot of ginseng products, nuts, dried fruits, underwear clothings, shoes, and accessories. This is the best time to be in Seoul, spring season. Not too cold and not too hot to go walking outside and enjoy this vibrant city. Can't wait to be back here again. "
A place for great bargain,A market that offers variety items at fair price. Bought souvenir items and a hanbok. Enjoyed the tteokbokki at one of the food stalls. Pleasant & very helpful sellers. You can haggle A must visit if your looking for variety & bargain! 
Must visit for good eats and clothes ,"Always visit this place when I’m in Seoul for the hotteok , buns and the children’s area with the wide array of good designs to choose from. It’s relatively inexpensive and there’s also shoe shops as well as street vendors who sell cheap tees worthy of a second look. "
As good as a market gets ,"Great selection of anything really. It’s a market: be prepared for different styles and qualities. I didnt haggle because I didn’t think it was worth it for the item, but you can probably try. Be prepared to spend a couple of hours here. There’s also plenty of food to try! "
Really cool to see even if you aren't into shopping,This is a very large market in Seoul where you can find pretty nearly any item you can imagine. It is somewhat like organized chaos! It is worth strolling through the market even if you aren't interested in shopping just to see the spectacle of it.
Large market,Large market where you can find lots of things from food to clothes and souvenirs it's not a must go but if you have time why not spend some time there. 
Whole sale goods!,The market has many whole sale stores. It’s a busy area and you can buy nice things in a good price but you’ll have to bargin. I’d recommend an hour or two to walk around and get a glimpse of whats going on
Not really recommended,"Instagram @oppakulinerThis is a typical flea market, there are many stores here but it's more expensive than the other flea market I've visited in Seoul. It's too crowded also and not find anything good and worth to buy here. For me is no"
Typical flea market,It is quite a large market and is spread out. Most shops were of accessories some weird and wonderful street food. The shops were cheaper than other supermarket. The market is easily accessible as it is in the middle of the city and surprisingly is open till late at night.
Needs more time,Our guide allowed 45 minutes to stay in the market which was not enough However we bought nice local products and souvenirs with good prices 
Huge market with lots of stuff to see and buy,"Largest traditional market in Seoul full of bustle, locals and tourists mingle at this location. The market is cut out into sections and one can get lost easily since it's huge. Cheap finds such as 2nd hand clothings selling at 5000won from the push carts. Easily accessible via subway Hoyeon station, just one stop away from Seoul station and Myeongdong."
Buzzling place with food and many things to buy!,"Many people come here to get cheaper stuff, seaweed and baby/toddler clothes here!There are many eateries in this area as well and also a popular traditional eating place where you go jnto the market and sit side by side to eat! As the place is quite cramp, it is not advisable to have many things with you especially if have kids and strollers.There is also a famous brand nail cutter which can be found here. (If you know what I’m talking about!)There is an area which sells lots of baby/toddlers clothes and some area looks like those in Bangkok with lots of small shops within it."
Many good things to check out.,"Good place to experience traditional setting in the middle of the bustling city. Since it's located in the middle of myeongdong and Seoul station. Just 5 minutes away from each other. Strategic place. Good people, and good atmosphere."
Many Delicious local Food stand,Must visit in Seoul if you want try some Korean food in traditional small restaurant like kimchi dumpling a bimbimbapMany souvenir shop a money changer with good rate
Great to wonder around,"We spent a couple of hours here, having great fun just wondering up and down the aisles of stores. So much to see, so many wonderful smells. Plenty to eat and plenty of cheap market goods to buy."
Large market with a bit of everything.,"This is a large and busy market. Lots of clothes, food, souvenirs, toys, and housewares. I did not see much in the way of art (like you would get at Insadong). Definitely a good choice for a market experience. It is also an easy walk to Sungnyemun Gate which is a great photo spot juxtaposing history with modern."
"If you go to Seoul, this is a must","Unlike any place we have ever been, the food was amazing and so many shops and stands to go through. You could spend days and not see everything. My wife flew here to visit and was highly impressed by the culture and how nice everyone was. We loved Seoul and taking a taxi from our hotel to the market was a breeze. I highly recommend that if you visit Seoul, you hit up this market. We went early (0900) on a Saturday, and it was good we did because when we left at 3pm it was packed!!!"
Can’t Get Enough of The Place,"The place is always full of life. Food everywhere, lobsters, strawberries, chicken, pancakes, rice cakes, ice-cream topped with raw honey, fruits, grilled, steamed, boiled, anyway you can think off, they have it. Big and small restaurants, stand-alone stalls, stalls peddling clothes, bags, etc. Huge department stalls, brand name stores, all you need to shop to your heart’s desire. "
Good place to buy souvenirs,"Cheap place to buy souvenirs especially brooches, fashionable socks and a lot more. Highly recommended."
Good place for last min shopping ,Not so upmarket but there are nice earrings and souvenirs to buy.. need to find your way around as the roads look similar 
Closed on Friday nights/for cold weather?,Tried to hit up this market around 11:30 pm at night as we heard it comes alive in the evening. Got there and most of the vendors were closed? Can someone shed some light on this? Maybe because it was unseasonably cold?
Good place need to go,This is my first time to go there. It’s a nice and wonderful place to let me into the Koreans life. I like the food and snack in this place. I will back it soon. 
Nothing to buy with unfriendly locals,"The items found here are of cheap quality. The stalls sell similar things after walking for 5 minutes. No smiles from the vendors, unfriendly. Not worth my time travelling there, will not visit again."
A lot of stuff to see,Very nice market with lots of things to see and buy if you need. You can find anything and everything you want. Be prepared to spend all day if you search for something special. I like it.
It's a bazaar ,"Well, it's a street Bazaar. I've seen a lot of bazaars but I've never seen people as unfriendly as here. Incredible.The quality of all things is not good but a bit cheaper than somewhere else... "
1 hour tops,"1 hour just because I am walking with a 2 and 4YO. Found some unique street food and also a fruit shop (corner lot near Seoullo information booth) that sold cheap strawberries. If your intention is to buy souvenirs in bulk, then this may be suitable."
"Find food, clothes store, souvenir store","If you are tourist, this place one of market sell good food, clothes (include jacket/coat when winter season) and souvenir with good price"
Beyond Cheap Clothes,"Namdaemun market bustles on the weekends with laneways full of people. The more obvious shops are street stalls selling designer clothing knock offs and street food. Beyond those, there is also one street focused on high quality Korean paper and stationary. It worth a look for reasonably priced gift wrapping and gift boxes for that special occasion. Bulk birthday and Christmas cards are also available and great for kids birthdays. Location is the Western end of the market as you come down from Namsan Park."
Gate 5 for Foodies!,"We just came here for food! We went to gate 5 where a bunch of streetfoods were ready to satisfy our mouth! Enjoy the gyeran-bbang (egg cake), croquette, mandu (dumpling), assorted of fried bread, and oden (fish cake). Surely will come again to try many seafood stalls there!"
Namdaemun Market,"Traditional market, easily accessible. In my opinion, here is better than Myeongdong area for shopping."
Namdaemun - Best market in Seoul. ,"Very traditional in style and setup. Available stuff - pin to plane. All authentic and Korean made items would be found here. People are relatively friendly to foreigners. Unlike myeongdong, bargaining is acceptable to some extent. Look around for Tshirts , shoes, jackets and random stuff. One can easily get lost in these market lanes for hours together. A must visit place in Seoul. "
Great shopping,"Excellent markets with everything you can think of, from clothing and shoes to fresh foods, seafood and everything in-between.Too much to list, and prices can be negotiated slightly.Only 500m walk from Seoul subway station (line 4)Well worth a visit....""Shop Till You Drop"" :)"
Traditional market. One of the best object in Seoul.,"His market is really big. The best thing is the freshness of the products. aside from fruit and traditional snacks, you could find lots of shops selling clothes etc. The more you go inside, the price will slightly cheaper."
Time waster. Trinkets and low quality items,"Closes early and repeats most of the stuff which Myeongdong has - but with fewer eateries. Trinkets are cheap knockoffs. Some of the skincare products and food products may be slightly cheaper, but it is probably not worth coming by unless 1) you are buying in bulk 2) have a lot of spare time in SeoulAvoid"
Closes early!!,Great place for street food and shopping. Make sure to get there early. For some reason they close quicker than other night markets.
Shopping for Souvenirs,"Bought some skincare products and loads of souvenirs from here. The price are relatively cheaper on some skincare products compared to Myeongdong but some are almost similar. So if you want to shop here, you'd probably do some research at Myeongdong beforehand. But for souvenirs such as key chains, seaweed, small bags, coin purses, ginseng liquor - we found it is cheaper here and we bought it in bulk. "
"Kpop merch heaven, closes surprisingly early","I bought lots and lots of kpop merch, from Blackpink to Got7 to Twice, everything is available here. But, my main issue was that they closed way too early. I went by 8 pm and almost every store was closed or closing. It's still an awesome place to buy kpop goods :)"
"Kinda confusing, not sure if it is a tourist attraction.","My point of view that is a market for locals not really for tourists, you can explore shops selling clothing, hardware, home necessity, sewing, cheap and average price. Overall, market is too big but not a tourist attraction."
Close on Sunday ,"Advice to come here during the day time , for street food , snacks , souvenirs , which was cheaper . "
Alright. ,We very much preferred the Myeongdong market over this one. This market is older but seemed to be just shirts and clothes not the diversity in Myeongdong. But we loved walking the streets and seeing the food and people. 
Great bargains among all night markets,i went to take a photo at namdaemun.most important is to buy a pair of gloves.there are few streets dedicated to sales of different commodity..eg shoe street souvenir street and food street..the prices of souvenirs are the cheapest here.but still must scout around as different stall offer different price.the famous almond nuts i bought at 5000won.the other places are selling at 5500won or 6000 won.many choices of souvenirs eg keychains pens pouches..great to buy all you need from here.will come here again for sure.
Best food place!,"There's plenty of places to eat for a very affordable price and you can tell the authenticity of the food because the ""auntie's"" are manning the stalls. Needless to say, the food was so scrumptious, specially the bulgogi. People are friendly despite not being able to speak English well."
nice market area in NamDaeMun,"this large open market area is popular with tourists and locals. located in the NamDaeMun area in Seoul, the market covers a few square blocks. shops line the market, offering bedding, clothing, footwear, bags, foods, etc ... worthwhile to stroll through when the weather permits for sure! "
Shopping!!,"This place is a shopping haven. You can buy ref magnets, keychains and other korean souvenirs for a cheap bargain. This is a crowded place so be sure to be extra careful. This is a great place for pasalubongs!!"
Great market with great food,Namdaemun Market is a great market to wander and experience and see what a traditional street market is like. This market is very organized and there are helpers/tourist info guides to help you navigate the market. There is also an information booth in the middle of the market that has free maps of the market and area and it is a great place to stop and get yourself orientated. The market is divided up in sections and the map has landmarks and the sections listed. The food in the market is very good and cheap and it is advisable to go there on an empty stomach. You will find cheap souvenirs here as well.
just a market,"To be honest I cannot say I liked this place much. Everything wasn't a good quality, the only thing I bought there ware chopsticks, which then I found cheaper ones in the Insadong. However, the food was really good!"
"Street food and lots of ""stuff""","If you're game for street food, this is your place. I'd arrived with a tummy upset and after day 1 in the hotel, I wasn't being too adventurous. There was lots of clothing, shoes and junky souvineers that didn't take my fancy. The other half enjoyed the street food. We were out and about early and it was Monday, I suspect a quiet day for the market as it didn't seem that busy. I was a bit disappointed really, I'd been expecting better quality stuff."
Street food and cheap finds,"They have tourist lounge gate two next to ginseng shop. They give free snacks and coffee. Food is cheap if you eat in small alley place, 8t for grill fish 4 fish rice n steam egg. A lot of places selling ginseng don’t know if real or fake. Almonds and seaweed sold everywhere."
Pick up some street food!,"Street food here is quite good, I sampled tons. Didn't buy anything besides food. Lots of stuff you don't need: clothes, souvineers, shoes - I didn't need any of that stuff so I just looked mainly at the food!"
Best place to buy Souvenir,"it's a big market and you can find a lot of stuff here, like T-shirt, korean spoon and chopstick, snack, cracker, key chain, etc. they also sell korean household appliances and they sell it on a cheap price.. and there is a good fried chicken place near the tourist information center, if you are moslem you can try it, because most of the food stall are selling pork.. happy traveling"
So cheap ,"I came here to buy something for my office workers, got a pretty keychain for 5k won (i get 10pcs pack). They sell others too like magnets, pretty chopsticks, cheap clothes (10k get 3). "
Wasting time,Amm don’t know what to say but if u like to see this market which includes fish fruit stationery and not original brand come and see as u can Bargain them 
Busy,"Made up from a network of streets, shops and underpasses. Very busy with local people but wasn’t really my cup of tea."
More suitable for elders,It's an elderly market as you can see by the time you reach the market. Alot of elder shopping there and the sellers are mostly elders too so dun expect fashionable clothing for youngsters. I heard it has good choices of food but I didn't find any. But It sells cheaper korean souveniers comparing to other touristy spots. 
The usual market..,Not much different than the markets you can find in most of the World's cities Lots of stalls selling the same thing. I tried some fried dumplings.. the woman tried to get me to buy 4 instead of the 2 I asked for.. so I didnt ask to buy the other things I wanted as she had soured our deal 
Very local experience!,"A really good place to visit if you're interested in the local lifestyle! There are lots of clothing, food and souvenirs to buy here. Pricing are low/acceptable as well! Some clothing can cost just 5,000 korean won and are made in korea. I would recommended this place for people who want to experience the local life. :)"
Local market,"This is a nice market to visit, from live fish to home appliances and everything in between...not exactly cheap"
A street for everything,Travelling solo i explored the nooks and corner of this street and found a number of knick knacks to take home.. The experience was great in terms of shopping as well trying local street food!
Large place to shopping!,The place is really large. I didnt get to getting all around the market. The market is easy to get with public transportation. So many items u can buy and cheaper than other places!
Good food but Beware in buying stuff,"We loved the food affordable and tastes good! Must Try the egg breadPotato with sausage Korean barbqEverything!But be careful when buying stuff likeThe clothing and hats, earmuffs etc.Please canvass first before buyingOur first night was terribleWe ate in a restaurant beside click hotelThey do understand English And we saw a group menu for 4 pax each Combo meal for 45,000wonAlmost 45-50 USDBut when they asked for paymentThey told us that the 45k won meal is for 2 adults and they charged us twice and we paid93,000won almost 100USD!!!we were 4 adults each table (3 tables)Since it was our first time and first dayWe did not complaint because we do not want a hassle on our vacation.Then at the street marketThe temperature on our first night reached negative 15-17 degreesThat our ears were freezing We looked for earmuffs immediately And this ladyGave us the price of 10,000wonI thought it was a good buyBecause the cold is not tolerable anymorewe were really upset the next day when My relatives bought same earmuffs at myeong dong train station only for 3,000wonOh well charge it to experience ;)Some people really take advantage to foreigners...Will Be wiser next time..."
Prepared to get lost,Huge market are with variety of shops including wholesale stores. Prepare the get lost in the alleys. Good place for souvenir shopping.
"Huge traditional market, kalguksu alley","Namdaemun market is one of traditional market in Seoul. Unlike any other markets, they classified the shop based on what they sell. We went there to find things for kids. Unfortunately some of the shop were already closed, perhaps due to the weather. This market is known for its food's alley too. For noodle lovers, you should visit kalguksu alley near gate 5. "
Sooooo many goods!!,"There’s everything you could possibly want to take him in this market from your typical souvenirs to delish food and prepared food. It tends to get busy after lunch, but this when the best food vendors come out :)"
Huge and diverse,"Namdaemun Market is quite central. You can find food, clothes, make-up, glasses (lots of glasses), karaoke bars and anything you could think of. It is veeeeeery crowded and loud, mostly young people. There is one place where young musicians and bands sing and make music for everyone. This was very nice to see and listen. Definitely recommended "
Amazing market in central Seoul. ,"Diverse wares and food stalls in the heat of Korea. Some of the most traditional and interesting dishes I’ve encountered in Korea. San-nakji (산낙지) is a variety of hoe (raw dish) made with long arm octopus. Although the octopuses are killed before being cut into small pieces and served, the nerve activity in the octopus' tentacles still makes the pieces move posthumously on the plate whilst served."
Largest Traditional Market in Seoul,"This is basically a pedestrian shopping mall. Spread out over a couple blocks, it first opened in 1964. It was interesting to see some of the different food places with donuts, fruits, etc. We saw lots of shoes, and some squiggly root looking things in water jars. There were also lots of shoe stores. It is probably a good place for souvenirs along with Insa-dong street. We did meet people here who spoke English to help us."
koran food,"the very first time i taste street foods. though, new to my taste, i tried it. i like some. perhaps, if i can see it always, i can eat it also they way korean people do. "
It is really good experience,"I've been there with my gf, around a month ago. We've eaten various street food and seen lots lots of shooping area. I think it will be a super great experience, if it is your first visit in Korea :)"
Good place for souvenirs and street food,"If you are looking for cheaper souvenirs this is the best places to get it. It is also walking distance from Myeongdong . Besides that, if you plan to try korean street food you can also try it here. Some of the street food prices cheaper than lots of famous places. "
Tough to bargain,This was fun to walk around and gain steps. Not as nice as it has been in the past. Could have been due to very cold temps. Vendors did not seem interested in bargaining. Still fun to walk around.
Very big market for workout 😅🚶‍♀️,This market is the largest market ) we were walking ‍♀️ for 1.5 hours. Looked around. Here we can eat traditional Korean food sitting inside a small “cafe” with heaters look like a fan . Price for everything is cheaper than outside of market. This market has a lot of buildings with clothes and other things. Inside a hot air
Delish foods for cheap price!,"The thing is, I'm a picky eater. I don't usually eat unusual foods but I had to try them here! You can also find silk, mattresses and all the sorts here in great material. If I had enough baggage, I'd buy tons of those!"
Pre starve for the excellent street food.,"I am not a shopper, rather I love street food and this market did not disappoint. Fried shallot pancakes for 1000W, intestine skewers for 500W (less gross than it sounds) and an entire alley selling noodles, soups, Chinese cuisine, dumplings and more.If you are visiting nearby attractions such as City Hall and Deoksugung palace, this is a great spot to stop for a quick bite to eat and souvenir shopping, everything from Ginseng to tailor made clothing. The restaurant I went to for noodles had tetra(?)lingual menus (Kor, Jap, Chn, Eng) with the wifi password displayed - food was reasonably priced, tasty, and tourist friendly."
Thank God for this Market,"Our visit to Korea was great but I found the culinary experience to be lacking. Food was pricey but underwhelming in every restaurant we visited. Maybe we just went to the wrong places to eat. We ventured to explore Namdaemun market in front of our hotel in the last few days of our trip. We were not disappointed! It was a tourist haven. Food was cheap, authentic and delicious. So much variety. I loved the huge dumplings! It was the best! Bang for every buck! You can also shop for cheap stuff in the market. There were a lot of winter clothes on sale, street food and a lot of souvenirs. My best buy was the Rimowa looking luggage set (Small, Medium and Large) for only P 9,000 or about USD 180.Be sure to visit Namdaemun Market when in Korea. "
Good place to try street food,"Went to the Namdaemun market in the after noon.there are many kind of street foods such as Hoddock , Ddockboki, fish cakes..and a lot of shops there you can buy whatever you want ! Should visit there if you travel in Korea !"
Expensive ! ,"I thought that markets stuff would be a lot cheaper .. But NO! The ppl tries to grab ur arm tightly so u couldnt escape or walk pass their items, most of the bags there are expensive they tried to sell me a small makeup bag ( a simple one ) for 32 000 won like seriously ?? I had to give them an uncomfortable look and just pull my arms from them, i was so nervous to even look closely to the items sold there cos they can be grab u by the arms and its hard to let loose. ( NOT COOL) The items sold there isnt any unique either, cos u can find similar items at myeondong underground shopping, or the street. You dont have to come to namdaemun market trust me its expensive! Unless u are there just to eat or take photos However u can find a store that sells international groceries around the market. If u are looking for Halal food. "
Pay a visit!!,"If you are to bargain and wholesales, go here! Just keep bargain, walk around check for different prices. Even if they dont speak well english, just put a price on their calculator. 50% lower than what they tell you ;) Asian insights and intel knowledge "
Our first visit!,"I decided to bring my family to Namdaemun Market for this trip. However, it was slightly disappointing. Saw a few YouTube clips to confirm our visit there. Basically, if you were to look for really cheap stuffs. There are many wholesale retailers there selling great varieties of items like fashion and home products, etc. As for food wise, I don’t see a great variety of food. We bought some red bean buns but didn’t finish them off. We ended up in a restaurant near exit 5 for our lunch. Can give it a try to patronise the restaurant that offer nice Ginseng Chicken Soup which located on the second floor of a building. "
Disappointed with the stall owners,"Had been to S.korea many times, Namdaemun stall owners from China rather rude..She supposed to pass the foods pack to me instead she just throw at the table, however some.of the stall are pretty kind and introduce some street foods to us. But expensive but just try it if you are looking for their local foods.."
Namdaemun,A must place to visit of u wanna buy gifts n souvenirs. U can havr a good bargain and lots of things to.buy .
Cheap Korean shopping ,Go to line 4 and go out of exit 4. This a bustling market for traditional Korean goods. Street food is abundant and cheap. 
Nothing great,"Some of the reviews mentioned this to be a night market, but not sure. A bit disappointed as this market was not the bustling place that I expected compared to other markets in parts of Asia. Most shops selling winter wear. In fact all markets and roadside stalls everywhere we went in Seoul seemed to be selling winter wear. Time of the year, I Guess. Food stalls were few and far between, though there was 1 stall selling delicious dumplings close to the metro entrance. "
the Korean market for everyday ,"my korean mum wanted that i see this market. It is not a tourist attraction and goods are for the everyday use for a korean household (which is very different from a western household !). It is fun to watch and eat street food ! You may not find something for the european taste as fashion is very different and sizes could be an issue (very small). Good buys in Korea for me are korean cosmetics, socks, dry food, teas, baby clothes (korean brands). Ginseng is very famous and expensive but not for everyone taste (bitter) ! "
Buy your souvenirs here,"The setup is similar to Malaysia's Petaling Street. Selling clothings, shoes, souvenirs, practically everything. Do try some street food if you are here. I bought 26 fridge magnets here for 10,000won. Also bought 10 nail cutters for 10,000won. Just to provide you an idea of the prices here. I didn't bargain...so maybe if you do, you can get stuffs at lower prices than me. "
A good place to shop and eat,It's interesting to walk around and you can get some deals if you bargain in Korean although it feels like they try to take advantage and overcharge the tourists. We ate in food alley. The restaurants aren't very fancy but the food is authentic and good. 
Markets for all trade...you can get anything here!,"If you are in Seoul, you must visit this market, the so-called the city's largest market. You can get almost anything here from clothing, souvenirs, purses, and food supplies. Many stalls are open into the wee hours of the morning. A very good shopping experience in Seoul. We managed to buy the Supreme clothing, souvenirs, fruits and also accessories here. There are lots of stalls & you will get lost easily finding your way out....definitely worth the visit!"
Namdaemun is a place with numbed vendors ,"The atmosphere at night here is a stark contrast to Myeongdong. It is dimly-lit and most of the vendors there look jaded and less enthusiastic about hawking their tired-looking wares. Though a few of their products there appear cheaper to Myeongdong ones, they do not add up to much savings. The goods hawked are dated and nothing special. Not worth the trip. "
Grab everything from here,"If you come Seoul, dont miss to visit here. It seem to be China Town in Korea. If you are traveller, you can find every things about Korea in here. Foods, snack, gifts and etc. the price is reasonable. "
Don’t go to food tent - targeted to rip off tourist,"My friend and I wanted to have a quick bite after dinner before going back to hotel to end the day. We went to the back street of Marriott Courtyard Namademum hotel where we stayed and decided to opt for one of the food tents to have the local experience, particularly we saw a number of local Koreans were having meal there. So we thought that having many locals in there should be a good sign for taste, price or both. Since we just wanted to have a quick bite so we only ordered 3 dishes, chicken skewers, chicken heart skewers, and boiled octopus. However, to our surprise, we were charged KRW 45,000 which was absurdly overpriced. We had paid less for each of our many delicious meals in proper restaurants before, such as seafood steamed pot for 2 people (KRW 43,000)and ginseng chicken soup for 2 people. (KRW 40,000). So there is absolutely no reasonable explanation to charge such high price for simple food in non- proper rest restaurant (or a tent). The only reason is that those tents are targeting tourists. To be honest, I am quite willing to spend money on food particularly when I am travelling but I feel upset because I have the feeling of being cheated. If you don’t want to leave a bad taste in your travelling experience in Korea, then please just don’t go to food tents in Seoul. "
Shopping is fantastic! ,There’s quite a bit of shopping done here despite the very cold and freezing weather. It was a good shopping experience. We went back a second time. The Korean ajumas are very nice and friendly!! Will definitely revisit if I come korea again 
Shopping with good price,Very good selections of choice of things to buy. And street food as well. Do shop around before you decide which shop to buy from. Same product might be selling at different price just a shop away
Worth going ,Best place to get fresh and reasonable priced strawberries. Saw some tourists bought boxes of it to be brought home. Definitely cheaper than department stores and myeongdong market 
Worth visiting if you like markets,"I think you can buy just about anything here - household pots and pans, clothing, food. I enjoyed wandering but didn't buy anything as most were not authentic souvenirs, just inexpensive stuff."
Still a great market ,"I had not been here for almost 25 years, I could still find my way around and loved the hoetok sweet pancakes that I remember as a kid! "
Experience the Culture,It’s not your fancy and most urban market if you are going for that reasons. But if you want to experience the most famous street food and buy a souvenirs with a super reasonable prices so it’s your destination. 
Bustling with culture,"If you want to see the real korea visit namdaemun or the gwangjang markets. bustling with culture a real hotspot for not just tourists but locals alike, authentic Korean street food and a variety of market stalls. Great food, great atmosphere!"
Nearest market by my hotel,"It was a very diverse market, lots of bags, clothes, scarves, Baby clothes, and if you go inside the building in the side street the wholesalers are in there. Lots of market stalls that sells almost anything and everything from food, ginseng,clothes accessories, etc."
Great local market,Nice place to go and experience korean street market. U can walk from Seoul station either via sky bridge or exit 5 of line 1 Seoul station.
Traditional style shopping area,"Namdaemun Market is more of a traditional style shopping area. It open early morning and close late night. The retail streets are divided into several categories like Children's Clothes Street, Watch/Jewelry Street, Fashion Street, Military Uniform Street, Bedding Street, Mountain Climbing Equipment Street, Camera Street, Stationery/Toy Street, Food Material Street. Food streets include Chopped Noodles Street and Fish/Stew Street. it a must place to visit if you in korea.ps: ( there visitors information booth if you need any assistance ) "
A little taste of tradition ,We enjoyed this market a few times. They don’t hassle you. Street food entertaining and good. Tourist help there as well. We were told when we went to Korea to buy socks. We bought many pounds of them! You pay basically $2 a pair but you buy in packs. There is a ton of modernism in Seoul so this market was a treat!
"Cheap eats and bargain buy! Delicious food, Eye-opener for Tourists","We stayed at Aloft hotel Myeongdong, which is quite near to Namdaemun market. We spent appx 3 hours in Namdaemun tasting different street food, and had a good walkaround. This market is abit messier than Myeongdong but it's really authentic Korean! Don't skip the small dark alley as those are the places that you can possibly find the best and most affordable korean food! Absolutely enjoyed it!"
Typical overwhelming street market,It can get very crowded but a good place to get souvenirs and casual necessities. This market place is known for galchi jjim (spicy silver eel(?) stew) by the locals but street food is good too. It is also known for many eyeglass places above and underground where you can get great stylish back up glasses. Be sure to bargain when purchasing goods but not food. 
Lots of jewelries and clothings,"This market is so huge that we got lost walking around this place. As compared to the nearby Myeongdong Street market, the prices are are cheaper but the place is not “classy”. A section of this place is a wet market and there are many wholesalers. Recommendation:1. Go there during the day as this place become like a ghost town after 8 pm. 2. Clothings and jewelries accessories and bags are aplenty. 3. Beside the street stalls, try going into the shops in the many buildings where you can find more and better merchandise. "
Evening in november,"Few of the shops were closed on the week at evening (after 6pm) but there were still plenty of delicious street food. I should have bought more sweet rice cakes from the old man, they were so delicious! Remember to visit the Kalguksu alley! The ajummas cooking are loud when trying to get you to sit down at their table, but so sweet and kind when serving. Should have visited Namdaemun market once more, will do it next time in Seoul!"
Good deals,"If you are seriously looking for accessories shopping. This is a great place! So much to choose from... you have to know what you are looking for and send me idea of pricing as you can truly find awesome deals. I can spend all day here... but no as I will go broke if you have few hours, I highly recommend for shopping and gifts. Friendly people and many speaks English and good food. "
Biggest day and night market in Seoul,"This is biggest day and night market in Seoul. It opens early and closed late at night time. You can find almost anything you need here. It does gets really busy. There are things that are expensive, but when it comes to eating. It is really cheap and good. It is located near the train station. If you see a building called ""Common Plaza"" you are basically there. The vendors sels everything in bulk. If you see this place called Hyojason King Dumplings. They make fresh food on the spots everyday!! Also, walk pass Hyojason King Dumplings, you should see it on the right hand side a restaurant called ""Namdeamun Charcoal bbq"". Must stop here for their food. It is really good and cheap!"
"Swarovski, fridge magnets and cutleries....For tourists... things you bring back to your homeland","I initially went here to find Swarovski brooches but it turned out the place and satellite area offers a lot more. You could get cheaper korean souvenirs here compare to other tourist attractions... fridge magnets, nail clippers, cutleries etc... you name it. The Korean Swarovski brooches almost made me run out cash hahaha. we went straight to kiosk 168 at 1st Floor E-lengdang. The salesperson already know how to converse the prices in malay, so obvious malaysians go to her... there are hundreds more swarovski kiosks there ranging from brooches, bracelets, tiaras, watches and baju melayu buttons... so ladies bring enough cash!the cutleries such as korean spoon has so may design and way cheaper here. the place is open at 7am and closes at 5pm so be early."
Expensive,"It's a tourist destination, therefore nothing is cheap here, particularly over the weekend. I see a lot of tourists with big shipping bags here, but I really don't know if they get a real deal. Lots of other tourist's destinations nearby, but are disguised by the luster of this market."
Traditional market place,The market place existed very few hundred years and still going strong. You will find everything and able to bargain for it. It’s discovery experience if you know what you are looking for.
"Street market & food, cheaper products - worth a visit.......","This is a street market concept, unlike Myeongdong or Hongdae.Street stalls, street food carts, messy looking shops - all part of this street market atmosphere.Prices here are cheaper no doubt but don't expect to find branded or high quality products here.There is a building within that sells wholesale accessories but purchases has to be in bulk. They don't accept 1 or 2 pieces buy.Atmosphere is nice though especially if weather is cooling. Worth a visit. This place is within walking distance to Myeondong Shopping Street, Namsan Park & Shinsegae Department store."
Don't go after 20:00,"We arrived about 19.30 at the market, but we saw that many stands already had closed down (we visited in autumn). The food stands however were still open and we enjoyed some street food from a local elderly couple (who kept on giving us more and more samples for tasting). The dumplings at the corner of a cross road were additionally excellent!"
Easy to get lost and carried away!,"This is quite a huge market with a lot of small lanes. It could be intimidating for first timer to be honest but enjoyable nonetheless. There's also Muslim friendly food at this market located in the small alley where they sell galchi jorim, grilled fish and serve the best fried fish (imo) as banchan. It could be hard to find at first but once you know the way it would be a breeze just make sure you have a map with you if you're unfamiliar with the place."
Cheap Clothes and Accessories,"Went there alone while husband was working.Love the street market, cheap clothes... everything was cheap.Broochs are cheap here... just go to 2nd floor of E-World shopIf you wanna bring home some gifts for your girl friends or sister, just go to the E-World, they sell whole sale stuff and a cheaper price."
Shop shop shop,"If you like shopping, this is the place to go.You can easily spent 3-4 hours in the market. From clothes, shoes, souvenirs and street foods.Must visit in Seoul."
Eat the street food!,My favorite meal in Korea was in this market. I ate standing up at a street dumpling restaurant. They were making the dumplings right there- so fresh and delicious.I kept going in circles and finding myself right back in a spot I had already visited.
Cheap clothes and diverse articles,"This is huge and full of things to buy: socks, souvenirs, clothes, purses, hats, food, ginseng...I would say worth visiting as this is very special. Probably good place to buy at low prices, not for every taste!If you are looking for traduire outfits, you’ll find a few stores there.Good for the experience, not my favorite shopping place."
Lovely Traditional Street Market,"Thankfully, there seem to be many traditional markets remaining in Seoul. This is certainly a nice one, if not large in scale and there are many good stalls. It’s proximity to the subway station and several nice coffee shops and excellent eateries, all moderately priced by Seoul standards—or even compared with Seoul University Station, just down the road—make it a good and efficient place to spend a few hours browsing and relaxing, while completing the morning’s or afternoon’s shopping. Very pleasant. It’s relatively smaller scale is, for me, part of its charm. "
A must visit to Namdaemun Market,We walked from Myeongdong to Namdaemun Market. It is just opposite and walking distance to there. It is always very crowded for street shopping & foods.
Exciting,"Exciting market where the line ""shop 'till you drop"" becomes a reality. There are buildings after buildings of shops with clothing apparel, shoes, and everything in between. Haven for wholesalers too!"
Souvenir Haven,"The market has tons of shops indoor and outdoor. The best I found was the Orange Building. Enter by Gate 2 and walk straight and the orange building will be on your left, you will enter through the luggage/handbag section and take the escalator up to the 2nd floor and there are souvenirs as far as the eye can see."
Fun and cheap market,"Compared to other market, this place is more cheap, crowded with senior citizens but still a fun place to visit and explore the korean culture."
One of the best,"Our favourite haunt while we were at Seoul. Crazy in the day and crazier at night. Close to seoul station, meongdong and hoeyeon stations.Food, clothes, bags, belts, accessories - anything for a cut price. Happy shopping. "
"Bargain, Bargain, Bargain","This is the most largest market for all sorts of traders. You name it they have it. They even have a Tourist Assistance to assist any tourist about this place. Most of them are very young, some are experienced. Ber helpful also.This market serves the mod and low income band. All you need is your haggling skill. Bargain Bargain Bargain!Gudluck guys"
Namdaemum market,"Namdaemum market is a place where u find Traditional Korean crafts, food dresses.We came across very nice Korean traditional dress materials for ladies and kids ...was slightly expensive ( not sure about the prices).It had plenty of Korean food and few craft materials....."
Crowded,"Although i have visited Seoul several times, this is the first time I visited Namdaemun. It was quite crowded. Most shops sold clothes and souvenirs, not up to my interest."
Good place for shopping and foods,A great place for the food hunter. A lot of choices for shopping also. Nearby subway for easy access. A must go place when u visit korea!
A must visit,A great place to come visit with hundreds of stalls selling all types of clothes and souvenirs.Saw some of the food stalls on a YouTube blog and had to give the dumplings and hot dog on a stick a try.This market is also very close to Myeondong so definitely check it out.
High fashion street for kids,"A traditional market with lots of clothes, bags, shoes and foodstuff. There are stalls to roam about and malls to explore.There is a mall that sells only children's clothing. Loved the variety of clothes available. Keep a lookout for clothes on special offer for good buys."
Busy but entertaining place,"If you don't enjoy crowded places, avoid the market on weekends. But if you can bear with it, you can have good street food and buy cheap souvenirs here, don't forget to bargain! "
"Somewhat more traditional, good location, cheaper","They seemed to have some more traditional foods. I didn't see any chicken skewers, meatballs, or fried chicken. One really popular item was a stuffed pancake with mungbean, I think its called a Hotteok. There was also a dumpling stall I liked."
Hustle and bustle,"Like nothing I have ever experience before. Worth checking out in the afternoon. Each part of the market has different things for sale - clothing, bags, kids etc. Fun experience. Very different. TONS of people, so only go if you like crowds. "
Come and visit the food alleys too,"Namdaemun Market is just a few blocks from Myeongdong. Myeongdong seems to attract the younger generations whereas Namdaemum attracts all age groups in general.Namdaemum covers a few city blocks with a few main streets and a lot of alleys. I found that the whole area is quite confusing. Most of the stores and vendors sell similar things: clothing, handbags, socks, street food, produce etc. It is difficult to find a landmark. If you happen to find the information booth, get a site map and it helps to navigate the area.We visited the area on a Saturday afternoon, Surprisingly it was not too crowded. May be it was their National holiday week. We had a hand-made noodle lunch at a tiny alley which is near the information booth. The space of that vendor is really tight and it can only seat 4 people. For US$5, you are served with kimchi, 1 bowl of cold noodle and 1 large bowl of hot noodle soup. The noodle lady was very friendly and she refilled the kimchi once we finished. The noodle was very good. A few days later, we visited again on a week day around 5:30pm. a lot of the vendors have already closed and only those along the main street were still open. So if you plan to visit, choose a day visit on the weekend.I didn't see any public washroom in the area"
Great market to stroll around for bargain touristy souvenirs,Market has a great vibe and definitely worth a visit. Beware the grumpy vendors though which seems to be quite common.If you are after tourist souvenir or fast fashion this will be the place to come.Also some great street eats around!
A little bit of everything! ,"This place has everything! Clothes, food, spices, souvenirs and tatt! The market sellers aren't in your face and the prices are reasonable. I stumbled across a firing range in the market which was really cool! Loads of food to choose from of all varieties though mainly traditional Korean. Absolutely worth a wander! "
"Busy, Interesting, Lots of Goods!","Interesting market, bustling with people, food, goods and some! Goods and food of all kinds in a block! Good to walk and talk a look!"
Shopping and eating at Namdaemun Market,"Visited the market both in the morning as well at night. The place was fairly relaxed before 9am on a Sunday morning. It was crowded from noon to about 730pm. Some parts of the place would be deserted by 9pm.The galchi jorim fish alley was busy even till 3pm on a Saturday. Had late lunch at Uri Sikdang, one of the shops there and the food was good. USD8 for the meal there and the tofu stew was very good.Plenty of street food at one of the stretch and you could get fishcake skewers, chicken skewers, octopus etc. I'd usually return the stick to the stall since there is no dustbin around.For shopping, recommend to start earlier in the morning as the crowd starts just before noon time.Plenty of coffee places in the market but most are closed on Chuseok. Most of the coffee places are for take-out."
Shopping at night,"I expected a much larger variety of goods and food stalls at this market which we did not find. Most of the shops also close quite early, we arrived after 8pm and very few stores were still open. "
Just strolling by,We arrived at Namdaemun Market by subway and expected much more to see and do  but we had nothing much to do except street market shopping and eating! 
Great Friendly Market,"Lots of shops. Eating carts and restaurants. Market is full of clothes, socks, bags, toys etc. nothing much traditional or hand crafts. A good experience though. "
Look is not everything.,"To many western tourists, traditional markets in most Asian countries look unclean. But you can trust on me that the food sold in this market are much cleaner than you think. Enjoy the cheap, but clean and tasty food."
Small but sufficient market,"The Namdaemum market isnt as big as the one on Hongik University Street or Ewha University Street or Dongdaemum but it has everything you need. It is quieter than those mentioned above and have cheaper food there. So if you want to just avoid the crowd, I would recommend this place to travellers out there. "
Street Shopping Heaven With Reasonable Price,"If you plan to visit Seoul, ensure this market is your first stop. You can get lot of local fashion attire here with cheap price compare to Myeongdong Street including children fashion. Price range start from 1000 won. Basically this market is just beside Myeongdong Market. Shinsegae Department Store is the divider of this two street market. If you travel with kids, just take a taxi, it only cost you less than 5000 won from any of Hotel at Myeongdong area.You can find souvenirs, kimchi & other local food here, clothes, bag & etc.Lot of restaurant also available along the street. Street food start around 3pm onward.Basically lot of choice & you may spend 3 - 4 hours here.If you looking for local foods, look for this shop (Sale Market No. 1), the guy very friendly & able to speak a little bit in Bahasa Malaysia or Indonesia. He gave us some discount, extra free foods & travel plastic bag."
Peaceful market,"This market was peaceful during the day I was there. Decent place to shop and great variety of street food. While it can be crowded, going during the week it isn't so bad."
Here you need to bargain,Now during the Chuseok time a half of the cabins are closed. Anyway enough stands to be studied and goods to be bought. Remember to bargain. 
Business trips,"Was here since 12 years ago till now and watched it changePrice are extremely high and they get alot of stuff from china nowSo i stopped going for shopping n more for the fun of it if i have extra time on my trip since i have been to mostly everywhere in this cityIf u r free, come here n just walk"
Great market and street food area,"We enjoyed wandering through the various lanes full of shop and barrow vendors. Plenty of casual clothing here, with food, gifts and souvenirs. In the evening there were a couple of streets with food barrow vendors, we ate (standing!) here a couple of times (we found here to be cheaper than the street food vendors in the more up-market Myeongdong area), the vendors were very friendly."
To see more local food & inexpensive stuffs,"It is one of the most famous market place in Seoul but I can not say it is real authentic or traditionally local stuffs there. If you want to see traditional market, buildings or foods, you can go Minsokchon which is abour 1~1.5 hr from Namdaemun market by car. However Namdaemun sijang(marketplace) provides a lots of street food and inexpensive shopping stuffs. Near Namdaemun, you also can find out many department stores and find dinning places, if you want to have a different level of shopping/dinning."
Cheap local market for clothes and accessories,"This is the largest market in Korea for clothes, household items and food. We visited here twice, once during the day and once in the evening. We used the subway and exited at Hoehyeon station. We had a very cheap local dinner here and bought some warm clothing for very cheap prices, but quite good quality. You get value for your money here. Nice place to visit. Recommended."
"Souvenirs,fruits,clothes,bags ",This place is ideal for those who want to buy souvenirs etc.The price here is also cheaper esepecially the fruits.I was amazed by the clothes they are selling for winter because of the fur they've used.Ideal place for wholesale shopping.
Good place for buy souvenir,"I strolled the Namdaemun Markets for 2 days. First day, already late so many shops ready to close. The next day, re-visit & buy a few souvenir.There is a variety of hings sold in here."
Lots of Stuff ... Little Substance,"A great place to people watch, a lousy place to shop, unless you like crowded street markets.At mid-day, there were people everywhere with different sounds, smells and sights. Neat to wonder thru, but not something I'm looking to purchase from."
Suitable place to buy souvenir,"If you look for souvenir (gifts and special snacks from Korea), this is suitable place. Price is cheaper than others for some kind of gifts/snacks. You also can bargain. "
Probably one of the best known markets,"Namdaemun market has a very central location in Seoul next to the Namdaemun gate. It's walking distance to the Seoul station and enxt to Myeongdong.The market is open every day. With many stalls outside that cater for everybody, one shall not forget to visit the many 2/3story malls with fashion accesories, cameras and lenses (new and used), foreign food, flowers, kitchen crockery, stationary, eyewear etc etc.Once at the market, don't forget to view the Namdaemun gate right beside, one of the beautiful gates left from it's earlier citywall."
Load of stuff to be bought but more is not always better,"Lots of stuff can be bought here, but most of it is junk and quality is generally poor. I regard it as a remnant from the times that east-Asia was a synonym for cheap copies of expensive goods. Nowadays it (forntunately) is much more trendsetting and tech-crazy, but this is not reflected here..."
Great big market,You can buy almost everything here. No electronics thou outdoor shops and air-conditioned area. Food are in the basement. And there's accessories all over. Unique handmade. And great finds of nuts and air-dried fruits
Not worth the time,It's full of cheap junks ... the area is a bit smelly too. Not sure what the hype is about. Seoul offers many other better markets and spots to visit than this dated corner.
Interesting but not so cheap ,"It was a good experience to wander around, you can buy all souvenirs and have lunch here. Can be the most economic way for shopping but consider it's still seoul not anything like Thailand etc. There is bargaining option but not more than 10-15 percent... still worth visiting for sure "
Seoul is not a shopping destination,There are many markets/night markets in Seoul. But most things are pricier than in Singapore. But in any country shopping should be one large part of your iteniery as this will keep ladies happy and best way to interact with locals. When you are tired there is no shortage of coffee shops to sit and relax
A Typical Local Farmer Market,"I am not sure why people were impressed of this market, it could possibly be the fact that this is a local farmer market that foreigners deem interesting. I spent about 30 mins walking around the blocks and found out that vendors were selling vegetables, meats, and other produce. It is not a bad place to visit; however, it feels like any typical local farmers market where locals go and shop for grocery. It could also be difficult for foreign visitors to purchase anything as almost everything is in Korean. But then again, which foreign visitors would want to go grocery shopping at a local farmer market unless they plan to live in the area for a long period of time and are able to cook a meal."
"Cheap shops, souvenirs, food and loud","Like many markets in Asia, feels more as a combination of streers than a market with stalls like in other places in Asia.Worth a visit, but don't expect to be blown away. Prices are ok, but no cheaper than other places in Seoul. Colorful place for some nice pics."
Closed on Sundays,Went there around 4 pm just a few stores opened. Market place is closed so we were not able to explore
Typical Korean market,Many small shops with lots of things to sell. Many street-food restaurants. I would say the market in Daegu is bigger and offers more.
Where,"Where is the magic?We arrived around 8pm. Probably it was too late? I expected to see a lively street full of people, food and things to buy. Yes there were some but not so tempted. Kind of lonely to me for a place to be named a must- go-market. If we came early, it might be better."
"Souvenirs, not clothes","Don't buy your clothes here, much more expensive than the ones you can find at especially ehwa uni and at dongdaemun. Best place to buy souvenirs like the spoons, keychain, t-shirts. Surprised at how some of the Korean shopkeepers can.speak.Malay "
Must visit!,We have been living in Seoul for more than a year and have visited the Namdaemun market occasionally. There are several stores of interest and even if you don't intend buying anything just a stroll through the market will be interesting. Ensure you have cash on you should you decide on making purchases - smaller shops accept only cash.
Shopping ,"This place is the place to shop, lots of good deals and the variety of merchandise available are endless. One can find anything that you need from Korea on the street vendors and the side stores. There's also an underground shopping area for specialty items and Imported merchandise. There are Daytime and Nighttime Vendors on the streets of Namdaemun market. "
Loved shopping at Namdaemun market ,"We visited this market few times. So much to see, shop and buy. The market has practically everything. We loved bargaining and shopping for socks. Do not miss the delicious deep fried honey/vegetables buns located at gate 2. There's always a long queue for these buns.When there, go to Gonggam restaurant for their extremely delicious BBQ meats. Lunch deal is extremely worth it"
A must visit,"It is the largest traditional market in Korea with shops selling various products. Amazing vibrant place. It's where a local Korea shop and tourist purchase cheap goods. It's a great place to immerse yourself with the local culture. It's a very expansive place to truly explore and get lost in the many nook and crannies and the different alleys. It is also a great place to have traditional Korean dishes and street food vendors at an affordable price. If there is a long line at a food stall, it usually is worth it. Nearest Subway Line 4 Namdaemun Station Exit 5. The market is even open overnight from 11p - 4am. "
Don't miss if you visiting Seoul,Great shopping street Good price for goods one time visit not enough you will come again and again thanks you
The market for photographers.,"On Namdaemun market, the part next to Namdaemun gate, there are some shops with photographic equipment. They have a lot of stuff, new and used. Many of the shops are on the main street but do not forget to go to the street behind, there are 3-4 shops visible from the backstreet in a old low building. If you enter the building you will see that it is kind of a market inside and there are may more photographic shops inside. So for photographers who are hunting for something old or new in Seoul this is the place to visit. In other terms the market is just one of many old type markets in Seoul and every visitor should visit at least one of those markets for the experience and fun of it."
Great market,This is an old market that's very famous in Seoul for cheap goods and eats. You'll find almost anything here. It's close to the center Myeongdong. Be prepared to bargain you might get things even cheaper.
Local market,Just textiles and street food as far as I could see. Not sure if it was that interesting to visit if you've seen similar markets in other countries.
Must visit market,We stay at Itaewon.Took the 421 bus line towards Seoul station.Namdaemun bus stop just after Seoul station.Different than Myeong-dong.Should visit to experience it.
lively market,"This market is rather immense and a little exploration at street level, in the back alleys, upstairs in the indoor shopping centers, and even underground reveals an extensive array of anything from traditional Korean dining ware, cooking supplies, fresh flowers, imported foodstuffs, clothing, souvenirs, bedding, restaurants, snack stalls, noodle alleys, and many other treats. There are a few major thoroughfares, but small alleys tucked away throughout the entire market make a visit even more of a delight. Almost all vendors can communicate in Mandarin Chinese, Japanese, and English. "
Huge,Huge market with everything. The same things at day and night market. A must If you are turist. One of the largest 
Great market,"It is a great marked located near the hotel we were staying at.They had street food and some restaurants in the alleyways.The market had everything from socks to pans and souvenirs.It opens in the morning, and closes around 10 o clock."
very big area with many wholesale market,not far from central. this is one big area with many wholesale market for all types of products. there is also a night market. you need 1 full day to explore all the markets. must visit for tourist.
Nice street to walk and have a look.,"Large market area withmany side streets selling- clothes, t-shirts, ladies bags, fashion accessories etc. Interesting to have a look but nothing much.Don't worry about visiting this place if you have limited time. Just another market.Myeongdong street food market is more interesting."
Traditional wholesale market ,"We headed here as soon as we arrived Seoul. We expected more after read the article from the guidebook. It is more wholesale market , from accessories, stationary to clothing. The price can be negotiated in some shops, so try to do first. The food stalls offer foods to the tourists so, do not expect the good flavor or reasonable price! "
Must see,"If in Seoul you will most likely end up at this bustling, interesting and colourful place. It's great if you like ally ways, street food and bargains. Easy to get to and from on the subway. I liked this market as the vendors don't hassle you to buy as much as they do in some other Asian markets. I really enjoyed my afternoon here"
Getting absorbed in local shopping,"A whole district devoted as a market. All sorts of things could be bought at the market. I did enjoy the street food. I can across some great dumpling places to eat on the street. Whilst people couldn't speak English they were very friendly. If you didn't like the market there were some up market department stores in the same vicinity, so lots of choices.You get a good feel for the local culture when you go to markets. These are everyday markets for people."
Cheap price market,You can find amost everything here. The best product are for souvenirs and kids clothing. Hanbok for kids sale for 30.000won (quite expensive but worthed). You can also find traditional snacks from Korea. Easy access with subway or bus. 
Average market,A few minutes walk from Hoehyeon station. This market is closed on Sunday's and when it rains. We unfortunately chose to go on Sunday and it also started to rain. Lots of street vendors still open but didn't really see anything appealing and left empty handed. Would visit again in hope for a better experience
A must see of Seoul! So tasty!,"Not to be missed is the Namdaemun Market, located next to the Great South Gate, after which it is named. It's the oldest and largest market in South Korea, dates back to 1414.It sells everything from housewares and fabrics to flowers and stationery. The multi-storey buildings offer thousands of shops, as well as endless numbers of street-vendor stalls and great food stalls to refresh and eat tasty local snacks!"
Fairly Low Scale - Maybe Good For Cheap Trinkets,"This market was directly across from our hotel. We walked a couple of blocks looking at the shops and carts but was not impressed. Maybe if we were interested in low scale trinkets, it would have been worth it. They all sold the same stuff also. We ended up heading to Myeong-Dong market which ended being better. Not Recommended.(To Travel Is To Live)"
Great spot for streetfood ,"I went there for a couple of hours, it was very hot though, but i enjoyed a lot of very delicious streetfood and people watching. I guess it is paradise once it is a bit colder:-) definitely a must see! "
For hardcore shoppers ,More of a local market with a few tourist shops. Not very photogenic in my opinion and we did not stop for long.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.
A great place to stuff your face.,"This market was great fun. I was a little bit disappointed by the variety of food you could eat - there only seemed to be pancakes, dumplings, bibimbap and a few stalls with dog (no - I definitely didn't try this). It is a lively place, any time of day, and you leave full. What more could you want?"
"Very crowed on Saturday, a lot of Korean local people","I am so surprise with a number of people in this market both for local and tourist, a long street foods and stores you can by and find anythings in this market, it is also has a relatively cheap fashion items mall in the area.."
Cheemak - Chicken and Beer,"Best deep fried chicken ever. Tasty, crisp and not greasy. Also sticky chicken, hot and spicy. Try with a cold beer or two. Fabulous street food, to die for."
"Nice, interesting market","I always visited this market every time I came to Seoul. We can find lots of various things here: souvenirs, clothes, socks, hats/caps, umbrellas, bags, luggage, ginsengs, fruits, chocolates, home decorations, cosmetics, local food, etc etc. And, in many shops, you can bargain the price. I always had fun strolling along this market, having checked all the things, blending in with the local people and tasting the local food. For me, this market is a must visit market when I visit Seoul. :)"
A buzz,"We strolled the Namdaemun Markets yesterday and took in a little Korean culture.Plenty of bargains to be had, not sure on the quality. Lots of local foods to sample as you walk the many streets.An easy walk and worth the visit."
Traditional market,"It's a traditional market, you can find a lot of snacks, souvenirs, clothes, etc. You can get cheaper price for wholesale."
Shopping for the elderly ,A huge market with a mix of items from pots to shoes to clothes to souvenirs and foodstuff.Style is more suited for the elderly though there are a few stalls selling kids clothing and accessories. There's also a huge wholesale building selling women accessories but they are truly wholesale and wouldn't accept any purchases less than 10 pcs.
Interesting ,There are so many things to see and eat in the market. Can spend whole day around. The tourist community lounge is a must visit to try traditional Korean hanbok for free photo session. Staff are so nice and even tidy hair for better look. All tourist information staff are so good and know the market so well for what you after. Food or varieties of goods. It just could be hot in summer days as mostly outdoor and wet if rains.
Nice market for odds and sods,A nice market to visit when staying near the Namdaemun Gate area. Good for a kimchi fried Pattie. There is a stall near the south entrance of the market where there are always queues of people during and after work. They sell good fried stuff. Loads of places to eat and buy clothes here. If you are after a beer on the way back to your hotel there is a seven eleven or across the road is a G25 store which also sell reasonably priced good wine. Enjoy ❤️
Shopping in Namdaemun Market,"We went here on day#2 our holiday in Seoul.so many stuff people sell here; fashion like a tee shirt,pants,socks,shoes,hats,jackets,etc.there're a mini restaurants with cheap price offer many korean foods and it's deliciuous.At the middle along Namdaemun street there's Tourist information,police office,and the shops which sell cosmetics such as : Aritaum,Ettude,Nature Republic,etc.This market open at 9am and close at 9pm.dont worry you will get free wifi here.You can reach Namdaemun market bu subway,get off at Heoyeon Station (Namdaemun Station) exit 5."
Shopping,This market is gold if you like to shop and eat. Lots of thing to buy....make sure you visit the hidden malls there. The entrance is sometimes hard to find but it's worth it you try to find them. Go in the afternnon!
Small shops selling tourist items,Came to pay a visit since near my hotel. Not much things to buy and have small street food stores like myeondong too.
Must visit for souvenirs!,"I bought shirts for souvenirs for 10.000KRW/3shirts and They gave me 1 bonus shirt because I bought 9 shirts. Many craft store there. It was near from HOEHYON station, just have to walk for a minute and tada you're arrived! So many entry gate, so you dont have to lookup where you want to begin shop. Just enter and you will lost end up buying everyting. Ah one more thing, they also have cosmetics stall if you missed not to visit myeongdong. "
Always interesting ,"We come here everytime we visit Korea because our interests change as our kids get older. No longer need the tourist trinkets, it is now for the clothes and accessories. Our family loves the variety these markets bring."
Whole day Market,"5 to 10 mins walk from MRT station. Best about it is I do not need to wake up early, yet still gets to eat and shop. Food here is traditional, cheap and really niceeee!!! Certain stores you can just seat in to enjoy your food. I vote for a twist donut store run by an elderly. She's alone, so customer needs to help to coat the fried donut with sugar and drop their money in the boxes. There's also a big hand made noodle store, the stock was light and nice. Customer can seat in to enjoy their food with complimentary kimchi. There's also fried food stores available. People there are friendly and nice. Worth going!!!"
Well worth the trip!,"Yesterday we visited Namdaemun Market. Filled with 10,000 stalls and stores with a footfall of 0.4 million visitors a day, this is a 24 hour, 365 day hub-bub of frenetic activity. Reputed as the largest market anywhere in Asia the array of goods was mindblowing. Situated in central Seoul it took us a subway trip of 17 stations to get there but it was most definitely worth it. The atmosphere was alive with sights, sounds and smells that just assault all of your senses at once from the food alleys and food porters with names like “chopped noodle street”, to workshops of jewellery makers with row after row of them beavering away at goods for export. Divided into specific sections the market is easy to negotiate but of course being Korea it also sprawls underground and reaches skyward into the high rise buildings. It would be impossible to absorb the experience in one day. We stopped for a breather in the shade, drinking iced peach and lemon teas in the afternoon whilst watching food vendors process endless queues of locals with street food for prices of just 70p per portion. Needless to say we came away reasonably laden with goods, basking in the warm glow of having negotiated some decent bartering (or so we think)!! No photos from the market itself I’m afraid, I could never have got a clear shot for most of the day. Although, in my opinion it doesn’t have the mysticism and beguiling romance of the African Souks it most definitely nails it on the sheer expanse of goods available. A day well spent. "
Wow,"Be prepared for an assault to the senses. Frantic market. Packed, noisy, surprising. A must see if in Seoul."
Traditional Market in Seoul,I went here alone to buy some souvenirs. Lots of bargains everywhere and its quite cheap too! It's the largest market in Korea I also got lost strolling around. Haha
Hassle-free market,"Be aware, that wholesale markets are on the outskirts of this market. We enjoyed browsing whilst being ignored, but then learnt we couldn't buy just '1' thing.The market itself was OK - I guess it depends what you're looking for.Our highlight was a particular food that I don't know the name of. It was a fried pancake/dumpling that had been filled with carrot, noodles, onion, etc. Ohhh....so delicious. It was food cart."
Market with everything,Huge market where you can bargain. Hoehyeon subway station 425 on the number 4 blue line. Many street food carts to enjoy. One drawback is the huge crowds.
Great buys,"If you are looking to send some souvenirs/decorations home, this is the perfect place to buy them at. You can find everything at an amazing price compared to other places in korea. Recommend 10/10 for these types of buys."
Wholesale market selling daily items,"More than 10,000 small shops located in here doing wholesale of items like socks, kitchenware etc. I think it is good for housewife to search for cheap household items here but not quite sure what to buy for tourists. "
Korean made goods,"This market was only ten minutes walk from Fraser place hotel. They sold Korean made tshirts, 3 for approx $12 Aud, great value, quality good and they've washed well.Lots of souvenir shops and great prices.Guards from the sungnyemun gate, also close by, parade through here in the afternoon then stand around for tourists to take photos of and with them.Also a small section of fresh produce which was great, strawberries so cheap but oh so sweet!"
Delicious secret alley and pure Korean culture,"This market offers the whole array of korean culture, save the gorgeous landscapes outside Seoul. People are so kind and many speak english.There is a a narrow alley way of very typical korean cuisine that gives you a perfect example of their typical foods and overpopulation in a small land problem. An experiance one from a spacey country never forgets! (Its close to the chiken man, or otherwordly, flashy chicken restaurant)."
Nice street side shopping ,"One of many street side shopping options is Seoul. You get anything and everything you want...From souveniers to clothes to bags etc . Bargaining options vary. Most places were fixed pricing , you can probably do a little bit of bargaining but not much. However there were other stores where you felt like bargaining a lot ( some bag stores etc) .most of the stuff is made in China like in all countries now. So you can compare prices vs India and then decide what to buy and what not . "
A whole lot of fun!,This market area was near our hotel so we took a stroll through it. What fun! They sell lots of different things. It is a very colorful place. Make sure to stop for some steaming hot dumplings or at one of the other food carts.
A very nice traditional market,"Have been there a few times. I enjoyed the cheap and traditional stuff that can buy at there. Especially the traditional snacks, they usually sell cheaper outsider the road, but not in the market. And the category of the market is various, so worth spending time to explore this traditional market"
Nothing here during dinner hours,"Came here during dinner time (6pm), and there was nothing available! The stalls selling clothes and gifts were either closed or packing up. And the supposed ""food alley"" was empty. Was there on a weekday."
Great place to shop,This is great place to shop similar to Hong Kong woman street. This place bigger then woman street you must have enough energy to walk. Must go area in seoul. 
Find a way to fit this into your schedule ,"Absolutely eye opening and breath taking as a foodie. I live in Singapore, where they practically own the word ""Hawker Centre, but this place is another level. You have to be a little adventurous, however there are some really good eats in here!! I'm highly recommending any of the Kimichi Pancake and Sausage Patty stalls... don't be worried about language, I found it easy ordering and each stall specializes in their own dish, so you can pretty much see what you're ordering... just point and smile!! Loved this place!!"
Good fun - good food - and clothes at great value,"We visited the Gwangjang Market two days earlier, which was pretty fun. But this market here is better on every aspect.It is quite a huge area and you might get lost or confused between all the lanes and stalls, even though with a map.The market has sections. Some for jewelery, some for clothes, food, kitchenware and much more. There are one or two bigger streets leading through the bustling and colorful market. Most parts are outside, some sections covered and some parts of it - especially the jewelery - are indoors. Getting a bit lost and wander the lanes are part of the fun. You might find some stuff you want....and never even knew it before. We enjoyed the food here. There is one big food lane and then there are a good number of small stalls and carts selling food. We enjoyed getting a small snack here, another one there....good fun!What we liked best here was the huge selection of clothes. Nice loungewear for low prices and some nice spring/summer dresses. It's not all of great quality, but the prices are really low. Some stalls have fixed prices (like all for 10$). Many have similar products and similar prices, but if time permitted you still might get it cheaper around the next corner. We bought lots of clothes and and turned out to be not bad at all even after a bunch of laundries.We came back two days later to get some more clothes. It's a fantastic market, so bright, lively and colorful. On sundays there is a bit less action and the stalls close a bit earlier, some are even closed fully.So, if you have limited time and only wanna visit one market in Seoul: make it this one!Wanna know more about me and my trips? Check my profile."
Cheap products on a fun street ,"This is a fun place to visit, but only to visit. There is nothing really of offer here except cheap knock offs and bad quality clothing. Rude shoppers ( yet it seem Koreans are just rude period ) still fun to walk through "
EVERYTHING YOU NEED,"This is a famous market within Mapo gu Seoul South Korea where everything you need can be found. It is easily accessible and the sellers are very friendly. You can get a discount with only a smile. The list of things available in the market is endless but you can find both modern, classical and tradiational Korean stuff. Foreigners are everywhere and may be of help. Feel free to ask for help if the need arises because the market is like a global gathering. Go explore Mapo gu..."
"Great market, nice atmosphere, guards!","After fruitlessly looking around Dongdaemun market area for clothes (found lots of fabric for sale but few clothes) we headed to Namdaemun and had a great experience. There's lots of jewellery, hair clasps, clothes and bags. I bought some cheap dolsot bowls too. Best of all the guards from Deoksugung end their 'patrol' here after the changing of the guard ceremony at Deoksugung palace (best to follow them from the palace, we just bumped into them). It was very striking to hear their distinctive musicians in unfamiliar surroundings."
Go there,A real local everyday coulerfull market. You may see locsl people at there dayly live. It is not for tourists just for locals
huge market,"Great to walk around and try some local street food. Busy, vibrant and great vibe. Loved all the different goods (yes, lots of knock offs), especially, liked all the cosmetics stores."
It's a big market,"If you got time, you may stroll around the area. Good place for cheap shopping. Fashion wise, it cater older customer I think. I got some Korean cutlery here, but actually Daiso have it cheapest "
You might get lost in here but worth it!,"A place to visit although there are areas that are very steep. This place sells mostly clothes which was not my primary interest. There are also seaweed souvenirs, cute plastic bags, stationary shops, local food produce and even house hold use stuff.They sell seaweed in a big bulk and some shops may be more expensive than others so remember to negotiate. There is also tourist information area which is great. They are very helpful and can direct you to the right place. Manage to buy some fresh korean ginseng there and also had early lunch in a barbecue eatery."
Underground Shopping ,What a surprise. Looks like you are entering a subway but it's shopping! From clothing to sunglasses and art. Go early. Closes at 6:30. 
Not A Night Market,"First time i go to Namdaemun market, just a view of them still open. That's because already 9.00 PM (Korean Time) but second time i go there, all of them open, and if you travellers want buy gift for your friends or family this is the right place to go. In here you can buy traditional gift too same like at insadong with cheaper price."
Sign up with d Tourist Office to tour d Market,"Superb touring n informative experience shared by d two (2) staff.We were guided to d South Palace, location of d first (1st) market place, d antique buildings which was built with beautiful flowers carved from d ceiling (Standard Chartered Building) and d Korean Bank.Also the location of d Merchant's Building whereby previously it was used to b notorious for illegal activities."
Enjoyed visiting a few times,"I stayed near Hoehyeon Station so I was a few minutes walking distance from Namdaemun Market. This place has tons of vendors selling a wide variety of items as well as street food and restaurants. Don't forget to bring cash when you go to the markets. I think this is a must if you visit Seoul, but Dongdaemun Market is a little better/bigger IMHO."
Great shopping malls,"Namdaemun offers a wide range of goods and services. You will 3 hours to walk around. Notable specialty shops were florists, jewellery, optical shops selling sun glasses and prescription glasses at very good prices while you wait. Also bags, clothings and accessories. Quite a few traditional Korean foods stalls just in case you are hungry. "
Great market! ,"From young to old, boys to man to the only woman, we all love this market. Things to buy, food to eat (and not ex!) and warm benches to keep u warm! Only regret is too little time! "
Korea adventure,"I love shopping and this is the Mecca of shopping. If you want good prices for your stuff then this is it. Everything is in this place. And when you get hungry just turn around and food stalls are everywhere. From bags to shoes to clothes to toys, everything is sold here. "
Decent shopping and activities,"Went here on the first day, thought shopping was pretty good until I went to Hongdae which beats this place hands down. Still worth a visit though, especially since it's near the palaces. Also, check out the free hanbok rental place nearby at the customer info centre - super fun to play dress up with all the hanboks available."
Super nice,I was actually not on my way to the market. I was seeing the South Gate and were on the way to Insadong by foot when I found my self at the beginning of the market close to the South Gate so I took a stroll around since I was here. There is a lot of things here and I guess you can walk around for hours and hours. I found some really nice things here to bring home as gifts. There are many side streets with millions of things. I was here once in 2006 and I can not say the street have changed much. Love it. There is a lot of snack food here as well... 
Had higher expectations ,I thought this would offer more than it did and found it hard to find the area with mens clothing and other things I was shopping for. There are plenty of markets in Seoul that all sell the same stuff but are smaller and easier to navigate 
Good place to shopping,"Much korean souvenir,kosmetik(aritaum shop),street food,ginseng.it's a cheaper shop than myeongdong.much of the seller can spaek chinesse.it's star from 10.00am and much close at 10.00pm.not open 24 hour"
Heaven for souvenirs ,Namdaemun is heaven for souvenirs.... side by side there are selling various souvenirs... price are slightly different .. if u bargain u can have a better price... and make sure to asked for discount.. if u are lucky u can have a huge discount... be friendly and learn hangul little bit to hugle the price.... 
Nothing much ,"Not as exciting as I expected it to be. Certain items are cheap while some are not, especially if you are a tourist. Definitely need bargaining skills if u must shop here. Other than that I would give it a pass"
