BEAUTY PRODUCTS AREA,If you wanna shop for alot of beauty products. You must visit the place. Very good deals in the area. You will be amazed.
Foodtrip at Myeongdong,Visit to Korea won’t be complete without experiencing the Mouth-watering streetfoods at Myeongdong. It is really a must! Though some of the items to buy here aside from foods are a bit pricey compared to those stalls at subway stations. 
Sightseeing,"Didnt really looked through the whole of Myeongdong or the Romantic Market nearby, more of just walked by. Quite afew places to shop and eat thought street snacks arent that many."
Happening street at Chuncheon,It’s like a mini Myeongdong shopping district at Chuncheon but with a fraction of the shops selling face masks. It’s still quite happening and many things to see and street food to try. 
Love the shopping in this area,"There are tons of shops selling facial and skin care product. Street food are interesting as well. Love the cheese lobster/scallop and croissant fish. There’s a lot of repeated stores around, if u miss purchasing something, similar stores are just around the corner. "
Sale sale sale sale,"Girls would love it, boys also...lots of food, drinks, street food and beauty shops. Have a bad exp with the shop lady. They kinda rude tho but not all of them."
The place to shop!,"This is the place to shop for beauty and fashion products! Many eateries along the walking street and also its juz nxt to the famous chuncheon dakgalbi street! There is alot of sportswear brand and beauty brands along this street and a few fashionwear shops. One shop in particular i like was 103 style, located right at the entrance of the street, just opposite of olive Young. The clothes there are of pretty gd quality and the price is reasonable too! A really nice place to shop and spend time in Chuncheon. As compared to Myeongdong in seoul, chuncheon is less chaotic and crowded, thats wat I enjoyed most, even though the options are not as good, i enjoyed it being less crowded. "
family visit,this is a good place for shopping or just leasurely tour. hard to resist bargain with plenty to buy and take home.
A mini version of Seoul Myeondong,"A small street with lots of shops selling from apparels, shoes to cosmetics and toys. It resembles the Myeondong but a mini version though. Things are almost the same as what you can get in Seoul. The only difference is, it is less crowded compared to Seoul Myeondong. It makes it easier to shop and walk around."
Only place in Chuncheon open after dusk,Really the only place to shot and dine after dusk in Chuncheon...lots of good restaurants...not so much shopping options...
Amazing!,"We love Myeongdong Market so much that we often ended up there at night during our 6 day trip to Seoul. you'll have a fill of almost everything there - food, shopping, culture, etc. And since it closes late, you'll have more time to do everything in one go. We particularly love going there at night when all the lights of every establishment is on and you get a fiesta feeling every single night. Weekends are best because more stalls of food and fashion and gadgets suddenly adorn the already narrow alleyway giving the whole place a more festive feel. If you're lucky you might even score some good bargains. Definitely worth a visit!"
i love the shops..,I love roaming around this place during nights because there are plenty of shops and streets foods to choose to.
Delicious,Cheesy Dalkkalbi is a must!! It is spicy and cheesyl and delicious!! Very great service as well. I went to the restaurant with the picture of a cow on the outside. It was great.
Shopping and meal,Well should say a must visit place if you in Seoul. A lot of shops for mask and street food. Prices not cheap which is normal if there are tourists 
Not worth to visit,Many shops are closed and nothing to see. I feel like visited a country side but not a Crowded Myeongdong street.
"Perfectly fine, but not a 'must see'","The 'downtown; of Chuncheon with above and below ground shopping and restaurants. Nothing really unique, but it is convenient. Mostly known brand shops, with expected prices. Some nice restaurants, but again nothing worth going out of your way for. There are traditional markets nearby that have a lot more 'character' or 'local flavor' that would be more interesting."
many shops both on the street and undergroung,"There is a walking street about 1km , but a much much longer shopping mall underground, we cannot finished walking before it is closed. We parked my car in a building very close by and there is another bigger parking underground along the street, no need to worry parking, the cost is4500won. It is a good shopping place."
for shopping lovers!!!,"full with cosmetics and street food!!!...this is the place for u to try all the korean street food, korean cosmetics and korean delight.....but my advised here, spend ur money more on food coz this is where u have a taste of extraordinary meal!!!..."
not bad,"sometimes you expect that this place gonna be awesome like myeongdong in seoul. but it not that much, but ok there are any famous brand here, the price also cheap. this place is reccomended for you if come to chuncheon"
Street,"Food are good, the things are still expensive. Walked around and eat all kind of food. Love the food. Should not miss this place whenever ure in Seoul"
A must to visit and worth it,"Nothing short of excitement in shopping spree and local eateries. Day and night has its own charms. Further away from the centre, most restaurants offer the real local taste cuisine with prices much cheaper. "
A short shopping street,"It is a popular shopping street that is full of famous brand name of products and restaurants.. However, not so long. To have a walking in this street is better staying at hotel at night."
for shopaholics spree,"if you want enjoy shopping to different brands and also with good quality, you can shop at Myeongdong plus there are a various beauty shops where you can shop for your beauty regimen."
Shopping district with lots to choose from and many restaurants,This area is great for those who only have a few days to spend in Chuncheon. There are many restaurants to choose from including a McDonalds and local favorites dak galbi. I recommend skipping fast food and sitting down for some amazing Korean bbq spicy chicken. It's unforgettable. The shopping area also has a movie theater and several street vendors. Plan on spending a few hours here at least.
Doesn't come any close to Seoul for food and shopping,"There's nothing bad about Chuncheon Myeongdong per se, it's probably very fun for Chuncheon residents, with many restaurants, franchised stores and what not, but as a tourist, it has little to offer. Living in Seoul, I have many more dining and shopping options near my home, Myeongdong really doesn't warrant a visit to Chuncheon by itself. Luckily, the city has other things to offer as well"
Great Place for Shopping~,"Streets with lots of shops from skin care to clothes and good food! You can find wide range of Korean brand skin care here, and there are around every corner of every street! "
"Souvenirs, Souvenirs!","When you ""TOURIST"" need some souvenir? but don't want something expensive? but still want something unique? this is the place for you when u need some keychain,korean doll, korean unique crafting, and many other items. But be careful, this place have some really bad and tricky price for you as tourist, be careful because some of the seller will be tricky and give u expensive price if you are not able to bargain well. so MAKE SURE to always bargain to about 20-30% of the price, if that didn't work out just use the ""walk out"" strategy, if the seller didn't make you to stay, then you can conclude the real price from your bargaining price. Last but not least, this place is good for you for shopping, but not much to see or unique out here. :D"
I am glad it exists!,"It is like a mini Seoul Myeongdong was placed in Chuncheon. Very easy to get to - once you exit Chuncheon train and subway station, you will find many taxi's waiting outside. Tell the taxi driver ""myeongdong"" and he will take you there. It is less than 5 minutes taxi ride away. You could walk from the station, and I can image it would take about 25-30 minutes walking. Chuncheon Myeongdong Street is quite small, but you can find there most things. There are restaurants (both western and korean) and make up stores, hair salons, clothes store, a big daiso, art box, phone places and more. There are vendors with street food, and on my last visit just a week ago, I tried those little freshly made tiny peanut waffles with a peanut inside and it was so great. I think I paid 2000 won for a bag of them. All in all, I am glad it exists, on this side of Korea."
Depressing,"You really could be anywhere in the world. This is just a succession of branded franchise stores and fast food restaurants. It's a real shame, because the it's a nice space and it is pedestrianised. Go to the market at the end of the street for more of a traditional experience. I'd especially recommend going to Fat Mama's Fruit Shop for some real Korean hospitality. If you want bargains, go to the underground market."
Shop and Dine,Good mixture of low to mid end products. Food is good but have to improve on floor cleanliness within the eateries. Oily and sticky.
"Great food, not much to see.","As a fan of Chuncheon's famous Dakgalbi, I enjoyed visiting the alleyway in search for a good meal. I visited two restaurants now and found them both to be very satisfying. They were both restaurants that were not packed with customers as they were not featured on Korean TV. My only complaint is that all of the restaurants pretty much sell the same two things: Dakgalbi and Makguksu. Very little distinguishing factors, little attention to decor, and constant references to Korean TV shows unfortunately detracts from the experience. However, if you want to try Chuncheon Dalkalbi, this is the place to visit. "
We Attended Mass at the Cathedral,"We attended mass at the Cathedral and it's our first time in Korea. I was surprised that the cathedral was full. And they kept the veil which I thought was really a nice tradition! After the mass, we went down to Myeongdong Street and it was crowded of course. People lined up in one restaurant so it must be good food. We didn't want to line up. We saw some street food like various sweet potatoes and squid, etc. So we tried the different sweet potatoes. They were good! Lots of stores and restaurants but we just felt like walking around. We found out Namdaemun Market was just walking distance and we decided to proceed there since there's this jacket that caught our eye and we want to buy it this time."
