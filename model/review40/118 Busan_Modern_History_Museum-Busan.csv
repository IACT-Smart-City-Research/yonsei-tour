Empty and not really intresting.,"From the first sentence, when you are entering this Museum until the last one when you are leaving, almost everything is related to put the blame on Japan. I was wondering if i was in a museum or the the propaganda room of a nationalist party. Instead of focusing only on Japan, why this museum doesnt value the people from Busan and the incredible job they have done to make it one of the best cities i ever visted? Im not clearing japanese guilt in the korea occupation but I'm sure there's a lot to say and to learn about busan people and their achievement but this museum wont show it instead they will focus on blaming Japanese, a bit sad."
Fascinating look at the history of Busan and Japan,"A rare insight into the history of Japan and Korea, very worth the time. Located right next to Yongdusan Park where one can climb the Busan tower and also very close to Gukje and Jagalchi markets, and BIFF square. "
An introduction to Korean history,"This is a small museum which is free to enter. It outlines Korean history under the Japanese and following independence, with a small exhibition about relations with America."
To understand what the Korean people endured from the Japanese,this shows how the Korean people were molested by the japanese invaders that by the way never appologized or financialy compensated ....
History,Perfect for a family outing or if you want to know the history of busan. It is very interesting. It is also easily done in 1hr. 
Good introduction ,Visited as wanted to know more about the Korean War. This place gave quite a good introduction but we didnâ€™t find it too detailed. Also talked about the Joseon period which was interesting. 
Small but useful intro to history of Busan,"Housed in a historic building, this museum is fairly small but the introductory movie (13 min) is a good overview of the history of Busan. Not that much to see really, worth a visit only if you are in the vicinity "
very informative museum,intriguing way of showing the history of busan south koreaeasy access for tourist to enterinformative museum
A Quick and Eye-Opening Day at the Museum,A great place for history geeks. Their exhibits add layers of context to the Busan you're seeing and interacting in/with now.
Quaint little museum,Nice little museum near my hotel. Popped in for about 15 minutes and worth the trip if you're in the area and don't know much about Korean history. If you're not in the area then I think Wikipedia would cover everything here. The exhibit wasn't that exciting
excellent Japanese occupation period,This museum which has excellent English descriptions shows the Korean view of the Japanese occupation of the early 20th century/. It was a fascinating and informative counterpoint to the Japanese version we had seen earlier in our travels.
"That was quite the ""museum""","The museum focuses on the Japanese occupation of Busan. So far a very valid subject, however the whiny way they showed their point of view really made me question the quality of their artifacts. Once a museum actually shows me a video where a lady is actually in tears telling me how I should feel about the occupation - I no longer consider it as a museum. "
Modern Korea in a nutshell,"Modern Korea in a nutshell, take an afternoon to explore the history of war, peace, modern life. Korea's place in the world, with its neighbours a real eye opener. Korea's respect for their citizens, politics & economics. Really enjoyed this place. Recreated Busan street scene, you could wander past the shop fronts to see shoes, clothes etc."
Very interesting if not a bit anti-Japanese,"One thing I never really understood (having not spent time in Korea before) is how the Korean people have been subjugated by the Japanese over the centuries.This small but interesting museum tells the modern story beginning about 1875 through today. The emphasis is on the Japanese colonial period of 1910-1945 and how the Korean people were treated as second class citizens in their own country. Now I understand the underlying animosity between the two countries today (much in the older generations).We enjoyed our visit and even the semi anti-American part! I'm glad this building could be returned to the people of Korea and used as such an interesting and informative building!The ""back in time"" street was quaint and also the street car with the video trip on board!"
Another 1-2 hour museum worth a stop,"Two floors of exhibits, with decent English/Chinese/Japanese explanations for the major topics, and brief English titles for the smaller exhibits. Would be great to have even more English descriptions, but for free, you can learn a lot with what's there.As mentioned previously, the hostility towards the previous Japanese occupiers is constantly evident: the words pillage and plunder feature heavily, and there's a movie about forced conscription and comfort women. While understandable to a degree, be ready for it."
Only visit if you have plenty of time,"OK museum and free to visit. However, it is too heavily anti-Japanese (although with justification in some ways). Most exhibits are dry but if you are staying in the area, it is worth a quick look and a few exhibits are worth a look. The Busan Museum is much better."
Lost track of time,"I didn't realise I spent at least an hour there! If it wasn't for my hunger, I could probably be there longer. The modern history and the way the history were told supported by the artifacts made me continue reading and looking at each of them one after the other. There wasn't any other visitor until just before I leave. I suppose those who love going to the museums should pay a visit. Entrance is free too! Only thing is, the direction to the museum wasn't very good. The museum itself isn't very visible like most landmarks (from where I was coming from). But do look for it if you like going to the museums. "
