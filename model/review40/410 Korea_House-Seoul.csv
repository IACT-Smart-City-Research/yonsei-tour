Amazing Koreans show,Amazing Koreans showAnd amazing traditional Korean dress with traditional music and danceI highly recommend So nice and beautiful to see this showIt's just one hour
Cultural show was impressive,"The group I was with booked a dinner and cultural show at the Korea House. I had no real expectations but was pleasantly surprised at the cultural show.  The show gave you a good insight into traditional Korean dance, music, and dress - very impressive.  The dinner was a buffet.  You could get almost any type of Korean dish you would expect.  Service and food was very good.  Staff was pleasant and friendly, especially considering I went with a very large group.  I would recommend this as a place to visit if you are in Seoul for a couple of days."
Terrible service,"We request to book a table for dinner uso y their website twice, but not response. You can check the confirmation using their site; but is always as “checking” .... they dont even bother to inform you that is full. "
"Food is good, but it’s really about the show!","I had ZERO expectations for this as a cultural show isn’t usually up my alley but someone else on our trip booked this and it ended up being a highlight from our trip. The dinner is a multi-course affair and is based on royal meals of the past. There are 3 options, and they all come with plenty of food in tasting portion sizes. It’s not your typical Korean meal that you will find in the U.S. or even most Seoul restaurants, but it was all fine. The real treat was the 1-hour long show. The story is based on a Korean folk tale and is performed by a talented group of dancers and other performers. There are also musicians that play traditional instruments to accompany the performance. Without spoiling too much, there was also a fun audience participation element that was a nice surprise. In the end, it ended up being an entertaining way to see a little bit of Korean cultural history."
Korean Showcase,"Every time I travel with my wife we always spend one night watching cultural shows that represent the culture of the country we are visiting. In Seoul I think Korea House is the place. They offer different ticket options, like show and dinner, and dinner itself has different options, depending on the food you want to eat, or the kind of service you want to have, etc.... The show is a total representation of the old Korean cultures as shown through the evolution of their music and dance. The food...I don’t really like the food, but it’s worth it if you want to try culturally or historically sourced food, and the servers are wearing period Korean attires."
"Banquet. Many courses, excellent food and service.",This is the second time I have eaten here. There were 21 of us and everyone felt it to have been very good. can't fault ti really. Traditional Korean food in an authentic setting. Beautifully presented and excellently served. thanks.
Really great show,"I have seen thus show last month, and i think it is beautiful, elegant, highly professional , done in good taste. Go and enjoy!"
Excellent! Must see,I went there with my group and we had dinner followed by the show. It was AWESOME! The food was fantastic and very refined and the show was a must-see. You don't have to understand Korean as there is a narration and the action in itself was hilarious. We had great fun and I would definitely go again if there is an opportunity to do so.
Performance only,We did not eat at Korea House. The performance was excellent. They engaged the audience and provided an interesting story.
Great food and show,"It was a fabulous experience. Our driver and guide, Paul, were very good. Paul was very knowledgeable about the city and very polite, funny, and caring. The dinner was great, and the show was fantastic, although the sound was loud. Overall the experience was very good."
The coolest lunch experience I had!,"We went for a traditional meal, we didn't see the show. We initially balked at the price, but we got the mid-priced option and it was enough food. The meal was one of the best I had on the trip, and it makes for a very photogenic spread. For our weekday lunch, we were one of three total groups, and really appreciated a lot of the traditional touches (like taking off your shoes and wearing slippers to walk to the dining table. The food was excellent as well, very fresh and unique flavors. We wanted to go back for the show, but it didn't work out for our trip."
very entertaining show,I only did the show - did not get dinner with the show.We really enjoyed the performance which showcased many of the different traditional dances & music. The performers were also entertaining and engaging - audience participation was a bonus :)
Overpriced food and ok performance,"We went for the Pansori performance and dinner last night. Most of the performance was excellent - talented musicians, dancers and performers, but there was at least 1/3 of cheesy audience participation. Tickets for this were ~£35 per person for an hour.The bigger disappointment of the night was dinner. We went for the cheapest menu and that was still ~£55 per person excluding drinks. We were expecting 9 leisurely courses of royal cuisine in an atmospheric Hanok. Instead we got 9 courses in 55 minutes like it was the chef’s hometime with multiple dishes served at once in a neon bright room with no atmosphere. The food itself was perfectly tasty, but I enjoyed my £5 meal from Gwangjang Market 10 times more.Would not recommend due to how significantly overpriced it was for the experience. "
Lovely Dinner and a Show,"This was a graceful place, so dress nicely (Sunday best / business casual). Dinner was multiple courses -- you choose how many courses ($60 - $135 per person - read the website menu). The dinner menu described in English what each item was. Lots of small tasty bites. Be sure you wear nice socks - you must take off your shoes before you enter the dining room for dinner! The show took place in a small, beautiful theater after dinner. The one we saw enacted the story of an old Korean folk tale ""Sim Cheong"". The acting was lively ,sometimes comedic and the drumming on stage was dramatic. Other musicians on the sides were playing classic Korean instruments. The costumes and dance were amazing. We enjoyed everything immensely and were lucky enough to have someone else paying the bill. "
Good show but annoying tourists,"We went to see a show here, without the dinner. The place is really beautiful. However they allow cellphone use during the performance, so as the show was starting, everyone of the tourists in front of us took out their phone and they were recording it all and taking pictures all the time, blocking our view with the phones, it was really really annoying, and they kept doing it all the show. The show was really good, good story, everyone can understand it, they don't speak a lot in Korean so you're not missing anything. It was really funny but also really connected to the Korean culture. They have live music with some really cool instruments we don't have here in the West. The show was really worth while but I think the phone thing made us enjoy it much less. If you go I would recommend going to the front row so you don't get the view blocked from the phones."
Wow!,"My family and I are visiting Seoul and booked a trip to Korea House. The trip includes dinner and a show. When arriving we were greeted by women in Hanbok. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming while giving you a sense of something g special to come. We were ushered to our table, but first we had to take off our shoes. The dinner was phenomenal-too much to list here but the food just kept coming. We had the traditional korean side dishes, but also Korea. Crepes (savory), beef tips, prime beef, a seafood salad of octopus, shrimp, scallops, radish, and lotus, a warm green tea ginseng chicken porridge, bibimbap, sweets and what can only be described as grapefruit tea. Delicious!The show is an hour long and worth every minute. The cast interacts with the audience. The dance and music took my breath away. At the end of the show all I could say was “wow!” If you get a chance while in Seoul I would highly recommend visiting Korea house"
"Amazing show, excellent cuisine ","The traditional performance is actually about this girl Sim Cheong, who is a filial girl that threw herself into the sea, exchanging for sacks of rice to offer to God in hope of restoring her blind father’s vision. Its a very popular folktale in Korea. The actors were fantastic and engaging. My family and I enjoyed the show very much.The royal cuisine that we had after the show was delicious. However i do feel that i had to eat fast as the servers tend to bring the food out very quickly, like as if they are in a hurry to close. We ordered 3 sets of the most basic menu thinking my 5 yr old daughter would enjoy the food too. Its a mistake as the food is not to her liking. The bean paste stew was spicy and hence she couldn’t eat it too!She ended up only hvg plain white rice, which i scoop out from her bimbimbap. So in case u r bringing young kids along, u may wana consider the option of sharing or preparing some simple food for the kids. Other than that, i think its a really good experience!"
Great Show. Recommend.,My husband and I just finished with the show at Korea House in Seoul at 6:30pm. We loved it! Great performance. Recommend.
Great Dinner Experience,"We made our reservation via the Korea House website. They responded in a timely manner to confirm reservation. Also, the website provided us an opportunity to view the numerous menu choices and decide upon which dinner we would like. The dinner/show were not cheap. A lot more than we have ever paid for dinner and a show. Also, we both had to choose the same dinner choice and could not make separate meal choices.We arrived late, because we walked from our hotel and had some GPS issues finding the place. However, when we provided our name, they immediately seated us in a room with other folks in it and table by ourselves.We received numerous dishes for dinner that were definitely fit for a king/queen. We ordered wine which was great. We were received a ticket during dinner for the show. The ticket had our assigned seat for the show on it.The dinner ended with a few minutes to spare to attend the show. Also, there was time to have a bathroom break.The show was superb. I have been to a number of shows, but nothing like this. It is a performance that is well worth seeing! Also, we had great seats. We met the cast of the show, after the show in the lobby."
"Amazing Show, Horrible Audience","The show was nothing short of spectacular. My wife and I enjoyed every second of it. However, there were bunch of Chinese business type travelers showed up way late and spoiled the flow of the show. Additionally, they had the balls to walk around the theater with their cellphone flashlights on! So rude and inconsiderate. Once they sat down in the middle of the show while blinding everyone with their stupid flashlights, they began looking at their phone with their bright screens. It seems like everywhere you go in the world, Chinese tourists are rude and inconsiderate. They act as if the rules don't apply to them..."
Absolutely spectacular!,"We were invited to go here by some Korean business associates. What an absolutely wonderful evening!We started of with Korean theatre and it was tremendous fun. Very easy to follow and had excellent effects.We even got to have our picture taken with the actors!After, we were taken up to a beautiful restaurant above the theatre, where we had at least a seven course meal. Great food, great experience, with great company.Definitely recommend"
Spectacular,My wife and I had our traditional Korean Wedding ceremony here and it was excellent... My family was blown away by the beautiful venue and amazing performances... Best part of the trip to Korea by far! Food was pretty good too.
Nice show!!,The food was ok but the show was very good. I loved how they interacted with the audience.I also loved that we go to explore the traditional houses that belonged to Korea House.
"Excellent show, but poor dining experience",The show: 5/5The food: 2/5Our party had dinner here prior to the show. The show was excellent --- all the drumming and dancing were great. But the food was rather poor.
Lovely show,"A lovely korean show with proffesional musicans,dancers and actors. Worth spending there a lovely rvening. "
Read the reviews. All the good ones are not for the food,"A friend stateside recommended we try the palace royal food experience. Only a few places in Seoul do it and this is one of them. Our hotel was close to this location and they made the reservation for us. I write this review trying to be fair and honest. I wanted to love this and it was my fault for not really fully reading the other reviews and understanding what they were saying. This experience was horrible. The service was so so at best, you are in this lovely traditional Korean house, yet the room we sat in felt like a cheap buffet lit with office lighting. The staff didn't explain anything and most of the girls were cold and dismissive, with an exception of two. We were rushed into making a selection for our course and just chose one at a glance (happened to be the most expensive of course!)Every single dish was basically horrible, not just bad but horrible. I don't know what palace food was like, but it lacked taste. Most of it was tasteless food that was not appetizing in any way. Yes the portions were small but I have had course meals before and been very satisfied. My biggest issue was the experience could have been amazing if the staff explained the dishes, such as when they were prepared which dynasty etc. even if we weren't a fan of the food if we felt like it was a historical meal we would have been ok spending the insane money we spent. It was insanely overpriced, and I am highly disappointed in the fact we just wasted over $200usd that could have been used for something worth while. Save your money or go to the show and skip the meal at all costs. Please trust me. "
Spellbinding,"What an amazing evening! The whole show transcends the language barrier to deliver an artful mix of technology, dance, comedy, music, and live theatre. The play was delightful with a feel good ending. The dinner we had later was very good and the service impeccable. This was well worth the time and money to see"
Excellent experience,"We three adults went to Korea House for an evening meal. We choose a set menu and thoroughly enjoyed it. Each course was beautifully presented and the waitresses who were also dressed beautifully in traditional costumes, explained what we were eating and how we should eat the dishes. We found the experience very enjoyable and something very different which we had do done before. The individual dishes are small and delicate however after 10 or so courses we left very satisfied. I see people comment about the food being expensive, however you get what you pay for. if you are looking for beautifully presented food and quality over quantity I would highly recommend this restaurant."
Great show ,"I am not sure about the food, since it suppose to be authentic. It appeared to me old fashioned and simple. Pretty much the characteristic you find in most traditional cuisines. But that might be the reason for some bad remarks on the food. Nevertheless to me quality was good and the experience was very interesting. The Sim Cheong theater was just amazing. Nowadays entertainment is difficult, because we are just to huge ensembles and perfect performance like in those shows of international scale (Blue Man Group, Riverdance or any given musical). The performance of Sim Cheong is on an enjoyable level. But above all of this I felt the heart of the ensemble. They enjoyed what they did and they were able to pass it on to the audience. Go there and open yourself to the spirit and feel the enthusiasm and the joy and the pride of the actors. "
excellent show,"Very nice show, we found it interesting and very professional. the music, specially drummers are amazing.the effects are nice, i think there are two shows per day we had the one at 18:30 and it lasts one hour, we made reservation via internet and came a little before to pay and pick up the tickets. the place was rather empty and not too many people for the show. the show itself is not fully on english but it is rather visual so everything is quite understandable.the cost per ticket is 40 euro."
"Enjoyable show, only one hour and quite expensive",The show tells a story through dance and music. Used several nice effects.Included some audience participation which was not needed and made me cringe.It only lasts one hour and after the show you can have your photo taken with the performers. We went on a Sunday at 18.30 and the audience was small. As we left a coach load arrived for the next performance.I gave it 6 out of 10. The person I went with gave it 1.5 !
Interesting show. Bad food,"I was recently here for a business function. Our fairly large group had dinner prior to viewing the theatrical show. We had the traditional multi course Korean dinner. I couldn't tell you what the courses were, but they included various appetizers and mains. Not a single one was good. A couple were edible. I was so turned off by the food that I didn't try the dessert. Unlike the food, the show was decent. It's in a small theater and features musicians, dancers and actors. If I had to describe it I would say it was akin to a non-verbal broadway show but obviously with Korean instruments, music, and dances. It was pretty good and something different to see.Having said that, I wouldn't go back or take anyone who hasn't seen it. It just wasn't worth it. I wish I hadn't had to waste a meal here."
Exactly the cultural experience I wanted. ,"I was looking for a Korean tradition that would exposed me to the various forms of Korea performing arts. I found it exactly here at Korea House. This is my friends and I first time in Korea. I booked only the performance a few days before arriving and received a confirmation right the next day. However, I mistaken the day of my reservation and came a day early. The ticketing ladies were so generous to switch my reservation for me. One of them also spoke good English. The performance was for 1 hour and KW50,000 (~$45) and the story line was easy to follow. The performance was a combination of performing arts, live music, and projections. The plot remained relatively simple and as a foreigner language wasn't an issue in following the story. All in all, truly excellent. Highly highly recommended. "
Don't eat here!,We came here for dinner during our vacation in Seoul. we tried the basic prefix menu which costs around $60/person. The price does NOT meet the taste plus the portion was too small. I won't recommend to eat here.Perhaps the show is pretty good from other viewers.
Fantastic show!!,This was the highlight of my trip to Seoul! The show here was fantastic! A must see for anyone visiting Seoul. The quality of the performance was top-notch! Worth every penny!!
Awesome show !,"After a nice imperial diner at the Korea house, we went into this relatively small theater with a bit less than 200 seats. Quickly, the show started : this was a blast from the start to the end !The show is about the story of Sim Cheong, a daughter who has sacrificed her life for her blind father to get back his sight. It mixes a lot of arts : from traditional music to acting, painting, dancing. A transparent screen on which some videos are projected helps the local and foreign spectators to follow the story between each act.I am so glad I was brought there to view such a well thought, designed and executed show.This comes at an affordable price, I will strongly advise any of my friend visiting Seoul to see the show.Bravo !"
Imperial Cuisine,"Yes, it is expensive but this is one of the few tourist friendly places where you can try the Imperial cuisine (food only the king used to eat). You will not find the Imperial cuisine in your home country.The restaurant is in an old, beautiful Hanok (traditional Korean home) and the waiters all wear traditional Korean clothes. The service is excellent. The food is delicious. You can choose to alsopay to watch traditional dancing if you want."
Beautiful place but food was bad,"Attended a reception in this place. It is a beautiful setting with lovely traditional architecture. I love the courtyard with lanterns. Unfortunately, the food was mediocre and a lot of the dishes tasted the same. It was a buffet that night with many dishes but none of them was impressive. There was no show that night. I might go back for the show but not the food."
A quite stay,"I didn't go there for an event or to taste the food, but simply to walk around at a time where no one was there (read in the morning). It is a wonderful small quiet place and you can enjoy Korean architecture without another 10 cameras being held up to capture the same image. As I visited it near the end of my trip I simply found it a great place to take a break and catch my breath without tourists pushing past me."
good quality of korean traditional performances with good food,"I've been Korea for 6days with my family, at first I was worried about the show, since my relatives are not children but teenagers, which absolutely may bore them.But it was not, show was pretty interesting and attractive and especially food was really pretty and lovely, I never seen this kind of big set of dishes while I'm traveling!FYI, the building is really beautiful!! worth to visit!I recommend Korea house for good show and food:)"
Loved This Place,"I cannot say enough about our experience. We were easily able to buy tickets online and pick them up on site. We were able to walk around a bit before the performance and enjoy the atmosphere. The traditional performance was beautifully staged, great singing, and lots of humor. If you want a night out enjoying a traditional performance pick the Korea House."
Great wedding,"Attended a lovely traditional wedding at Korea house. They provide the whole package make up , hanboks, food ,ceremony ,food, drink and entertainment - a memorable day"
Great show w 10 acts in less an hour - good swing and drums,"We booked only a day ahead and show had free space. Choose option w/o dinner. Lots of options around the Korea House. Drummers were great, so was a traditional Korean story singer. Time flew by quickly. After show opportunity to take a foto w artists."
Great Show but NOT Dinner,"This is an easy place to go to via subway. Great garden. Should definitely go for the Show which starts at 630pm for about 1 hour. We had the Royal Traditional Menu and it was a disappointment. We booked 2 so called Royal Traditional Meal from two location so we can compare. And Korea House was bad in food quality, taste and service (rushed, makes me wonder if Royalty were that rushed in having their meals). The other place is Seokparang. No show but the food was really good."
Highlight of Seoul day tour! ,"We did a family and friends day tour of Seoul and Korea house was at the end, before dinner.  Just under an hour of various korean traditional performances - dance and music. The drummers were especially amazing and everyone thoroughly enjoyed the experience. My father in law was still telling me how great this was the next day. "
Very especial traditional korean show,"Korea House is a house where you can have a special show of Korean traditional dance and drum performance. It is very good for foreigners to know about their traditions. After the show you can have a Korean traditional dinner, seated on the floor. Very nice food."
The Show was Amazing! A Must See!,"We did not get dinner reservations, but the show was amazing. It was full of beautiful costumes, music ,and dance. Exceptionally well done. The entire Korea House is beautiful with interesting things to watch and see. The employees are dressed in traditional costumes, and we were fortunate to see someone really getting married there. So beautiful!We had difficulty contacting them and so were unable to make reservations for dinner or classes during our brief stay. However based on the exceptional quality of everything else they must be amazing. We went there, purchased tickets for the show, went out for dinner and then came back.Also, they do not allow flash photography, but other photos and recordings are not prohibited. Since they do not have recordings available for purchase, videoing makes a nice moment to share with others back home. "
Traditional Dinner and Performing Art,"Went has a reluctant visitor, the building itself is great and being off the main area make a great change from the usual modern Korean structures. I was treated to a good traditional meal and then the real surprise....traditional performing art this was excellent especially the drum dance finale. Go there..."
An Awesome Dinner at Korea House ,"We did have an awesome dinner at Korea House in terms of yummy food stuff and great services. From the main menu, we did reserve for their well-known royal cuisine, which includes the signature dishes in the restaurant. They all tasted so good that we stopped to eat them up and definitely forgot our muffin top for the whole nite. Please be reminded to make a reservation in advance and enjoy with a nice experience right there"
True Traditions,"We had a great experience witnessing one of our best friends' wedding held there. Despite being close to the main road, it was very secluded and quiet. The food served was good but I had to point out, because there was another wedding after our friends', it did feel a bit rushed."
Colourful and lively dance and music,"I'd recommend the one-hour traditional dance and music performance here, made up of eight different sections: some ensemble pieces, others duets. The music, played on pipes, drums and stringed zither-like intstruments, is also very good, almost more interesting than the dance.I'm no expert on Korean culture, so I can't say how authentic the performances are, but they are certainly beautiful and well-performed. I didn't eat here, so I can't comment on the quality of the dining which is also on offer in packages with the dance performance."
Half happy half dejected ,"The staff is blank as they can't understand English, something which should addressed like the other tourist places in Seoul , food was very bad and overpriced "
Don't miss in Seoul,You can taste all of the Korean national food. So delicious and Folk Art Performance was so amazing and interesting.
Half of it was impressive while half was just ok,"traditional and well made.Shows different forms of performing arts: dance, drums, singing and playing instruments. Made up of 8 consecutive sessions, a total of 1 hour. Some of the sessions were quite impressive, while some had me wandering off. Since the theatre was mostly vacant, we were able to sit up front so was even nicer.In total- a very cultural (and a bit too pricy) way to pass an hour, but for the most part not thrilling."
Don't Fall Asleep,"The traditional dance and music which greet you at a Korea House performance are professional and beautifully choreographed. But if you have had a good dinner and then go to this performance, it is not difficult to fall asleep, not even the traditional drums will stop you. Thankfully, there is no attempt to drag the audience onto the stage, so you are safe even if you get a seat in the front row."
Not so good at all,If you stay close to Myeongdong area it`s worth going there to experience Korean Culture. I advise you not to visit Korea House unless you sleep on money.
A great deception house,The personnel is cold and gave no explanation. The food was probably one of the worth we had in seoul. And the price was expensive not to say outrageous for the quality. Go there for the shop at the entrance but not for the food.
Amazing performance,"We went there just for a performance, and did not attend the dinner (please note that to attend dinner you will need to come an hour earlier. Dinner is BEFORE the performance). It was positively awesome expirience. The performance consists of nine short numbers (dances, oral performances, traditional instruments), all of them different and fascinating. I had my doubts before booking, but local friends said it is quite authentic.Most of the seats were prebooked for group tours so we had to choose out of the first and the last row. Turned out, what is built as an ""elevated stage"" for Koreans, is quite comfortable to watch from the first row for Caucasians 170-180 cm tall =))) "
Great show but really bad food,"Korea House was on my must-do list in Seoul. In hindsight, I should have just penciled in the show and forget the food. While the show at 20.00 hrs. was spectacular, colorful and excellent value for money, the ultra-expensive dinner was a major letdown.We took a long walk from Myeongdong to get to the restaurant. Located on a side street from the main road, the restaurant is easily identifiable because it looked just like, well, a Korean house on a small slope. Once inside, you are greeted with a lady in traditional garb. Advance booking is essential especially for the show. We waited a bit then was shown to our table inside the vast and romantically illuminated compound. There were three set dinner menus to choose from and we decided on the cheapest one at W88,000 per person.The first course was some Korean snacks laid out colorfully in a round wooden bowl which got my hopes up for a memorable meal. What followed was one disaster after another. Though there were some very interesting ones like pumpkin soup with abalone and deep-fried shitake mushrooms, I could not comprehend why the set was so ridiculously pricey. The dishes were mostly bland. Portions were very small. I would have been better grabbing something to eat at fast food joint in Myeongdong before getting here. Avoid having a meal here at all costs.The performance, however, turned out to be a highlight of my trip. There were 9 shows in all, each showcasing a different set of artistic skills. There was a solo singer and beautiful fan dances, but the ones that were totally captivating were the four-person drum show and the ladies doing the standing large drum beats. Just seeing those two was enough of a great night for me. The performers were obviously seasoned professionals. The set was lovely and the mood lighting was spectacular. This is a truly unmissable show in Seoul, on a par with a Broadway musical in Times Square or West End play in London.By all means take in the show at Korea House, but be sure to have a satisfying dinner somewhere else before it."
awesome show and food,visited the house with my wife. we enjoyed the show and.the.dinner tremendously. very polite staff and most of them commend fair english to get you around. good place for first time visitor. the show and dinner together costed us about US150 each. fair charge for the food and good show.
