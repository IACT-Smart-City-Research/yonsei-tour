Nice Place for A Walk,"If you love Korean traditional houses, this is the place you should visit. Although seems quite touristic area, but it's worth to visit."
Just great to wander around.,"Lots of local people in traditional costumes. The village covers alarge artea but still gets busy, Not sure how authentic the village is however for the western toursit its still pretty cool. Its nice just to wander around and especially at night, Prices are a bit steep in some of the cafes however I guess its an expensive place to run a business. Lovely."
Just wander around!,"We spent our first day just wandering around and discovered there was a tour in English at 3pm so we joined this the second day. We were the only Brits alongside a Belgian couple, Hong Kong nationals and a German couple and a few others. The tour takes you to all the main sites and I suggest you then go back later if you like. We ended in the excellent paper factory (the only original place where they hand make the traditional hanji (made from the inner bark of ‘paper mulberry’, a tree native to Korea that grows on rocky mountainsides). Prices are incredibly reasonable so stock up here. "
Visit really worth it!!!,"The day was cold and sunny, perfect to take around! The village is not so big, so it is possible to visit in one day, including the areas around it. I needed to use the restroom and I got impressed how clean it was! Beatiful pleace for nice pictures. I strong recommend this visit!"
Beautiful traditional village,The traditional buildings are so beautiful. One will experience the relaxed pace of lifestyle with lots of good food here. The people here are friendly and nice.
Some part magic some not so good,The place was teaming by school children. It’s very touristy and some bits gimmick. The magic of Hanok was diluted with tacky tourist shops. The craft shops was fantastic. We took a free guided tour and was definitely worthwhile. 
A look into classic Korea,Very nice place with vivid atmosphere. It Is full of asian tourists. Various restaurants and coffee shops. 
Super charming area.,Great to walk around - really cute and awesome shops for food and souvenirs. Very safe and comfortable area.
From Busan to Jeonju,"A brief information:From Busan to Jeonju takes Express bus It is cheaper & faster.Cost ₩24,900 & takes direct 3 hours.The Express bus has:• Large luggage compartments• Charger plug• Spacious leg rest• Comfortable seat.The seats set in 2-1 row seaters.Please depart 10 minutes before The bus stop for 15 minutes for toilet stop."
Lovely traditional houses & buildings,"A very compact & easy to navigate traditional Hanok village. Nearly all the buildings are in the traditional style. Lots of hanoks for guest stays - makes a lovely stay if you want to sample the traditional. Lots of shops, stalls & restaurants - some traditional, some selling modern products. It is a lovely place to stroll in the evening when the crowds disperse. Avoid weekends - it's heaving & as the roads are closed - lots of people hire bikes, scooters, segways & buggies - the roads are just full of them dashing around with no regard for pedestrians.Weekdays & evenings are more relaxed. Try traditional korean food at restaurants & stalls - & korean drink. There are many cultural places within the village & ask at the tourist info for any displays/shows that may be on.If you choose to go for a hanok stay the area is very quiet at night so not a problem for sleep etc"
Tourist Attractions,Lots of restaurants and shops lining up the whole area in different streets. Recommended place of interest when you are in Jeonju.
Beautiful place,"Beautiful place, everything is green with small streams flowing and sweet little shops on the roadside. The food is wonderful and special! You can dress up in local costumes and it's a great experience! Highly recommend coming here!"
Spend here one day and one night!,"Jeonju is just unmissabile in a trip in South Korea.The Hanok Village is characteristic; seems to be back in ancient Korea!Moreover, you can find here shops, coffee houses, restaurants, etc..Jeonju is the Food Capital of South Korea: here I ate the best Bibimbap and probably had the best food experience of my whole trip in Korea.Sleeping in an hanok is a great experience too!I suggest to spend here just one day and one night: I think this is the perfect time to enjoy Jeonju and to have the best experience it can offer!"
Lively Hanok Village,"The village keeps its traditional value and there are many original sites that kept in good condition. This is one of cultural heritage of Korea that you should visit. You can ask for an English tour guide. You also can try many traditional snacks and try to wear Hanbok, or buy some souvenirs or calligraphic stuffs. In the afternoon, there is a switch of guards shift. There is also a PNB bakery opened since 1951. You can try the various pie there. I want to visit this place again if I have a chance."
Hanok Village,"The centre of Jeonju is preserved as a Hanok Village. This is a Korean style of building houses. Jeonju is the biggest and best example in the country. Just walk around the town and admire the houses, or climb up the Omak-dae hill and overlook the roofscape. Jeonju is a great place to spend a couple of days and chill. Many Koreans rent traditional costumes and wander around town taking selfies."
Mix of traditional and the new,Very beautiful buildings with a lot of street food and activities to do. You can rent traditional clothes to wear around the area as well. 
A Fully Developed View of the beginnings of the Jeoson Dynasty,"I visited here, with my son and daughter-in-law, along with her parents.getting a good look at the place where the Jeoson insurrection got started and at various aspects of the culture that took root, after the Jeoson monarchs became established."
Real fun,"We had a great time learning about Korea's history. Great place to take kids. Saw many families with elementary kids. We went in July so it was hot but everyone had such a good time. Unfortunately, due to the weather, we chose not to rent hanboks. Lots of restaurants, coffee shops and knick knack stores. Would def recommend."
Interesting to visit,Good place to try wearing hanbok and walk around the streets and photo taking. Food is definitely must try as it taste different with other city.
Tourist Trap,"Hard to describe, other than ""contrived, commercial, and crowded."" The main area is modern buildings made to look traditional, all selling the same stuff.There is an older section of town, away from the crowds, which is nice, but hardly worth a journey."
Overly commercialised and not worth the travel time,"It was a hit or miss place. Not my cup of tea. It looks more like a theme park or a foodie playground. Jeonju Hanok Village may have historical roots from the Joseon Dynasty. However, much of the present-day site bears little of it. Saved from a few scattering sites that are deemed worthy such as the Shrine and the Confucian School, the majority of the village are trendy cafes, souvenir shops and trendy food stores. Perhaps what is most saddening is that many locals and tourists alike dressed in rented hanboks posing and ‘photo-bombing’ the sites. Instead of taking the time to enjoy, smell and see the place, majority of the people were more interested in swamping the place and using the place as a photo backdrop, and often spending more time monopolising the place for the best photo shots. Photography itself is fine but when one starts hogging the space for minutes for the best shot and multiple poses, it becomes an inconsiderate act. It wasn’t all gloom making a 2-hour train journey from Seoul to Jeonju. The famous PNB bakery, which makes the best choco pie is found in the village. The white choco pie flavour is mouth-watering. The humble and ubiquitous bimbimpap dish originated from Jeonju and the village houses some of the best and flavourful bimbimpap. The Jeonbang Catholic Cathedral was a nice church. It is a symbol of Western missionary activities during the Joseon Dynasty when Christian missionary activities were suppressed. Other than that, the place is just too commercialised and lacking little historical flavour and the ‘feel of experiencing the real korea’ as the marketing claims, is definitely intangible. Definitely over-rated and a miss overall. Stick to Buchon Hanok Village in Seoul."
Love this place,"I came across this area on the internet and have not regretted planning a trip here. We most destinations are within walking distance or at the edge of this village. Plentiful of shops to rent a hanbok or a 1920’s attire from the Kdrama Mr Sunshine. As the village is mainly a square you won’t get lost walking around and in fact it would be fun to get lost here. A lot of Instagram worthy locations for those who loves to take pictures. Hanok village stay is also available which we also did. If you’re not into Hanok village stay, the village is good enough for day trips from Seoul. "
Best Place to Hangout and Wearing Hanbok,"This hanok village area is dedicated for tourist spot. Many restaurant who sell bibimbab, korean local cuisine and street food here. Also, this is a very good place to rent a hanbok (korean traditional clothes) and wearing it as you like, taking some good picture. Very crowded during the day I came because there are a lot of student group came here. But it's very peaceful at noon around 4pm."
Beautiful,"It was raining when I visited the village but was still worth the walk. Very beautiful buildings, streets and alleys. Unfortunately there were a lot of businesses that were closed but fortunately there weren’t too many tourists.Recommended on a sunny day."
Must go to place,"I loved Hanok village! So much to see and so much to do. I feel like I've been to many different places in Hanok Village, but everytime you go back you see something new. Great food, great random conversations with people, and smiles all around. I miss being in Korea"
Hardly any trashbins in this beautiful village!,The most astounding experience in this otherwise beautiful village was that there where refreshments sold everywhere but the retailers don’t allow you to use their trashbins. Public trashbins are rare so these messt spots are the result. It’s funny how retailers here don’t consider this their problem.
Great place to spend a few hours for photos.,This is a reconstructed village where you can dress up in old fashioned clothes and wander around taking selfies.Lots of eating places and souvenir shops.Great atmosphere and lots of photo opportunities.You can also hire a scooter bike.
Lovely place,"According to the stats, this plac3 gets 10m visitors a year! But when I .came it was not crowded, the weather was nice and it afforded a pleasant enough afternoon wandering around the streets, down alleys and into shops and tea and coffee houses. Not masses to do, but a nice gentle day. Particularly nice s to see people dressing up in traditional costume and walking round."
Beautiful township,"We loved this beautiful little township.Not a lot to do here, but it is a great place for pictures, culture and wandering.Food was fine, plenty of options. Not many souvenir shops though.We went by KTX from Seoul - easy to find. "
Worth Visiting,"A good bit to see and do at and near the traditional Hanok Village. 100% recommend. Easy to get to from Seoul or Camp Humphreys/Osan AFB with Waze. Not as well known to foreigners but has been recommended to me on more than one occasion by Koreans. Try bibimbap while here, a local specialty and well renowned from Jeonju."
"Quiet, sleepy historic town","Quaint place to visit.. great restaurants, tea houses to try out jeonju food. A historic sight nestled in the middle of a city"
Lovey place with amazing architecture,This place has all the historical houses of Korea. A great place for photos! There is a different vibe to it in the day and at night. It’s recommended for you to experience both. The lights at night are pretty. There is a stretch of good food as well! Do try the noodle shop called VETERAN 베테랑 ... serves excellent noodles. Also try the very famous KOROKKE there. Amazing food and scenery !! 
"Very Nice Traditional ""wealthy"" Hanok","Jeonju Hanok Village is a great place to visit. Jeonju is a historical site for more than just the village. There is also a shrine to the Joseon kings/dynasty. There is lots of history here. This Hanok displays the wealthier, more ""urban/city"" upper class historical living. The aristocratic way of historic Korean life. The actual Hanok is surrounded by traditionally-designed shops where you can rent hanboks (traditional Korean formal wear) and restaurants. Many Hanbok shops can do matching couples. They are very beautiful. The more modern part/city of Jeonju surrounds the restaurants and shops. If you're interested in seeing a more rural, ""middle/lower"" class Hanok, this is not the place. Go to the Nagan Hanok in Suncheon if you want to see that side of Korean Historical living."
Just an ordinary place to visit!,"Though it is called Hanok Village, there aren't such traditional Hanok houses; instead there are several fancy street shops and restaurants in every corner. Many young people are seen wearing Korean traditional dresses and walking on the streets and taking photos. This place is just like other commercial streets in Korea."
Beautiful large Hanok village,"We came to Jeonju to visit the Hanok village and it really was beautiful. The village is quite big with lots of little alleys and is great explore on foot. Do make sure you get off the crowded main streets and into the alleys, they are must more quiet and relaxing. We spent two nights in Jeonju but in hindsight one night would have been enough, we only really needed half a day to see the sights in and around the village."
Great visit!,"Spend the nice stroll in the village with it’s old houses, shops and restaurants. Dress up like the locals and make pictures, while walking around. Very nice"
A Day Tour Is Enough,"We took one of those foreigner-only tour buses that charge less and allow u about 5 hours to roam around the hanok village. Those 5 hours were more than enough. The hanok houses and the church were beautiful but overall, it was more like a food land with a theme. We did find the baked choco pies, bibimbap, and soybean sprout soup amazing, and I'm sure other foodies will too. For everyone else, go if you've got a lot of time (use the tour bus, it really is convenient) and skip it if you don't. You won't really be missing a lot."
Pleasant time but a kind of “Hanok fun land “,"We stayed 3 nights there, but one single day would have been enough. In the preserved Hanok village there isn’t much to do apart from shopping and eating. So we wandered around: we went to the market, we had a stroll along the river and we took the bus (with Naver map application it’s very easy to organize your itineraries and we also bought transport card you can charge) to Geumsansa temple, which was a very nice place surrounded by many hills you can hike. With the autumn foliage it should be terrific. Unfortunately for us we were a bit early in the season."
Worth a visit. ,I would recommend a 1-day trip to Jeonju Hanok Village. Stay a night to visit the night market and enjoy the local food. 
"Heart of Korean traditions, stubborn conservatism and the fidelity and royalty of Korean Sunbi(classical scholar in Ch..","Heart of Korean traditions, stubborn conservatism and the fidelity and royalty of Korean Sunbi(classical scholar in Chosun Dynasty). Because of their belief, we could preserve some historical buildings and traditions. You can see many of the remains there, not like other places in Korea. Very unique in terms of the preservation of the traditions and the efforts made by the locals. Jeonju is very special place in Chosun Dynasty.... You can find many things there. Also bunch of Korean things including staying at a Korean house.... It's like ""Old Town"" in a city of Europe, which is very rare in Korea due to many wars......"
Nice day at Jeonju Hanok Village,"Arrived before lunch and saw many people wearing hanbok. There are shops after shops with hanbok displays so if you want to wear one, you have very many options to choose from. Had bibimbap for lunch and it was awesome. I went to the place next to the 600 year old ginkgo tree. The bibimbap was only 8000 won and really worth it.The entrance fee to Gyeonggijeon Shrine was 3000 won. You can wander around the grounds and see the Royal Portrait Museum of the first king of Joseon dynasty.Just outside the gate is the Jeondong Catholic church and Pungnammun Gate is on the same road."
Best Slow City in Korea,"I will never get tired of visiting Jeonju Hanok Village over and over again. Very peaceful and has so many foods, souvenir and new things to see. Best slow city in Korea."
Family food treat ,"We took a one day trip to Jeonju and visited the Hanbok Village. Compared with the hanbok area in Seoul, Jeonju Hanbok Village has lots of great food of different varieties. It’s certainly worth the visit. We stopped by many stalls and dine at a chain porridge restaurant inside the village."
Extensive landscape of Hanok houses,Great views of the architecture. Near the outskirts are mini trails that elevate you above the Hanok village which gives you good views of the surrounding landscape. Great if you have a drone handy.Great food and desserts like skewered cheese balls & the numerous cafes with really great bingsus
Lovely area to wander and enjoy traditional korean buildings,There are many streets to wander around and enjoy the architecture of traditional Korean buildings. Some wonderful places to eat Korean food and nice coffee shops. Very interesting!
Could easily spend all day here,"I had great time exploring the Hanok Village. It was great to see and experience former cultural and traditional Korean life. The architecture of the buildings are very picturesque. It’s easy to find yourself wandering through the streets simply enjoying the architecture. The many people who work there were very nice and very approachable. I was able to ask some questions in English, while others I had to attempt in Korean. Jeonju’s Hanok Village is worth visiting."
Tourist trap,"This has become a tourist trap, the houses look cool and there's a lot to see. But you have to look for it in between the souvenir shops and far from traditional food stands.. the road seems to be used as a racing track for electric vehicles. Not really a Legid experience. But that seems to be a trend with these hannok villages."
Beautiful place!,So much culture and tradition packed into this village. Amazing architecture and incredible sights. A must see if you're in Jeonju.
Worth for a day trip from Seoul,We took KTX from Seoul to Jeonju for a day trip. The main goal was to visit the Jeonju Hanok village. We took a taxi from the station to the village; it was about a 15 min. ride only. The hanok houses have been well preserved and we loved walking inside the village. The atmosphere was good; there was not a lot of people in the morning. The old village creates a very unique scenery and bring you to a different time or period with many of the visitors dressing up and walk along side with you. Most of the visitors were young local people doing a day trip like us. Even though it seems a bit touristy with many shops selling goods; we loved it.
The Relaxed Side of Busy Korea,"Modern Korea is very busy. People always seem to be in a hurry. A welcome contrast is Hanok village. The charming traditional houses, restaurants, shops and relaxed atmosphere offer you an interesting insight of Korean life, style and tradition. You will see many people walking around in the traditional Korean clothes. Make sure you have got enough memory in your camera or phone, because virtually every step is something interesting and beautiful for a snapshot. For the lazy ones among us there are eScooters for rent for a more convenient strolling through the village.Unfortunately, there is almost no guidance in English for us foreigners. It would be good to understand the many signposts in the village and a little hint in English on the menu of the many good restaurants in the village would be extremly helpful. However, Hanok village deserves a five star rating and when you visit Korea you definetely should plan a visit there!"
An escape from busy city,"Jeonju is called a slow city by Korean people and I can see why. I live in Seoul and people there always move quickly and seem always busy while in Jeonju, especially the Hanok Village, people can enjoy the feel if traditional house and foods slowly and enjoyably. It is something that you can’t do at Seoul. Such a refreshing place to go!"
Picture perfect!,"This place is basically a huge photo opportunity. You can stop by one of the Hanbok rental shops and rent the traditional clothes for an hour. People everywhere are wearing them so it isn't embarassing at all. The area is filled with tourist shops, street food, scooters, and selfie sticks. To really get good photo opportunities though get away from the shops and go into the old palace. Then, you won't be photobombed by scooters. "
Laid back place,"This place reminds me so much of Hoi An. Just a chill place you can stroll around. When we went there, there weren't a lot of people and the weather was cool so it was really relaxing. There are a lot of restos and street food around so you'll never get hungry. Loved the ice cream place that sells Injeolmi and green tea ice cream. Never loved green tea ice cream until I had theirs. The next time I'm coming to Jeonju, will definitely come back. This place is also near the church, nambu market and Pungnammun gate."
"Traditional Korean village, come theme village.","It was lovely to discover the Jeonju Hanok Village, to view the traditional style homes and see nationals dressed up in traditional Korean costumes. There were young people everywhere having a fun day out, drinking and snacking on heavily over-packaged single use containers which was a real shame to see. Maybe we needed a guide or to stay in a hanok to get the full experience of the village. We enjoyed our stroll through, very photographic and experienced a beer slushie, beer made from fruit and served with frozen froth on top, unique.After our evening meal near-by we made our way back to the village to check out the night life, basically nonexistent, but very peaceful and beautiful. Overall, disappointed."
Not Quaint. Not Historic. More like Disney World ,"The serene pictures of hanok houses and cobble stones makes you think this is a beautiful trip back to Joseon era Korea. It is not. It is a tourist trap on steroids. Blaring music, people posing for Instagram photos everywhere, junk food sold all over. There is nothing quaint here - everything is gaudy. Not worth the trip from Seoul. "
Heavily commercialized,"We spent almost four hours to get there from Seoul on the advise of lonely planet, which is on there top 7 attractions. We were truly disappointed, the whole thing is heavily commercialised shopping street, not much “traditional “ to see. If you want to see some traditional Korean village, the one in the middle of Seoul is better than this one"
Great for photo taking!,"The buildings and structure makes it different from larger Korean cities, giving an ancient vibe. I stayed at Dalpengi Guesthouse and it was a short walk to here. I went up to Jeonju Omokdae & Imokdae Pavilion and grabbed a view across the Hanok Village. It probably look even nicer if there is snow or autumn leaves to be more colourful."
Okay for a stroll but not much for a day trip,Trains from Seoul are at weird times so it’s either a half day or a long full day. We chose half day so only managed to do lunch and a walk around the hanok village.There is tons of street food around and the area is famous for food so give it a try. Many of the streets are very pretty and newly built. Very picturesque and lots of people dressed up in traditional garb.
Lovely to walk around,"Most of the days the majority of the people walk around in traditional clothing, which makes it very nice and pictures. Definetly worth having a stroll around, a lot of food to find as well"
Good,GooodNice place we can dress korean traditional clothes we can eat korean foods nice place  Historical hose also we can see..
Nice !,"Really like the place, its nice and colorful.. The street food was delicious - i loved the dumplings especially those with prawns.. Did not try the traditional costume but will do during my next visit !"
Fun in an old-style city,"Though very touristic, Jeonju Hanok village is a nice place to visit, in particular on a sunny Sunday. I don't think that many of the houses are really very old, but they are rebuilt in old style and create a charming atmosphere. I was there on a Sunday. Many people rented traditional dress from one of the numerous shops and walked through the street, open for being photographed. So, if you like getting colourful pictures, this is the place to go to, best on a Sunday. Just stroll around through the many small street. Among others you will find a Kimchi museum as well as Gyeonggijeon Hall belonging Korea's cultural heritage. Hill-up, well visible from Hanok village is Jaman Mural village. If you like comic books, go there and have a look to the murals. The village is easily reachable via a a bridge crossing a busy street. Beside the murals you find nice coffee places offering fantastic views over the Hanok village."
"Classic, with a modern twist","The ancient layout and building styles are quite unique in how they've preserved the history of the area, yet each one now seems to house a store of some description or a restaurant.This is a blessing and a curse as they have retained their older layout and design which has brought the tourist numbers in. The flipside is they have had to cater to the tourism trade by commercialising the area which has also resulted in the area losing some of it's rustic charm.Worth a look, but the vibe of the area just doesn't sit well with me."
The Modern Twist of Hanok ,"We went here during Easter and it was crowded eventho' it wasn't public holiday for Korean. All the Hanok Village transformed into restaurant, food stall, shop, cafe, Hanbok rental place and accommodation place. The area is very big and lots of small alley so better to know where you want to go at first otherwise u will be just going around the village and lost. The Hanbok rental are pretty much along the street on every corner as far as I cud see in case you want to rent Hanbok. If you carry small luggage or big bag, there are few lockers in 2 locations that u can pick. It only cost KRW500 for small or big one but if u intent to rent Hanbok, they also have a space to keep ur belongings.We spent 2days1night as we wanted to explore a bit more of the city but in case u just want to visit the Hanok Village, a day trip surely will be enough. They have plenty of street foods or restaurants so prepare to empty your stomach before stepping into the village and have fun ! "
Team Building Event ,Participated in a Team Building event for 60 colleagues. Went to Hanok Village and dressed in local ancient costumes. Had LOTS of fun. 
Very very quiet on week nights,Lovely village with lots of shops. Only thing is most were closed on Monday and Tuesday night. The nights we were there.
Unique Tourist Precinct ,"It’s a replication of traditional Korean villages but it’s done tastefully. Full of coffee shops, arts and crafts and some traditional Korean food. Lots of traditional clothes for hire if you want to wander around the village and the palace. Seemed a very popular experience for young adults. Besides the standard souvenirs there are some truly unique craftwork that makes ideal gifts. We went midweek but I understand it’s packed on weekends. Definitely one of the best “historical” experiences in South Korea. I want to go back. "
"Nice, touristic. Good. Selection of restaurants",Many cities try to preserve the traditional way of life.... all in all it is for tourists and that is one thing you need to bare in mind while walking down the streets of this area. A big selection of food and nice spots for photos.
Jeonju hanok village with opportunity to wear Korean hangbok,Traditional Korean houses in hanok . Many shops for one to try Korean hangbok and walk around the village . The origin of Korean dish bibimbak started here and the dinning in hanok is well known world heritage place
Wonderful time,Really cool place when you stay in Hanook house. All the area well preserved to keep well as old time. There are many restaurant and cafe that you can enjoin take a break when you tried from walk around. Also many shop for rent the hanbok dress and the price is ok depend on hours. I would recommend to stay there on weekday as weekend many people come.
Worth a full day. ,There’s plenty to do here. Take a full day walking through the little streets and exploring the ancient buildings. Thee are food and coffee shop stops all around. We’re good shoes as there are many cobbles. 
Not worth a visit,"We booked 2 nights here after not really looking into it apart from what it’s advertised to be. It is really not worth visiting, it’s more of a day trip place for young Koreans not for foreigners wanting to experience korea. The buildings are nice but surrounded by a scruffy busy city, they are mostly turned into tacky shops selling junk food and blaring out r and b music. EVERYONE rents costumes and electric scooters, in my opinion the place has been ruined, when it has so much potential"
Mey!,"The organised trips to Jeonju seemed expensive, so we simply went ourselves for a fraction of the price. A taxi to Yonngan (?) Train Station, TXH tickets bought very easily, (our hotel reception printed out departure and return timetables), a clear departure board supported by a very well-spoken speaker in English, a pleasant one and half hour journey in luxury even though we were standard class and a taxi to the village. The village itself, well there are a few areas where you feel you are in an authentic neighbourhood, but most areas seem replicated, are mainly selling food and drink, renting out traditional hanok clothes and are basically just catering for the day trippers. Places of interest were very similar in architecture and the artwork is disappointing. One palace is outstanding for it's decorative roofing and ceilings, the name of which escapes me but it will be heavily featured in most advertising online, but overall I felt that I had seen most of it in Seoul. A long way for a uninspiring attraction, so such so that we left after three hours. It was nice to see so many young Koreans walking around wearing hired traditional clothes and I do think that the Korean people do value the village as part of one of the few remaining historical landmarks left after the Japanese wartime occupation, but to my Western eyes the site lacked depth and variety. I would save yourself the effort and see the same things in Seoul."
Beautiful place.,"Although a bit filled with tourist, Koreans in traditional costumes doing selfies and junk food shops, this place building s make up for it. A feast for the eyes with some hidden gems!!"
Fun place to visit,"We enjoyed walking around the village and seeing all the Asian tourists dressed in rented traditional clothes posing for photos. Even the very cold weather did not seem to bother them! We wanted to stay in a traditional house, but the prices were too high for the lack of comfort and privacy on offer. The traditional houses are lovely from the outside though and there are many cafes, restaurants and street food vendors to keep you satiated. "
Korean traditional town,The town is surrounded by a river. You can see old fashioned houses built hundreds years ago. It’s amazing to see still a few residents are in the village. Clean restrooms and free shuttles are user friendly. There is a small exhibition displaying many kinds of mask. They even offer lessons good for teens and children. 
Jeonju Hanok Village,"It is absolutely to visit if you are in Jeonju. Unfortunately, different buildings are new but built as if they were old and others with the new squared design, which ruin the atmosphere. In the village, there are a lot of restaurants but everything is really expensive and the most important thing, the food is not really tasty."
Short Get Away From City Life - Hanok Stay@ Jeonju,"If you like to twist your trip to Seoul a bit and be a little adventurous, you can take a short KTX from Seoul to Jeonju. It’s about 2 hours away from Seoul. However, to enjoy the place, it’s good to book ahead the traditional Hanok and stay for 3 Days 2 nights in the Traditional Hanok Village. This is the fourth time I’ve been here. This is also one of the most favourite place for the city folks to come here & stay for the weekend. The pace here is much slower than Seoul and thus a very relax town. You’ll see folks here having street foods, loan the traditional costumes, dress up, walk and take selfie in the village. You can also visit their local market to experience their lives here....The must try food here are their Jeonju Raw Beef Bibimbap, Jeonju Bean Sprout Soup with Moju "
2D1N visit to Jeonju in December,"I went with a mix feeling about Jeonju as I read that it is too touristy and not genuinely Korean. However, my family and I had a wonderful time there. I stayed in a hanok which is small for 4 pple in a room. But a good experience. No doubt that some of the Hanoks there are new and built purposely for tourists but some are not new. And if you love such traditional structures you will like Jeonju. There are some things which I do not fancy such as a VR shop which I found to be out of place in the Hanok Village. I guessed it was meant to attract the younger crowds. The local kids do go there in throngs as they like to dress up in the traditional korean costume to take pictures. It was delightful to see them. The whole village may take some time yo explore and there are other places which I had no time to go too. The map for the village will be useful for you to navigate your way through. Since it was winter when I went, shops closed early. I bet it is more busy and interesting during other seasons. "
"Interesting and lively village, seems to be a Mecca for Koreans",This is a bustling village with many original buildings but also seems to be a place Koreans just love to visit. Not only are there a number of cultural places to visit the atmosphere is very pleasant as many people asking about wearing the Hanbok.Lots and lots of acting places and coffee houses. You would never go Hungary here.... So much on offer.Certainly worth a visit if you have time on your itinerary.
Plenty of eateries ,"It has numerous streets lined with restaurants, café, gift shops and hanbok rental shops. There's an prominent old cathedral church. You can rent a hanbok and pay an entrance fee to get into the Gyeonggi Palace for lots of photos taking. To get there from Seoul, take the rail and alight at Jeonju station. It's easier to hop onto a cab just outside the train station and point the driver to the Hanok Village with a map. But expect a roller coaster ride with most of their taxi drivers suspected were once F1 racer.Bibimbap and PNB choco pie are some of their more popular food and snack."
Traditional Korean Village.... Slow City,"It's a very nice Korean traditional village. There are hundreds of Korean houses (Hanok) in this village. You can stay in the Hanok guesthouses to learn more about Korean culture. People are very nice. There are many interesting things inside the village, e.g. museums, tea houses,Korean traditional restaurants, workshop and etc. It's good to stay at least 1 night here."
Day trip will be ok,"If u want to experience to stay in tradional houses u can stay overnight but f u want just to see the village and try hanbok, day trip will be ok. From express bus to hanok village taxi fee range fromm 300 to 400 won. Print ur guesthouse add in hangul. From seoul or busan u can leave ur luggage in a locker inside the express bus terminal.Nothing much to do. Great for photo op. 70 percent wearing hanbok inside the village. 20k to 15k won rental fee for hanbok for 2 hours. "
"Stayed for the photos, went somewhere else for food","I've been to the Hanok Village in Jeonju a few times this year already. For me, it is a good chance to see people dressed in hanboks, and the traditional houses look great. The view from the top of the hill is especially good, and with a zoom lens you can even manage to take a picture that does not include any grey apartment buildings! However, for bibimbap I always go to one of the old restaurants in the city centre nearby instead (where the main shopping area is). Another great place for food in Jeonju (and my personal favorite) is the makeolli streets. You can ask at your hotel or guesthouse for the closest one, or the one they recommend, and hop in a taxi for a short ride there after visiting the village. I've had some of the best food in Korea in those places, and the atmosphere is great."
Good day trip,I enjoyed seeing the Historical side of teh village and how they have kept the old homes yet updated them for modern amenities. Worth the trip
"Dissappointing - very commercial, difficult to see the authenticity due to the crowds",Spent 2 days in Jeonju. This is by far the poorest Hanok village I have seen in Korea. Really not worth to make the detour. Fortunately there was the opportunity to make 2 nice day hikes in the national parks at one hour driving distance.
Nothing much to see but good photo taking venue ,We rented hanbok before entered the village. The price of hanbok is around SGD20 for 3 hours. You will see a lots of people rented it to take photo in the village. Nothing surprise us in the village but in Jeonju this is a place you must visit I would said. 
Enough for a day trip,"My friends and I came here for a day trip. It’s small enough to walk around and complete almost all the streets. However if you are planning to come here to wear the hanbok and take many pictures, probably one night stay will be better "
Commercial but worth the experience,"Jeonju Hank Village is known to be among the most traditional town. The hanok style houses and buildings were just beautiful. It's a good place to walk around, have loads of snacks, and even wear a hanbok as you roam through the alleys. "
Hire an outfit and really get the full experience!,The Hanok village is a great place to see traditional clothing and houses as well as eat good food. We stayed in one of the Hanok and really enjoyed the local hospitality. If you truly want the full experience then go prepared to hire a hunbok gown and get completely made up from head to toe! At 3.30pm there was a parade and there are often concerts at the cultural center so would recommend asking at the information center for daily schedule.
well preserved,"The sprawling Hanok village covers a large area, and the buildings are well preserved. Not huge amount to see and it can be repetitive as the buildings are the same. It was more interesting to see everyone dressed up in rental costumes of traditional clothes."
Jeonju Hanok Village,I loved it. It's lovely little village filled with fun little shops. Be prepared to open your wallets here because they are so many yummy to devour. Enjoy your day here for sure.
Where old meets new ,Very nice area with both local people and tourists exploring/experiencing Korea history. Some people don't care for the village because it is now more commercialized but I quite enjoyed seeing how local people having fun with their roots in a manner that they enjoy. I recommend that you go somewhere higher up so that you can see a better view of the city with the room tops of the old houses. 
Good place to spend a day,Popular activity with Koreans is to rent traditional Korean clothes and walk around the traditional village. Only the exterior is traditional and most shops sell souvenirs or food. You can spend a few hours visiting cafes or sampling some food. Most souvenir shops weren't that interesting but few historical sights within the village are worthwhile. One full day is all you need here.
"Hanok City, Jeonju!",This is not a really perfect place for history lovers who expect to see historical sites with quiet atmosphere and historic stories in it. Of course hanok is part of Korean history but the way they arrange this place is more like a shopping street than cultural sites. You can say that Jeonju Hanok Village is more commercialized as a place where you can wear hanbok and eat various street foods since the place is also close with Nambu market. Bukchon Hanok Village in Seoul probably is a better choice for those who want to learn history about hanok in deep. Jeonju Hanok Village is just perfect for tourist and lighthearted sightseeing. You can find Korean traditional restaurant that serve Jeonju specialty food bibimbap in the main gate across Jeondong cathedral.
Don't go out of the way to see it,"Really is like an artifical village, with just souvenirs, food stalls and hanbok rental shops. We stopped here for a few hours on our way from Seoul to Suncheon, definately would not recommend an overnight stop, as you would only need an hour max at the hannok village, besides that there is not much else to do and see. I personally think Bukchon village in Seoul is better, or visit the in Gyeongju."
Mostly Shopping and Sight-seeing,"Jeonju is supposedly the original hometown of Yi family that Korea's last Yi Dynasty Royal family arose. Hanok village has a number of traditional Korean residential houses have been restored and preserved. Later, they added many more to attract tourists from all over the country. Within the village, a museum to commemorate Yi Dynasty family is located. And, nearby, a city gate with walls is preserved. Also, in the same area, there is a historic Catholic church to witness martyred saints. Not much more of historic things unless you are really into it. But, there are so much to try tasting, shopping, and walking in rented traditional garbs. One thing you may really want to shop for is hand-crafted wooden comb produced by a National Human Treasure. He runs a shop within the village. A $40 to $70 price range; it is a bit expensive. But, combs are real work of art and they provide a good stimulating massage on your scalp."
"Only for street foods, shopping. ","I was really expected to go this Han-ok town. I am Korean. I thought the place will be quiet and cozy, and good for walk, feel what our ancestors acknowledge. But i am so disappointed this place. There were many things changed.If u want to feel Korea traditional House town , then just go Palace in Seoul or Bukchon Han-ok village. I can't see what's going on there.So commercial, they will rub your pocket. That's it. "
Traditional setting with nice vibe,"Clean and well maintained this small village is filled with Hanok home stays and refreshment outlets. It is very pleasant to wander the alleys and appreciate the style of the newly restored dwellings. We spent half a day which included the shrine, school, pavilion and the mural village nearby. Try the local bibimbap while you are here in its big place.Less than 2 hours on the KTX from Seoul and make sure you have your hotel name and numbers in Korean, as it will make short taxi ride from station easier ~W6000.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful."
Pleasant sightseeing experience,"My friend and I went to Jeonju Hanok Village for 2 days. Currently they have a night event on Saturdays till September (I think, I'm not very sure), so there are cultural performances and shows ongoing at different parts of the Hanok Village.We rented hanboks (Korean traditional costume) on Sunday morning, 9.30am, at 30,000won for 4 hours, but the shop owner was kind enough to allow us to return the hanboks at 5pm. Hanbok rental shops can be seen almost on every street in the village, so you should not have any trouble finding them. It was an enjoyable experience walking down the streets in hanbok! It can get rather troublesome but overall the experience was great!"
Where history and modernity blend,"It's interesting just walking around the area, as many Koreans wear hanboks (the traditional clothing), adding a lot of colour to the area. There are many shops where you can rent hanboks as well as food places and souvenir shops. The traditional Korean architecture (hanok) is also in full display here."
Street Food Galore,"I have to admit this village is fairly touristy, but it's close enough to do a day trip here from Seoul. Enjoy the happy atmosphere, the crowds, small museums in the area, and street food. "
Not sure about the town,"I don't know, maybe it is too early to judge but I am not getting this town. It is a bit artificially positioned as an artisty town but there is nothing really artistic and all you see around are girls dressed up in the typical dresses who take posed pictures. It is pleasant to stay in a Hanok but not more than 2 nights. The best thing to visit is the Confucian centre."
Quaint village,"We went here on our tour of South Korea. There were lots of people in period clothes which you can rent by the hour for about 30,000 won per person. There are little food stands along the way though it was difficult for us to find an open restaurant for a proper sit down meal. We ended up with some steamed dumplings instead."
Hanok village. ,"We stayed in the Hanok village in a wonderful guesthouse, a new star on the list of guesthouses, Haninok's EHAWON. The atmosphere is very friendly, the sleeping arrangements are traditional Korean. Meaning on the floor on heavy blankets. But beds can be arranged. The village is created in the traditional fashion: old Korean. It is a very friendly and enjoyable area. Next to all kinds of food and drinks you can rent several types of batterie powered vehicles. Enjoy a ride or just watch. Visits over the weekend are very popular. "
Great to stroll around,"Nice streets, interesting houses. Lots of shops, cafes, snack shops, etc... a great way to experience the best part of Jeonju."
Nice little town with old world feel,"Make a day trip to Jeonju from Seoul via express train, 2 hours ride. It's very easy to get around to the village, experience the place where bibimbap originated, variety of street eats, a nice palace and a beautiful Romanesque cathedral. "
Back in time in Jeonju hanok village,"Jeonju hanok village was a 15min taxi ride from the ktx station. Upon entrance to the village, it was nothing short of AMAZING! Brought back in time with rows and rows of quaint hanoks lining the streets. Hanboks rentals were everywhere and jeonju had the most gorgeous hanboks I'd ever seen! Tiered design and big puffy skirts that was simply elegant. Rental price is cheap too, do rent one to join in the fun. Everyone's wearing hanbok in jeonju hanok village!Scooter rentals are also available but the village is not very big. It does look bigger on the map than in reality, so accommodation anywhere in the village will be just right! Stay in a hanok for a traditional experience :)Just to note: the place was very crowded with tourists and even locals from other parts of korea, students on school trips etc esp on weekends.Food was good too! The best bibimbap I had ever eaten was at HanKookKwan. Everywhere in the village is so nice to take photos. Don't forget to try jeonju chocopie! It's sooo much better than the packaged ones.Locals in Jeonju are friendly and nice too! Such a good experience. We went to korea in April spring time, seoul and busan were cold. But jeonju was hot, scorching hot! There's comfortable cold wind at night till early morning though. There is a night market that sells mostly food..but it was very crowded too. Most shops in the hanok village closes at 8.30pm so be prepared ......we stayed for a night so what we did was to visit the night market, and sat in a café. It is a slower and more relaxing pace in jeonju than in the metropolitan areas.KTX tickets from seoul to jeonju are not cheap but I would go again, for the traditional experience, the food and the laid back atmosphere. There are buses too but definitely a longer travelling time.Recommend to visit at least for a day trip :)"
It was nice experience to visit Hanok Village ,It was nice experience to visit this place. Especially wearing Korean cultural dress. Recommended place. 
Great to jump back in time ,I had a wonderful strolling through the streets of places that date back many years. The streets are cobblestone and some streets are not driving by car. You can rent a two wheeled scooter to ride around
Plenty to see and do,"This village of traditional style houses is aimed at tourists so there is plenty to see and do here. Many of the hanoks host small businesses and studio/workshops. I went to a liquor tasting school, a fan museum, the house of a member of the royal family and watched paper being made by hand. There are lots of places to rent traditional outfits for the day and some nice restaurants too. Great for a day out."
Nice but made for tourists,I felt a bit like in Disneyland as no Korean people live there. It is perfect but done for tourists. I suggest to go a bit further from the center of the village to enjoy real hanoks and spend some time walking around after 17.30 when tourists are gone.
Very nice village ,"The Hanok, old village of traditional Korean house, is worth to go! There are many old houses and some temples free for visit. Although many tourist shops there, the people are friendly and pure, they still keep the houses in good condition."
Relaxing day trip out of Seoul,"How we got here:Took an intercity bus ( approx 2.5 hrs @ 18,700 won per person for 1 way ) from Seoul Central City bus terminal to Jeonju. Then we took a taxi ( around 5,000 won for 10 - 15 mins ride ) to reach the hanok village.Came on a Tuesday and it was getting crowded as the day goes by.We see people wearing hanbok ( interesting to see cross-dressing as well) exploring the areas. A little bit of regret that I didn't wore one here.Pace are slow here and there are food stalls along the streets to try out. Some of the local snacks we tried are pretty good. Such as the PNB chocolate pie.Go at a slow pace and try exploring the different corners.We covered other nearby areas by walking in one day:- Jeondong Cathedral- Gyeonggi-Jeon Shrine- Nambu Market + Real New Town Youth Mall- Jeonju Hyang-gyo - Omokdae and ImokdaeIt was easy to get a cab back here for us get back to the bus terminal."
Just ok,It was much to touristy for me. Not authentic at all. Actually reminded me of an amusement park without the rides. I guess if you havent experienced anything like it you might enjoy it. Mostly food and nice kids in Traditional costumes.
Korean culture and architecture,"The Hanok village is a popular attraction with tourists. The village is comprised of many buildings featuring traditional Korean architecture which house a variety of restaurants, galleries and guest houses. It is also possible to try traditional Korean Moju liquor as well. We visited for a day, but to fully experience the Hanok village I would recommend staying at one of the local guest houses within the village for a couple of days to fully explore and experience everything the village has to offer. During the spring season, you will also get to see the flowers in bloom, adding to the overall experience."
Rows of Shops and a Few Overpriced Hanok Stay Guesthouses,"Thought it was an actual living village and not a themed shopping area where Koreans go to eat snacky foods, dress in traditional garb and look beautiful. "
"crowded, touristy but i love it!","easily one of my favourite place in Jeonju! i stayed nearby at a Hanok homestay and had easy access to this hanok village. it was almost spring and flowers are already blooming, it was so so pretty! many young Koreans rent hanbok/Korean old school uniform and stroll the village in them, took pictures etc, so much feel!there are many great restaurants and cute little cafes to visit too.. the restaurants/cafes have the most beautiful designs, they are all Hanok styles with slight modern interior - loved it!get up early before the shops are open and you get to enjoy the beauty of this village.. i took both early (before the shops open) and late night strolls (when shops all closed), both had different feeling and i enjoyed strolling around. some lovely shops even has speaker with cutesy songs.. every steps i took was like in a Kdrama!"
Definitely a place to go,"if you go to South Korea, make sure to visit this place. you can take a day trip from Seoul to Jeonju and make your way to this hanok village. this place is feel like out from a fairy tales book, every corner of it is beautiful. if you have a lot of time, staying in one of Hanok turn into guesshouse is very recomended."
Touristy - but Lively,"From a cultural perspective, this is not exactly my ideal spot. But as a visitor, I think it's a pretty good place to check out. The street foods are good (PNB Choco Pies are to die for) and there are plenty of back lanes for you to explore. Very picturesque place."
Traditional & consumer oriented,"A former visit to this site only allowed me 20 minutes to explore one single street. This time, I stayed overnight in one of the many guest houses in the village, and had time to wander the streets, see the sights, and thoroughly enjoy this experience.In the early morning, before the shops open, you can see the traditional houses at their best - the rooflines, the tiles, the decorative aspects all combine to present Korea's culture and architecture.Once the shops open and the tourists arrive, a whole different vibe is felt - young Koreans rent hanboks and take pictures of each other posing in front of the Confucian school, or in the palace garden. Everywhere you can partake of the famous Jeonju bibimbap, at various prices, or you can fill up on street food and coffee, tea, slushies etc.The more popular restaurants often have lines outside, but I find the quieter ones in the side streets often have better fare and value for money.If you are going to visit this, decide before-hand if you want to walk or rent a scooter. I recommend walking, since that way you see each place intimately.A good family visit or on your own."
love it!!!,"The hanok village area was pretty..You can rent hanbok or korean old school uniform and strolling around. So many food stalls and restaurants, but i fall in love with 'ssiat hotteok'. Sorry i can't tell you the location of that ssiat hotteok, i don't remember since i accidentally found it :'("
Perfect for enjoying a day !!!,"It became one of hottest place in Korea. Eating, walking, seeing, and even wearing Korean traditional dress, Hanbok, can be nicely done here."
Family trip,"It was good, but i recommend jeonju to visit except winter season, if you can. It was cold weather and traditional accommodation was not enough prevent from noisy..but really good experience about korean culture."
the korea in korea,"highly recommended destination if you happen to visit this part of south korea in jeonju. it's not my first time in korea but most of my previous visit is in seoul or incheon area, and i can tell you people that jeonju hanok village will set you to time travel in the past. 90% of the visitors here rents and wear the traditional korean dress, so that already sets your eyes to the past. and the architectures of the houses maintain the old korean times, even the alleys and the stone roads. though there is already the touch of modern living, the people around still relives the old way the best they can... and i commend this community for doing that. i had a day's tour here and it was a day well spent."
"Touristy, but a worthwhile experience","This is a lovely little cultural section of Jeonju. Approach it with the right attitude - it can be quite crowded. There is a mix of old and new here despite it being sold as a historical village - people get into the spirit by dressing up in traditional Korean garb, but there are also others whizzing about on segways and virtual reality arcades on several corners. The street food is spectacular and there are some incredible restaurants and bakeries about. Be aware that you will pay a premium on souvenirs. Allow half a day at least; more if you are going to explore the gardens and historical sites as well as eat lunch - it is hectic but a worthwhile experience. "
History in a view,"Love the Hanok village which is accessible to several attractions including Nambu market. Lots of yummy food and snacks to try here including the Daurang Mandu, Oven baked hotteok, fried squid, chocopie and so on! If you ever visit Jeonju, staying at one of those Hanok guesthouses here would be the best and most authentic experience you can ever get. "
Lovely time at Jeonju ,"I'm glad we made the decision to visit Jeonju before Seoul. It's relaxed, beautiful and a much more enjoyable area to stroll around and explore the hanoks"
The capital of make-believe,"The Hanok Village is a section of Jeonju city -- it's about 2 km south of the city centre -- that is heavily promoted as a ""heritage"" quarter. A closer look leaves one with doubts. Although there are some old buildings of historical significance, such as the Confucuan Institute and the Geonggijeon shrine complex, most of the other buildings look newly built, albeit in the traditional style. The frontages of these newish buildings have mostly been converted into shops selling snack foods and touristic kitsch. ""Tradition"" to the younger generation of Koreans seem to be little more than playing dress-up, so the place assumes the character of an open-air cosplay site.There are some adult restaurants in the village, but menus seem overpriced.In the day, huge busloads of domestic tourists and even huger busloads of kids descend on the village. By nightfall, the crowds thin out, but it then means the place is virtually dead and restaurants closed by 9 pm.The older points of interests in the vicinity (e.g. Gyeonggijeon) are worth a look, so you'll probably end up in the Hanok Village anyway, but there's no need to allot more than a hour to walk the streets and see how tourism corrupts the meaning of ""heritage""."
Beautiful collection of old houses,"This part of Jeounju is really lovely, with its high concentration of historic Hanok houses. A great place to stroll around, even if it is rather touristy... Do stay in one of the many traditional guesthouses that you can find all over the old town."
Pottery making,"A nice place recommendes for tourist, lots of korean street food and you have a chance to try on their Hanbok! Went for a pottery making class during our trip there and it was awesome! "
"Like one big throwback ""cosplay"" village!","This historical UNESCO heritage site village seemed like a COSPLAY village to me. There were more ""local"" tourists that foreigners. The main road got filled up quickly during the weekend with several people dressed up like koreans during the joseon era...you'll feel more at home by renting a costume yourself and walking around with the locals...go ahead and enjoy! "
Nice Ambience,Can spend a relaxing and enjoyable afternoon there for tea and coffee. Also can hire traditional Korean clothing for taking photos and walking in street. Also motocyle for rent but I don't like the idea.
big - expensive - touristy,In total i've been to about 4-5 hanok villages allover Korea. The village is very big but is exployded for touristic purposes. There are shops and snack boothes everywhere that sell overprized goods. If you really want to experience a genuine Hanok village i'd recommend the one near Andong!
Big Tourist Site,"This hanok village is located in the centre of the bustling city of Jeonju. It is extremely popular with Chinese and domestic tourists, so expect crowds whenever you may go. It is a pleasant place to wander around but some of the entertainments make it look like a tacky tourist-trap. Although the streets seem to be pedestrianised, there are and endless number of electric vehicles for hire ie; segeways, scooters, 3 wheelers and they are being driven everywhere by out of control tourists (including small kids) so you need to watch out as you can't hear them coming. There are some lovely old buildings to explore but they have all been heavily restored. There is also plenty of food around so you won't go hungary. People can also hire Hanbok clothing to walk around in and do photo shoots, which they somehow manage, despite the crowds.Overall a bit of a tourist trap but still nice enough for a visit."
Throwback Korea,"What better way to experience Korean culture by walking the cobble stoned streets of Jeonju in traditional Hanbok or homestay-ing with the ""Big Mouth"" artist. While good for a day trip, might as well stay at least a night to savor the food and atmosphere. "
Sightseeing ,A beautiful village where all kinds of housing are old style. Every corner you explore will bring you nearer to Joseng years. Met an uncle who is very kind enough to tell us the history of the museum we visit! . Do rent Hanbok to wear and take pictures. Saw a few guys wearing woman Hanbok which were funny but they attracted people to take photos with them .
Great collection of traditional houses,"This collection of traditional Hanok houses is very nicely preserved albeit they are adding new ones throughout the area. Great introduction to Korea for us. Beautiful architecture, couples and groups dressed up in traditional Hanbok outfits and just the general ambiance of the area. Was lovely and exactly what we were looking for at the start of our trip. Yes the area is a bit touristy but it's not over the top and the buildings make up for any shortcomings one may have. "
Amiable:but Bukchon in Seoul has more to offer!,Wander around hanok village brimming with restaurants & tourists-even in the rain!Not a lot of craft-however the papermaking mini-factory a delight to stop & stare at the 4 staff going about their craft. A good priced shop too -socks made from hanji ie paper! And a good range of fans
Restored and Rebuilt Antiquity,"The village is a rebuilding of what the area probably looked like centuries ago, but most of the structures are post 1960 and have water, electricity, etc. The shrine is old and there is a small charge to enter that area; it is well worth the money. IF you are elderly or have gray hair, someone will approach you and ask "" Where you from?"" or ""How old are you?"". They aren't trying to sell you anything, just being friendly. Safe and good food and clean restrooms. WELL WORTH any time you spend there."
Unique & creative food lovers haven!,"We visited over the Jeonju Bimbimbap festival 20-23 Oct, and it was interesting but definitely more a family-friendly event more directed for domestic tourists as English was pretty much non-existent. There was lots going on though in Hanok Village itself, street food after food stall after restaurant, of quirky, creative, instagram-worthy street eats so definitely worth a visit if you're into street food. There's loads of quaint cosy guesthouses inside the village itself, which are an interesting experience if you don't mind sleeping on rather thin mattresses on the floor (similar to Japanese tatami) and it was fun to get dressed up in the traditional get up for the day as well. Fun, easy weekend away!"
Really lovely!,"Took a train from Seoul to Jeonju by the express train so it only took about 2 hours + a public bus ride. I went on a Saturday so it was rather crowded, but it gave a nice lively atmosphere. They have stalls selling yummy food, along with hanbok stalls. I tried out traditional fan painting and also saw artists drawing caricatures for tourists. They also have live traditional performances. A really great day trip for those who want to escape from the city of Seoul!"
Great way to go back to the old time,"The village is really cool with a lot of locals, tourists wearing hanbok and walked around. Very enjoying scene to see and walk beside them. It was like I walked in the old time.you need to try the bibimbap here in Jeonju. The street food here is great too, cafés, bakeries, ice cream, drinks... just everywhere."
One big photo opp...,This village seems to be a major tourist attraction in Jeonju but that is mainly due to people (in particularly couples) coming here just to have a photo shoot among the buildings and trees. I would suggest hiring hanboks to make the whole trip more interesting. Not the best traditional Hanok Village I've been to.
Worth a visit,"A very lively traditional korean village with many young people wearing hanbok walking around or taking photos, even on weekdays. Worth a visit, better than the two other Hanok Villages that we visited in Seoul. Nice for photo taking and to experience the culture and food but nothing to shop."
Must visit and rent a hanbok!!,"If you want to wear a hanbok and take beautiful pics all in a day. Pls visit this korean village. It may be abit touristy but there are so many beautiful hanbok rental stores, street food, cafes and photospots all in this hanok village. Have a night stay at the honok village will be good too! Spend a whole day at Jeonju will be good! "
Nice side trip from Seoul ,Great experience with lots of good food! A nice getaway from Seoul that is easy to get to by train (about 1.5 HR on KTX). 
Exploring Jeonju,"Jeonju should be on your visit to Korea bucket list!! Enjoy the culture, history, food and more!! Spend a night in a Hanok house, make Hanji paper, stroll the streets of the Hanok village, explore the small shops and restaurants and historical sites. A great place to rest and reflect!!"
Korean Traditional Village,"You can experience great Korean Traditional food that first timers can try without much hesitation. Also, a great place to visit for a day and experience old Korean village."
"One of the biggest Hanok villages in South-Korea, a bit touristy though","Gives a nice impression of how Korea might have looked like before the Japanese and (later) the North-Koreans destroyed everything. Well reconstructed, but you can almost smell the fresh paint, which makes it a kind of open-air museum. Still very nice for a few hours. And obviously the Koreans love it! Special shops where you can hire traditional dresses for a few hours, an have yourself photographed in t hem."
Where the tradition is still... live!,"The interesting thing with this Hanok Village is that it's not just a constructed replica of an old traditional village. It is an active, alive part of the city! Plenty of blocks, full of traditional buildings, which are used for shops, restaurants, pensions, even for regular houses! You can spend a a lot of time walking in the small streets of the village, enjoying the wonderful traditional buildings and relaxing (when the area is not overcrowded!). It's an oasis inside Jeonju City!"
nice&quiet,I wish i can have more time to stay here longer such a beautiful village i love all the old traditional house lovely place !!!!!
A great mix of things,"The hanok village is, at the same time, touristy and authentic. At its heart is an old (restored) shrine that once housed royal portraits. Around all of this, there are theatres, a few handicraft locations and an important catholic church.Interwoven are tacky snack bars filled with Koreans.Culture and chaos together!Two notes:Koreans (especially young women) love to hire traditional dress and wander around the village posing for photos.Consider sleeping in a traditional style house (Stayhanok). A very good way to see the ebb and flow of the place."
Nice village,"An old grand village with so many houses which are very beautiful. Let's walking around with a hanbok, eat some street foods..."
A quiet garden ,"I would suggest to visit the hanok village , it is one of the most important korean heritage place. The palace hosts the only availability portrait offerte the first korean emperor . Furthermore a nice garden with a bambù forest is visitable. "
Very pleasant day break,"During a business stay we had the chance to spend one day in the weekend in this very nice village.We found a pice of old times Korea not so common in such a modern country.The landscape is very nice, a lot of people relaxing in the small streets and wide choice of delicious food options (it's a Slow Food city!!!!).Tha Castle is very interesting the guide tour is adviseable.If you are nearby, don't miss the visita! "
Good to walk around at day and night.,"There're historical sites, cafes and shops that whole family may like to visit. We looked around riding minibot(electric wheels) rented and that's the best at hot summer day."
Must see in Korea.,"Hanok Village Jeonju is combined of series beautiful traditional house of Korea. The guide said that there are about 700 hanok houses at here, and some of which has rooms to stay for tourists, but the price is more expensive than the same level hotel. However, I booked one night to stay because I want to see sunrise and discovery nightlife at here. For me, the village is the most attraction place with historic lover, and the scene of sunset or sunrise are stunning."
Cultural and heritage with a modern vibe,It was an amazing sight to see many people walking around in traditional hanbok over there. A picturesque place to take many photos and enjoys lots of good food as well.
Amazing Jeonju Hanok Village,"Amazing Jeonju Hanok Village. During the weekend, the village was jammed with people, many Koreans went there as an outings. Shops and restaurants were full of people, the whole village became vibrant. On weekdays, the crowds disappeared and the streets went quite. Early morning you can see locals walking by, grownups going to work and children to school. The whole place just quieted down and that serenity was simply charming."
Korea Style Architecture!,"Korea. Jeonju, the combination of history and delicacy,is one of the most typical cities in Korean style! You can see lots of special architectures right there, Hanok. And the scenery of maple is also wonderful! If you wanna know more details , http://goo.gl/4eaqWo"
A MUST see for all visitors to Korea,"This village is such a unique treat to visitors of all ages and nationalities. It's what a traditional urban village would have looked like in the old days. The shrines and houses are worth a visit and though it may be uncomfortable and unfamiliar to sleep on the floor, I recommend that all visitors try staying in a traditional Hanok to get the full traditional Korean experience.People walk around in hanbok (traditional clothes) and this is also a very special experience. You can rent any hanbok for 1.5-4 hours for about 20,000 won. There are also great places to eat. I recommend the Hangukgwan for the best bibimbap!I'm Korean so I had no problem reading the captions and pamphlets to the major sites but the English translations are a bit lacking-I really wish they would invest more in making it foreigner-friendly because this is such a treasure. If you're a non-Korean speaker, I recommend traveling here with a Korean friend fluent in English or a great interpreter/guide to take you around."
If you went to Geyongju first you will not like this one,"I think if i went there first i will love it a lot but i went to Geyongju hanok village which is bigger area.If you are going in Summer be careful it is really hot and you will walk tooo much so i prefer that you go there in the early morning or in the afternoonI suggest that you rent Hanbok to wear and also to rent a scooter, you will need it There are varities of cafe and restaurants also souvenirs shops are found everywhere."
Touristy,"We visited Jeonju Hanok Village at night, so we only saw it illuminated in the darkness. However, we were not impressed. Unlike the Namsangol Hanok Village in Seoul, for example, it does not recreate traditional Korean architecture and lifestyle. It is really a commercialised collection of restaurants and shops that sell touristy souvenirs.We came here as part of an organised visit, and therefore thought it would be an interesting attraction. We were seriously disappointed."
Very Nice Little Village,"We went here specially for this village and we are quite happy with it. Even though the size is much more smaller compare to other Koran village in bigger city like Seoul, this village is definitely more tidier than the other. Less tourist compare to the other villages which makes it more calm and peaceful to walk around."
A shopping and photo opportunity,"I should state at the beginning of this review that we visited the Hanok village on a rainy day. An extremely rainy day. Warm rain granted, but the narrow streets and small shops don't lend themselves to a multitude of umbrellas all trying to get past each other. There are a great selection of shops, some a tad tacky, but many with lovely examples of Korean handicrafts, including some local to Jeonju. Eating places and coffee houses and takeout stands also abound. We didn't feel that the major of the 'traditional' houses were actually that old and photo opportunities were often spoilt by the close proximity of commercial outlets. I am sure that a properly guided tour would have rendered a completely different experience, but whilst attractive and a good opportunity for souvenirs, we were somewhat underwhelmed."
good,"Korean traditional house(hanok)villageYou can enjoy hanok store, museum, heritage, hostels..In thesedays it is difficult to see hanok in korea, so it will be good opportunity to see. You also can see many people who are wearing hanbok, it is really beatiful. "
Tradition untouched ,It was a real lovely village. We were there during the weekend and it was bustling with life with mostly Koreans themselves. Many were in traditional hanboks and taking photos! There many many small shops selling Korean eats and many big restaurants serving true Korean food. It was definitely a place to go to immerse in Korean traditions.
Lovely little place,"I wandered around the village and was able to see many little quaint buildings and details. If you are visiting the village to enjoy the cultural aspects and want to get some good photos, I would definitely suggest getting up early. I was up and out of my hostel at around 8am and there were maybe 4 other people walking about, which is great for photos.. By 11am the crowds had arrived and it was a lot less fun!"
Traditional house,Here is a good place to see a Korean traditional style house. A lots of food on the road and so many peoples enjoy it. I cannot say it is a real traditional style but easy to go and good experience.
Beautiful place,"One of the most beautiful place to be in Jeonju, specially during evening time, so that you enjoy the area along the day and get a great dinner after sunset, it's consists of beautiful traditional building thats shows a great architecture Korean style houses with a lot of restaurant, cafe, and different stores.. Be there and enjoy the number one place to visit in Jeonju.."
Quaint korean village,"Started the day by checking in at one of the Hanok stay. It was a hot day feels like 32 degrees. Went for a bibimbap lunch and sightseeing at the king taejo palace and walked to the opposite church. Ended with a ice flake coffee. Every places is within walking distance, a pity it was really a hot summer day. It would be perfect if it was a few degrees lower. Worth a visit, but not recommended in summer. "
Group visit,"Visited today 11-13.00 when the sun shone with a 28 deg C it was quite hot the weather . It is advisable to visit in the early morning and late afternoon , when the weather is more friendly . The most attraction you will find here that so many people walking around in HanBok traditional Korean dress as a couple or in group of several people. Many food street available to enjoy incld cakery , ice cream band many other Korean snacks. Clothing shops are also available for rental of traditional Korean dress for KRW 15k you may wear it for several hours in this Hankok village. There are also high quality shops selling earthen ware , silk stuffs , hand made accessories ; besides many shops selling just an ordinary quality stuffs for woman accessories.Many cafe shop also available , some has organic coffee.For me it is just killing time visiting this place , but not a must. "
Cheap and nice,The visit here was very nice and was taken well care of. There is a free museum in the village where it talks about the korean tradition in Jeonju. Rent a Hanbok (Korean traditional outfit) and take many pictures in this village.
Very Nice Village with Using Hanbok,"This is very nice and interesting Village, with using hanbok and go arround the village and taking picture. Here they have so many snacks, souvenirs shop, restaurant, etc. Here we can enjoy the Choco pie, snacks like squid, meatball, chicken, etc. Delicious and tempting look..

Good place for all generation,"Here can try all kind of Korea culture and food.Located may cultural experience center, craft shop, restaurant, street food shop and can try traditional house stay.Specially weekend open many street shop and have free event."
Nice cultural village ,This is a nice village. You can visit the museum..as see the display of art work. And most interesting part if u love to try out their traditional clothing u can have it for one and half hour for a price. It's crowded but fun. We also stop by for bimbingbap and it's really tasty 
Nice place to visit,"Is a very good place to visit. You can rent korea culture costume everywhere in Jeonju Hanok Village. Priced between 10,000 Won to 20,000 Won depending which type of costume you want to rent. You can wear the costume & go wherever you want. The renting period is 1 1/2 hour. We were wearing the costume for a photo shooting, walk around the village. Is a very good & fun experience. Besides, the village has many local foods stalls that sells snacks, and proper meal like Korean BBQ, noodles. You won't starve yourself in the Village because too many good foods & cafe around. You can spend a whole day here and won't get bored.There are a lots of guesthouses in Jeonju Hanok Village too, with reasonable price."
Beautiful Hanok Village in Jeonju,"Jeonju Hanok Village is one of the most beautiful Hanok Village in South Korea. This area was full of beautiful traditional korean houses, lots of shops and cafes around the village. To enjoy this village, you should walking along the road of this village, visit the museums, try some nice cafes and shopping at the shops. You also should try Jeonju Moju, a special makgeolli version of Jeonju when you visit this village.."
Living history,"It is fun to walk around enjoying the architecture of the historic buildings, many shops and fine restaurants, and young people dressed up in traditional Korean costumes."
Loved it,"Love the place and especially the tour in the small palace..that makes all the difference and allows you to unserstand the historyThought the hanok village surrounding is one of the best i have seen in Korea , very friendly ambiance, try to get lost in the small street and dont be shy to walk in the small traditional Korea paper factory and art shop you will find there."
Experience day trip in Korean traditional village,"Experience Korean traditional village in Jeonju. I went there by express bus paid 18700 won (AUD 25) which called seat type called wudeong (우등석) . This give you more spacious seat & give space for your leg room. Bus available every 15 minutes.I departed from Central City Express Bus Terminal ( 센트럴시티터미널)in Gangnam (seoul) took around 2 hour 30 minutes including stop over around 15 minutes on the way to Heonju terminal than caught the taxi & paid around 4000won to get to the village.There are shops where you can hire the korean traditional dress, hanbok (한복) for 2 hours for 20000won Also you can leave your bag in there when you hire the dress.There are a lot of things you can eat in this area.There are guided tours available as well. Please note that visit here during weekday, weekend will be so crowded."
Step back in time and Pig Out too!,"Great place for a stroll and experience traditional Korean architecture. As you build up your appetite you will have scores of places to satisfy every craving you can think of. Sweet, spicy, savory, salty, whatever they have it. Do pay attention to the prices you will see some stalls charge higher prices for the same goods that a stall one block down charges."
Well worth the time,"We were unsure if we were going to have time to visit, but the friends we were staying with highly recommended a visit.Apart from our choice of hotel, we would visit again.The village is mainly car free, with lots of small streets full of shops and stalls selling food and other items.On Sunday when we were walking around, in addition to the tourist attractions, we found a band stand with a number of local young groups singing and dancing which added to the enjoyment. "
Excellent Hanok Village that you should visit when you travel to Korea,"Let's explore everything in Jeonju Village from 8AM, too early. No, this is the best time you can see Korean people prepare their shops to begin new day and in the morning, not too many people in here, great time for go around, enjoy fresh air and eat what you want because after 10AM, you have to stand and wait along time to buy any food around here. Trust me, come early and you will see as I saw in Jeonju :)"
Nostalgic!,"We went to the village around 11am. I rented a ""hanbok"" and walked around the village with it. It was a great experience! You can enjoy some street foods like grilled squid with cheese (super yummy), grilled chicken, PNB Bakery with its famous choco pies, grilled cheese, etcwhat a great experience!"
Typical Korean Village,It gives a glimpse of typical Korean Village. We can spend much time there to understand the living style of those people.
"a lot of foods and shops, and photo spot!",better to go there on weekdays since it will be packed in weekend or holiday. you can also some traditional games here. there are some stores who rent hanbok and korean-old-uniform. i heart this place!
An impressive example of the traditional South Korean architecture,"It is an example of the traditional South Korean architecture, surrounded by the real South Korean stile of live."
Amazing,"So they say Jeonju Hanok Village is the best of the lot. Definitely it is one of the biggest Hanok in Korea. If you are interested in old time korean lifestyle and living, you ought to visit here. You get everything here. Most of the attractions are free of cost. Just stroll through the narrow lanes of village and visit places. Sori cultural place regularly holds traditional shows. Worth a try though without knowing korean language it would be impossible to get the full essence of it.There are lots of souvenir shops. You can shop till you drop.One of the best place to try traditional bibimbap. Fried Octopus is also a must try."
Worth the visit,"You get everything here. A lot things to see, shop and eat. There are many young Koreans (mostly couples) wearing Hanbok and taking pictures around the village (it was interesting to see!). The street food are a bit pricey and the taste just okay. But the Jeonju Bibimbap I had was extremely good! "
Learn about Joseon dynasty and taste authentic Korean food,"You can take limousine bus from airport to Jeonju.It is pedestrian-friendly, and a slow city. Just get a Jeonju tour map, and you're good to explore the city.Join the english tour around Gyeonggijeon shrine, and you can learn more about the place. You can take a rest at Cheongyeonlu pavilion, and view the scenic city. During evening~night, there is a night market at Nambu market south gate. Don't forget to try walnut pie and choco pie from PNB nakery."
Love this living village!,"Its a cozy, peacefuland very pleasant tiny village. a really leisure walk in the village can help bring you back to the past.. you can start to imagine how life may have been in the past. a coffe break in their quaint cafes is wonderful, looking out into the street n enjoying your brew.. true relaxation. food is fantastic here! recommend an overnight stay at a hanok guesthouse or at least a day trip. some may feel touristy but its a mix of modern convenience n let your imagination flow back in time as a busy street in its heyday."
Cosy Jeonju Hanok Village,"strolling to various attraction spots within the vicinity whether it be day time or evening walk. Many eateries & street.Jeonju town is an approximately 3 hrs bus ride from ""Central City Bus Terminal"" > Jeonju Express Bus Terminal Take Metro to Express Bus Terminal station (exit 3), about 7-10 minutes walk towards the Central City Bus Terminal. The only challenge in Jeonju is language. No english. "

One of The Most Traditional Cities,"I’d like to recommend Jeonju in Korea. I went to Jeonju this past December. Jeonju is the biggest city in Jeollabuk-do and one of the most traditional cities in Korea. It take about 2 hours to go there from Seoul. One of the famous attractions in Jeonju is the traditional Korean village. There are so many Korean traditional houses called HAN-OK. And the other attraction is Jundong Catholic church. It looks like a European Catholic church. Also, if you go to Jeonju, you could wear Korean traditional clothes called HAN-BOK.In Jeonju, the most famous food is Bibimbap because Jeonju has a good atmosphere climate and soil. There are many kinds of food sold in the street, so you would eat many kinds of foods. Besides food, Jeonju is well known for Hanji, which is Korean paper, fans, and Mo-Ju, which is made from rice wine. If you come to Korea for the first time, Jeonju is the perfect place to let you feel Korea’s culture. This place doesn’t have breathtaking scenery, but it will offer some very special experiences. This is a popular location among local tourists. You will be glad that you came. Reviewed January 10, 2016"
must visit!,"beautiful! wear a hanbok while touring the place, it makes you feel youre back in time. many locals do this, rentals are available. "
Great Experience,"This village is very cute. It is a good place to walk around and enjoy an afternoon. You can rent traditional Korean clothes for about $5. Walk around for an hour and take some fun pictures. It is also very famous for its street food. However, I got to say that I didn't find the street food all that good. There is also a lack of things to do besides eating. Jeonju continues to try and improve this village and make it more enjoyable. It is fun for a few hours but I wouldn't suggest longer than that."
Delicious food and good view.,"You can wear HANBOK Dress. I think this place have a lot of activities to join. Delicious food, I like BIBIMBUB. If you come you can take a photo, so beautiful ^^ "
Beautiful Traditional Roofs,"I think this is one of the best Hanok village I've visited in Korea. This village is mix of old and new traditional style houses. Which is full of small shops and street food, There is a lot of guest house where you can stay as well. I saw a lot of people wearing Hanbok on the street. I believe you can also rent one as well if you want to experience it.You must try ""Choco pie"" at the PnB and ""JeonJu Bibimbap"""
"An Incredible Place to Visit in the Evening, Daytime, Anytime!","We visited Jeonju Hanok Village in the late afternoon and early evening with our daughter who lives in Jeonju and our son who lives elsewhere in South Korea. Wow! What an incredible place to see first-hand. There are many places here which sell food, and touristy items, but the main reason to come here is to see the lived-in dwellings and the unique architecture of the Hanok village. My son, who pays attention to things like this, told us that this village is constantly undergoing upgrading. I don't know if that is all good. Some of the older buildings are being torn down and newer, similar buildings are replacing them. We loved being here as evening set in and the lights came on. It has such a special atmosphere just to walk through this area as darkness came. Very, very beautiful. Nearby is a wooden bridge that crosses a stream - also worth a look. And lit up at night! I would love to come back here again. It was the highlight of our time in Jeonju."
Best Hanok in Korea,"A must see for anyone who likes traditional Korean villages, this is the best attraction in Jeonju and perhaps the best attraction in all of Korea. I have been to every major city and nearly all Korean villages, this is the best by far. The whole downtown area is filled with restaurants that serve some of the best food in Korea, and again I lived in Korea for 4 years and have eaten a lot of Korean food."
700 traditional Korean houses,"We visited the Jeonju Hanok village which is still home to residents today. It is the largest cluster of traditional houses in Korea. The well preserved old traditional streets, houses and structures (with mail boxes) make the Jeonju Hanok Village a popular tourist attraction. Many of the houses had large squash growing on their roofs.As part of our trip, with the help of an instructor, we made traditional mulberry fans to take home.We also tried on some traditional costumes and were surprised at the results."
Wish I could have stayed longer,This stop was part of the k shuttle tour.We only had 1.5 hours here. I wish we could have stayed a day here.It's a lovely charming village where one can rent a hanbok to walk around in. It's cute to see the young couples wearing these.There are plenty of shops and eateries nestled within the traditional hanks. I loved exploring all the narrow alleys.You won't be disappointed here.
Great traditional village,"This is a gorgeous traditional Korean village which is really enjoyable to walk around and look at all the housing which still holds the traditional Korean vibe. Slightly touristy but the majority of them are Korean, you can also see many Korean couples wearing the traditional dress and walking around taking pictures. Very cute"
Very good place to experience hanok style living,"Must try their local delights. All the street food is a must try!! Had a great time touring around, roughly 3d2n will suffice! They also have 7 routes for those who enjoy hiking. The trail can be found at hanok village. "
Korean-style house village in Jeonju,"Many Korean-style houses cluster in this village. Also, there are lots of cafes, restaurants, and street vendors. Thus, you can enjoy various foods at cheap prices. This place is very good for young couples to pass a day."
Picturesque little town going through a rejuvenation,"Jeonju Hanok Village is a small old town located in Jeonju itself. The town is not big and can be explored on foot in a few hours. However, I would recommend an overnight stay in a traditional hanok to fully experience the place. Furthermore there are quite a number of nice eating places in the village which one should not miss. We arrived at about three o'clock in the afternoon, stayed overnight and left the village at about two o'clock in the afternoon the next day. The village is picturesque, although I would not call it ancient, as one can witness the rejuvenation which the village is undergoing through. It would be a good idea to rent a traditional hanbok (Korean traditional costume) for a few hours and take beautiful pictures around the village. It would be pretty memorable."
Bustling colourful little village,"This was a bustling colourful little village with many quaint shops offering lots of different foods, souvenirs and stuff related to traditional Korea. For instance, we tried on the Hanbok for about 5000 won for half and hour and walked around taking photos with the many traditional houses in the background. We didn't feel awkward at all as there were many people doing what we did, Koreans and foreigners alike. There were also no shortage of eateries. In short, it is a very good area to do things that tourists do... eat, shop, take photographs, and the prices are reasonable. And everything is within the confines of walking distances."
A beautiful Jeonju,Jeonju Hanok village consists of 800 traditional houses. It is a nice place to enjoy traditional Korean culture. People can also wear hanbok while they go around this village. Don't forget to try choco pie if you have a chance to come here
Slow city Jeonju,"Jeonju hanok village is a traditional-style village located in the heart of Jeonju, housing over 800 traditional ""hanok"" style buildings. Nice place to enjoy traditional korean culture and to try traditional Jeonju bibimbap."
Over the top touristy but still enjoyable,"I was expecting quaint old style hanoks. Boy was I surprised to see the shiny new looking hanoks. This village is definitely more a tourist park rather than an actual village. No matter. It was still enjoyable for 1 day. 1.5 days max. There were tons of tourists, mostly local. My favorite place was actually the Confucian School since it was quuiet and peaceful, and beautiful in autumn. Do venture outside the village since it felt more normal and less amusement park."
You're in Jeonju for this reason,"Hanok Village is a heritage area featuring traditional Korean houses. This area is gazetted as a tourist attraction, most of the buildings are turned into shops for souvenirs, eateries, guests houses and attractions. For photographers and shoppers, this is heaven. There are a lot of intimate, secluded yet photogenic areas for photography. The prices of souvenirs, F&B and accomodation might be a little higher here in comparison to other parts of Jeonju. Some of the attractions in the village requires a fee. However, if you are dressed in traditional Korean outfits, you gain free access into them. If you are feeling a little lost, look for the nearest Information Booth, you can gain maps in English, Korean and Mandarin. The officers manning the booths do speak English and will be able to provide you with information about the village. Hanok Village is best explored on foot. Have good walking shoes. There is an alley, unknown mostly to even locals, which features shops selling hand-made products. My favourite is this particular shop which sells ceramic wares, cotton scarfs and natural gems / stones jewelry. The husband is the artist behind the ceramic ware and the wife runs the shop. Not too pricey either. There is also a cafe / restaurant which is situated in the highest building in the village. It offers the best skyline / view of Hanok Village. Check out the traditional tea houses a for a good experience. The must try food within the village: Churros, ice cream, squid on stick, bibimbap, grilled cheese on stick. Although commercialized, Hanok Village is the best spot to head to if you only have a day in Jeonju. It pretty much summarizes Jeonju and its most famous attraction in one area."
little old korean village,"it is the best place for a couple of days traveling, around 2hours by bus from seoul , the traditional houses are so much attractive , i spent a lot of time photographing there ... "
A very commercialized Hanok Village,"We visited the Hanok Village whilst we were in Jeonju for 2 days taking the train from Seoul. The village is quite a huge area with many beautiful traditional Korean houses and shops which sell a variety of merchandise and food. However, the area is very commercialized with every available buildings renovated for such purposes. The food and goods are rather expensive with mediocre products. The governor of Jeonju should ensure that the village retain some of the traditional buildings to showcase the Korean lifestyle of olden days to the visitors. The area is packed with tourists esp on weekends which you should avoid."
More kind of a Theme Park,"We read before about Jeonju and since it's the land of Bibimbap we decided that we must visit the place. Our B&B place next to the Hanok village was very good, called 'Becky Art Space' a very stylisch place and a very friendly Ruby who is always there to make it nice for you.The Hanok village was nice at first, but quickly turned out to be more like a Theme park with only shops that sell cheap souvenirs, mostly street food and people who want to be dressed as in the early days.Yes, a one day/night visit is worth but not to go back again."
Good-looking hanok houses and restaurants,"Jeonju Hanok Village is definitely a charmer, what with its traditional hanok yet lively atmosphere of modernity surrounding it. Though the grass and ground looks a little dead and often tan, the hanok are quite nice to see, and heading to Gyeonggijeon Shrine from here is a piece of cake."
Many things to do and attractions nearby,Just went there today and there's so many street food stalls and street stalls selling many things. There are many restaurants there as well and attractions like museums and historical sites all within walking distance. The village encompasses all of the above that I just mentioned and it's not just a village as I thought before going there.Definitely a must go in Jeonju!
Feel Korea in Jeonju Hanuk Village,"My trip to Jeonju had to be the best thing that happened to me while in Korea. The place looked so dreamy, like I was time warped back to the old days of Korea. The streets were entirely covered in cobblestones and most of the old houses were transformed into shops and small restaurants. Surprisingly, my trip to the Jeonju Hanuk Village Tourism Office was the most pleasant. The lady who was assigned in that office at that time was more than happy to help me with my purpose of visit. I was thankful that she could speak perfect English and that I was able to complete my trip to Jeonju and finally find my friend. The nice staffs and the kind policeman all helped a lost tourist find his way in Jeonju. That made me love Korea more than anything else. The choices of food is also amazin. Did not know where to start."
Extraordinary Endurance ,"Although the village is somehow small, I enjoyed wandering about it so much. It actually took me about three hours and half in ther. I stoped by various traditional shops. I found numerous attractive artfacts and korean stylish items.Its also a great place to take pictures n for selfies :).You can also take pictures with some people dressed in Korean gowns. Don't forget to start your journey in there with an icecream. There're some small n convenient dhops to icecream from."
Great Village,"Unlike some of the other Hanok Villages in Korea, Jeonju Hanok Village is a true living and working village. They're occupied, and the restaurants and shops are in Hanok style buildings. Most of them have been modernised, so they have windows, air con, heating etc, but you still get to see them in all their beauty.There are enough restaurants to suit everybody's tastes and Jeonju is home to the original bibimbap! Lots of those restaurants to choose from."
Beautiful village!,Lots of shops and attractions. Beautiful village and must see! I recommend staying at a local guest house if one is available. 
Only food and shops,It was totally different from what i expected. The village look traditional house style but actually it look built newly. It was kind of food street and shops rather than place you can experience very traditional culture. It was good for just one visiting. I wouldn`t go again.
Traditional goods in quaint old style village,"How do I love the Jeonju Hanok Village. The shops of cute souvenirs, of traditional art work, food food food. Tea shops. Ah. Old days of Korea LIVE."
Heaven for street foods,"Along the way in Jeonju Hanok Village you could find varieties kind of foods and beverages. Let me break down it for you, so you couldn't miss it when you visit this slow city of Jeonju.1. Choco pie of PnB Bakery, this pie is consisted of chocolate, strawberry jam, nuts coated with chocolate. as long as i remember it gonna cost you 1600 won each. it is located at the big crossroad, or you could ask whoever where is PnB.2. Shrimp mandu. despite of this shrimp mandu they provide you some kinds of dumpling, ranging from vegetable, pork, etc.3. Deep fried squid, so crunchy yet so delicate. this one gonna cost no more than 10000 won. 4. if you want to find something for your lunch, you need to try either Jeonju bibimbab or tteokgalbi. tteokgalbi is like patty, grilled on hot plate.You could wear hanbok and take picture all the way around the village. hanbok gonna cost you only 5000 won for 90 mins. you could experience the Korean oldies in Jeonju."
Exciting,"We asked friends to take us to see a traditional Korean home. They took us to Jeonju Hanok Village. What we didn't know until we arrived is that one of the Korean Dramas we like was filmed there. We even stayed the night in one of the traditional homes, so cool."
Charming 'Old Town' of Jeonju,"Must-see attraction when visiting Jeonju. Marvel at 'old' Korean architecture lovingly re-created in Jeonju's Old Town (all buildings are new, but have been built in the traditional old Korean 'hanok' style). The old town buzzes with life throughout the year and features countless little stores, restaurants and galleries as well as museums (wine museum, paper museum, traditional medicine museum, king's portrait gallery, etc.). You can even rent a hanbok (traditional Korean attire) and stroll around the hanok village (as the old town is also called) and enjoy some bibimbap (rice with mixed vegetables). The only downside about the Old Town is that it gets awfully crowded on weekends, especially if the weather is nice."
You want food on a stick?...you got it!,"Stayed for a couple of days and was rather impressed with everything really. Easy train journey from Youngsan (Seoul) and then a short bus or taxi from the station.The original buildings (hanok) were really quite beatiful and if you fancy it, you can complete the experience by dressing up in traditional clothes (hanbok)...everybody does it!The vibe seems to be walking around, shopping, eating, chatting...very relaxed.For when you're hungry just head to the main street for a large variety of stuff on a stick (chicken and cheese, squid, octopus to name but a few), a really popular dumpling shop (really good) or even churros! There are many shops selling all kinds, but my favourite are a couple who sell products made with Korean paper...really lovely.Even got to see a traditional show (didn't understand it...but still :-) )Had a great couple of days...would definitely recommend :-)"
take a step back in time,"Right in the heart of downtown Jeonju, this is a unique place to visit. When you come here, you can see how many Koreans used to live back in the day. The wooden houses are great, and you can learn a lot about how Koreans used to live. You can also dress up in old style Hanbok ! "
A mix of modern and traditional,"Jeonju Hanok Village is approximately a 2 hours bus ride from Nopo bus terminal in Busan. Buses are comfortable coaches with lots of leg space. Just be advised that the buses leaves on the dot, very punctual. Once you reach the Jeonju Intercity/Express Bus Terminal, take bus 5-1 or 79 to the village. It's about a 20 minutes bus ride and you get off at Jeondong Cathedral. Remember to listen out or keep an eye on the stop to get off as our bus driver didn't informed us when we reached the stop. We only asked when we saw many youngsters getting off at this station and they looked like local tourists as well. Anyway, the village is about a 5 minutes walk from the village.This place has a very touristy feel to it but yet it still maintains the traditional Hanok architecture. You can also rent the traditional costumes from shops all over and wear it around while exploring the village. Food, drinks, souvenirs, local produce are all available here. There are also plenty of hanok guesthouses here if you would like to spend a night or longer.Gyeonggi Palace is here as well but I think they charge an entrance fee. Worth checking out if you are taking a day trip to Jeonju."
"Beautiful, romantic recommended for couples of any age","Beautiful place, full off traditional restaurants and a Portuguese style cathedral, making it a wholly cultural experience, at night time the Korean lanterns go on, lining the small, stone foot streams and decorative fountains making this a very romantic experience for any couples in the area"
Worthy only as a dining and shopping experience,"Supposedly it's an old village, but in practice while the old village is there, it is mostly a bunch of touristic shops and restaurants. "
Enjoyed it more than I thought I would.,"I didn't expect much from it to be honest but wow I was very impressed by how touristy the place was, yet it didn't feel like an overblown tourist trap. Really enjoyed walking and exploring around the area and eating the delicious food. A lot of korean restaurants and famous bibimbap places within the village as well. "
Very Organised Old Village,You can appreciate the old architecture and at the same time enjoy the best of the Korean and world food.. Definitely worth visiting the town.
"Maybe not ""very"" good, but good nonetheless","Appears we were lucky that we went on a rainy Monday, as the ""hordes"" described earlier weren't evident until much later in the day. For tourists, it's fine--you can see some traditional houses, although many have been rebuilt and don't look all that old. There's lots of small things to snack on, and our friends took us to a couple of ""famous"" restaurants: we had a bowl of noodles at one that was good, but we were told it used to be 500W and is now 6000W (and smaller in size).As it wasn't packed, it was interesting for us to see Koreans walking around in traditional clothes taking photos. All in all a good day out."
A must visit,"This is a great place to visit whether you are visiting Korea or live here. It is very touristy, but the palace is still a great experience complete with people in costume. Jeonju Hanok Village is perhaps most famous, however, for its food. particularly its unique makgeolli"
Extremely crowded but worth it!,"The small homes and buildings in this area really are one of a kind to Korea. There isn't any other area where you can see so many of these building in this semi-modern fashion. Therefore, it is worth a trip to see and walk around. There are plenty of gifts to buy and food to eat. With that being said, be prepared for a tremendous amount of people flooding the area...and long lines for snacks and stuff."
Overpraised,"Just visited Jeonju for the first time since 2008. Very disappointed at the gentrification/commercialization/Disneyfication of the hanok village. The charm, sadly, is gone. Most of the 'hanok' are really just new buildings in hanok style, rather than vintage or historic hanok. Nearly all of the hanok with street frontage are shops, restaurants or cafes, many of them offering the same products. Off the main streets, you might still find some purely residential buildings, but even in the backstreets many homes have been turned into guesthouses -- or knocked down and re-built as guesthouses. The truly historic buildings that are national monuments and are labeled as such are of course worth visiting. My advice is don't bother with the hanok village at all on weekends, but maybe come on a weekday in the off-season if you happen to be in the area."
A tourist trap worth visiting,This place is a complete tourist trap full of Chinese and Korean tourists. It's about a 3 hour bus ride from Seoul and is worth a day trip. It's the most impressive collection of Hanok type buildings in the country and has some nice restaurants and cafes.
Gorgeous,"The entire village is gorgeous, especially go up to the hill and you can see the entire village. It should be a fantastic view during the spring and autumn time.It is full of tourist (no matter local or overseas). A place worth to go."
It should be called JeonZOO,"We have visited EVERY Hanok village in Korea except the one in Jeju. Jeonju should be called Jeonzoo. Japanese destroyed almost everything culturally antique and heritage quality in Korea during their brutal occupation and then the Koreans proceeded to do the same by building monstrously ugly, concrete everything. This village is actually a neighborhood in a really ugly city (all Korean cities are ugly). It is close to Seoul. About 2 to 3 hours drive and hence everyone comes here renting vintage clothing and moving around with a squid stick in one hand and a selfie stick in another. By 8 AM in the weekend it is a perfect zoo. Most of the houses are new. Architecturally these are interesting but the entire neighborhood indeed feels like Disneyland. If you want to go, try to spend one night and go during weekday. I have never seen this many foreigners outside of Seoul anywhere in Korea either. No good restaurants. Most everyone is selling desserts or other packaged crap. For first 30 minutes or so, it is kind of a novelty for some people but then it becomes extremely tiring to fight the crowd. We spent two entire days and nights there and never, even at 6 AM there was any silence at all. The tourist office is nice and helpful. From the bus station, take taxi for about $5 US. The ride takes less than 15 minutes. There are immense number of guesthouses. Basically almost 99% of the homes are guesthouses. The entire thing is fake. It is NOT a village. Take tourism out and everything will collapse."
Ok.,This place was cute and nice for a casual stroll. I would not go out of my way to see it though. The area was largely a crowded tourist trap.
"omg, super beautiful place!","I heard its crowded most time, but when i visited there it was okay.there are too much delicious food and beautiful view!!I wanna go there again!And, if you visit Jeonju, Korea, you should go there!!!! "
Traditional Hanok,"Besides tradional Hanok, the place was just a shopping and dinning centre, nothng in particular, it was better to tour the tradional market and you could see something more."
Magnificent historical place,"It is absolutely stunning, vast and impressive. I think I can spend days walking through these intimate, historical grounds and I personally would advise going out the first time with a local tour guide or with a tour group and later on spending several hours or maybe 1 or 2 days in a stay temple order to be able to understand the heritage in the construction of the houses as well as the architecture and temples' history that tell Korea's history itself."
Beautiful village..,"C1 ( 2015.05.21 ) This village was very famous for Korean-style house. Though there was not as much as I expected, it was certain that there was beautiful. There was various food, seeing, and traditional structures. Walking this area was very good to know about Korean people's atmoshpere, I think. Around there, many attraction located. Too many shop and restaurant was not good to me, but good place."
Pleasant Stroll,"We took a bus from Seoul Terminal Station. It took about 2.5 hours. With a list and map in hand, we took a cab over to the Jeonju Hanok Village. There was a lot of construction going on with a mix of fancy restaurants and newly built traditional bed and breakfasts. It's mainly a tourist spot for local folks. We found a place and had bibimbap, which Jeonju is known for. We also sampled the shrimp mandu, octopus skewers, and chicken skewers in which I thoroughly enjoyed. We also saw Pb bakeries on every street corner selling the choco pie. I personally was not a fan of it, but I think it's a nostalgic snack for Koreans. There were a few galleries we checked out. Shops started to close around 5pm. Then we hopped onto a cab and headed out to the Yetchon Makgeolli."
Korean traditional mix,"It was Sunday and many peoples most Koreans filled the streets of this nice place ,there are many Hanok houses (more then in Seoul Hanok village) there were women and men dressed on traditional costumes, stalls with traditional Korean food,traditional wine museum, go to see it all and mix with Korean local people."
Enjoyable,"Such a pretty village in Jeonju! Well-worth spending a few hours here and munching on the street food. I found it to be the best in all of South Korea! Try the meatballs and squid. We went up to Omokdae for a view, but thought that the view from the high cafes were much better. On the tourist maps there were paper-making or craft activities, but sadly it was either all in Korean or we were not able to find."
Must visit for the area,"Lots of Korean guest house in the area, can try book them for about 50,000 won per night.Good feel of tradition meets modern... while preserving the historical buildings and cultural establishments, lots of good restaurants and cafes, nice small shops, museums and park, not mentioning the cherry blossoms in spring, ginkgo in winter... you can also try Korean paper making... so much more to explore in this area.Korean people will rent traditional cloths around the area too..."
Lots to see and do,"Really nice place to visit to see traditional Korean housing. The day we went wasn't as bust as I've heard it can be. There is lots of different foods to try, I'd recommend trying the street food such as the PNB chocco pie's and the shrimp mandu! Fun to walk around in the traditional hanboks (clothing). Worth a day trip."
Fun,"Lots of fun food to try, people walking around in traditional Korean hanbok, museums, including the making of soju. We didn't try the palace, but probably would have if we had more time. Overall, a nice day."
There's the last son of Chosun Dinesty,"The 'seung guang jae ' is a his house where is in the jeonju hanok ma_eul. AndThere are many good restaurant, much of story. Jeonju is the hometown of royal family of Chosun."
"Traditional Houses, Also A Tourist Trap.","Although it is a tourist trip, it is still interestingly enough to warrant a visit down here.There is quite a lot (around 800?) hanok-style buildings to look at and take amazing photos with. Also the food, there are food stalls all over the place, you can even buy squid or octopus on a stick (which is quite delicious). There are also small souvenir shops that sell hand made crafts, as well as the traditional souvenir crap you can buy elsewhere, maybe a bit more pricier here though.If you have limited time in Jeonju, this would be recommended as a priority visit before any of the other sights in the city."
A taste of traditional Korean village,"Located about 15-20 minutes drive by taxi to Hanok Village. It was really a big traditional Korean village (about 800 houses). I had a chance to walk around Hanok village at night and day as I was staying at the nearby guesthouse. It was really beautiful view at night. There are lots of people (young couples & family) strolling around the village at night. There are lots of shops selling souvenir, foods & authentic Korean restaurant."
Avoid busy weekends,"I think the Hanok village was a nice place with fine houses and a lot of interesting things you can eat and drink. They had some museums, but most of them were only in Korean though. The village was packed with Koreans and a little too busy for me to really appreciate it. Would recommend to go there during the week."
A well preserved hanok village,"We were amazed since we arrived at the parking lot. The place was beautiful. I read that Jeonju Hanok Village is better than one in Seoul. A big village with many traditional Korean houses in a very well preserved condition. The houses were occupied, not just for sightseeing. So only some that we can enter.Many Korean young couples walking around together.Never feel bored while taking a walk in the village. So many places to see. There was a small flower garden with blooming tulips in one part of the village. Very beautiful.After that, you can get the long cone ice cream or eat bibimbab."
The home of bibimbap!,"I went there last May with my two friends. What can I say.. This village is soo beautiful!We stayed there for one night at hanok style guesthouse and we had a very pleasant experience at this guesthouse. I will review the guesthouse seperately. The guesthouse owner gave us free map and point out must visit places in this village, including where to find good places to eat local food, snacks and of course the famous jeonju bibimbap! It was very nice strolling around this village.. So beautiful and clean. So many food stalls and souvenir shops."
Interesting,Nice area with plenty of restaurants and coffee houses. Easy to walk to and quite interesting. There are houses in the Hanok Village that are traido also in character but not so sure that they are old. Look like Nes builds to me.
Fantastic Experience,"Visiting the village is great, you can get a little taste of traditional Korea. There are many little stores to wonder through, as well as watching traditional paper being made. There are many other crafty things to do in the village as well. DEFINITELY try some Jeonju bibimbap! You will not be disappointed. For those who enjoy history, you should visit Gyeonggijeon Shrine, where the portrait of King Taejo is kept. "
Very nice street food & Bingsu,"All the street food looked and smell very nice. Grandma's Best's Bingsu is really very good, with brilliant seasame taste."
Worth the visit,"Yes, it is commercialized but my goodness, is it beautiful!This is the type of place that is common in Europe - cute and preserved village but no real ""authentic"" feel - Espelette in France, for example. OK, so with that in mind, enjoy the beautifully preserved buildings, shop and enjoy a place that has so many Korean tourists as well. Be in the moment and be grateful for the opportunity to see so much beautiful architecture. The portrait gallery toward the church was a lovely visit and antidote to the commercialization. Also, wander off the main streets and explore the small alleys."
Good place for photography,"Actually the village is really like a tourist park. I saw a lot of houses that are newly built, just the same old style.However it still a good place for photography with old style house, small street, the old Catholic Church and Royal place are verry beautiful.You can enjoy this place in one day."
tourist theme park,"an awful disappointment as the whole place choked with tourists and every Hanok house either a homestay , art gallery, cafe, restaurant or crystal healing space. To add to this the Christian religious nutters were chasing about prophesying the second coming. The Seoul hag ok area is much more authentic. Not worth coming to Jeonju. "
Perfect Getaway,We visited here on a rainy November day and couldn't have enjoyed ourselves more. So many shops and restaurants and lovely streets to stroll. We definitely want to return because you need much more than one day to appreciate all that Jeonju has to offer. 
commercialized but nice,"Lots of food, lots of quaint homes to look at. People are super friendly. Too many people handing out religious weirdness flyers (if you have a certain type of acupuncture, you have been injected with the mark of the beast--what?~! they were all over the place) cool to see young ppl rent hanboks and take selfies all day long. "
Great historical walk with interesting shops outside the village,"An interesting cultural place to walk around in Jeonju to get to know the older generation living lifestyle and their architectural design. I'm actually quite amazed on how well they can built those houses during their era.The place is big enough and it was not crowded as people are scattered around.After you visited Hanok village, you can walk around the shops featuring different local food and souvenir shop. Expect to spend around at least half a day here."
Nice traditional village,"Last October, we visited Jeonju Hanok Village. You may spend 3 to 4 hours of touring around the village. I felt like I traveled back to ealier Korean times when I was in the village. Despite of being crowded due to the Bibimbap festival, it was overall a pleasant cultural experience for me. Speaking of bibimbap, you should eat bibimbap when in Jeonju! It is one of their specialty dishes and I can attest that it is very delicious too! There are also souvenir shops in the village but things are but pricey. Also, you should try the PNB chocopie. It is the best chocopie i have tasted thus far. "
Worth a visit,"Spent a couple of hours here. There are some attractive traditional style buildings but most are actually modern or replicas. It gets very busy at weekends, queues for dining are quite extreme. Lots of restaurants and street food, gift shops and a particularly good art gallery where photos are printed onto the traditional Korean canvas."
"expensive Bibimbab, good to walk around","Think the village has been changed many things compared with the past...Lots of unidentified food(I dont think those were korean) were along the path from the entrance. But the taste was better than my thought:) I'd like to strongly recommend to try Strawberry sticky rice cake. What a sensational food! haIt was a shame that I did not stay at one of the accommodation in the village. The village has many rooms and some lodges are open to public for a few hours in order to show tourists. Hanok village inside have been well-maintained and some Hanok lodges are still under construction.By the way, I think the bibimbab price was pretty expensive. The restaurant is located at the entrance of the Hanok-village. The restaurant seemed already famous for the food I think. If I visit Jeon-ju again, I will find out another better and cheaper bibimbab restaurant for sure."
It depends on where you are. ,"It depends on where you are. Just visit nearby place where you are, Bukcheon in Seoul, Here, Yangdong Hanok Village. Buildings are not so old actually. Mainly from 1910s or around. Instead, Jeonju city itself is a meca of food. Especially Bibimbap and Makgeolri. Makgeolri has two different types. Here, that is flour Makgeolri. South east part of Korean peninsular, that is rice Makgeolri. "
Good but crowd during Korea holiday,"It was just like Chinese style culture street in China where you could found traditional hanok, snacks, drinks, performance there. Good to relax here for afternoon. The map here is not correct, which is pointed at city hall (1km away from the destination). We finally reach by following the car sign and visitors."
Touristy but okay area,You know what you're getting. Great for street food and window shopping. Mostly Koreans from other towns going to hang out. Was at least entertains but not a must go.
Massive Tourist Trap,"The Jeonju Hanok Village is certainly popular, as attested to be the impossibility of getting a parking spot anywhere nearby and the throngs of people in the streets! That being said, tourist traps generally do have lots to do and this one is no exception. There is no end to the shops and restaurants who are looking to take your money and you could certainly spend a lot of time here. The village is well kept and very aesthetically pleasing, though it doesn't appear very authentic. The restored ancient complex in the center of the village is rather sterile and I have seen many that are essentially the same, only perhaps not quite as expansive, throughout Korea. On the positive side, it was cheap to get into. We arrived in the evening and there was a troupe of musicians and flag wavers proceeding through the streets and stopping on every corner where they were drawing a throng to watch them. I must admit they were interesting but they also gave the area a bit of a circus atmosphere."
We enjoyed our strolls through the village,It is fun to stroll through the village. There are good maps in English (although no tours in English) and good restaurants to choose from. Houses are being rebuilt (or built from the ground up using the traditional architecture) and it is looking very good.
"Very nice for a stroll, interesting area.","The Hanok Village is very nice for a stroll, especially a bit away from the most touristy streets. Lovely old buildings and some very interesting history to it. Plenty of nice traditional Korean restaurants in the area as well. Hanok Village is a must when visiting Jeonju. "
Where is Hanok or Tradition Whatsoever?,"There are virtually no Hanok houses in this village. The streets are full of fancy bars and expensive restaurants that allude extravagant young people and unknowing tourists. Bibimbab is very expensive but it tastes so bad. Many foot massage shop and no traditional art shop.It's just streets of no culture but a commercialized fake tradition that was sponsored by local government that probably spent millions of dollars of tax to create this artificial traditional looking ""amusement park streets"""
A mixture of traditional insadong and modern cafe,"If you are looking for traditional Korea but want to have a taste at its modern culture Jeonju hanok village is the perfect place. If you go on weekends expect very long queue. There are a lot of hanok guesthouses available around the place, although pricey it's worth it if you want to have a nice slow weekend. Food to try including- ddeokgalbi- famous jeonju bibimbab- kongnamul gukbab- sundae And for the modern- churros- sausages- choco pie- popsiclesI went to some alleys near the hanok village parking lot and there was a cafe that served really good traditional teas."
sukaaaa,"hanok village-nya menarik. sukaaaaa banget. i love this place..hihihii. its pretty nice, the weather, the atmosphere. sightseeing on foot is my favorite. Jeonju is famous with its bibimbap, so you should try ones. soooooo tasty! and i went to jeonju by bus, its a free shuttle bus for foreigners. you just need to sign up then reserve your travel, back and forth. i was there for one day trip. they will pick you up on 5pm, just don't be late or you'll be stranded there. hihihiii.."
Great shops and architecture,"Great for walking and people watching. And if you like ice cream, there sell it at almost every store. "
Amazing town,"Been to the Hanok villages in Seoul, Gyeongju and Jeonju, and Jeonju tops the list. Wandering in the folk village you will feel like you are walking on streets hundred years ago, with people still living in and running small businesses. Great food, snack and coffee. Must try the bibimbap inside the west alley of the shrine, the snowflakes ice cream at a cafe next to Revolution Memorial Hall with a 500 years old giant tree in the garden, Tomorrow cafe has the best 3rd floor view.Hanok Hostels are everywhere so you can go around and check if there is anyone with the most lovely terrace or garden and experience the traditional life for one night."
Good place for photo shooting~,"The hanok village is a Must-go place if you are in Jeonju. So many restaurant available here that make you feel like you are eating in a historical house. Exterior that is so traditional with Modern Interior, It is really nice and harmonizes combination."
Beautiful Hanok Village,"Lovely looking hanoks (Korean traditional houses). I had pleasant time walking around the village. You need at least 2-3 days to visit the attractions. I stayed at Bukyungdang Guesthouse in Jeonju Hanok Village for 2 nights. Most (if not all) of the attractions are within walking distance. There's a Tourist Information Center to guide you too. Do visit during the weekdays as weekend can be quite crowded. Plenty of souvenirs shops. Do hunt around for cheaper bargain if you have time. Try kalguksu and mandu at Veteran Restaurant, PNB Bakery for its choco pies and patbingsu when you're tired."
A couple of days in Jeonju…is more than enough time.,"I recommend going on a weekday, or whenever there will be lesspeople. Hanok is nice enough, but my personal have were the choco pies!check out my blog post for a detailed account. http://www.girlwhodoeslunch.com/2014/06/jeonju.html"
"Commercialized, but Pleasant","Mainly a place to go souvenir shopping, but still very beautiful and interesting. The royal portrait hall is a restful and cool spot on a hot day."
"If you don't mind queuing for the food, it's ok to visit this place.","Before I came to Jeonju, I asked my friend what should I do there and what kind of food should I eat. She recommended some kind of baguette and choco pie (PNB Bakery). When I arrived at Jeonju traditional village, it was sooooo crowded because it's a long weekend in Korea (Children's day on Monday and Buddha's birthday on Tuesday). It's so easy to find the baguette and choco place, because there were very long queue in each place, like really long. I gave up eventually so I don't know the taste of the baguette and choco pie.Jeonju is also famous for the bibimbap (Korean traditional dish, rice mixed with veggies and meat). I queued in front of the restaurant (this one is shorter than the queue in baguette and choco pie place), but honestly the taste of the bibimbap is not special, just like a regular bibimbap that I usually eat in Korea."
Jeonju Hanok Village,"We went to the Hanok Village half expecting a theme park where you had to pay an admission fee for entry. However, that was not the case. The Hanok Village is a series of traditional Korean houses grouped together in a public area. You could just walk around the area, no admission fee and the like. These huts are mainly used to house shops and restaurants. I suppose you could get a feel of old Korea by walking along the streets. It was really crowded with locals when we visited as it was on a weekend. There were a number of restaurants to eat at (apparently Jeonju is famous for its bimbibap) but I think its just marketing. We had our lunch at Veteran Noodles (selling noodles and dumplings) it was quite satisfying, Its worth a visit if you are in the area. A lot of beautiful houses with very nice gardens. Maybe 2-3 hrs. Kindly note that driving at this area is quite hard cause traffic is quite dense. Parking requires some skill :)."
A great living ancient village,Hanok Village is the largest preserved old Korean village. People actually live in this  village; residents have to make renovations keeping with older architecture. The main street fronts are converted souvenir shops and food places. Visit the alleyways to see the more truly interesting buildings in ancient setting. The women in this area are known as the best Korean cooks. I guess that is why this area is the origin of the bibimbab dish. There are many learning centers such as bibimbab making classes (we ate what we learned to make and it was delicious).
Hungry?,"While I was going to Jeonju I thought the Hanok Village would be a culture-oriented spot. But once I got there, I realized almost everything was about food! Ddeokgalbi, patbingsoo, mandu, sandwiches, choco pies, bakeries, traditional pastries... Everything delicious (and expensive!). We got to experience Korean culture as well after paying to get to a temple, which was very entertaining :) Jeonju is known as the food-capital in Korea and if you want to know why, you'll have to vist the Hanok Village (I hope you are not on a diet, though..)"
Must see!,Very pretty place with nice food and environment! Recommend to stay there for one night and immerse yourself in the real traditional korean house! Must try their bibimbap and the icecream with edible flowers (Its near a folk museum).
A Must See in Jeonju,"This part of town feels like the Korea that any tourist is looking for. It captures the ancient style of Asian architecture and modernizes it with fun shops and interesting attractions. Get lost in the small backstreets and discover beautiful yards and houses. It's hard to take a bad picture in this village, because every turn is something interesting."
Tourist area with nice and cosy restaurants,Like - the Hanok guesthouses are centralised in this area.Dislike - too crowded because a lot of tourists.
Okay for half an hour,"Another place on my tour where many new buildings have been mocked up in between a few older ones. Sadly, every other building has been converted into a kiosk selling candy floss ( blue or pink), coffee or ice cream, with the rest seemingly restaurants. This was a great example of how to mess up a cultural site with unrestrained commercialisation and mismanagement. On the plus side, I found it quite fun seeing how the South Koreans seemed to love this place. I wouldn't go out of your way to see this but if you are around, pop in and have a good laugh."
"Touristy, try the workshops","The Hanok Village itself is rather touristy with most of the buildings being commercial.It's a nice date course and there are some food places on this but think disneyland... it feels a bit fake. The best food is inside the city and the good stuff around this area can be pricey. There are lines everywhere for some of the food and especially for the local choco pie.. but, you can get the PNB choco pie elsewhere in the city as well. Still, it is convenient if you're just looking for a nice date/shopping/sights trip. Walk around a bit, see the 경기전 Gyeonggijeon and then go do a workshop. Around the north side of the Hanok village, there are some workshops. We tried the hanji stuff and made hanji covered boxes. If you have kids, they will probably like this. It was about 7,000 won for a dish like thing and 10,000 for a pencil case/box.On a side note: Mondays are dead. Nearly everything is closed. We ended up going to Mt. Maisan and seeing the Tapsa Temple (very recommended)."
A combination of interesting and tourist trap,"The hanok village is a fun place to go visit for a day or two. Their are a few things I thought were interesting, like the museum on makeoli, where they do demonstration on home brewing. Getting there from anywhere in the city is easy by cab. As far as the shrines and tours go, their are a few in English but they are really drawn out, and I felt like they were a bit boring, especially if you're not interested in which Korean dramas were filmed where. The food in the area is generally good, but expensive, and if you go on weekends prepare to grab a ticket from a machine and wait up to 40minutes for food. Trinkets and souvenirs are also pricy. I'd you plan to try bibimbap it's better to go somewhere else.If you're looking for a place to store your bags the information office will keep them for free, but they do have lockers around the corner for about 1000won. Also, be prepared to inadvertently be photo-bombing people regularly, because it was a photo frenzy when we went. There's an orange chocopie place that's worth checking out, but that line is huge usually. The street food is generally good though if you want to skip the waiting.You'll get to see. Bunch of traditional Korean houses in the area, but some spots have poor drainage, so be aware of marshy parts. You can cover everything in the village I one busy day, or two casual ones. "
Excellent place to spend a day or two,"Lots to see and a lot of affordable traditional souvenirs (crafts, wines, soaps) to take home. And check out Cafe Madang, the owner is so sweet and cheerful. She barely speaks english but she gladly help me find my way to my hotel. "
Wonderful attraction,Well worth the visit. Lots of old styled Korean houses (Hanok). There are many laneways and interesting shops as well. Picture of a hanok covered in snow is simply beautiful. The experience will be better if you follow a free guided tour offered by the local management. Would totally do a hanok stay if I am visiting again.
If you're in jeonju,"If you are in Jeonju, of course you have to go check it out. Now I heard sometimes they make demonstration about how to make soju and stuff like that, I guess I wasn't there at the right time.Some interesting stuff to see however. I liked the hanji places where you could see traditional paper."
Not to be missed,"It is an old Korean style house village located in a beautiful setting. At the time of our visit it was full of lovely yellow gingko trees. We spent the whole morning roaming around this interesting place where many of the old houses have been converted to inns, shops and restaurants. A short walk up to ""Omokdae"" is worthwhile as it has the best viewing and photo point for the entire village. The Jeonju Confucian School and the Gyeonggijeon hall are not to be missed also. The latter looks like a royal palace of the Joseon Dynasty, is a museum of Jeonju history. We ate at a restaurant on Taejo Road in the village which served very tasty Korean style panfried pork and Bibimbap (I think its No. 19 on the list of recommended restaurants provided by the Tourist Information centre at the entrance of the parkig lot). It was full at lunch time so we had to queue up for a while but its worth it. The waiters were efficient and friendly. The total bill came up to only 21000 won (about 20 US$).The staff at the Tourist Information Centre were very helpful. Although they speak very little English, one of the ladies helped us call a taxi (on a rainy afternoon) and explained to the driver where we wanted to go. The assistant of the free shuttle bus between Seoul and Jeonju was also extremely helpful and friendly too."
Very traditional old township,"It is a very traditional old township and is good their government still maintain it un-like other cities replace it with sky scraper. It is well maintain and they have an information center to help us around, good work."
Take your time to walk around this quaint village,"as soon as the taxi driver turned into the village we were immediately transported back in time! The atmosphere there was so tranditional... however not quiet coz there is a school there as well as group of kids on school trips. But get into the alleyways and you will find amazing architecture, and gorgeous antique and handcrafts. The village is not that big, but you can easily kill half a day there just wondering around, then take a (long) break at one of the tea houses."
Small and poorerly maintained,"As I came from Seoul, the traditional Korean village was not much to see. Very simple structure and not worth the trip. "
Good for travel.,"Jeonju is the very tranditional place. What a greatest Korean food that I've eat, and the good experienced place. Hanok village was awesome to travel. Also, the H&T Consulting has the best tour programs for us. Good Tours !!"
Preserving Traditions,"The last time I was in South Korea was 20+ years ago. Returning this year, I was surprised at how modern it has become. My grandfather's once beautiful home is now the site of a large condominium. While it is wonderful to see the development and experience the prosperity of South Korea, I was saddened by the loss of the traditional. Jeonju Hanok Village brought back the traditional experience for me. A wonderfully designed village with authentic Hanok guesthouses...Delightful and beautiful. Wonderful stream / tree lined streets to walk through with many cafes and restaurants. Hoping to return soon!"
Traditional Village - mixed with modern style,"I am very excited visit the village, not because of the object it selt, but because surrounded with small shops, restaurant, cafes and hotels.For me it's mixed cultural and modern living. I like to explore it...."
Beautiful Village,"The Jeonju Hanok Village is something similar to Bukchon Hanok Village but I feel that Jeonju Hanok Village is more lively. There are many interesting museum too eg, paper museum and wine museum. I visited during summer so it is extremely sunny and hot so best is to bring umbrella and wear shades.

"More traditional, more genuine Korea..","You will find Jeonju traditional village is like Insa-dong (shops, cafe, restaurants, etc..) but less commercial, more genuine (you can see the local people are still living around here) and more thing to see. Everything is so nearby in Jeonju, so you can just walk around half a day, then it would be enough. So don't miss out Jeonju if you have a few more days in Korea."
The entrance of Hanok village,Its a nice place have many cultural old houses and a temple or a small palace along with some art gallery and restaurants delivers cultural food and some western food as well.
Jeonju Hanok Village,"While the Hanok Village is great to see, it is not the historical site it is marketed as. I understand that the original buildings would not have stood the test of time, but most of the village appears to be new buildings which takes away from some of the atmosphere. That said you do get to see/experience traditional crafts, etc and there is an abundance of restaurants to enjoy. I would recommend you try Veteran for their fantastic dumplings"
Nice place,"The buildings are pretty, though most have been rebuilt. However, don't expect any ancient atmosphere here. The place is thoroughly modern and a tourist trap -- with expensive eateries, etc. However, it is the nicest part of Jeonju city to stay in."
Check for events,"Hanok Village in Jeonju is always charming and interesting, but it's much better when something is going on. There are often events when the weather is nice, so just find out when they are before you take the time to go.The village itself is not far from the downtown area of Jeonju and makes for a nice walk before or after visiting. There are tea houses, museums, small temples, a nice short hike up a hill to a pavillion, and traditional-style homes to look at. Don't be afraid to go off the main path; you can find some real treasures down roads that look like there's nothing of interest.The village shuts down pretty early though, and Koreans tend not to be morning people, so plan to go in the afternoon. And be sure to bring a camera."
Modern & Traditional Hanok,"What is perhaps most unique about Jeonju's Hanok village is how the core community has adapted into the 21st century. While there are quite a few traditional (authentic) buildings within the village, much of what we see today has been built in the last 10-20 years. There are numerous traditional tea houses, souvenir shops, and restaurants.Above all the best activity for this village is to just stroll around, appreciate the beautiful buildings (old & new), and enjoy delicious food. Bibimbap is a local speciality, and is served nearly everywhere. Jeonju is a fairly large city, but visiting Jeonju Hanok village makes the city much more local and enticing."
True Korea,"The village gives you an authentic taste of Korea, great photo ops and delicious food. Its easy to spend the whole day walking around seeing the traditional village and paper making. Even learn how rice cakes are made and eat them freshly made!"
Great day trip!,"Visit the Hanok Village when the weather is nice. It's a surprisingly large area, and you'll want to explore every nook and cranny. There's a number of restaurants and coffee shops inside, as well as small historical museums. I visited with friends early in the day, thinking we'd be bored after a couple of hours, but we didn't leave until after sundown! Jeonju bibimbap is famous; you'll find it on almost every menu. It's delicious, cheap and vegetarian!"
Let's Get Traditional,"Located on the south-west coast of Korea, lies the traditional city of Jeonju with their decodant, old streets in Hanok Village. In this area of the city, anyone~tourist or neighbor~can see Korea from the aspect of the old with traditional dances, foods, and architecture. It also has the oldest Catholic Church in the country and there are plenty of different hiking ranges in the area~Martyr's Mountain and Moaksan to name a couple. You can also walk around the former palace grounds of the kings. Hanok Village is truely something to marvel, experience and enjoy."
Mixture of Traditional & Modern,"Being the recipient of a free shuttle bus ticket to Jeonju from Seoul given by the Visit Korea committee, I was just too happy to visit Jeonju, dubbed as the most beautiful city in Korea & thehome of the most delicious bibimbap. Our bus stopped right there in the Jeonju Hanok Villagewhich is the main attraction here & a must-see. This is one of the biggest & well-preserved Hanok Village in Korea & you can feel the ambience of how it used to be. I was there on a Sunday, so there were so many people congregating there, with so many selling handicrafts,souvenirs & fooditems. There were also some who entertained the crowd with their music like the accordion,the violin & the organ. It was such a lively & interesting place."
Lovely and great food,"We did not expect much, but the village is really nice. Jeonju is a big city and within there is the old Hannok village. There are some beautiful houses, well preserved and some are being built in the same style. Many people are still living there. Small alleys every where. Along the bigger streets there are some great looking restaurants, cafes, shops and traditional snacks, but all in the Hannok style. We had the ox tale soup, was delicious! You can visit the old palace for 1000 won, there is also a big church. And no cars allowed so you can walk peacefully. There is no entrance fee for the village.From the bus terminal you can take a taxi, that is not more than 5000 won (3€) From there you can not walk, it is quite a distance. Keep in mind that Sundays are busy with Korean tourists and getting a bus back to Gwangju, Seoul etc is more difficult, and you could up waiting a few hours to catch a bus back."
Easy accessible and interesting,"Hanok village is located in the southern part of town and easy accessible. You can freely walk around between the historic houses. The village gives a good impression how it used to be, although you cannot enter the houses. On the backside is a small hill that give a good view over the village. Also you can visit the fan exhibition. All and all it´s an interesting place to visit."
Must see Hanok village,The high point in a trip to Jeonju. A cultural and shopping adventure
Good visit for a couple of hours,"The Jeonju Hanok Village is charming. It's a nice place to wander around for a few hours. The view from the hill next to the village is nice. I wouldn't go out of the way to visit Jeonju, but if you are passing through it's worth a stop for a couple of hours. We stayed at one of the traditional hotels, Jeonju Hanok Living Experience Center. It was very expensive for the tiny hanok room that we stayed in. We won't stay there again. The souvenir shops were also expensive. Jeonju is a good place to stay if you are visiting the Expo in Yeosu. The KTX goes directly to Yeosu and takes just over an hour. It's cheaper to stay in Jeonju than in Yeosu. Overall, a short visit is enough. No need to go out of your way to visit."
Beautiful Jeonju,"JEONJU tranditional Hanok Village... the old traditional streets and the largest traditional town in Korea. (were there on April 19)A great place worth to visit for sightseeing, must try their local Korea’s best dish ""Jeonju Bibimbap"" and for the best place with a view of the entire village.. visit “Tomorrow Café” ! Have a great trip and enjoy Jeonju !"
Fav Place in Jeonju,"Hanok village is just beautiful. It is our favorite place in Jeonju. Every time we go we find something new- some little pathway we had not taken before. If you want souvenirs, this is the place to go. There are tea houses, cafes, all sorts of shops... on Saturdays vendors set up stalls and sell food and artsy things. Make sure to hit up Veteran Noodle for the best kalgooksoo in Jeonju too."
Just lovely,"Hanok village is a traditional Korean village filled with restaurants, coffee shops, arts and crafts shops and museums. It's lovely to walk along its cobbled streets, especially in spring when the cherry blossoms are flowering. There's even an easy walk up the hill overlooking Hanok village to a large pavilion."
interesting place to visit,went there under government organised for oversea students. it was free of charge with nice events.
Interesting,"Interesting look at Historic Jeonju. There are shops where you can buy goods made in the traditional way, eg Papercraft."
History at the Hanok Village,"Jeonju's Hanok Village is often used for filiming period dramas. The entire village was built around the same era, and any newer buildings are given the same look as their predecessors. But it's not just about the buildings. You can purchase arts and craft and have a satisfying lunch. Jeonju's Hanok Village is a great place to visit for sightseeing AND for trying the local Jeonju Bibimbap."
