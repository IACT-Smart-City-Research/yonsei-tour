Great shopping area!!,"We visited this street while we were in Busan and quite enjoyed the shops on this street. Besides the everyday shops (like in Seoul), you can find many unique boutiques as well. Prices of goods are much cheaper than Europe. We bought some winter sports wears and gears from Marmut and after taking into consideration the tax refund that we will get, we find that the prices are much better than if we had bought the same stuffs from Europe. "
A Very Vibrant Area,So much to see so little. You get big stores and the market alley shops. We enjoy walking through this area. Many shops selling clothings according to the season. Good to take a look. 
Amazing!,"I love this spot. Lot of shops, cool sellers, colorful area, nice prices, tons of clothe and makeup stores. Also many restaurants. I love it!"
Lots of shops,"Heaps of shopping for clothes, skincare, food restaurants. Just walking past was enough, not interesting for us. But nice for a stroll "
Lively shopping street,"Lively, bustling shopping street, with a great atmosphere at night. Not much to see if you're not interested in shopping & not much different to any other popular shopping street in Busan."
Lots to see and eat,"This is a great place to visit. Tons of stores and shops, plenty of food options, and a great place to people watch. You can spend all day there just looking around. You can buy just about anything, and have any kind of food you can think of. A fun way to spend a day."
Shopping & Sight Seeing ,Had fun strolling around the area. So many fashionable stores to choose from. Highly recommended for shopaholic! 
Good weekend vibes,"The street is full of people eating street food, shopping, restaurants. Everything you want is there"
Good shopping,"This is a great shopping area, with every brand you are looking for. Everything from high end to backstreet markets."
"Street with many retail shops, nothing really unique","Gwangbokro is a street flanked by retail shops that reminded me of Orchard Road in Singapore. You can find many brands of fashion here from the well known ones to the lesser known ones, but nothing really different other than a nicer looking street. Prices are average so don't expect to find a bargain here too.One good thing about this place is that it's very well-connected to the other attractions around like Busan Tower, BIFF Square and Gamcheon Village, so you can just include it as a stop when you're visiting the area. Otherwise not really a must see."
Interesting and hip shopping street,Interesting and hip shopping street In Busan especially for youth. Nice cafes along the way too. Sculpture pepper he sidewalks. 
For youths,"This place definitely caters for youths related fashion, with both local and international brands. Public seating are also provided along the road making this a great place to shop. Could easily spend 2-4 hours here if I could find a toilet. "
Popular shopping street of Busan,"This is a modern street in Nampo. The atmosphere is like Myeongdong of Seoul.Lots of shops, restaurants and cafes.- The accessibility is good. Lotte Department, Yongdusan Park, Jagalchi Market, BIFF Square and Gukje Market are close.- There are fountains with old time portraits and I liked them.- Seeing street performers, traditional pop corns, etc. were also fun."
Plenty of choice,Mainly a fashion street both international and local. High quaility goods with fair price. Has coffee and bakeries often. Turn right just past sculpture and in market.
Tree Festival,there's a tree festival in december and it looks amazing at night. but it might get crowded near Christmas.
Shopping street plain and simple,"Not sure where the culture part comes in (well ya shopping is part of culture) but basically lots of shopping and moderately priced restaurants. Note that during daytime cars and motorbikes will enter the street. Personally I prefer this kind of setting to malls/huge department stores, and the backdrop of Busan Tower (and even Gamcheon) was nice. If you like street food, they are available just a few blocks away in BIFF square."
Enjoyable shopping street with food and clothes,"We enjoyed our night here. A good shopping street with food and clothes. We dined in a Korean restaurant located at the basement of a building. We do not read Korean but we attached the picture for reference. This restaurant has been around since 1995. All the main dishes sold here with the price of KRW8000 each. All the side dishes are free to be consumed with unlimited refill. In fact, one can go to take whatever side dishes he/she prefers. Indeed, that was something new to us. After dinner, we walked around and bought jackets and coats with affordable price."
Shopping street,"Everything from cosmetics, clothes, shoes to souvenirs you can find here. Good restaurants all around also. Going across 3 subway stops this is the best hang out place!"
Nice shopping street,"At night, street is closed for car traffic, shops are opened and you can move freely. It was Xmas time so lighting and decoration are everywhere. You can rest and eat in between shopping. Prices are relatively high!"
"Beautiful street with lots of fancy, colorful shops & restaurants....","Its very easy to mistaken this place as BIFF Square as it is just one street next to it.It is a beautiful street area with lots of colorful, fancy & nice upmarket-looking shops & restaurants. The ambience is great especially at night with the beautiful shops litted up 360°. The cool weather makes for a pleasant walk.This place in within an area where BIFF & Jagalchi market,etc is. This is probably one of the best place to stay in Busan. "
Lovely,Very europish shoping area. Neat and cozy. Losts of shops of any kind. Paradise for shopoholics. But also great just to hang around
Great shopping Street,This is a world class shopping street. So many major labels but depending where you come from you could get sticker shock when you get your converted visa bill. Lol
Νice place for shopping,Very nice place for shopping where you can find almost everything. Nice place to spend an afternoon or evening. Prices are more or less like in Europe.
Shoppingstreet,"Mostly asian brands/shops, just a couple of western shops, but the prices are quite high. Quite overloaded by tourists..."
Nice stret just for the strole,I wasn't there for the shopping but just looking around the area. This street is nice and wide and on Sunday that had closed the road down the middle which made it so much easier to walk down that the other times I have been here.
Shop Till You Drop!,"GwangBokRo is well-known for it's fashion shops and it's right! I was very pleased. Anything you're looking for -- whether it be the trendiest clothes or the hottest new make up, any store you can imagine in IT Korean culture, you will find it all here on this street.I wanted to step foot in every store to check out the hottest Korean fashion and accessories. Not to forget that there's tons of great restaurants to go eat at or check out the street food vendors a few blocks down.Location is also super awesome because it's all walking distance to BIFF Square, JaGalChi Fish Market, and GukJae Market too! Nothing is out of hands reach! So enjoy yourself to this wonderful street so the shopoholic and the fashionista in you can run wild. Enjoy!NOTE: Try to come in the day time or week day if possible because nights and weekends will be PACKED with people. So if you want some leisurely pace to your shopping, be aware."
"Best shopping for trendy fashion here, Must Go list in Busan.",Search gold7778t in Youtube and watch video for more details.This is a great location for shopping hot and trendy local fashion. The area is quite big with street vendor as well as local brand fashion store. Nearby has BIFF square also for street food and fashion. Jagalchi Fish Market is just nearby for seafood.Recommended to spend almost one whole day in this area and nearby for shopping and food.This place attracts not only tourist but also locals. Money exchange is also easy to find in this area.
Great for Shopping and Eating,"We got dropped off at one end of the fish market, which was actually pretty fun in itself (good place to go if you want seafood for lunch, lots of little food stalls set up there). The shopping area is great, we actually ended up buying some nice hiking clothes because a lot of shops were having big sales while we were there. There's lots of to eat at too, I think we went to some little random chain restaurant that served bulgogi over rice and it was pretty good. Plenty of little cafes also if you want to stop and have a coffee or snack while you're out shopping."
Fashion,"Lot of souvenirs, clothing and fashion accesories. Great location, close to the fish market. Always packed especially on the weekend."
Great shopping place with arts,"It's nice and cleaned, filled with shops ranging from clothings to necessity. Basically a place u can kill time with fun."
Shopping street,There were many shops along the main street and side lanes. The area was crowded with local people and tourists searching for their souvenirs and food. A lively area particularly at night time.
walking street surrounds by many places of interest,"This walking street is really fantastic with all kinds of shop and many back lanes shops selling many local selections.There are many statues, seating place and flowers pots being installed or placed along the street to add the vibrancy. Allowing visitors to stop and take a rest and admire the displays or flowers. There are also many visitors taking photographs of the street and surroundings.Take your time to walk along the street, notice the fashion, enjoy the café & local delights and walk into the back lane."
Nice place with modern shops,"It is near Nampo metro station. Take Exit 7 and then turn left into Gwangbok-ro (Road). It is lined with modern shops and there are many restaurants in the adjacent street, including a ginger chicken soup restaurant. Great for a stroll at night. If one keeps walking straight for another 10 minutes, one could reach the BIFF Square and Jagalchi Fish Market. I stayed at the Last Hotel which was off Gwangbok-ro. From Gwangbok-ro, there is an escalator that goes right up to the Yongdusan Park. "
Shopping heaven for beauty & clothes,I love K-beauty so this street was heaven for me - all the big brands had multiple stores. There were also lots of fashion and footwear stores and a market for the locals running parallel to it selling more varied items such as light fixtures and artwork. It is a fairly long street with a lot of shops and you can take your pick of cafes/coffee shops.
Shopping!!!,No smoking street. Walking distance to BIFF Square. Bought quite a lot of stuff here. Highly recommend it if you are into Korean fashion. 
nice place to shop,"there are many shops! sell quite good price! many fashionable and korean style clothes! good place to shop! paradise for girl haha. can spend half day over there, and there are some good restaurants. Also very cheap and delicious! this place is awesome"
Good for Christmas season,"At every end of year, this place shines with the beautiful and huge christmas tree. The street with lots of shops gets enlightened with the millions of little light bulbs. Good place to see the holiday season of Korea."
highLIGHTS,"the best fashion walk in Korea! i just love the Christmas feels around, with lights and some Christmas songs"
Nice shopping street,A nice street with a large variety of shops selling mostly branded goods. I would recommend visiting during the weekdays as it can be quite crowded during the weekends. It is in between BIFF Square (a must-visit place) and is connected to Yongdusan Park via an escalator.
Heaven,"You will feel so much youth vibes here! So many restaurants, cafe, shops and cosmetic shops, also fashion shops that will makd you happy! Heaven of street food and korean cosmetics with cheaper price than in Seoul"
Shopping Heaven!!,"It is an interesting place where there are lots of shopping options. Basically you will not just walk on Gwangbok-ro, but also the other streets such as International Market, PIFF Square etc. Plentiful of skincare and make-up shops, food options on street and cafes/restaurants, clothes and so on. Some shops open all the way up till 11pm!However, I do realise that while some shops are repeated along the street, they may have different promotions or different prices (I encountered one of this situation for a skincare brand).Nevertheless, it is a good place to get food and shop for stuff!"
Lots of options!,"One of the more robust shopping districts that I've found here in Korea. It's not just limited to culture and fashion; it includes all kinds of bars, clubs, restaurants, and drinking establishments. Definitely recommended if you're in the area, and it's a short walk from the nearby subway stop or plenty of bus stops"
Enjoyable strolls ~ even on Hot Days,"The stretch goes from Nampo Metro station Exit 7 onwards till BIFF or Bupyeong which ever places you prefer, it is a whole area where you could spend a few days to cover them all. They dont just sell clothes but also food, in the main street and the alley. Whcih was quite crowded during my Chuseok Visit. (13-15), and yes we were there everynight trying out different restaurant. Especially near Gukje. You can't really differentiate where you are once you were inside, You just walk all the way to the next street following the crowds and you will know where the action was. 1 restaurant we visited was a 10,000 KRW buffet BBQ. All the pork you could eat, but Beef is available at an order. 10,000 KRW is like price for a bowl of Noodle/Bibimbap and if your have your stomach going at it, you could eat all nite as they are open 24 Hours ... Street food is abundance, but price had gone up 10-20% which goes at least 1200 KRW, which thus I end up preferring the buffet.Along the ways towards Gukje / BIFF there is bronze statute for photo session and display of info on the history of the place. How it started. To have a good photo, go in the morning which is less crowded. The escalator to Yongdusan is also here."
Great place for shopping!,"There are a lot of small stores with a great choice of cheap and middle priced clothing and shoes, which are very different then the ones in Seoul. "
Amazing!!,If i could go back every weekend i would. Theres so much to see and do. Theres many places to eat but also there is a street just for food venders. I enjoyed the fact that the prices were pretty cheap compared to the malls.
"Cosmetis, Street food...","You can buy anything here... cosmetic, food, coffee... though i didn't see any souvenir shops..(which i hoped to find here. Very crowded and i somehow got lost in the market."
you can find every thing,"I went in the weekend and it was very busy Street.. it has many cloths shops and surrounded by restaurants.. from there, side streets will take you to local shops selling different types of goods and food including a seafood ..many options are available to choose from..it meets all the tastes."
Shopping,A lot of branded and small boutiques for clothing shopping. Awesome for shopping buy till you drop ready more won...
Shopping Street,"Another Korean shopping street with restaurants, coffee shops and ""forever in sales store"". Is near to Jagalchi Market, the International Market and Busan Tower, so, you will not lose anything if you go by. At least that you want to buy something in the ""forever in sale shop"""
Shopping,Had different type of store in arrangement you will find the sport shops together and the cosmetic together.. near the fish market and the underground market too 
Nice Christmas Decorations Along The Street,"We went there in the winter and there are high end brands, boutiques and skincare/cosmetic shop here. It was very nearby Global Inn hotel where we stayed. It was really nice to walk around here at night and taking photos with beautiful Christmas decorations along the street."
Lots of hustle and bustle!,"No matter the time of day or day of the week, this place was always fairly packed! If you're into Korean cosmetics, skin care, and fashion, this is the place to go! Several branches of several well-known Korean brands are here, such as: Innisfree, Etude House, Missha, and Skin Food. There are also a few international brands sprinkled in. If you get tired of this area, BIFF Square and Gukje Market can be directly accessed from here, provided you can find your way around!! It is incredibly easy to get lost, as my boyfriend and I experienced one too many times! I highly recommend getting a map from the tourist station located street side near the entrance to Exit #2 of Nampo-dong station. The tourist station also has staff that can speak a little English if you need some guidance on getting somewhere."
Great Mix of Shops and Street Vendors,"A nice way to spend an afternoon. Movie theaters, a nice variety of Korean, Japanese and western food. If you are looking for fashion, a nice selection is available. Very close to Lotte Department store. On weekends, sometimes there are live performances which can be very entertaining. A nice place to go for an afternoon date, just wander around."
Major shopping area in Busan,"It is located near metro, Jagalchi station. Many of shops including clothing, watches, jewelries, meals, snacks and cosmetics are found in this street. Along the street, there is a bronze cute statues of animals and peoples. Almost all of Korean cosmetic brands can be found in this street, most of them provide tax refunding to tourist."
Lively neighbourhood!,"Right in the heart of Busan, short walk to the Busan tower, BIFF square, jalmachi fish market, gukje market. Shops, street food, you can find everything around here!"
Window shopping galore!,"After lunch one day my sister in law wanted to take me here. This is a fun place for fashion, trends, and shopping in Busan. You shouldn't miss this. The streets are beautiful and exciting, there are so many cafes, and stores to see. It was really a nice day time outing. Do this with friends, family or couples. This is a great excursion for everyone on your list. You can find some great things here!"
Try a Waffle!,Lots of shops and great street vendors. After marching around you will need a little snack. The Belgium Waffles are everywhere. They are AMAZING. Nice and crispy on the outside and soft in the middle.
Long Stretch of Street with young fashion,"Prepared to walk and walk if you want to comb every corner of this street. This is the hang out place for the Busan teens and youngsters.Some in their school uniforms shopping in the day time.There are also eateries, cosmetic shops around. So you can always take a break if you are tired. Shelter is limited. So be prepared to bring your umbrella and poncho if it rains."
Must Go Place in Busan,Easily accessible from Nampo and Jagalchi metro stations.Nice shopping and food district. Full of young vibes. Nice selection of shops and eateries. Close to Busan Tower with a section linked by an escalator. A must go place in Busan.
Shopping Place in Busan,"The street offer wide array of items from clothing to jewelry, skincare to cosmetics, camera, electronics, folk crafts and luxury items.It is decorated with beautiful plantings and punctuated with splendid lighting and sculptures.This is a good place for the youngsters to hang out."
Very cool street to walk around after dinner ,"Awesome people watching spot, lots of food and souvenir stalls, shops. Bustling even on a weekday evening, lots of lights and people! "
"Lots of retail shops, from fashion to cosmetic and skincare, food stalls.","Lots of retail shops, from fashion to cosmetic and skincare, food stalls. The streets are clean with clear directional signs."
Really enjoyed this area ,"Went when they had the area lot up for Christmas. Unbelievable food, shopping and huge crowd. The ambiance is excellent and highly recommended!! "
A long street of shops,Shops are about the same in Seoul. But the push carts stores and the food are cheaper than Seoul. Spend and enjoy here. 
"This is nearby Jagalchi fish market, good place after dinner. ","This is nearby Jagalchi fish market, good place after dinner. Jagalchi fish market is good place for dinner : fried fish, eel, raw fish (= hoei, sushi). After dinner walk around here and go up to Youngdusan park and Busan tower. Busan is a kind of film city, enjoy the trend of fashion here. "
Nothing interesting,"This is a place with fashion shops and some restaurants but nothing fancy, I would rather shop in Seoul more than Busan."
No money no pleasures,Its a shopping place with some cool art stuff. A lot of international and local brands is there but if there is no money you can just enjoy the window shopping activities
Rubbish bin please~,the fashion street has a lot of brands and you can find some pretty cheap stuffs here. You can hardly find a rubbish bin and a lot of garbage just throw in the planter box and roadside. Beware of car coming when you walk here.
Fun shopping in Busan city centre,There are may stalls in this street selling garments as well as food. Most of the people there are not able to speak English or any other languages.
Shopping place,"From Yongdusan Park we came down via escalator and arrived in this area. A lively winding road lined with shops. If its still not enough, there's Lotte Dept store nearby. Its a goos connection between the park and BIFF and Jalgachi. "
Hip and up-market stores,"Interesting shopping street with a lot of artistic bronze statues dotting it. Walk along it to BIFF Square and also cross to Gukje market where a lot of bargains and souvenirs can be found. Bee Cheng Hiang is also here. A lot of restaurants, cafes and street vendors make this a popular meeting area for the well heeled and hip young crowds. From here you can also walk to Yongdusan Park and Lotte department store. Subway just around the corner."
Good place to shop and food paradise restaurants,"We stayed at Terra Guesthouse on the 7th floor of Jagalchi Market. The opposite of the main entrance of Jagalchi Market, you can find many adjumma waiting at their restaurant inviting you to dine in. Most of the seafood restaurant, the food are good. Try the eel cooking on the hot plate. Take the non spicy ones. We took three main dishes that costs 30,000 wons per small plate should be enough for 9 person because most restaurants provide a lot of side dishes. You can also dine on the 2nd or 5th floor of Jagalchi Market. The 5th floor provide buffet lunch and dinner. I remember seeing the cost is about 40,000 wons per person. If you like to purchase dried pack seaweed go to the Dried Fish Wholesale Market which is about 5 minutes walk on the right side of Jagalchi Market after the row of restaurants or the 2nd floor of Jagalchi Market besides the seafood restaurant. Shopping - Start from Gwangbokro shopping street to Gukje Market then to Changseong Food Alley, BIFF Square, Jagalchi Market to Nampo Underground Shopping Street. (Gwangbokro Underground Shopping Complex). The merchandise are not cheap. You can't bargain. Go to the International Wholesale In Gukje Market. Try to walk between the alley behind BIFF Square. Not many people knew that merchandise there are cheaper. I was given this information during my 12 days stayed by a citizen. You can bargain up to 40% if you knew how to communicate in Korean Language. Most of the Busan citizen could not communicate in English well. It would be a great advantage if you study 30% of their language before you arrived in Busan. Go to Yongdusan Park. It would be a great experience during the night visit. You could see Busan all light ups from the tower. It is on the left side of Gwangbokro Shopping Street. Look out for a signboard and the elevators almost at the end of the street. You need to pay 4,000 wons per person to go up the tower. Bring along design padlocks, write your loved notes and hung it along side of the verandah at the park for memory.From Gimhae International Airport to Nampodong-gu by taxi would be around 29,000 wons. If you are travelling alone backpacking like us, it would be more advisable to take Light Rail (the purple line) to Sasang which is only 3 stops from airport. Adults fare 1,300 wons, child below 12 years 650 wons and teenagers 13 - 18 years 1,050 wons per person. Transit to the Green Line at Sasang station. Sasang station is near Lotteria. Purple Line to Sasang Station is about 500 meters or about 10 minutes walk. You may purchase your ticket up to Jagalchi Station. Sasang Station is on the GREEEN Line. Please transit from Seomyeon Station to ORANGE Line. Sasang Station to Seomyeon Station are 8 stops. Seomyeon Station to Jagalchi Station are 9 stops using ORANGE Line. Adults fare about 1,700 wons, child 950 wons and teenagers 1,150 wons. May you have an enjoyable journey using this information given. I just came back from Busan 5 days ago."
Always lively there,"This place is popular amongst the youngsters and tourists. I visit there several times and noticed there are more happenings during weekends. On Sunday afternoon, can see street vendor demonstrating the making of popcorn the traditional way. People selling handicraft of grasshopper and frogs made from leaves. This place is like A smaller version of Myeongdong of Seoul. I prefer to shop here then Myeongdong as I find that the sales staff here are less pushy and aggressive. Gwangbok-ro is also where you can find the escalator to Yongdusan Park where Busan tower is located."
Not Just A Street,"Well, this area is not just a street. It is a street with all sorts of interesting shops. So many cafés and eateries to choose from. Although it is not the longest street there is, I seemed to just keep going back and forth for 3 days. Kept trying out the different cafes and each time I would come to notice things like the different bronze sculptures, the boards containing descriptions of nearby places of interest including the description of the Yongdusan & Busan Tower. You can also find all sorts of boutiques and shoes shops. You can find just about anything I suppose. Not far from the area are the underground shopping malls, the Lotte Shopping Plaza, BIFF Square. I walked and did not even realise the distance. That is how interesting I find this place was. Will be bringing my sister there this weekend ;)"
Well connected to different shopping areas,"For value for money shopping, this is a place to go. It is within the yongdusan park area. One suggested itin is to start from Gwangbokro shopping street to Gukje market, then to Changseongdang Food Alley, BIFF Square, Jagalchi market and then Nampo underground shopping street."
Nice shopping in Nampo,This is where the nice shops in Nampo are. If you don't find what you want for the price you want go to the gokj market next door (to the left)
