Best cultural experience in Korean ,"Beautiful and definitely worthy a visit. This complex contains national portrait museum. There is lots to see, felt a lot more relaxing and plenty places to sit and relax taking in the atmosphere. Highly recommended. "
Haven in an area of busy - buildings from Joseon dynasty,This area of quiet in the busy village is nice to wander around. The buildings are from the Joseon dynasty & are enclosed by a surrounding wall. The gate way leads to the main buildings with smaller court yards & buildings off.The area also has the Royal portrait museum (covering the key portrait of King Taejo) 
nice visit,"good, historical visit. Make sure to take the docent led tour (they have English-speaking guides). there is also the museum to walk through. Worth an hour on your visit to Jeonju."
in the heart of the Village...,"At the center of the Hanok Village, this shrine (erected in 1400) is one of the most interesting things to see in Jeonju.Entrance Fee is only 3.000 won per person.There's a little ""bamboo-forest"", pretty famous to be a nice background for photos.Take a slow walk through this shrine!!!!"
Josean shrine complex in Hank Village,"The Gyeonggijeon shrine is in the centre of the Hanok village. It is a complex of pavilions, shrines, store buildings from the Josean Dynesty. There is an entrance fee, but we turned up at lunchtime and the ticket office was closed so we were let in for free (not that the entrance fee is large), Many Koreans had rented traditional dress and were taking photographs around the complex. One of the buildings has manuscripts from the Josean Dynesty, other buildings house various museum pieces on daily life."
Beautiful shrine complex in Jeonju hanok village,"Gyeonggijeon shrine/palace is a beautiful group of buildings in the Jeonju hanok village. We visited at 09:30am, half an hour after opening, and it was quiet. The buildings and trees are really beautiful, and there's a small bamboo grove that is gorgeous. You can go inside lots of the buildings, which is great. We didn't visit the portrait gallery museum, and it took us a bit less than an hour to see everything else."
Worth a visit ,You probably won't spend more than an hour here unless you're taking photos in the traditional hanbok costumes~ Paid an entrance fee and received a map in English. Don't forget to check out the museum. 
Very nice during Autumn,"It is 3.000 for the entrance ticket. You’ll need about 30min to 1h for the visit and it is located at the entrance of the traditional village, so very easy to reach.The shrine in itself has nothing extraordinary but is a nice and quiet place to visit. During autumn it is actually very nice for pictures."
Interested in Korean history? it's must-go!! 한국인이라면 한번은 가봐야 하는 곳!!!,"Fortunately, there is a fee language guide program, through which you can get a good guide speaking English. The entrance fee is about 3 USD, it's almost for free considering the free English Guide. Kyoungkijeon, it has the portrait of the first king of Chosun Dynasty. It depicts the king exactly with the same appearance. No adding at all. And also this place is used as an altar for important figures of Seongrihak(an academic studying developed from the confucionism. it's based on the confucious belief). So Confucius is included in the figures. It has deep history. You can hear of it from one of the guides there.  The books of the annals on the Chosun Dynasty are also preserved well here.  You can see how strict and strong the confucious belief was in Korea. It was more than a religion. 다행기게도 무료 해설 프로그램이 있어서... 입장료가 3,000원인데 그정도야... 낸다. 해설사 비용도 안나오겠더라... 거의 공짜라고 본다. 경기전, 태조의 초상화를 포함해서 성리학 위인들의 위패를 모셔놓은 곳, 조선왕조실록도 모셔놓았던 곳!!!! 그리고 그걸 지키려했던 선조들의 노력!!!! 경기전, 조선 태조 이성계의 초상화를 모신 곳이다. 태종은 1410년 전주·경주·평양에 태조의 모습을 그린 초상화를 모시고 어용전이라 하였다. 그 후 태종 12(1412)에 태조 진전이라 부르다가 세종 24년(1442)에 와서 전주는 경기전, 경주는 집경전, 평양은 영숭전으로 달리 이름을 지었다. 경기전은 임진왜란 때 불탄 것을 광해군 6년(1614)에 다시 고쳐 지었다. 건물의 구성은 본전·헌·익랑 들로 이루어져 있고 이를 내삼문과 외삼문으로 둘렀다고 한다.해설사의 설명을 들어보면 한국에선 건물 하나를 지을 때도 그냥 아무렇게나 지은게 아니고 하나하나 모두 그 뜻이 있다고 한다. 저 기둥도 뭔가 뜻이 있다고 하는데... 아, 뭐라고했는지 까묵었다...  경기전 이 건물은 다행이게도 불타지 않고 보존되었다고 하더라. 광해군 이후로... 다른 곳은 다 타고 없어져버렸는데.... 전주에는 이렇게 지켜진게 많다. 조선시대야 그 근원이 '농사'였고 평야와 농사의 중심지였던 이곳 '전주'가 자연스럽제 중요한 도시였음은 자연스러운 일이라고 하겠다....해설사의 얘기를 듣다보면 일본에 대한 악감정이 안생길 수가 없다. 뭔가 만들어 놓으면 어김없이 일본이와서 다 파괴했으니까... 그 와중에 전주의 시민들은 우리 조상들은 그 유산을 지키기 위해서 목숨을 걸어야 했고....초상화는 털하나도 빠지지 않고 그릴만큼 사실적으로 묘사한 게 특징이다. 경기전 안에는 태조 이성계 어진을 모신 곳과, 규장각처럼 조선왕조실록과 서적을 보관하던 곳, 그리고 성리학 성인의 위패를 모신 곳이 있다. 각각 이름이 있지만 일일이 기억하지는 못한다. 성리학도 결국 중국의 학문에서 온 것이고 언어도 중국의 언어를 기반으로 한 '한자'였으니... 엄밀히 따지자면 전통 한국은 아니었다라고 해야 할까? 성리학의 명과 암이라고 할 수 있겠다...."
Nice stroll,"People walk around wearing hanbok. There were children, teens and parents in traditional clothing. It was a big area where you can read about Joseon dynasty in English."
"Small, peaceful Shrine",Small and relaxed stroll in a shrine featuring King Taejong.Good combination for photography when you dress up in their traditional costumes
Pleasant and peaceful,A pleasant place to wander around and enjoy traditional Korean architecture. The Portrait museum was small but interesting.
good place to see history,"nice site to walk around. also houses the royal portrait museum, which is pretty interesting, although not extensive."
King Taejong shrine,The First King of Shoseon dinasty. A small shrine and it has a painting of King Taejong. You have to pay for enter.
"Small, less crowded and similar to crowded palaces in Seoul","If you want to take pictures with your hanbok around Jeonju, this place is worth a visit to to that. There aren't a lot of tourists unlike in Seoul where every nook and cranny of a palace has people taking their photos. The place is serene and quiet and worth a visit when you want to escape the Seoul crowds. This place is small as well, but everything looks similar in other palaces so if you're done with palaces, you can skip this one unless you have nothing more to do in Jeonju."
An Upclose opportunity to see traditional architecture,"A great opportunity to see the function and layout of traditional Korean dwellings (particularly of those with money) There is a museum in the center of the complex which is worth the entry price on its own. If you like traditional artifacts, this is a must. There are also quite a few of the buildings that you can take your shoes off and go inside and explore a little bit. Nice layout and design ~ a very low stress enjoyable place to be."
Interesting with guide,It was interesting to learn some history with a 45 min guided tour in English. The storage area for the Joseon annals where quite interesting too. 
Houses a portrait of something.. not that with it,You can see a lot of it from the inside so can consider saving the 3000 won to go in. There’s some history about why it’s famous but it is not a palace or anything similar. From the Chosun period.
Average,If you have visited temples/palaces in Busan or Seoul this one does not really impress you as it is less spectical and beautiful. As people should not expect an palace anyway
Experience the foundation of the Joseon Dynasty,If you're visiting the Jeonju village then this is a great addition to your sightseeing experience. It includes the only known images of Taejo founder of the Joseon dynasty. It's also an intriguing story of how so many manuscripts and artefacts were destroyed. It's a lesson in ensuring we preserve the past. Lots of young visitors dress up in traditional costumes which adds the the experience. Lots to see for only 3000 won!
"Historical gyeonggijeon shrine, hanok ","More than 600 years old shrine , well preserved . Tracing the history of the famous king of the 27 Kings of jeonsan era. Portraits of the several kings are shown in the traditional museum "
"Ancestral home of Taejo, founder of Joseon dynasty. Well laid out","We went here with a private tour guide which made all the difference as he could explain all the history in detail. (Without him we would have no doubt just wandered about and considered it only a collection of buildings and small temple). However it is actually steeped in history as is the local town, which is also worth a visit.Should you visit remember and climb up into he Jeonju history archive building, it's easy to think it's unassuming and miss it. This is where the copies of the Joseon history were stored). Many people wearing the Hanbok, which adds to the experience.When here you must also visit the Royal Portrait Museum to see some of the original king painting. As you come to expect in Korea the museum is very well presented and laid out. Amazing history.Well worth a visit ."
Free tour every hour,A free tour every hour is included with the reasonable 3000 won admission which will enhance the visit for non-Korean visitors. Worth a visit if already in Hanok village.
Worth it if you are in Jeonju Hanok Village,"This was worth the price if you are staying or visiting Jeonju Hanok Village. Not the best Shrine I've ever been to, but it was interesting and there is a museum on the premises that is interesting. "
Main shrine in heart of village,Two grand entrances ahead of the main shrine with its colourful roof both inside and out. Off to the left is some traditional houses used in film sets. Free tour available at 1100.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.
Cultural,"Gyeonggijeon Shrine is a place with rich culture and history. Entrance fee is 3,000won for single adult. There are tours available in Korean, English & Mandarin, at different times of the day. There are also signboards located in the shrine, so it was easy for us to understand the historical meanings of the place. My friend and I rented earlier on in the morning, and we took plenty of photos inside. It is a pretty place for taking photographs :) if you have time, visit the place again at night! It is really beautiful at night as well :)"
A celebration of King Taejo,"As the ancestral home of the founder of the Joseon dynasty, Jeonju holds this shrine that features the last surviving portrait of King Taejo. The grounds also house the Royal Portrait Gallery that has several examples of portraits of Joseon kings as well as exhibits on clothing and palanquins."
Felt tricked into paying,"We followed the GPS to this location. We then confirmed with the person at the ticketing window if it was the right place. He said inside and waived in a general direction then asked us to pay. After paying, we went straight to the shrine only to discover it was closed. "
Lovely shrine,Certainly worth going in to have a look at the various buildings. The place where they houses the manuscripts is particularly interesting. Also be sure to check out the Portrait Museum (no Additional charge once you are in the grounds).
Historical sites seekers would love it here,"With an entrance fees of 6,000 won for 2 person. We spent a good 1.5 hours here looking at the different section. How the kitchen of olden days look like, with a traditional pounder. And a place used to keep the records on daily life of the King. Royal Portrait museum where we get to see impressive portrait of King Taejo. Painting of Five Peaks with Sun and Moon was beautiful to admire too. So much so that I bought the magnet version of it home.Historical sites seekers would have to pop in here to see."
historical visit,"have a look into the museum and see the Portraits of King Taejo, it was mesmerising. a great stroll in the morning before the tourists flock in. also known to be a Kdrama (Love in the Moonlight) shooting location"
"In Awe of ""The Portrait""","This is the place for you to see the painting of King Taejo - the first king of the Joseon dynasty. Be respectful and lower down your voice in the compound - after all you're in a shrine. As an avid reader on Korean history, it is my candy store. "
Love in the Moonlight! ,"A must place to visit especially when you're in Jeonju! It's within the Hanok village which makes it very accessible and convenient to get to. Everyone should try renting Hanbok before they enter the shrine so it'll feel as though you're filming a drama here. This was where Park Bo Gum & Kim Yoo Jung filmed the bamboo forest scene, staircase scene, and more in ""Love In The Moonlight""! "
"Good enough for a stroll and some history, not fantastic","This is a collection of old buildings (some restored) in a park-like setting. Unlike the Hanok Village outside, it is quieter and generally less juvenile.The different buildings (and guided tour) offer a glimpse into a brief period of Korean history when this was the centre of the State. At the heart of the attraction is a pavilion (""shrine"") housing a portrait of the founding king, but the other buildings actually tell more interesting stories about life and governance in those times.Entry was 3,000 won."
Restored...,Much of the Shrine is restored after being destroyed...a nice walk though. There is a free ENGLISH tour (and other languages as well) at 11am. You have to pay a minimal amount to enter so i guess it's not really a free tour at all...tours are made by volunteers so some may not speak your language perfectly.
A consideration for your valuable time in Jeonju,"The basics: A shrine that housed royal portrait. 3k won admission. Free English speaking tour approx +/- 45 minutes in length. This is a nice break to give your tummy some much needed digestion time after you have, I'm sure, overeaten after walking up & down the streets in the hanok village. Is it impressive? Not really. But it's an interesting way to spend about an hour, and you will learn a little history along the way.If crunched for time, take a pass. If not, stop in!"
Very interesting - for history lovers,"Located within the Hanok village the shrine gives a good eypression about the ancient Korea! For those interested in Korean history it is a must-visit place, basically unique in Korea!"
Best Three Bucks You Can Spend,3000 won equaled a bit less than $3. US in October 2016 and was worth the admission to the Shrine. We were with a Jeonju resident who teaches English and grew up in the neighborhood so we received a special tour. The restoration of the almost 600 year old building is unbelievable and there is a free pamphlet in English which is extremely helpful. The shrine covers a bit of the space in the Hanok and the crowds don't seem to congregate there as no food is sold. This makes the visit more enjoyable. GO!
a walk in time,Take a few hours and walk around this lovely shrine. It tell of how Korea was like 500 yrs ago. it give an overall view of the life for the kinds in Seoul during the jeon dynasty. It cost 1 dollar and you can see the living rooms and quarters of famous Korean people of the past. 
korean traditional place,"The fee was 3000 won. Not expensive. Near gyunggigeon, you can find hanbok (korean traditional clothes) rental shop. I recommend borrow hanbok few hours and take a picture and walk around this place. Hanok village is full of hanok but there are many food stores..not traditional.. this place is protected well and heritage. So go and walk around slowly.  Rental fee is different by where the rental shop placed, so choose good one and good price! Have a good time"
Learn the culture,"This place, you should join the guided tour which is for free so you can understand history & culture.This shrime, they still use few times a year for rites for ancestors.You have ti pay entree fee to get inti this place but it worth to visit."
Good but not free,"Inside Gyeonggijeon, the portraits of King Tae-jo and other successive kings are displayed. The carriage used to move the mortuary tablets as well as carriages used to transport dignitaries and individual chair-like carriages are also available to view. Admission Fees for Individuals – Adults 3,000 won / Teenagers 2,000 won / Children 1,000 won, and for Groups – Adults 2,500 won / Teenagers 1,500 won / Children 500 won."
"Average, not spectacular","If you have been to any of the palaces in Seoul then this shrine is not necessary to visit. If you have rented the hanbok (traditional Korean clothes) then you can take some nice pictures in this area. But if you have come down to Jeonju for the day and don't have much time then you can skip this. For 3,000 won I found it to be a bit overpriced. Its only $3 bucks but after walking around the grounds I felt it was wasted money."
Tranquil,"While not as big as Gyeongbokgung Palace in Seoul, it is nevertheless, a beautiful and tranquil place to visit. There are no manicured gardens, but there's a modern underground museum. It's on the northern edge of the Hanok Village."
Historical shrine with free English tour,"Gyeonggijeon Shrine is a nice-looking and fairly large shrine in Jeonju, one that shows and describes royal portraits of some of the past kings of Korea, especially those who resided in or around Jeonju. The shrine has a lot of good information, and the architecture is lovely. You can also dress up in traditional Korean attire here, and just outside is a fairly thriving set of shops and food stands. The entrance fee is 3,000 won (or about $3), and there are free English guided tours as well. This is a fairly entertaining, brief foray into Korea's history; I recommend visiting for two hours or so."
Pleasant. Don't miss the annex bldgs.,We went around with an English speaking guide--for no extra fee--who talked about the history and features of the place. The size of this place is an important attraction for us; not everything ought to be grand. DON'T MISS the annex buildings (to the left of the entrance) especially if you are visiting with kids.
Combine with Hanok village,"Very interesting look at what life was like long ago in this area. The free English guided tour (I believe they were at 11:30AM and 2PM) made the experience much better than if you just walk around and look yourself (there are daily English tours almost daily and Chinese/Japanese ones on weekends only)The ""highlight"" as mentioned previously is the portrait of King Tae-jo, founder of the Joseon Dynasty. Certain sections weren't open, as it was a Monday.There is a section where kids/families can enter replica buildings to see what life was like many moons ago, as well as try our dart throwing. Certainly worth the 1000W entry fee."
Try this is you want a day trip from Seoul,"The town is historical, with plenty of interesting shops and a church or two to look at. Guided walking tours of the city are offered, but were not available when we went there because of concerns about MERS (which now appears to be fading). This shrine is the highlight, with several buildings to look at and various portraits "
Calm place having history,"C1 ( 2015.05.21 ) This Shrine was located beside Jeonju Hanok Village, and enshrine the first king of the Joseon Dynasty, Yi Seong-gye. I think this area was important historic site, and had beautiful small forest. There was very calm place and worth to visit."
Peaceful,Whilst visiting Jeonju it is worth visiting the Gyeonggijeon Hall. Entry is only KRW1000. It is very peaceful and the buildings are beautifully painted. Allow 1-2 hours. 
This is shrine of founder of Choseon dynasty. ,"This is shrine of founder of Choseon dynasty whose name was Seonggyeo Lee. Very small. In my opinion it is just one stop when you visit another place like Hanok village. It will not be independent stop. [Personal opinion, he betrayed the order of the King of Goryeo dynasty and than found Choseon dynasty, so it is not model of good soldier(e.g. Great General Choi Yeong) but just history]. "
Gyeonggijeon Shrine,"Just opposite the Jeonju Catholic Church, we decided to visit this place since we were in the area. There were a few activities in it that added to the charm of merely just wandering the grounds (i.e. traditional games, museum). You could play some traditional 'korean darts' by throwing weighted sticks into small pots and there was a museum with some art pieces displaying Korean historical pieces. The main attraction was the picture of King Taejo (founder of the Joseon Dynasty) that was found here. We spend about 1-2 hrs in the area. There was an admission fee to enter the area."
