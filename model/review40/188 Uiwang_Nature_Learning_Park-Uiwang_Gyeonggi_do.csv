Park and for Railbike,"Went there for railbike ride. Took subway to Uiwang station and from there easily cab to this park. After the session, asked the ticket booth lady to help me to call for a taxi to get out. "
Uiwang Rail Bike,Please try the rail bike round the lake. Highly recommended for relaxation and enjoying scenic views. There is a shuttle bus that brings you right to this place.
Close to Nice Spots,"The ""nature learning park"" is mostly just some grass where you can have a picnic, along with a little visitor's center (and some giant robot statues), but it is minutes from some other decent attractions. These include the Wangsong lake rail bike, the bird ecology museum and the railway museum."
