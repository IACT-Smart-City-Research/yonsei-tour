Pretty enjoyable if you like to see animals in O World Daejeon,"We visited around afternoon till closing time 6pm. We only purchased the entrance ticket (without rides) and subsequently purchased a ride on the safari separately when we wanted to see the lions, elephant and zebras only in that session. But we didn’t find it worth but you get to see standing bears trying to wait for rewards from the bus (that drive inside). The ride in that safari bus is about 5-7mins. Too short for the amount we paid. Flowers sections according to the staff during November there’s nothing to see. We took bus there and bus back from hotel nearby bus stop. Not all area are up when we visited. Some area like seal session was closed but not mentioned in the map. There is no English map when we requested for one. Some Xmas decors are up while some Halloween still being taken up when we visited."
Great Place for a Family Outing!!,"I was a beautiful day, and the flowers were in bloom. A lot of people, but l was surprised at the number of animals there. We had lunch, which was nothing special, but not horrible either. A great place to take young children on a weekend."
Flower garden nice/ Zoo horrific,Good things first- it's nice for an afternoon with friends- the flower gardens are very pretty- the rides are funBad: and I'm not an expert but these were very obvious things- the Zoo and many animals were in poor condition- many cages were just overpopulated - severly- the monkeys on the picture were in a maybe 10 to 10 meter cage with no climbing possibilities and an obvious skin condition- there were more specially monkeys with skin conditions that didn't seem to be treated- there was a very little monkey baby in desperate need of attention all alone. At that age it should be with a careperson at all times.- many animals had no access to food or water- donkey hoofs were probably never in their life treated and must have pain walking
Only zoo in Daejeon,This is the only zoo in Daejeon. Far away from heart of the city but frequent 301 bus brings you to there.
Go Late Afternoon into Early Evening,"Don't skip this delightful place if you have a day of beautiful weather and want to be outdoors! The two of us spent 4 hours (or more) exploring Zooland, Flower land, Bird land, the maze, plus two dance shows. We went the day before Chuseok (Thanksgiving); it was not too packed. The first thing we did was the safari, because we had to stand in line. Zooland was filled with so many animals I have never heard of, let alone seen even on Animal Planet. All of the signs were translated in English to read the names of the animals, but much of the animal information was written in Korean. Also, there are several vending machines to purchase food for the animals. Guests are encouraged to feed the camels, deer, bears, monkeys, etc. Very cool. Flower land was the best part to me; the displays and designs were colorful, creative and gorgeous. There are family restaurants there too, but we did not try any. The only thing I wished there was more of were maps translated in English and the payment details at the ticket counter. We didn't ride any rides; they seemed to be for children - but if I return I will ride the carousel. Definitely recommend arriving around 3pm to see the animals and flowers during the day, and see the sunset for the light displays and performances."
One of my FAVORITE Destinations,"When in Daejeon, it is NICE to visit O-World Park. This is a combination of botanical garden and Zoo! In addition, the park offers some rides and an entertainment area where free performances (dance and songs) are done! Every season offers a particular activities and sites to enjoy"
My 5-year-old son loves it (zoo)!,"My 5-year-old son, my closed Korean friend and I enjoyed visiting the zoo at Daejeon O-World. We saw various kinds of wild animals, especially those monkeys tigers and birds. The facilities and safety are good. My son really enjoyed watching these animals. This would be a perfect place for children to learn about wild animals. You wouldn't want to go to the natural history museum to see those stuffed wild animals no more."
Enjoyable Day With My Son,"Don't look for western standard rides at this park, they're more in line with carnival style rides, but my son enjoyed himself all day here. We really liked the zoo portion of the park. They have put forth effort to make some decent enclosures for the larger animals and there is a drive thru safari where the animals have lots of freedom to roam. Large selection of species. New section set to open - Bird World that should be really nice. I didnt get to see the garden portion of the park since my son wasn't interested i n it so I can't comment on it, but the small entrance area i saw looked like they put an intense effort into creating unique topiary and flower designs.Be warned this park is filled with day care and pre-schoolers during the week. It seemed like millions when we were there. They leave as the afternoon goes on and the teenagers come in."
Flora and Fauna in South Korea,"One of my favorite places in Daejeon! Of course aside from the letter O, this theme park has a well organized gardens and a zoo on one side. In addition, there are song and dance performances by individuals and groups which are scheduled at a certain time of the day. I love this place!"
Just Perfect,"O World is Great!!!If you are in the area, just grab the kids and go. It is not very expensive compared to other amusement parks plus it has other activities for you and the kids that you need to be at the door upon opening.I certainly recommend a day out with the kids at O World."
Lovely day out,"Plenty of exotic wildlife to see in the zoo section and a few okay, if not, decent rides (log flume, pirate ship) to try out. ""Flower World"" was okay, though not particularly special by any means. Overall, O-World was a relaxing day out that is most certainly worth a visit should you stay in Daejeon."
Park Diversity.,"This is a definite visit for all. It is especially worth while during spring and fall. There is a theme park, a small zoo and a garden. The garden is beautifully designed with a big lake. They have a flower festival during spring which is worth a visit. A good place to take children."
Good place to take fun with your family,"O-world is a small theme park located in south of Daejeon, including zoo(Not big, but enough space to walk around 1~2 hours). It's very easy to get there, because it's close to city-center. I know, it's smaller than like Lotte-world in Seoul or Seoul-land in Seoul, but this place is for local citizens. Taking a day on holiday or weekends, this place will 'cure' you. One more, it costs about $10 to just enter(including park and zoo), $25 including every service. It has a couple of restaurants inside, but tastes bad and expensive. Don't forget to bring a picnic-basket!"
"Average amusement park, loveable zoo","O-world is one of the few famous attractions here in Daejeon. Well, for me, it is just an average amusement park. The entrance fee is around 12,000 won (without the rides), and the ride all you can pass is around 29,000 won (a bit expensive although nothing remarkable with the rides). But i must say that I enjoyed the zoo! If you are an animal lover like me, you must visit o-world. It has different kinds of bears (the polar bear is sooo cute ♡), they have penguins, monkeys, crocs, snakes, tiger safari etc. Also, nearby o-world is the 쁘리 공원 (ppuri park) which is a nice park that you can visit for free.
