Great,"I really enjoyed this, very cheap to do, amazing gardens below. Hop in one of the two lifts and enjoy the lovely 360 degree view from the top. In the tower there is two levels, I suggest head to the lower level where the exit elevator is and there is usually no one there, and the windows are on a better angle for a better view. Really enjoyed this place and I rate it 5/5"
City Landmark,The tower is distinct in it's height and very visible. It offers a great view of the city and I recommend visiting it.
busan tower - large park,"Yongdusun Park is just within walking distance from Nampodong area. The name literally translate to Dragon Head's mountain. Since I'm a dragon, I guess this is my mountain. Yongdusun is also the home of the Busan Tower. It's closed the day I visited but visiting its base near sunset did offer some pretty amazing views. I could only imagine the amazing view that would have rewarded me from the top of the tower. But the view from the bottom isn't any less interesting. People are interesting. Makes them interesting to watch. Statue of General Yi Sun, a great naval commander during the 16the century. So they build a large statue of him to show how important he is. Apart from tower that dominates the park, there's also plenty of pavilion and smaller towers to act as great backdrops for instagram selfies. Make sure you budget ample time here to account for that."
Great view up there,"I took my family here way back many, many years ago. It was a great ride up. It was like going up more than 30 feet in a split of a second. The next thing we were on top. Great view from up there indeed."
Atop Yongdusan Mountain,The tower affords panoramic views of the whole city area. At the bottom of the tower there are souvenir shops. It would have been good for photographs to go there at night.
Great views of the city,Busan tower is position in Yongdusan Park. You can't miss it as it towers over the city.For a small entrance fee you can enter and go up to the viewing area of the tower gallery.From here you can see a 360 degree view all over the city. When we were there the view was very clear. You can see for miles. You can quite easily spend a good hour there. I guess the views at night would be spectacular and the sunsets really good.At the bottom of the tower you can place a lock of love on the railings. These are sold in the souvenir shop. I really wished I had bought several as I can't find these any where else in the world. Would I recommend visiting the tower - yes I would.
Nice place to visit,"This 118-metre-high tower is situated at Yongdusan Park, on top of Yongdusan Mountain (“Dragon’s Head” mountain). We followed the road sign (on top of the manhole covers) and climbed up the nice shaded steps to the Tower. I don’t remember how much we paid to go up observation deck, but the panoramic view of the city and harbour was worth the money. The base of the tower has a gallery and souvenir shops. We went in to take a look, I even bought 2 packs of magnets there.Happy Travelling!"
Great views,"I'm a big fan of towers. I love seeing the entire city from above. Busan Tower did not disappoint. If you can, time it for evening as the lights are coming and the city seems to be coming alive. No matter the time of day you go, the views are well worth it!"
Magnificent View,From the top of the Busan Tower you can enjoy the unique 360 degrees view of Busan town and also capture breathtaking pictures.Enjoy your coffee at the Cafe located one floor behind the top one. Also there is a gallery with very nice exhibits.
A Good Place To Visit,"We did not find the escalator in the beginning and went up by walking uphill from other side where we found some arts shop. The scenery looked great. We also found love locks at the garden near the base of the tower. When going up (fee required), don't forget to take video on the display on top of your elevator. Spectacular views will be seen on a sunny day with 360 degree at the city. You can also find the distances n direction display towards your homeland. Souvenir can be bought in the small shop. A place worth to visit."
360 deg View of Busan,"You can have a 360 deg view of Busan city from the observatory of this tower. The ticket is not expensive but not cheap either since it’s only an observatory. Think it’s $5,000 Won per pax.The tower is walkable from the Nampo area. Worth a visit."
Fantastic 360 degree view of Busan,"From the Lotte Shopping centre, if you walk parallel to the Harbour towards towards Yongdusan Park you will see a very long escalator leading upwards, take this up and another and you will get to the park overlooking the city. Walking up further takes you to the Tower itself which is surrounded by various interesting statues etc. There is a gallery at the base of the Towere but we did not look in there but went straight up the tower. We had a fine day and there are great views of the whole of Busan from the Harbour around to the tree covered hills."
