A nice healing place,"it's a nice healing place for people. There is a story about the peaks. The wife rock turns her back to the husband rock because he married with another woman to have a son. That's it story Anyways, the scenery here is nice. It's good to take a walk around here and feel the fresh atmosphere. There's also musical fountain at night. There are some convenient stores here."
Nice view,"Was able to go with a friend who had a car, so I’m not sure about public transit. It was a nice view. Day was clear so we had good views. Stopped to have coffee afterwards. The area is nice. Worth a stop. Up the walk is also Seongmun. Worth the hike up and down the stairs. "
This worth a quick photo stop .,If you are in the area it is worth a quick look.Its not far from the town center and free to enter unless you have a car which you will pay a small fee.There are tourist shops and cafes.Plenty of photo spots.
Just 3 peaks in the river,"We walked here from Danyang and we found it a little disappointing as you can see by the photos that the river was low and the peaks were more or less joined together. The first peak had a small building on it but we could not make out if it was a shrine, rest area or something else. It takes about 45 minutes to walk from town"
Just watching in distance. Different looks depending on weather.,"This is a scenic three high rocks on a lake. There's a tiny pavilion on the middle rock.It is famous in the history and lots of tourists come to watch.When the people come to see, the weather makes many different views which means it is worthy of visiting multiple times. Especially, when there's no wind, the surface of the water becomes a mirror.- There's a lookaround tour with a ferry. It seemed expensive.- It can be watched along the passage with different angles.- There's a way to Seokmun(stone gate or rock gate in English) nearby. It is also one of 'Danyang Palgyeong(Eight Wonders of Danyang)'."
In the path of Isabel Bird Bishop,"This was a planned visit after reading about these rocks in Bird's book from 1897, recommended as a Korea primer. A lot has changed in Korea but these three rocks in the Hangang River remain. Sight is marred a bit by noisy speedboat rides and a huge mining operation in the background but worth the dive off the expressway."
picturesque sight,"A picturesque rock formation sticking out of the Namhan River. About three kilometers outside of the town center, it is a comfortable 30 minute walk with wide pedestrian path leading to it. It’s one of those seen-in-done-it sights but definitely worth checking out for its postcard image."
Nice scenary,You can see 3 big rocks in the middle of the lake. The story is about a general watching over a peak in one of the rocks.
Nice scenic spot,A nice place to spend about 1 hour. Parking is not free but quite cheap. You can enjoy looking at the rocks/scenery and even take a short boat ride around the rocks if they are operating. From the car park you can also take a short 10 min walk up the cliff to see the stone gate.My only complaint would be that you will stuggle to get any picture without a bridge or something it it. It is a place of natural beauty but quite heavily surrounded by man made constructions.
Visitng the sights of Danyang. ,"A nice spot for a break and a well earned rest from driving. Quite pleasant and good for scenic shots. Well worth the walk to the stone gate, sadly like everythigpng in Korea, it involves a lot of steps....lolPleanty of restaurants and a watermusic show is available in the warmer months."
Islands and a natural bridge,"It's amazing that three rocky islands in the middle of a river can draw so many tourists. But, the real draw to this place isn't the rocks in the water, instead, it's the natural bridge at the top of the ridgeline to the east of the three rocks. Park at the parking lot near the islands and walk up the hill towards the 'Stone gate'. It's a helluva climb on a Korean stairway (rise and run for each step is completely different), but once you get the natural bridge, it's a cool sight."
"Unimpressive, dirty, noisy tourist trap. Waste of time.","We were very disappointed with these famous peaks. It may look nice in pictures, but the tribute for this goes to the photographers. In reality what we saw was a very crowded area by the river with very ordinary rock formations in the (murky and shallow) water. Right in front of the rocks there was some construction and/or mining going on, so it added to the ""charm"" of the place, and was it noisy! Next, if tourist guide books consider it such an important sight, one might expect that it would have good facilities. Not at all! We had lunch there which was hardly edible, beware! And this place is a sure winner for the dirtiest and most disgusting toilets in Korea we've seen in 7 years!! Overall, I don't understand the fuss over these rocks, it is just a tourist trap. There are many many much more beautiful natural sights in both Danyang area and in other parts of Korea. After visiting Danyang, we went to the East coast, walked along the sea by Yeondeok Blue road and found rocks of all shapes and sizes there. The East coastline of mainland Korea or Jeju island are much more impressive. So if you have seen those, be sure, you can skip on Dodamsambong Peaks."
Interesting,"It's kinda interesting to think how these three rocks were built.. Also there's a history behind these three rocks that you should knowIn addition, there is a garden with some flower in heart shape which very suitable for couples to take a picture. So, not only adults but also youngsters are recommend to visit this historical and natural place"
Dodamsambong Adventure,"There are three rock islets standing in the middle of Nam Han River, it called as Dodamsambong. In the middle one called Husband Rock, looks like a figure of an imposing general. While in the south and north part of the rock, there are Wife Rock and Mistress Rock. It is said that Chung Do-jeon, the meritorious retainers in Joseon Dynasty, enjoyed his life here during his young days. According to story, Mt. Sambong was originally located Jeongsun-gun at Gangwon Province, but had drift down due to the flood and settled at Dodamdambong."
