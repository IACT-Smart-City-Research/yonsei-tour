Ancient Gate in the City,"Just down the main strip from Gyeongbokgung Palace is a junction that spilts in several locations and in the middle of this junction is an ancient gate called ""Sungnyemun Gate"". It is part of the ancient city wall that surrounded the capital of Seoul in the Josean dynasty and is one of the oldest remaining features of the wall in Seoul today. It is a great place to visit on the way to Namdaemun Market and there are daily activities at the gate including Changing of the Guard ceremonies which occur daily every 2-3 times in the day. You can get some photos with the guards at the end of the ceremony which makes for some great holiday photos."
Oldest & Largest of Remaining Wall Gates,"Sungnyemum Gate, one of the four main gates in Seoul’s former fortress wall, dates back to 1398. But this South gate has been rebuilt many times with the latest completion occurring in 2013. I was exiting the Nandaemun Market at Gate 1 when I first saw the structure and wondered why it looked so new. Designated National Treasure No. 1, it stands across the street from the market on a big traffic island in a modern section of the city, known for its tall buildings. When I went to investigate, I was delighted to find free pamphlets in English that give the gate’s history from the Joseon Period until the present.The gate features a stonework base, a two-tiered pagoda-shaped tile roof and a large archway in the center. A few guards in colorful traditional garb stood nearby and I soon heard distant drumming that came closer. It signaled the impending arrival of many men dressed traditionally in colors ranging from royal blue to bright yellow, complete with big hats and boots and carrying large flags. I had arrived in time for the free changing-of-the-guard performance at 11:40 a.m. Only a few others joined me, which was a welcome change from the huge crowds I encountered at similar productions held at Seoul’s palaces. After the short, less-than-10-minutes show, visitors could pose with the men for photos.As a history buff, I really enjoyed my stop here and the lack of tourists. The gate stands between Seoul Station and Seoul Plaza. It can be accessed by Subway Line 1, Seoul Station, Exit 4 and Line 4, Hoehyeon Station, Exit 5. Closed on Mondays."
Historic Gate Well Maintained,"The Sungnyemun Gate was built between 1396 and 1398 and was part of the old Seoul City wall.It has been modified over the years and in 2008 the upper structure was destroyed by fire, but now restored. It is an interesting structure in a city mostly glass an concrete."
Quick photo,It's in the middle of a busy square full of cars. So it's good to see it when you are just passing by and catch a quick photo. 
Antiquity vs Modernity,"Better known as Namdaemun Gate, is one of the symbol of Seoul: One of the 8 gates of the seoul's Fortress.It was built in 1398 during the Taejo Reign.You can walk throught it and take pictures.It's interesting see an historical place like this at the center of traffic jam!You can take a quick visit before entering the Namdaemun Market."
Historical Gate,This gate near Seoul Station is one of the last remaining gates in the walls of ancient Seoul. The gate is located on an island in main road. Best viewed from a distance.
"Interest history, picturesque gate","One of the 4 main gates in Seoul, reconstructed many times most recently in 2008, Sungnyemun Gate is impressive and great for some photos, but not really much to do there. There is a changing of the guard to add some colour (I missed it, but had previously seen the change at Deoksugung - its only a 10 min walk from Deoksugung to Sungnyemun). It's a good place to start a visit to the Namdeamun Market (there is an underpass from Sungnyemun gate to the top of the markets. Worth a quick stop and photo opportunity. More photogenic than Dongdaemun Gate and easier to get a good angle."
Lovely gate,"This is a reconstructed version of one of the original Seoul gates and a lovely one, at that. Probably not worth a trip, but when in the area, worth passing by."
Destroyed by Arson in 2008,"Of the 8 gates in this once walled city, this one was the oldest wooden structure in Seoul until an arsonist climbed up and set a fire which destroyed the wooden pagoda on top of the gate in 2008. It took 5 years and several million dollars to restore this National historic treasure. The Namdaemun Market nearby is named for this South Gate."
Elegant ,Right next to Namdaemun market. I love that it’s randomly in the middle of quite a busy intersection. Stands magnificently. We saw the changing of the guards. There are toilets near by.
Make a quick stop,"There’s not a whole lot to do here but it’s worth checking out if you’re close by. I always like seeing some cool architecture and learning some history while travelling. From what I remember from the plaque... the King came to pray at this gate during times of drought.What you’ll discover when you’re there it is super clean and well maintained. There is no fee to enter. There is a changing of the guard ceremony at certain times which may have a fee, not sure."
A small but nice attraction,"Accidentally stumbled upon it, and right at the time of change of patrols. Quite fun to see, if you can time to it, then you can witness it much closer than at one of the overcrowded palace gates. So, better photo opportunities with no crowd around as well..."
Fantastic landmark with plenty of history,"Located in the centre of a busy junction there’s certainly a contrast between the surrounding office buildings and this cultural landmark. It offers a particularly good photo opportunity at night with the passing vehicle lights and is lit up beautifully. There isn’t a huge amount to look at but what is there is worth taking the time to admire, and there’s plenty of signage explaining the history and significance of the gate. Everywhere is well kept and clean, plus on my weekend visit it wasn’t busy with tourists either.Given that it’s free to enter the grounds and walk through the gate it’s a must see, certainly on a first visit to the city."
Okay for a short visit,"Very large and historical gate that located in the central area of Seoul, convenient location, walking distance to Seoul station and Namdaemun market. Entry is free. The superstructure was destroyed in the arson incident in 2008, and the restoration was completed in 2013."
Quick visit to the historical gate,"The gate is walkable from many stations. If you have the energy, you can walk from this gate to many other spots like the Namdaemun Market, Namsan park, Seoul Station, Seoul Tower, etc.The gate was simple and we took a quick photo before heading to the other stops"
impressive gate,This gate is the largest of Seoul's gates. It is surrounded by nearby sights such as the Namdaemun market and Seoul Station so it is easy to reach.
Looks impressive,Saw this gate while walking from Seoul Station to City Hall. Consider it halfway if going to Myeongdong Market.
Restored historical gate near Namdaemun Market,"Fortunately our hotel was just 5 minutes walk from this very impressive gate, so we actually visited the place three twice during our stay in Seoul. The gate can be reached from it's south side from near Namdaemun market and down a small road beside a mini-mart. The original gate was destroyed in a fire and this is the rebuilt one which is still very impressive. It is the Southern gate to the city of Seoul.During my second visit, by luck actually, I was able to watch the changing of the guards which made the place a lot more special and allowed me to take fairly close up photos of the guards themselves. The guards do not mind photo taking although they will not allow you to get up in their faces the way the guards do outside Buckingham Palace.At the entrance to the gate there is a small booth with an elderly gentleman and brochures freely available in several different languages. There are also public toilets here."
Restored gate after fire,"Sungnyemung Gate , often known as Namdaemun Gate is listed as Treasure Number One in Korea, but it was partially destroyed by fire in 2008 and renovated since then. Tgis gate was the south entrance of the city wall."
Large Gate Near Namdaemun Market,There is no charge to visit this large gate near Namdaemun Market. This is the South Gate of the original four main gates of Seoul. It was a bit surreal to see this gate from the 14th century surrounded by modern buildings. There were guards dressed in period costumes standing by.
Impressive structure though rebuilt ,"It's unfortunate that due to the history of S Korea alot of its historical structures and monuments have been rebuilt and it's no different (though for slightly different reasons) for the gate also known as Namdaemun gate which was destroyed by an arsonist some years back. It's one of the most memorable sights when arriving into the city from the airport as it's at a roundabout. Don't think other gates are open like this is so it was nice to walk through it and pose for pictures with the guards dressed in historic outfits. For kdrama fans, the gate featured in a few scenes from Chicago Typewriter :) If you had to pick one fortress gate to visit in Seoul you can't go wrong with Sungnyemun. "
Landmark of Seoul,"This is the southern gate of Seoul in Joseon Dynasty.Visitors can only watch. But, the symbolic value is higher than any other landmarks.- Also known as Namdaemun literally meaning southern big gate. Locals are more familiar with this name.- The access is from the other side from Namdaemun Market. Easy to circle around finding it.- As many people know, it had been on fire years ago. The one remaining now is a modern work built after studying proofs.- Better to stay away when there's an event or a gathering. It will have a huge traffic around this area."
Accidental find,We were shopping at namdaemun market and chances upon this attraction at the end of the market. Understand that most if not all of this gate had been burnt down and this is a reconstructed one. Basically this is the outer gate to the city with part of the city walls. Ceremonial guards are still been stationed here and they are happy for you to pose beside them for photos. Spend about half an hour here taking photos. 
Beautiful historic gate preservation.,Found this while walking around Seoul - Namdaemun market.A free attraction.This gate was built in the late 1390's and served as the new capital's emperor's gate of exalted ceremonies.The beautiful preservation and grounds keeping was amazing in the middle of a major metropolis.Witnessed the changing of the guards and got to take photos with them!
End of the Market,Bus passed here and it looked like a really interesting place to go. It's located on the Western entrance of the Namdaemun Market. The gate looked really nice.
Cool spot on your way to the main market,"Landed up here by accident looking for the market , the Guard’s are really helpful and in full attire. Quite cool for a few pictures with them but not worth a special trip."
Nice ,"Nice place to visit, everyone would stand to look at the shifting of the guards in a traditional ceremony, you can take pictures with them after the ceremony it was a wonderful to watch how they were dressed and played the drums."
Historical structure,This historical gate is in the middle of a busy part of the city. We saw the changing of the guard from a distance and the guards were dressed in very colourful traditional uniforms. Later on we went to the gate for a closer look. It has a colourful painting on the underside of the archway and there is a sign which gives the history of the gate. An interesting place to quickly stop by if you are in the area.
Pretty but not worth a special trip,"The gate is relatively tourist free and you can get some good pictures when visiting, however there isn’t much to do here.If you are going to the nearby market, then it’s worth a minor detour. But it’s not somewhere to go out of your way to see."
Joseon Guards!,"Known as one of the main gate of Seoul, this historical site is a good place to know more about the Korea. The main attraction for me is the traditional Joseon guards who guard this gate. It will be really attractive when they change the shift in a small traditional ceremony."
Historical Site,"Easy to find and located at a major intersection near Namdaemun Market.It is one of the Eight Gates in the Fortress Wall of Seoul, South Korea, which surrounded the city in the Joseon dynasty. The gate is located in Jung-gu between Seoul Station and Seoul Plaza, with the historic 24-hour Namdaemun market next to the gate. Entry is free and the gate is closed on Mondays.Destroyed by fire in 2008, 5 years restoration followed with it reopening in 2013.We visited on a Monday, not sure what the benefits of it being ""open"" would be, but regardless, a brief visit is all that is necessary."
Near Seoul station,"This gate is located near Seoul station. If you take a train from Seoul, you might have a chance to take a look of it. This is much similar to that of many ancient cities in China. "
Sungnyemun Gate...Historical Site To Visit!,We went there on our first day in Seoul. A great historical site to see...you can see the guards & take photo with them. Very near to the famous Namdaemun Market. You can walk across the street or take the underground pathway...take extra caution if using the underground since it is quiet & a bit creepy. Not advisable if you are alone...
A historical site ,"This historical site is easy to find as it is located in the cross section of a main road. It is also next the popular Namdaemun Market. There is nothing much to see and explore. I would suggest a 30 mins visit would be sufficient to take in the sight. While we were there in the morning at 9 am, we were the only visitors. Recommendation : to throw in this visit while on your way to Namdaemun Market. "
Historic area,Located across from Namdeamun Market. You can either walk across the street or there is an underground path way to Sungnyemun Gate. It free to get. There are a brief descriptions carved into the stone about this place. It is worth seeing and learning the histories of Seoul. 
Sungnyemun Gate,"This impressive Gate is in fact the No.1 Historical Monument in Seoul.Note that the actual gate is closed on Mondays, but it is still possible to absorb the grandeur at any time day or night, when it is lit up. Very photogenic."
Great Scene. Easy to find. Quick Stop,The location is easy to find using google map. The location was closed for visits while I was there. Really beautiful at night. 
"Iconic, a must ","This is a iconic and a must to be place, it is just great. It only take you like 15 to spend there, nice pics and you can say you have been in ROK"
Interesting History,"Not sure I would travel too far out of my way to see this, but was staying close by and the bus from the airport drove past this attraction so I decided to walk over and check it out. Am a fan of history but know pretty much nothing of Korean history. Admission is free and they have nice pamphlets that explain the role in history of this gate. A good job has been done in restoring the gate (especially after someone torched it not that long ago). The guards in authentic costume were more than willing to pose for pictures. Be sure to look up when going through the passage! It is closed on Monday's."
Sungnyemun Gate Review,"It is good that city history is protected. However, nothing extremely special with this attraction. If you are around that region, then it may be possible to visit."
Another gate in the city,We stopped at Hoehyeon station and visited this attraction. It is near the Namdaemun market and Namsan park. We saw some colourful guards here. The roundabout near here is very busy. It is quite beautiful. This place is free to visit.
Palace facade,"This facade is a must see, old guard dress in olden times are maching and guarding the place. They are very accommodating in having selfie with everyone...no entrance fee.."
Landmark ,"Also known as Namdaemun Gate and sits next to the Namdaemun Market. It is considered Korea's National Treasure No. 1. Sungnyemun Gate is the largest castle gate stone structure with an arched entrance in the middle. There is a column on top of a platform, raising the roof and distinguishing the upper and lower stories. Great photo op when visiting Namdaemun Market. Beautiful contrast between this medieval gate and the vibrant modern buildings that surrounds the area. "
Symbol of Seoul,"My friends enjoyed the photo taken Namdaemoon (Soongraemoon) background , one of the 4 main gates of Old Seoul. It is good to visit."
One of the 8 gates of Seoul,This is an impressive structure and one of the 8 gates of the City. it stands in the middle of a big round about so vehicles are constantly driving about. Not far from Seoul Main station and the Nadaemun Night Market. This gate is also known as Nadaemun Gate so can be found easily by taxi. 15 mins from City Hall Metro station which is the closest metro.Only 7 more to go :)
Experience a piece of history from the late 14th century,"It's indeed mind-blowing to think that you are standing in front of a structure that originated from 1396 during the beginning of the Joseon Dynasty. Although the structure is no longer original and has been restored numerous times over the centuries (most recently in 2008 after an arson attack), this National Treasure No. 1 is still worth a quick 15 minutes visit before you move on to the Namdaemun or Namsan attractions. "
"Big Gate, Fancy Gate","To be honest, the style of this gate is pretty jarring, set as it is in the sea of traffic, modern buildings, and large video walls that seems to be what defines Seoul. It's quite pretty, ornate in a manner heavily in line with the styles I associate with China and Taiwan.Alas, there is no quiet here, as traffic is within spitting distance.Still, if you happen to be in the area, it's worth a look."
Love this place ,This place is a must visit when you are in Korea. Love the architecture and the way it's accessible and I come back over and over again Place visit 
Old wall portion of Seoul city,"Nice area to look at and beautiful to photograph at any time. Changing of the guards plus it is lit up at night, so photogenic!"
Rich in history ,"If you are on a trip for history and culture, stop by for 5-10 minutes to say you were here. It sits on a busy corner and there is nothing to do here but look at the monument and take a picture. Once you know the history- it's interesting. "
Worth a 15 min view,There is not s lot to see here however if you are in the area it is an interesting gate to come and see. There were guards present at the site but in general it was very quiet. I only happened to come here as I had to make an errand in this location. 
Pretty at Night,We used this gate more of a landmark to find our hotel. It was very pretty all lit up at night. The surrounding small park closes at 6pm though.
Korea treasure number 1,"Korea is a country that preserve very will its history. Many of monuments and palaces are in excelent conditions. This Namdaemun gate was complete destroyed by a angry man who put fire in it, 6 years ago. It was complete rebuilt and now it is possible to see one of the most famous historical treasure of Korea. "
Part of old Seoul but 15 mins visit is enough,"If you are in the area, then sure head towards the gate. Other than walk through the arch and gaze up at the gate there is nothing else to do here. There were a few ceremonial guards there on a Saturday, but if you have been to the palaces you will have lots of better photos. Nice gate yes and maybe one that has to be visited so the box can be ticked."
Gorgeous gate and surrounding architecture,This is an amazing historic landmark in Seoul and is popular for tourists to visit. We were very impressed with how beautifully maintained it is for its age. There are also tours offered which are helpful for understanding the gate's historic significance.
"One of the three ""city gates"" I saw :)","Not quite as big as Heunginjimun (the Great East Gate) but definitely bigger than the one in the southeast, this city gate with a ""stone base"" as the other two (not many such gates in the city: only these three plus Gwanghwamun which is the first gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace that I personally saw with such a base, and maybe the three gates in the north but I didn't get to those three) is worth checking out although it's kind of hard to ""imagine"" now with big roads and tall buildings all around it what an ""imposing structure"" this gate must have been back in the Joseon days. In any case, it's a well-kept gate with some grass slopes and a nice piece of wall extending on one side, and I was also fascinated by these ""zodiac creatures"" on the edges of the roofs above the two levels of the gatehouse (also to be seen on the roof edges of pretty much all buildings of the city's palaces, I'm not sure if those zodiac figures are a kind of royal symbol or such).From Seoul Station (after arriving by train or the subway Lines 1 & 4), it's just about a 10-minute walk north along the big road Sejong Daero to get to this gate; and just about another 10-minute walk after passing by the Gate, you'll be at the big lawn beside the City Hall (two actually, the old city hall & the current ""all-glass"" one side-by-side) with the beautiful ""I (Seoul in a heart) U"" sign on an edge of the lawn; and about another 20-minute walk after passing by the City Hall, you'll be at Gyeongbokgung (the biggest of Seoul's five palaces) with first seeing the great statues of Admiral Yi Sun Shin & king Sejong the Great before getting to the palace."
"南大門, South Great Gate","Sungnyemun, 崇禮門, meaning Gate of Exalted Ceremonies, is one of the 8 Gates in the Fortress Wall of Seoul which serve to protect the city in the Joseon dynasty. In was built in the 14th Centre by King Taejo. The gate is located just between Seoul Station (10 mins walk) and Seoul Plaza, with the 24-hour Namdaemun market just nearby at the eastern side. Lesser hype than its counterpart the East Gate (Heunginjimon), it is still as marvel. With the lesser tourist horde we got to spend more time and taking better pictures (minus the human and vehicular traffic)! The city gate is made of wood and stone with a two-tiered, pagoda-shaped tiled roof. It was recently restored after arson damaged large part of it. While magnificence it lost much of its authenticity/originality (looks “new” instead)!. Then again it sure looks grand.by day and simply impressive at night. Sungnyemun’s tablet has its name written vertically.While in Japan we go Castle-hunting here in Korea we go Gate-visiting, haha.I will recommend one to visit if you are somewhere nearby – 숭례문 Gate!"
The massive Sungnyemun Gate,This is a beautiful and massive gate built several centuries ago. There is a panel which summarizes its main events. It has an interesting story and was recently repaired after an arsonist set fire to it in 2008. The day we visited it there were some people in military costumes who performed a change of the guard.
Quick photo opportunity ,A part of history in the middle of the city. It's been really cool to find these gates around soul. It's a part of history you can find right in the middle of different parts of Seoul! 
"Cool, but not very worth visiting","Do not get me wrong, I am into Korean history and sightseeings. But this is basically just a gate in the middle of a busy road. You will have hard time to catch clear shot of this gate. Worth maybe for just 10 minutes or so, not more."
A nice place for a visit,"This place is a national treasure for South Korea. It is surrounded by tall and modern office buildings, that are a nice contrast with this traditional place.It is a cool place for good photos.Lamentably we visited the Gate during a Monday, the only day of closing…. There is free admission all the days of the week except on Mondays.Near the gate and crossing an underpass, you can reach the picturesque Namdaemun Market"
Time your visit,"A great ancient monument that has been restored to remind us of how grand and great the gates to the city looked long ago. It is st the western end of the namdaemun street market. Although not very big, it is very grand. The gates are closed on mondays and on other days at 6 or 630 depending on the season. It looks grand by day and simply impressive at night.Tip: see it in late afternoon before u walk the mkts and captured it in the early evening when the lights come on for good photo opportunity. "
A Monument of Historical Significance,Namdaemun Gate is an icon in Seoul. While really just providing a photo opportunity for westerners it is its significance in Seoul's original wall structure that makes it so important.
Gate,"Obviously there isn't too much to do. Just take a couple pictures and that's it. But it looks amazing. Magnificent view, the ancient gate in the middle of the whole modern city. Is really worth a view and couple pics."
One of gates ,"There are 4 main gates to enter to the capital during chosun period ( early 20th to late 20th century). Namdaemun is one of them. The line 4 stops at hoehyun station, exit 5."
Neat history,This is a pretty neat sample of history from Seoul. But make sure that you're there after 9 AM because they don't open before that. Very close to the downtown seoul train station
beautiful architecture,"The south gate (Namdaemun) is probably the most impressive of all the Seoul Fortress gates. I had visited two years ago, and viewed the gate at night. It is much more impressive in the daytime. It was originally built in 1398. The gate was extensively damaged during the Korean War, and was repaired in 1961. The gate was damaged by arson in 2008, and reopened in 2013.It may be easily accessed by subway line 4, Hoehyeon Station, exit # 5 or a 10 minute walk from Seoul Station, exit # 4. If using the Hoehyeon Station, the walk will take you through Namdaemun market which has great shopping. This route will take you to the rear of the gate, and it will be necessary to cross the road and walk around to the entrance of the gate. There is a changing of the guard ceremony sometimes that we were lucky enough to see and take photos with the guards.This was our last stop on our day trip of visiting all the remaining gates of Seoul Fortress, and was probably the best way to end. Admission is free, and the gate is accessible from the front. There is a beautiful mural under the arch."
Very nice!,"This attraction was near the hotel so we went to check it out.It's small, only the gate left but it's very ancient and preserved with great care.The guards with the swords are just so cool thing to see."
Magnificent, Sungnyemun(it means 'Admiration to politeness' gate) is famous for national treasure no.1 in Korea. It is also called Namdaemun(it means 'South' gate).  It shows early Joseon dynasty's(AD14~15s) architecture style.I recommend you to take a picture at night.
"Quick ""To-do"" photo op","This is a nice spot to take the touristic photo while in exploring the neighborhood around it. Walk in, take the picture in front of the gate, and proceed to the Namdaemun Market through the underground path adjacent to the gate entrance."
Massive artwork..,"The gate is similar to the Dongdaemun gate, with the exception that you can walk through it. Visiting one gate should be enough. Although it's just a gate, how many gates are still there from the old times? Feel and experience this antique 'artwork from Seoul dynasty'."
Love the crazy mix of old and new,"If you face the main entrance, you have to go to the right (up the hill) and find the spot to see the crazy mix of old and new..the old gate with an industrial background. Just amazing!"
Majestic Gate at the main Junction,We stayed near this place so we visited many occasions. This is situated right across the Namdaemun Market. Beautiful architecture. Entrance is free.If you are passing this area worth a visit
"Nice gate, busy area","We viewed this gate as it is right next to Namdaemun market, we didn't attempt to get to it as it would require crossing big busy streets. "
Seoul - a walled city- needed gates!,"Seoul is (well, was) a walled city, so has numerous gates, generally identified by direction. The one under review is the South Gate, which is pretty spectacular and is near the Namdaemun Markets, which are accessible by Metro.I've posted a photo of Sungnyemun, but also of the East Gate, so you get the idea.I had hoped to tick them all off, but didn't. Maybe you will?"
A must see historic place ,It's amazing and powerful and great to check out after it was restored. A terrible fire caused by a crazy guy burned it down years ago but now it's nice and beautiful. Tourist can easily go and visit and you will learn so much about Korea and the history of Seoul. I think you should visit around 4pm. The evening sun falls beautifully at the wall. A must go 
It’s just a gate but quite nice,"I wouldn’t consider this a main attraction and worth hunting for while in Seoul. However, if you are in the Myeongong or the Namedaemun area, it’s worth looking out for and snapping some photos. The architecture is beautiful and worth a quick stop."
Worth a visit,"Nice monument. Then u can walk to the walls and then, if u feel fit, walk all the way to the bottom of the North Tower."
A beautiful piece of history and architecture ,"Very much enjoyed visiting with my husband. I was just enthralled to experience a piece of history dating back to 1396, Joseon Dynasty"
Just seeing,"Near Nandaemun Market, walking towards City Hall, I happened to find this gate. Several years ago, I heard this gate burned down, and after that, has rebuilt. Just seeing and taking some photos."
Not your usual gate,"Namdaemun gate is really not that hard to find. Towering in the middle of the road, it is really an eye catcher and a nice piece in a mix of old and new Seoul. I must admit that there is nothing that special with it since a lot of the same structures can be found in the palaces and temples, historically speaking and as a first timer in Korea, I appreciate it and how it is really maintained. "
"Certainly a ""Must See"" Photo Op","S. Korea's Treasure No. 1; the Namdaemun Gate or ""Great South Gate"" (f/k/a Sungnyemun Gate), is a ""Must See"" on list of places to see in Seoul; and provides a good Photo Op."
Namdaemun Gate,"Sungnyemun, one of the eight gates in Seoul. This is only a walking distance from the namdaemun market."
Not a must see,"Considering all the sights in Seoul the Namdeamun Gate is not a must see. there are so many gates in Seoul, all very similar, and actually not much to see as such. So if one has enough time and is nearby it makes sense, but in case of a busy schedule this gate can be skipped."
Nothing much to see!,"Just a gate located in the centre, you actually don’t have to look for it shopping and moving around in Namdeamun you will see it, if you want to take a picture evening hours are perfect!"
A Impessive Historic Gate!,"This gate which is a reproduction due to it being burned down, it's in the middle of a busy traffic island. If you don't get to see any Korean gates then you must see this one!"
Beautiful stone work,Not an extensive attraction but worth walking around to see the extraordinary gates and beautiful stone work in the walls. The gate is also beautifully lit at night - worth the night time photographs.
Symbolic gate in the middle of the city,Closely located to Namdaemun markets. It is in the middle of an intersection surrounded by buildings so lovely mix between old and new.
Another great gate ,"In the middle of the big, modern city - get transported back to the glory of another time. Impressive gate and nice place to have a break and get inspired. "
Historic gate in the middle of the road ,"It stands like a statue with nothing around it . So one can see it , take pictures and move on , that would be my advice "
Cool to see the history,It's cool to see from a historical standpoint but is only worth about 10 minutes to look at. You can't even walk through the gate. 
"Rebuilt after arson attack, it's pretty neat to see",When you first see it you are struck by how it seems so out of place! Now imagine many years ago the walls that encircled the city of Seoul and this w as one of the principal gates to enter/depart the city.It was the victim of an arson attack a few years ago but has been entirely restored. The paintings are beautiful.There's a stamp challenge you can do if you visit all four former city gates (for the cardinal directions). Pick up a sheet at the visitor center and get your first stamp right outside (ask if you can't find it). Great idea!You'll undoubtedly be near the gate if you venture out to shop at Namdaemun Market. Come over here to escape the crowds and regroup.
Old gate in the middle of modern Seoul,I like the contradt between the old gate and the new buildings around it.Next to the gate is a market which is nice to walk around.
Not much to see,"a great history and story behind this place, even recent events but not a real lot to see here. Only visited as I was at the market. A place of pride for Koreans"
keeping the authenticity,Its amazing to see these gates right on the road when u are driving through the city. its so nice that korea is keeping its authentic buildings maintained which actualy enhances the beauty of the city
Historical Site with famous market,"Namdaemun is a historical sight, but for me the most attractive thing is the import market nearby. In this market, you can buy many local products, clothes, food, drinks. And also some western imported stuff is available here. Intresting place, take 2~3 hours to enjoy the shopping experience."
If the door talks,"It is a very good place, a must, any you should have a photo in your library and share it. This place says 'you are in Korea'. Also I recommend a little reading of its history. You won't spend more than 20' there."
historic place of interest,"historic place of interest, nice and free. will be better if there are more photo taking point, tour guides to guide us there"
Namdaemun Gate,"Not the most interesting attraction in Seoul. Once you've looked at it for a minute, there's nothing else to see in the surrounding area and it's very similar to the other gates which are situated all over Seoul"
good stop while walking around!,It's a symbol gate of Namdaemun area! You should take photos here! It was worth walking in daytime or nighttime but at night you can have a very pretty picture here cos the light makes it more interesting & stunning!
nice,"Big, nice gate in the middle of a huge square. Very nice for taking pictures and walk around. Don't stop a lot of time, but worth a few metro stops and minutes of walk."
Seoul's most beautiful gate is worth walking or driving by,"Sungnyemun - recently rebuilt after being burnt down by a lunatic - is truly stunning. I absolutely love how they restored it by mixing in neat modern white-ish materials on the edge with the antique actual door at the middle. What's fascinating about this neighborhood (besides the door) is that it is so diverse. You're a couple of minutes away from Seoul Station, the ultramodern City Hall, the old Deoksogung palace, the traditional Namdaemun market, decrepited smaller houses on the South Side, and sky-reaching glass buildings on the North End. This place is really central to Seoul and Korea, and the fact that cars swirl around the door only reinforces the sentiment that Sungnyemun is really the heart of the city of Seoul."
Good place to shop for local products and clothes,"Namdaemun Market is a place that tourists must go. They sell various types of stuffs. From daily products, local products, clothes (adults and children). Remember to bargain for discount before buying as some of the products are more expensive. You can get cheap facial products from ""The Face Shop"" at Namdaemun Market as well. Please note that the retail opening hour is mostly from 9am till 5pm and from 10pm till wee in the morning for whole sale.Do remember to try their local delights at the tented restaurants on wheels (Pojangchama). They open from evening till late at night."
Worth a look,"If you go to Namdaemun it's a pity not to visit this gate and snap a few pictures. Well re-constructed, looks beautiful."
"""National Treasure No 1""","This was once the main South Entrance to the Seoul City Walls. Now at the North side of the interesting Namdaemun Market, it has recently been extensively restored. Despite being rather surrounded by traffic and modern development, it is certainly worth a look. "
A Short Walk From Seoul Station,We had a long lay over at Incheon Airport and we took the Express train to Seoul station so we could visit Sungnyemun Gate and Namdaemun Market. It was very easy and much more fun than sitting in the airport for seven hours.
Pretty gate,"This is the symbol of the nation and a point of pride for the Korean people. It looks very nice and it has been well re-constructed after the arson attack a few years ago. While it is a nice gate, there is little there to take up your time as a tourist. After a few good photos of the gate, you can move on without having to explore it deeper."
Ornamental Gate,"Like the Dongdaemun Gate, the Namdaemun Gate is just a historical structure in the middle of an intersection, with little else to see or do. Seeing either one would suffice, since they are pretty similar. I wasn't too enamoured by the quiet, dark and even boring Namdaemun Night Market nearby as well, so I would recommend that you just head to Dongdaemun for a view (and mandatory picture) of the gate, and a far better shopping and dining experience."
Contrasting gate,"This gate is located in the middle of busy streets, which make it contrast with its surrounds and also a pretty interesting view and co existence of past and present. It is a beautiful construction itself but doesn't differ from the other gates, so it is not a must."
Magnificent Gate,"It's located right in the heart of Seoul on the far-end from Gyeongbokgung Palace, through Gwanghwamun Square, to Seoul City Plaza & Deoksugung Palace. Actually, it's a misnomer to call it a gate because it does not lead to anywhere. It's just a beautiful structure built during the Joseon Dynasty and one of the 8 gates in the Fortress Wall of Seoul which surrounded the city during that time. It dates back to the 14th century and is designated as the first National Treasure of Korea. Right next to it is the 24hr Namdaemun Market.. It is more stunning in the evening when it is beautifully illuminated & great for taking photos."
