World of Entertainment,"MBC world is Korea's first broadcasting theme park, you can experience dancing and singing with your favirite kpop star, become one of your favorite drama's main character, watch your kpop idol in hologram, etc. Located in Digital Media City. So if you're a kpop fanatic or kdrama avid fan, be sure to drop by this place."
Full Kdrama Experience,"I love the fact that i got to see the famous MBC shows thru different technology interaction & other activities. It has a cute & fun way of being with the stars. It costs 18,000 won for adults and there will be 3 areas where you can explore. It has time limit though so you might want to skip some lines that you really don't like. I particularly like the area where you can take pictures along with the stars (Lee Min Ho's Personal Taste, Kim Soo Hyun's Moon Embraces the Sun & Gong Yoo's Coffee Prince posters). I also danced with BTS in an interactive show. I got to be a reporter for MBC & I got to peek at a live MBC show too. I got to see the Idol Radio studio where Astro's MoonBin is always a co-host there! It's worth the visit if you are a fan of kdrama & kpop. I went there via Metro then walked for about 10minutes. Before going to the entrance of MBC, you'll see k-stars walk of fame where their hand prints are embedded. Tip: Go early on a weekday to avoid long queue."
Not worth the price for us,"Personally, we feel like the activities were not worth the price :( We only got to enjoy the interactive dance with kpop idols and taking trick eye pictures with MBC dramas which are just a few. The saving grace of this activity was the statue outside which was featured in Kill Me Heal Me drama. Otherwise, we feel like we might have just explored other activities since this was also a bit far from where we stay in Myeongdong."
MBC World Experience,"Went to this place because one of my sisters is such a big fan of Korean Dramas. Went there early to beat the crowd. Fortunately there was no crowd at all except some very young grade school students doing a tour. The place was divided into three activity areas and you are only given 90 minutes for the whole experience. The first area that we went to was a section where you can watch a Big Bang holographic concert as well as digital interactive stations with famous k pop stars where you can have your photo taken with them. You can also experience being a newscaster for the day. If you love dancing then there is also a section for that. The second area are photo ops with stars of different famous k-drama and their backdrops. Another room is like going to a trick eye museum where you can have lots of photo ops with famous celebrities. Actually this area came out great in photos. The last area was interaction with famous celebrities using the latest VR technology. Lastly, after the tour you can either buy physical photos or an MBC usb card containing your photos and videos for 20K won. Overall, I think it was not value for the money considering the experience that you will get. But if you are such a big k-pop and k-drama fan then this place is for you."
K-pop and K-drama,"I think this is a must see for all k-pop/k-drama fans! There are three sections in the tour - I think the order varies per visitor as they have to manage the traffic. The first section I visited was the photo section, wherein you can take interactive photos with a lot of different k-stars. I believe there was also a booth where you can record a k-pop song. The next section I entered was the historical bit of MBC so I just browsed through the exhibition. The last part included newscasting demo (should be done by pairs), an exhibit of Jewel in the Palace, 4D performances, and a hologram concert experience. The best one was probably the Big Bang hologram concert followed by the interactive photos. As my access comes free with my Discover Korea pass, it was an ok experience to try."
MBC World! An exciting place to see how South Korean TV works.,"My wife loves watching Korean soap operas, so I made it a point to go to MBC World in order for her to see Korean TV at work. We pretty much enjoyed the place. There are 3 sections, sections M, B, and C. Although it is difficult to find, and when we asked directions, some of them don’t know the place or don’t know English."
For all the Fangirls/Fanboys,"Included this in our itinerary because of actor Jang Hyuk. I am a huge fan and when I found out that I could get his digital signature from this place, I immediately included this in our itinerary. =)From the Digital Media station, a 20-minute is required before you reach the MBC park. In it is the MBC building itself, the MBC mall, cafes, and other random buildings. During that time, there was a political rally going on (to oust Park Gun Hye) so my mum was kind of turned off. Good thing there was also a bazaar happening and we bought a few interesting stuff from it. =)Inside the MBC world, you get to experience K-Pop, K-dramas, and K-shows (MBC-produced, of course). There are sections wherein you can get to ""interact"" with your favorite idols, actors, and even watch a Big Bang concert, in either hologram or make-believe digital arts. It's really cool. =) There's also a ""walk of fame"" section there and palms of various well-known Korean personalities are in it (like Jang Hyuk, Song Joong Ki, Kim Woo Bin, TVXQ's Changmin and U-Know, Song Il Kook, Yu Jae Suk, Shinhwa's Eric Mun, FT Island's HongKi, CNBlue's YongHwa, Ha Ji Won, and a whole lot more).We also got to see a live airing of a radio show.So yeah, it's a must visit tourist attraction. We find it a bit pricey but since we don't get to do it everyday, we tried it. The staff too are very accommodating so it's a plus. =) I just hope Big Bang's not the only K-Pop group to be heavily promoted there. Not that I hate them but I'm not just a fan."
MBC WORLD: The future is here,MBC is an all in one location with fascinating sites and activities. The studio is modern and the staffs are friendly. The place is well secured and contains replicas from famous Korean artists.
Not as good as I expected,"I applied to join this tour through Hallyu Seoul so it was free (apparently there are a bunch of activities you can join from there). The tour was divided into three parts (M,B, C) and you get to do different activities respectively. The staff were quite nice, they can speak basic English so you can get help from them easily. I was lucky to see Korean stars hosting a radio show during the tour. Otherwise, the tour was just full of places for you to take pictures or to act scenes out. I don't think this place was worth my time."
Great experience for Korean Drama and Pop lovers!,"I visited this studio and it felt like an out of world experience from watching so many Korean dramas. The staff were pretty friendly and helpful in directing the visitors. The entrance fee is about $18. Many well suited security guards were present to protect the place, just like in the Korean dramas!There were a 4 different areas to go to and you can tour them all, but have about 90 minutes total. Each area is specifically blocked off for visitors. You can take pictures or they have built in cameras, but you do need to pay for the pictures either printed out or on a USB. You get a pass where you insert into the various machines to record pictures you take on the various machines. There are booths where you ""interact"" with hologram/screen celebrities, a hologram ""live"" show that was really fun to watch, and a virtual reality tour and ride you go on, unfortunately it it only in Korean, so I didn't understand. Many staff were available to assist with any questions and directions. This was a great experience to for a Korean drama lover like me and I highly recommend other fans to visit. There are lots of activities to keep you busy and you have lots of photos to remember the experience by. Go with a friend who can take pictures This place is not somewhere I would go twice though. The novelty was the best part. "
Quirky Stop,"I planned a stop here to waste some time before my departing flight. I know nothing about Korean dramas, but thought it'd be a fun cultural thing. Despite what the website suggests, you don't really need a tour. This is a self guided experience. It is split into 3 different zones. M Zone is basically a series of photo ops and audio experiences that you can later buy. B Zone is a small trick eye photo op museum. C Zone is the most interesting part. There is live radio, a look into the newsroom, some VR experiences, a newscast you can act out, a hologram theater, and a few photo ops. It's a fun little thing that doesn't take a ton of time. The price might be a little high since half the attraction is a photo op money grab, but I still thought it was amusing for an hour or so. This should only be an add on if you have run out of things to do."
Boring experience even for drama lovers,"I've visited there with my parents after I read many good reviews about it. The tour costs 18$ and is divided for three zones for a total of hour and a half. Zone C is a complete waste of time, except from GD's singing hologram. Zone B is nice but very short and limited. The only one that was a bit worth it was zone A(the one with the performance, I watched Big Bang, I'm a big fan and I didn't find it very enjoyable). Overall, it's a waste of your time and I recommend you not give time in your schedule for this attraction."
My Hallyu experience,"If you are looking for kpop and kdrama tour,you will love it.You can take a photo with your bias,record the song,dance kpop with the idols and find other excited things."
Korean Drama Theme Park!!,"The Location: Inside MBC TV station (total 3 zones, different zone has different exhibit and activities)The Admission: $18 for adult. If you would like to save all pictures & videos on USB card, that is additional $30. If not, you can purchase pictures individually. This is definitely the Korean Drama Theme Park!! Zone 1 - There are different sets that you can take pictures with the drama characters. Get your camera ready!!!Zone 2 - You can take visual pictures with celebrities. My favorite is definitely with G-Dragon!! And you can also have sing with G-Dragon inside the recording studio. Lots of photo opportunity!!Zone 3 - They display items from the famous MBC dramas. You also get to see a mini concert video performed by Big Bang. You can have a private dance lesson with one of the KPOP groups. You also get to be a news anchor, how fun is that!! You can record all these fun adventure on their USB card.... for $30. Outside the building, there are star alley, you will find famous actors/actress/singers hand prints on the ground. There are also cut out boards of drama characters. There is also a area that you can watch LIVE radio shows. I think $18 admission is reasonable. However, I wish they can lower the price for photo printing and USB card. $5 per photo and $30 for USB card are a little bit pricey. But overall, it is a fun place to check it out if you are familiar with Korean drama and celebrities."
MBC Drama Lovers will enjoy this place,"If you're a K-drama fan, especially MBC dramas, you'll enjoy visiting the first broadcasting theme park in South Korea. Lots of photo opportunities with celebrities' life-sized standees as well as 3D drama scenes, and there's even a hologram theatre here too. Best to visit this place on weekdays so you can skip the waiting time and enjoy the theme park thoroughly! It's located within the MBC building in Seoul itself."
Surprisingly Fun....,The visit was surprisingly entertaining even though I don't normally watch MBC dramas or anything to do wit MBC Korea. Lots of fun activities to do....
For Korean Dramas lovers,"The place is quite interesting if you are familiar with dramas and kpop stars. There are many decorations where you can take pictures like being part of shows and movies. Many different games and visual tools make you really feel like a new star. However, I expected something more like seeing a real studio, places of shooting dramas (not only pictures and posters). That is a good place for teenagers, kind of TV amusement park to have a bit of fun.But I really have to mention that hologram concert with Bigbang was a great experience!!"
""" if you love korean telenovelas, never miss going to MBC World, Seoul""","My cousins and I who love watching korean tele-novelas really had an amazing experience at MBC World and a plus factor of having a tour-guide from VIP Travel named Chance Kim. The seemed-real temples, the prison cells, the village houses and a lot more are awesome.. Just be ready with your cameras so that you can immediately upload the pictures on your facebook account lol.. Chance was not just our tour-guide but also became our photographer. He can speak English well and that he showed us around and answered our questions well."
amazing,"If you are a fan of Korean drama, you must go to MBC World in south Korea. This is my first time my Korean friend brought me to there. In MBC World, you will find that there is so big. You can take many photos, play games and enjoy 3D video."
take pictures with your favourite celebrities,"this is a new theme park opened under MBC last year. you get to take pictures with your favourite celebrities, like 2NE1, big bang, psy, and favourite variety shows, like we got married. the virtual part is pretty amazing. experience hologram concert which is so real. head over to olive young that is just nearby to stock up your skincare & cosmetics!"
