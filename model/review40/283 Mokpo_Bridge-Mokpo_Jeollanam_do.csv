It's a Bridge.,"And hardly the Firth of Forth railway bridge.It's just a typical, late-20th-centruy bridge.Not worth a side trip."
Worth a view from Yadal Mountain.,Best view is from top of Yadal Mountain especially at night when its all light up.You can also get a great view from the ferry when coming into port.
A few days of relaxing trip to Mokpo ,We stayed at a business hotel for 40 dollars a night near the beach and Lotte Mart. We visited the major attractions and restaurants. Daytime is not as interesting as the night time. Eating and hanging around in cafe are major pastime. Walking along coast is also enjoyable.
Final views and stop on 4 Rivers Bike Trail,Mokpo is the furthest SW location on the awesome 4 rivers bike trail which also goes to Busan. Seoul and Incheon and many places in between. The Makpo bridge and the wide Yeongsan gang (river) is spectacular. Great way to end our 1500 km bike ride
Cruising at Mokpo River!,The view is simply amazing whilst get on cruise over the Mokpo Water. We went under the stunning bridge.
Mokpo Bridge after sunset,"If you are travelling to Mokpo, and you enjoy photography, you will not be disappointed. Of the numerous sites to capture images of in Mokpo, taking a picture of the Mokpo Bridge is certainly a highlight. The bridge is an architectural marvel, and is especially nice to photograph as the sun is setting and within an hour after sunset when the bridge lights start to come on. Be sure to bring your tripod!The are a number of great access points near the beach in Mokpo on Haeyangdaehak-ro. This is the road that the Marine University is on.The image I took is within an hour of sunset and I was positioned on a concrete boardwalk that juts out into the water beside the beach....This area is accessible by bus, by car, or by taxi, and is a beautiful place to just walk as the sun is setting, while the ships are sounding their horns.......very peaceful.....enjoy!"
