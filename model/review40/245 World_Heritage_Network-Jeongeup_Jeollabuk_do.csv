Brilliant multi-coloured autumn foliage in Naejangsan!!!,"From my research, one can take the 171 bus to reach the National Park. You can find the bus station is across the street from the Jeongeup train station, right in front of the ""Toast & Coffee"". The ride is approximately half an hour. Alternatively, for more convenience, you can engage a private tour with the comfort of a private transport. Between these two, we chosed a private tour from World Heritage Network as we thought we are too old to line up for buses with other tourists. We needed comfort and only wish to relax and enjoy our tour without any rush or stress. In this private tour, we were picked up from our hotel in Jeongeup by a very friendly guide, Sue.When we reached Naejangsan, we noticed there are two different entrances. Each will lead you to different attractions. Sue guided us to the main entrance to see autumn leaves along a road. We realised the trail is very easy & gentle in gradient (saw elderly in wheelchair seriously!). The brilliant multi-coloured autumn foliage along the way is truly awesome. The little streams, bridges, and dangling branches in amazing red, yellow & green makes poetic sceneries. Beyond words. Lots of local visitors lay casually on the lawn between the trees and enjoy a sunny picnic. If you don't want to bring your own food, there are little food & drinks stalls along the way, selling local snacks like fish-balls and pancakes. After around 2 hours of very casual walking/photo-shooting, you can find the Naejangsan temple (me-think not as spectacular as the red-leaves though). You only need a full day tour to this beautiful place with proper guidance from a guide. Later, we were transferred back to our hotel late in the evening. We saw many tourists waiting for 171 Bus in Naejangsan and Sue said the bus was delayed due to the influx of tourists and there were not enough public buses to fetch all the tourists due to the autumn peak season. So visiting Naejangsan in high season by a private tour is recommended."
