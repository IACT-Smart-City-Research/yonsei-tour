Peaceful place,"With a little shower makes a different feeling for the park, plenty of flower rain dropped onto our head. It was beautiful. No words can describe it. "
Quite ordinary,"I went to Jinhae in late March and visited the Eco-Park which was located further down the Yeojwacheon Stream. Not hard to find. It turned out to be quite disappointing as there were very few flowers, nothing like the cherry blossom laden Yeojwacheon located at the park entrance. Food was not allowed into the park.Took only one picture (of a willow tree). Maybe a good place to take a leisurely walk."
Not bad,Went there with an 8 and 10 year old. They didn't care much for it until we found a TON of tadpoles to watch. Just a pond with a walking track around it and a work out station.
Changwon Naesumyeon Eco Park,"This park is very beautiful in spring and in autumn. This place is also famous for a drama-shooted place. In spring, you should take pictures of reflected cherry blossoms, Also, in autumn, trees around the lake put on autumnal tints."
a perfect place for a short walk,I enjoyed a walk around the small lake in this park (no bicycles allowed) It is very peaceful and there is a small exercise area which the locals use. Pretty viewing points along the walk and a small 'forest' area. It is small but worth the visit if you are in the area. There are signs that indicate No food or drink - pity because it would be nice to sit on one of the benches and have a small picnic. There is a water fountain and bathrooms and information desk at the entrance. Pamphlets all in Korean. No English. It is small but worth visiting if you are in the area anyway. I would not make a special trip just to visit.
