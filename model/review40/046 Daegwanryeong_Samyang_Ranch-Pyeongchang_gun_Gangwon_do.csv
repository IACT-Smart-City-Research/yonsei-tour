Nothing,"When we reached the entrance, we were told there were only 8 sheep but we still went ahead. Maybe it was not a good month to visit because when we got in. There was absolutely no sheep at all. What made the trip nice was it snowed heavily when we got there on 15th March 2019."
Nice place for pics.,"There isn't that much to see though I have a feeling a lot of people come just for the store which sells instant noodles at a super discounted rate. The scenery was pretty though and we took some fun family pics.Make sure you know when the bus leaves each location. The driver doesn't count the number of people and if you miss it, he'll leave you."
During winter the ranch close at 4.00pm,"This is sheep ranch and very big area and for family with children, will take about 1 hour plus to complete to whole area. But it is good for education and very nice view during winter since you can see a lot of snow covered the mountain and etc. Even you can feeding the sheep and etc. Beware that the entrance is about 800m walking from parking area. The charges for the ticket still okay and i could not remember but if not mistaken about KRW5000 for adult. Nevertheless you can always check the price online."
A mountain pasture,"Excellent place to see where your dairy comes from. Scenic pastures, mountain views. My boys enjoed meeting the cows and sheep"
Feed the Sheep,This is a pretty site where you can feed sheep. There are also some snacks available just outside the entrance. The fee is small so worth a short visit. 
Stark beauty during Winter,Visited this ranch last winter and it was very very beautiful. We took a cab from Hoenggye and the cab driver agreed to take us on a private tour for KRW50K/USD50 inclusive of entry fee. There was no timeline so we took our time. He drove us around the ranch and we could freely ask him to stop at all the scenic spots for photography. Most the the spots were well marked so those wanting to have their photographs taken at drama locations will be very happy.Winter is not the best time to go for taking photographs as the cold winds were very harsh! However the winter landscape was undeniably beautiful...a stark kind of beauty. Definitely worth a visit!
Not worth the stop in April,"With such good reviews, we were excited to take our kiddos to see this Ranch. We went early this month and were not impressed. We paid about 30,000 won for entrance and only saw the ostrich's and a couple of sheep. The dairy farm was closed to visitors and none of the animals were out in their fields, but stuck in their little pens. Our kids were pretty disappointed. Be sure to bring food if you plan to go around lunch. The restaurant and shop has a lot of ramen and frozen beef and that is about it."
Sheep farm ,Took the hotel shuttle bus to the sheep farm. Cost 2200 won per pax. Was around 20-30min journey. Entry was 4000 won per pax including sheep feeding. Was quite fun. Kids will definitely enjoy it. 
Huge and amazing!,"This place is very amazing not only as a ranch but as an entertainment. This ranch made by Samyang, which is one of representative food companies in Korea so that in this place, you can taste some food which made by that company Samyang. You can try Samyang's ramyeon and some dairy food before touring that ranch. In Summer, it gives you a free tour bus so you can take on whatever you want and the scenery was really great on the top of this ranch, personally. I recommend this place! "
Cute Animals and Best Dairy Ever!,"The place is a great place to visit, especially if you're traveling with kids. There are a lot of sheep and Holstein cows. At the same time, there is also an ostrich enclosure. There are also wind turbines and the view is breathtaking. I like that there is a Samyang noodle store within the property that also sells milk and cheese made from cows in the area (or for the cheese, Korean cows at least). What is amusing is that they even sell blankets made from the fleece from their own sheep. "
Breathtaking Views,"Took a bit of effort to get the to highest point of the park/ranch where the view was well worth it. But beware, shuttle buses do not run in winter when the roads are icy but you can drive all the way up in your own vehicle. The drive takes about 30 minutes and can be challenging if you're not used to driving in icy conditions. The view was simple breathtaking, snow covered mountains and wind turbines. Apparently, quite a few Korean dramas and movies were filmed in the area too! This place is highly recommended if you're already in the Pyeongchang/Yongpyong area."
A break from city lives,"Hoenggye is just a small cute city ,not many building and buses.I took a taxi from the town to the ranch ,taxi fare is 13,000won/way ,since there are not many buses and remote ,you have to ask the cab driver for his name card and ask the ticketing staff to contact him when you return ,It is about 25 min by car.The entrance fees to the ranch is about 8000 won and there are free shuttle bus service to the top of the ranch.time table is display on the window of the ticketing office,it is about 20 to 30 min interval.There are about 4 pick up point,so if you are tired of walking ,you can hop in to the bus.The bus will stop at the top of the ranch and from there you can walk down,it is beautiful and peaceful.first is the sheep farm then cow,there are a few farms which i cannot remember.It take about 2hours or so depend on how fast you walk to reach the bottom,where there are cafe or shops selling ice cream ,milk and samyang instant noodles.i reckon that it will be beautiful in autumn,weather is cool and air is fresh,however i heard that the animals may not be out in colder season.It was a good experience for people who live in the city to see so many animals and indeed the scenery is beautiful with slope and the area is really big.I will recommend to people who want something different in korea."
