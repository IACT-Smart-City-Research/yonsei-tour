Attractive scenery,"It was very windy when I visited Seoraksan and the cable car stopped functioning. My friends and I hiked the Biryong trail to see the waterfall. The waterfall is stunning and worth the hike. The hike is not too long distance but relatively difficult for a beginner hiker like me. The Hallasan Yeongsil trail is easier than Biryong trail but much longer distant. Biryong trail has more stone paths, hanging bridge etc. Overall, I would revisit Seoraksan again for the beautiful scenery."
Perfect for a stroll and nature viewing,"If you want to be in nature but don’t want to hike, this park is perfect for you. You can take your family here for a nice stroll, but make sure you go on a sunny and warm day unless you want to freeze! I went when it was super cold (but hiked, so it was OK) so I took a warm jacket and it was alright, but I think it would’ve been much better if I had gone in the springtime."
Good views,"I did not join the hiking tour but took an easier one ie getting to the top in a cable car. The whole trip was much easier than originally thought. I had to wait only 40 minutes for the cable car (running every 5 minutes and carrying 50 persons; best to buy the cable car ticket as early as possible); took pictures of the Buddha statue and of the surrounding areas in the meantime, before going back to the cable car station. Then there was a walk of some minutes up to the fortress. The walk was not difficult and the stairs were lined with anti-slip rubber. At the top there were many people; all coming up for the expansive views. The whole trip took about 3 hours."
Absolutely a must do ,"Can easily spend days here doing all the various walks, bring water as some of the hikes are a little tough but are so worth it "
One of the most beautiful places in Korea,"Hailing from a lovely mountainous place myself, I take hikes and surrounding mountains very seriously while traveling. There’s just something soul soothing about strolling along beautiful scenery, surrounded by nature. Seoraksan is massive, with the best views coming from the hikes themselves rather than just the cable car area shown in photos attached. There are food areas near Seoraksan cable car, and great snacks available this time of year such as Hotteok. It an absolute must see, photos cannot do it justice. Definitely look up more on the park before you go, you won’t be disappointed. "
Hike+Autumn Leaves,"The easiest(??) and one of the popular route to seoraksan is to the Biryong waterfalls. We went here on a weekend, so it was like everyone from Seoul wanted to see Seoraksan. By the last week of October, there are already autumn leaves around the middle of the hike up to the water fall. If you want a more leisurely hiking pace, go here on a weekend. There are many restaurants, a coffee shop and many agricultural stores, but nobody speaks English. There are some street food, however, if you have allergies, the Ahjumma's will not be able to explain the ingreadients."
A view to remember,"It was autumn and though it came later than predicted this year, the view was still amazing. I would definitely come again and try out the trails. Went up through cable car and the hiking to the peak from cable car station on top, was not steep (+ stairs). I would like to enjoy just sitting still while watching the view for at least an hour up there. Unfortunately due to time constraint, was not able to do it. If you stay in Seoul and would like to come here, make sure you arrive at the express terminal station early in the morning to take earliest bus to Sokcho!"
Nice walking,"Be aware that this park is very busy! Weekends are a no no, so we arrived on a Monday but even then it was crowded. However we saw some lovely Autumn colours and the paths are quite good to walk. We did take one to the round rock and this wasn’t so easy for walking - a lots of steps made of large rocks really. Enjoyable though."
Autumn Beauty,"We enjoyed a full day in the park. We appreciated views of beautiful riverscapes, autumnal tree foliage and rugged mountain formations. The varying angles and levels of light added to the spectacle. Be warned: we were there on a Monday and it was very busy with long queues of cars to enter the site and lots of people."
Seoraksan National Park,"The park is Very well maintained considering that it is quite a huge park. Requires lots of walking, for some hiking. Take the cable car for a closer view of Mt. Seorak & its surroundings. There is a big sitting buddha & temple as well. The natural landscape of the park makes for a relaxing ambience."
One of the prettiest mountain parks in South Korea,"Come in early October and look for the Autumn colours. Climb the heights to one side, or take the cable car on the other. And indulge in the countryside drinks (dong dong ju) and the mushrooms. Beautiful views, and hiking at all levels of physique."
Korean nature,"Excellent park with many good though steep walks. The entrance with the many food places is a little off putting, but most visitors do venture beyond this area. Well maintained paths and clearly signposted."
a scenic mountains and fun cablecar,"the park itself is average however the mountains surrounding it are really beautiful. If you love hiking, it is one of the best place, I guess. However, I visited with my family, we opted for the cable-car. there was a long waiting. if you are not lucky you will not see anything even if you are on the top of the mountain. check the weather, and avoid cloudy-rainny days to get the best view from the top."
Tiring but worth it,Ulsan Rock was spectacular and beautiful! Needless to say it was tiring but definitely worth! Didnt manage to visit the others but heard its good too!
Wonderful visit,"We spent a lovely couple of Spring days exploring the various paths and sights of Seoraksan National Park. There's a lot to see and do, and even though there are a lot of people at the park's entrance and going up and down the cable car, it's also a breeze to leave the crowds behind with a bit of walking. We loved it, and I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys getting out and about. Our two sons (10 and 12), enjoyed the challenge of spotting the many birds and mammals about, and none of the walks were too challenging or difficult."
Gorgeous nature,"This National Park is a must see when visiting Korea. We booked a hotel in nearby Sokcho to visit the park multiple days. There are lots of different hikes which will show you the absolute best of the natural beauty of Korea. Some hikes can be challenging, so make sure you start your hike well equipped ."
Day trip to Seoraksan,"The scenery on the way to Seoraksan National park was beautiful. We had to go through several tunnels and it was nice. Got to Seoraksan and took a cable car up to the Gwongeumseong Fortress. The view from the top was amazing. Not far from the entrance, we can go to see the Buddha statue and the Sinheungsa Temple. Keep following the temple wall you can make your way towards the Heundeulbawi rock and then the famous Ulsan Rock. The walk was not that hard, but the climb from Hendeulbawi to Ulsanbawi is quite challenging if this is your first time hiking. The walk in the forest is really nice. It is so calm and relaxing. If you have plenty of time, you can visit other places in Seoraksan National Park. Since I joined a day trip to this place, I don't have enough time to explore the whole place. But if you only have limited of time, going to Gwongeumseong Fortress is a must, then you can take either Biseondae course or Ulsanbawi course (depending on the time you have). All and all, this place is worh visiting."
"Superb mountain view, cable car and good hiking trails","It was good experience. The rock mountain is good for all ages. Getting to the mountain peak via cable car makes it possible for children or even ladies with flat sandals or slippers to climb the peak. The peak was crowded with people, even with children. The mountain view is breathtaking and you can see the small Sokcho City and Sea of Japan from the top. There were other rock mountain and several nice places that can be hiked in the area/park, but unfortunately I was not able to reach those places due to time constraint. Definitely will be back for the Ulsan Bawi and other parts that are worth exploring!"
Great nature park,"From Sokcho city, I took bus 7 or 7-1 to this national park. T-money card is accepted for bus, ride is about 25 mins. The entrance ticket is 3,500 won. I started by heading to Biryong Waterfall, a relatively easy hike. I took about 1 hour 45 mins round trip, including a 20 mins break at the waterfall. Next, I took a cable car to Gwongeumseong Fortress. The cable car ride is rather expensive, 10,000 won return ticket for 5 mins ride one way. At the top cable car station, it takes about 10 mins to climb up the steps to reach the fortress. It was not overly crowded as the area is spacious. Unfortunately, it was drizzling and foggy when I was there. I managed to take a few clear shots in between the fog arriving and disappearing. I then took the cable car back and had lunch at the food court of cable car station. Initially, I planned to hike Ulsanbawi Rock after lunch. It was still raining and view was foggy. I decided to visit the nearby Sinheungsa Temple before calling it a day and then return the next day. Fortunately, my travel plan is flexible to accommodate this. I was glad the next day was bright and sunny, with clear blue sky. I finally hike to Ulsanbawi Rock, which was the highlight for me. See my separate review. Overall, I had a memorable time visiting Seoraksan National Park and highly recommend it."
Best hike EVER :) don't miss it,"I have to say I'm not a hiker. Before coming to Korea I didn't like hiking. But I fell in love with Seoraksan. I did 2 hikes there. One day I went to Ulsanbawi rocks (pretty light hike, many stairs) - all in all around 2 hours to get to the top. A lot temples and nice views along the way. But best was a hike to the top Daechongbong Peak. It's really long hike, you have to start early because it is 11km to the top and it took me almost 5 hours getting to the top but it was definately worth it. You have nice views almost always. first 3km are just a walk, than anouther 3,5 km it is a light hike and last 4,5 km are deadly :D but don't worry, because I'm not an experienced hiker and I did it with some breaks at pretty good time. It is worth going hiking even if you don't get to the top. Somewehere in the 1/3 of the road between Huiungak shelter and Socheongbong peak there is an oservation deck with the best view (I spent there 15 minutes while going up and another hour going down) so preserve until than. Enjoy hiking ;)"
Beautiful views,"I went with my children and elderly parents, therefore took the cable car and unfortunately, the staff packed in as many people as possible. Cable car ride is just a short 8minutes ride. I would have done a hike up if it was just me. Lovely views at the top once you exit the cable car plus you can also do another short hike up to a small peak where you can get lovely views of Sokcho. After taking the cable car down, we walked to a nearby river and the temple. Well worth the day trip."
Seoraksan ,"Is a temple surrounded by mountains, good atmosphere, convenient transportation, Is a place to ask for blessings, climbing or walking But there is a rule prohibiting animals from entering"
beautiful,some amazing walks and cable car to the top was an incredible view. A must see if you are in the area
Nature at its best,"What a wonderful place, took our dogs hiking. Weather was a bit overcast in the morning, but by mid day the sun was shining and it was time to find the beach."
"Gorgeous park, easy public transport from Seoul","Online ticket reservation using the Kobus website - it is indeed possible using a foreign credit card and doing your best to fill in the boxes.In relation to the mobile number requirement, I googled and found a suggestion to use something in this format010 1234 5678And it worked. I took note of the number but the counter clerk only asked for my credit card. The online system reserves your ticket and seat but you still need to have it issued at the counter.Clean and spacious bus with good seats. It took about 3 hours to get to Sokcho's Express Bus Terminal.If you arrive at the Sokcho Express Bus Terminal, you need to cross the road and take either bus 7 or 7-1 to the park. These are local buses, so there is no luggage space and you just need to lug your bag up. Cost is 1400 KRW and I had exact change. Stop names are announced, including in English. The last stop was at Kensington Stars Hotel/car park of the Seoraksan National Park. You can walk through the car park to the hotel.The hotel is sort of colonial in style and has various Halls of Fame - different floors for actors, singers, movie stars, ambassadors...and the Abbey Road bistro on the top floor is a museum and treasure trove of Beatles memorabilia - photos, platinum records, a suit belonging to John Lennon, a guitar signed by all 4 Beatles ...The location of the hotel can't be beat as it is literally 500m from the entrance to Mount Sorak National Park. At the car park entrance to the hotel is a 7 Eleven which has some basic foodstuffs but obviously a limited selection. I believe there is a microwave for heating up the ready-to-eat meals.Two easier walking courses in Seoraksan that I did were Bisongae Rock and Biryong Falls. Do note that this simply means that the beginning portions are relatively level and non-pebbley but that the last few hundred metres involve bouldery rock bits to step/ climb over which require shoes with good grip and a good attention span to guard against slipping. The bouldery bits generally involve some sort of upward climb. Not undo-able but best to be prepared for it and be clear what one's limits are.The cable car - it stops running when the winds are strong but I got lucky and it started up on my last day. Good views from the top!It's probably the beginning of the peak season now and the park wasn't crowded so it was perfect! "
Beautiful park,", but I've found to many garbage on the path, please keep your garbage with you, nature don't need that!"
The waterfall hiking trail was AMAZING ,Don’t forget the waterfall hiking trail. We couldn’t believe that we hadn’t seen a single person on the trails and IT was BEAUTIFUL!
Beautiful Cherry Blossom,"We don't expect there will be cherry blossom blooming here, since all the prediction it will come around 9 April, we go there at 4 April and a stunning cherry blossom has arrived early, even all korean people we met very surprise, we even stop at the road to take a picture of the cherry blossoms. memorable time we can't take the cable car since it closed due the heavy wind."
beautiful scenery,One of the places we visited in our package to in korea. It has many beautiful scenery and good flowers and cherry blosooms. Took a lot of pictures.
Movie-worthy views,"My daughter and I visited Seoraksan as part of a month long trip around South Korea. We stayed in Sokcho-si for 3 nights and this proved to be an excellent choice as a local number 7 or 7-1 bus takes you into the gates of the National Park for 1250₩The park has multiple routes and trails you can follow of varying distances and heights to climb. There is a cable car to one of the peaks but we opted for a 3km climb (mostly steps but initially there are rocky paths to clamber up) to Towangseongpokpo. The MOST STUNNING views when I finally made it to the top! My daughter danced on ahead like it was no effort I’ve attached a few pictures - if you are visiting South Korea and are able to squeeze in a day trip to Seoraksan, I promise it will be worth it!"
Great place to spend a day or exploring waterfalls and views.,In the park you can take a walk to see 3 waterfalls with great views and nice scenery.There is also a cable car which is a bit expensive (10000 won) but it is a one off opportunity to see a great view.There is a short walk from the top of the cable car for views.There are 2 other main walks .One taking around 2 hours and the other around 4 hours.Small entrance fee and parking fee into the park also.
Comment on difficulty of hike,"Very nice park, as everyone else has said. I just want to add that I did the ""4 hour"" hike to Ulsanbawi Rock, which is the most difficult hike in that part of the park. I am a 65 year old man, in decent, but not great, shape. The walk was strenuous, especially the last 0.6 km. Uphill on steps or a rock path. By the time I reached the top, I was quite pooped. But glad I did it. For someone younger in good shape it shoud not be that hard. For someone older or in poor shape, it will be a challenge. Also, I did it in April, so it wasn't very hot."
I love this place (April 2018),"A great place to see a different side of Seoul. It is about a 3 hours busride away! For people who can't walk well it is still a great place to go as you do not need to hike up, due to cable cars. There are also diffenr routes you can take around the park. Which have different levels.From the cable car it is another 10 minutes max hike up to the top!"
Breathtaking !,"Wow! What a nice park. We spent the day at the park, went up to the rocks and took the cable car. The views are amazing. Access from Sokcho is by bus 7-1 and takes about 50 minutes. Definitely worth seeing."
Seoraksan National Park,Seoraksan impressed me with its amazing Mountain View’s. One of the best places to visit in South Korea.
Beautiful autumn colours of the trees,"Upkeep of the place was well maintained. Though it was chilly (1degreeC), we enjoyed walking through and browsing around the different sections of the park, stopping now and then to take photos or buy some snacks. What brought out the ""oohs"" and ""wows"" were the glorious and beautiful autumn leaves of the trees! Different and various hues of yellow, orange, red, rust and brown.....so picturesque, what a lovely sight!"
Entrance staff very rude. Maybe they cant communicate well. Park is great,"Need spend more times here as we have 2 great days here. One day for waterfall, one day for cable car up. "
Enjoy One Day Trip,"This place is awesome. Beautiful view and variety of choices of hiking routine. Too bad I have insufficient time, otherwise will be visiting at least 4 days to explore more. Will definitely come back."
Feel the nature and deeper background of Korean Buddhism. ,"You may feel the sea bed of Buddhism of Korea by LG(Licensed Guide of GPS Travel) who have insights of history , thoughts , ideologies , and philosophies. We are good enough to give you presentation in the very common and easy words. That’s why we are the best . "
Good to see,"One of the famous attraction in South Korea. The scenery is beautiful, has some ancient Korea building around. It is very quiet and comfortable walking the trail."
The famous Seoraksan,"I think a must to visit Seoraksan National Park because it is one of Korea's famous tourist spot. Here you can enjoy the beauty of mountain with cable car (8,000 won) to go to the peak. If you are budget traveler, just take intercity bus to seokcho for 13,000 won and then take intercity bus directly to the mountain... to achiave the peak they serve a better route for amateur for 2 hours walking... so enjoy your trip"
Beautiful ,I had a great time here and enjoyed the view. I didn’t mind the long steps to get to the peak. It was well worth it. 
Beautiful National Park,"I spent two days exploring the national park. I did several trails and enjoyed them all.The most popular one is the one up to Ulsanbawi Rock. Lots of Koreans were hiking up there. I didn’t get all the way because my legs were tired though. There are numerous temples along the way. Gyejoam is well worth visiting. They also had wifi there. The route to the waterfalls is less busy. The waterfalls weren’t overly impressive when I visited in November but the hike was nice. You can go further to an observation deck, but this involves climbing 850+ stairs. The view from the top is stunning.The trail to Biseondae Rock is the easiest. For most of the way it is a road. It does run beside a river and the scenery the whole way is spectacular. Most people stop at the rock but if you are really adventurous, you can continue to Geumganggul Cave. I only saw two other people doing that and they didn’t go all the way to the cave. This is the steepest route in the park, but it’s worthwhile when you reach the top.There is also a cable car that will take you to a viewpoint. Toilets are on all the routes. There are also cheap restaurants at the base as well. The coffee roasters is great at the end of a cold day. Overall, I had a memorable time hiking through Seoraksan National Park and highly recommend it."
Stunning Maple Colours in Autumn,"Stunning maple colours in autumn, would recommend at least two days here to fully appreciate the vast park and hiking trails. We took the cable on the first day and did a short hike to the fortress. Next day we took a more demanding hike to Ulsan-bawi - they were a lot of stairs but definitely manageable for anyone with a reasonable level of fitness. Just take your time and slowly enjoy the sights - no rush in this tranquil place. Love how there was no litter in the park - South Koreans are really respectful to their national parks in this regard.Visited 22nd and 23rd October 2018 - stayed two nights overnight at the nearby Kensington Stars Hotel."
Great place,"Seoraksan is very famous in korea... while we went there, only local korean visitors no one foreigner/ western... the place is good but far from seoul... the weather while cold is very cold... we can use cable car... we also can praying in big Buddha here (there’s shop that can give you stick to pray or rice that can you use for praying)..."
Great National Park,"It is a great national park that travelers could select their appropriate route of hiking trail. However, the writer did only travel the temple, Sinheungsa, owing to the schedule and weather considerations."
Beautiful Seoraksan,Beautiful place of flora and fauna to spend a few hours. It's a good trek up the summit so be sure you wear the right shoes. The park hosts Buddhist temples Baekdamsa and Sinheungsa. The tea house run by the monks is a nice place to take a break.
many adventures + hidden jjimjilbang + decent chow + big buddha!,"Very much worth the 3 hour trip from Seoul. Get there early on weekends for decent parking though they do a great job double and triple parking cars. Trouble is there's a huge jam outside. Big to-dos: eat at any of the various restaurants in the main ""village."" reminiscent of US national parks with their concessions built close to the main attractions seoraksan has around 15 restaurants that serve everything from korean tradition to burgers. lotsa makgeolli too natch. take the tram to the top of one of the nearby peaks for a quick hike up to the top. great pics. gotta love the pines clinging to the jagged summits like a fairytale asian postcard. the buddhist village from the 1600s to 1700s is whimsical mystical and operational. monks eat together study together and maybe train together (though we didnt see that unfortunately) in the made-for-hollywood temple courtyard. you can imagine them practicing kung fu there, if they do that. really neat place. and of course there's the gigantic buddha just outside. up a 10-11 percent grade through a separate entrance to the park there's a mini oncheon and a great restaurant. it's called pillye germanium hot spring and its got an outdoor pool. the water is green. very pretty spot. the restaurant serves traditional korean but it's chopped up cooked up fresh right in front of you in a wooden mountain cabin with a wood stove cozying up the place. sweet spot.great hike up to a waterfall that must look great in spring. the hike starts in the main concession valley and goes a couple of miles straight up a river thanks to steel stairs the park's built into the side of the canyon. very pretty up top but strenuous fo sho."
Breathtaking & Beautiful,"We came over 2 days at the end of October, where the autumn season is still in bloom. We attempted a few trails over the 2 days. The easiest is the Biseondae trail, where the path is pretty flat and wide for the most part. It's essentially a forest trail. The second easiest, in my opinion, is the trail to the Gwongeumseong Fortress, which is accessible via cable car. The cable car is the fun part, but from there, is a roughly 10minute climb of steps and stairs to reach the 'peak'. Consider walking the Biryong falls trail if you enjoy a forest bathing experience followed by stair climbing for the remaining 1/3 journey to reach the Yukdam falls and Biryong falls. The last 400m stretch to Biryong falls is the most tiring. Finally, conquer the Hyundeubawi trail which is an uphill climb up slopes and stone paved tracks for the most part. But the autumn scenery here is the best among all the trails.Finally, if you are really fit, then you can attempt the final 1km from the Hyundeubawi Rock to the Ulsanbawi Rocks. This part of the trail is rated Advanced, so be prepared for some tough climbing.Seoraksan National Park is nature's gift and a must-visit"
Beautiful Scenery All Around,"Our tour itinerary included visiting this beautiful Seoraksan National Park, also known as Mount Seorak. Autumn here is so beautiful. We also took the cable car up to the only station. Then walked up the trail to the peak. It was very tiring but the fresh air and wonderful view was worth the effort. Remember to bring along your Walking Poles the next time you come. Saw many people, especially the locals, who went hiking around the many hiking trails. Great place to visit."
Magical!,"The beauty of nature is just breathtaking! I would recommend to go there in October, really worth visiting."
A Magnificent National Park; Go in Autumn,"South Korea is proud of its national parks and Seoraksan is emblematic. Featuring magnificent landscape, including streams, falls, forests, temples and animals, Seoraksan, the beauty of Seoraksan was amplified by the fall colors, enough so to make we want to return each October. A moderately challenging trail parallels a downstream river leading to a small waterfall, nestled in the forest. The tram ride to a high point offers nice views of the valley to the coast but we found it over-rated and dispensible; better to be in the park than above it.The park is popular; expect crowds."
"Beautiful fall color, a bit too crowded ","It’s very beautiful park, especially in autumn. A lot of hiking trails which are well managed and clean. Avoid weekend if possible, it’s very crowded. "
Slightly disappointed for autumn,"Went for autumn viewing but was too late and all the leaves have mostly withered. Supposed the mountain should be very beautiful in full bloom. Summer should be very scenic with water flowing, green leaves and beautiful sky. Took the cable car to the observatory tower and hike all the way up to the peak. Not a difficult route , can attempt even when you are not equipped with hiking stuffs. Cable car is by timing. Pretty organised but should also have English speaking guide so that foreigners know when to start queuing for the cable car. "
Easy trekking available,"Upon persuasion by a Korean friend, my sister and I decided to try walking the easiest trails at outer Sorak. We did our walks on 24 & 25 Oct when the autumn foliage was pretty nice. We did Biryeong Falls on our first trek and Bisondae Rocks the next day. Most delighted to find that both trails were easy and did not require serious hiking gear. On the way to Bisondae Rocks, we passed Sinheungsa Temple and the magnificent Buddha. Also popped in to the specialty coffee shop near the temple to use their clean toilet and enjoy their lovely decor. To ensure we start our walk without huge crowds, we decided to stay at the Kensington Stars Hotel, just 5 minutes away from the Park entrance. Started our walk before 8.30am and only met massive crowds of people on the trail during our return trek. Based on our experience, we would stay 2 nights in future - arriving in middle to late afternoon to avoid the traffic jam on the road to the hotel which is also the same road to the Park. This way, we would have 2 clear mornings to start our walks early before the crowds arrive. Of course, we will stay on weekdays to avoid weekenders from Seoul. Best time to leave for Seoul would be immediately after lunch so we can avoid the evening rush hour."
Cold but Scenic Mountain View,"Once again, in Korea where things are really Cold, nearly Winter, but not quite yet winter. The scene was beautiful with natural and artificial 'decoration'. I'm sure Spring would be just as nice."
Not what I hope for,I went there on Nov 1st and I must say that it's not really fun up there. I chose the cable car route (because my friends are too tired to do the tracking). I have to say it's boring and the trees are already losing it's leaves so it's pretty ordinary and barren for me. Nothing special. I think it's better if you choose other route like tracking to the waterfall if you're fit enough and skip the cable car route. Or just go to the Sinheungsa temple and enjoy the scenery rather than wasting 10.000 won for the cable car
Worth the Visit,"We booked trough an agency because this pace if quite far from the city. October is the best time to visit, autumn season, the trees are beautiful, the weather is really cold. Though lots of people and limited time was given to us, we did not really have time to visit the restaurants and eat, it was worth it. I will definitely going back to Mt. Seorak."
Hello autumn,"The best time to visit seoraksan mountain on october when autumn. The leafts many colors. But maybe you must prepare rain coat, cause maybe rainy at the time.The entry ticket 3500 won per one. And you can trekking or by cable car to the mountain. And for cable car fare 10.000 waon for roundtrip. IG@tripout.id"
Highlight of Korea.,"My Korean wife took me here. I'm a Kiwi and love the outdoors. This place would rival anywhere in NZ. The scenery was breath taking. The autum leaves were so varied and colorful. The cable car was not working due to the wind but we hiked up past the water falls to around 500 meters for an amazing view. Not so many people there either. So peaceful, beautiful and a great day out in nature. "
Beautiful and relaxing scenery.,Best to go here in Autumn during the color transition of the trees/leaves. Uphill climb thus wear comfortable clothes. The mountain scenery is so beautiful. You can enjoy the stillness of nature and capture its beauty in your cameras. A lot of restaurants also if you get hungry. With cable car if you want to see the top of the mountain but you have to brave the long line for 1-2 hours if you get lucky.
Hikes for all ages but can be crowded,"There are a number of trails here for all levels, from extremely flat and paved terrain to more advanced ones. You can also see a lot here: waterfalls, caves, and peaks. During the peak season in the autumn though, it gets very crowded, and it is NOT advisable to bring a car all the way to the park unless you want to spend hours on the road to Seoraksan. Go on a weekday if you can, or stay in a hotel near the park entrance if you really need to go on weekends during peak season (autumn). You can also go really early -- the crowd starts coming in around 10am or so. The traffic was also better on Sunday, since most people prefer to come from Seoul on Saturdays.I found the place a bit too touristy though. In some ways, it's good (toilets along the Ulsanbawi trail are really convenient) but for some who prefer wilder trails, it may not be the best. Personally, I prefer Hallasan to Seoraksan, but then the two are like apples and oranges. It all boils down to personal preference."
The most popular mountain park in Korea,"This is the most beloved mountain park for Koreans.I also recommend visiting here to foreign travelers visiting Korea for longer than two weeks. The true mountain climbing requires at least one night at the shelter(reservation is essential).- How to access:1) From Sokcho(Sogongwon Main): #7 and #7-1 Bus from Sokcho to Sogongwon Entrance. The first bus is before 6 am. 2) From Inje(Baekdam Village): There's a bus from Inje Bus Terminal to Baekdam Village. And from the visitor center, there's a shuttle to Baekdamsa Temple.3) From Yangyang(Osaek Mineral Water Area): There's a bus from Yangyang intercity bus terminal.- Sogongwon Course:This is the most popular and crowded access to the mountain. Very crowded. Many shops and restaurants. There are four different routes.First, Towangseong Course is to see three amazing waterfalls. Seniors and young kids can reach until the second falls. Towangseong Falls at the end is tough to reach with many steep steps. But, it's magnificent. 3 hours course.Second, Gwongeumseong Course is reachable by cable cars. The easiest. And it has an amazing view.Third, Biseondae Observatory and Geumganggul Cave Course. Very easy trail until Biseondae. 90 min until coming back. After Biseondae, it's a real hiking from here with above average level. Mountain shoes are necessary just in case. Healthy visitors might be able to come back seeing Gemganggul Cave within 3 hours. There are shelters in this route and it's available to finish at other entrance.The last, Heundeulbawi Rock and Ulsanbawi Rock. 2 hours. It's okay level for healthy ones. Ulsanbawi has a wonderful view.- Baekdam Course:There are MANY restaurants and lodges in Baekdam Village. This is a route to see mountain climbing or to have an easy walking in the valley. Very crowded in the morning. There are pebble towers, pure water, temples, fall foliages, etc. Baekdamsa is really beautiful temple and temple stay is available. The trail to Suryeomdong Shelter.is very beautiful and accessing to the stream is allowed. If any family wish to see fall foliage, I recommend this route.- Osaek Course:Osaek Mineral Water Area is good to get refreshed. This route has the shortest course to Daecheongbong Peak, the highest peak in Seoraksan.- Comparing to the number of common tourists, there were much fewer mountain climbers. In the middle of mountain, it was hard to meet others.- It's not easy to see any animals but squirrels. Sometimes little lizards were found.- For the climbers:Seoraksan is not a smooth mountain. Trekking shoes are required. Many tracks aren't as tough as I anticipated. But, slopes and steps last very long. It's exhausting. Even if it's not a steep ground, it can be slippery with wet leaves and rocks. Take each step slowly and don't be ambitious to avoid fatigue.Dinosaur Ridge is a very popular track. There are several shelters nearby. And you need to rest enough before and after since it's quite tough.You MUST either come down or arrive at the shelter before it gets dark. The sun goes down very soon. And never try to sleep outside. It's risky and not permitted.You should reserve the shelter on the website in advance. It sells out early in popular season. It costs below 15,000 won mostly. You can buy things, cook and sleep. The one I stayed wasn't that comfortable. No drinking water. No shower. Old toilets.There aren't many signs while climbing. You may confront disconnected tracks of 3~10m on the route which can put you in distress heading wrong directions. You'll probably meet the restarting point if you move forward. Or you can go up a little bit to look down and come back."
Seoraksan,I highly recommend a visit to Mt Seorak especially during the autumn.Took the cable car and was blown away by the beautiful autumn foliage!! Long journey from Seoul but definitely an unforgettable trip. 
Good place but extraordinary,"Visited here with family on September 2018.We took cable car to the mountain but it turned out the distance was very short, less than 10minutes, so not very exciting.The rest room on the mountain was very very dirty :( After went down from the mountain, we just went to the river to take some pics.There is a big buddha statue in the park just like in Hongkong.For me the place was good but extraordinary."
Dream Park,"Any solo traveler, family and tourist group who love natural park in winter, don't miss this destination. It takes 20 minutes from Sokcho by bus. Many activities wait for visitors : hiking, trekking, taking cable car to the top of a snowy mountain, walking to see snowy ground & trees or doing merit at a temple. Tasting Korean lunch in the park food court is a must."
Autumn folk in seoraksan,"We came here on the first day of Chuseok holiday. Suprisingly, it was more crowded than our imagination. Anyway, the cable car is really worthy attraction (although you need to come early to get the ticket. We came at 10 am and the earliest ticket that avainle is the 12.30 cable car)"
Breathtaking view,We came on the first day of Chuseok holiday because we thought that there wouldn’t be a lot of people on the day but we were wrong. There were a lot of people and the bus we took was trapped 2 km before the main gate so it was better for us to get off and walking to the main gate. We arrived around 10 o’clock to buy the cable car’s tickets but the line was already crowded. The fastest car we could take was 12:30 and they said that it was 4 times more crowded on autumn foliage. But I must say that it was worth it!! The view was really wonderful from the top. You can see the mountains and East Sea from above!!
Hikers' playground,"No wonder Seoraksan has a reputation of one of the most beautiful and popular national parks in South Korea. The nearest seaside town Sokcho (2.5 hour by bus from Seoul, then 35 mins by bus to the NP) is friendly and relaxing, and Seoraksan NP has almost everything for everyone. The ground area by the river is pleasant with a nice outdoor Buddha statute and a small temple, visitors can take a short cable car ride to enjoy the scenery, then walk 20 mins to the wonderful Gwongeunseng Fortress Wall. In addition to the must do Ulsanbawi trek (4 hour return), there are many other treks from 2 to 4 hours to choose from. I recommend Biryong Falls (i.e. flying dragon) then continue up to the Observatory to view the Towangseong Falls & amazing surroundings. The 1.7km trek to Biryong Falls is nice and easy; but the last 0.4km up the Observatory requires climbing 900 steep steps! It's almost as demanding as the Ulsanbawi trek! That said, the view is equally rewarding. "
Most beautiful view in Korea,"I have to admire that I was extremely lucky enough at that day. When we took the cable car from the park 10,000 kwon for adults and 6,000 kwon for children, the weather was foggy on the top of 700 m suddenly clouds started to disappear and mountains tops started to appear and shine. The view was glorious and stunning. Temperature was around 18 C.. everything was perfect except the timing. They told us it’s 6:00 pm and cable car will be closed. We had to leave the place. Please enjoy the photos as I cannot say more."
Like a miramar map on PUBG!,"just kidding, It’s a lil bit rocky hills and easy to hike. But don’t get fooled, once you got to the peak you'll see why It’s a five-star destination."
Soraksan total tranquility.,"We were here about 35yrs ago and the park has really changed with made pathways, bridges and lots of places to eat and rest. There is also a cable car to take you to the top to get a spectacular view of the surrounding area."
Breathtaking!,"It is certainly an amazing and breathtaking place to be. The view of the mountain as you arrive is already enough to make you be in awe.Admission fee is 3,000KRW for adults.I had initially wanted to take the 7hour climb to the highest peak. However my legs have not recovered from climbing Bukhansan two days ago. I had to cheat. Took the cable car (10,000KRW). The view on both sides as you ascend is awesome. At the back of the station are steps to take you to one of the lower peak. There are proper steps made and a short path of stones. A short climb. The view is ... WOW! The view of a valley is.. amazing. I have attached pics i took with my phone. Most of my pics are with a proper camera.Directions from Seoul:1. Bus to Sokcho from Express Bus Terminal (approx 3 hours).2. Cross the road and find a bus-stop on the right side.3. Take either bus 7 or 7-1 to Seoraksan National Park.The peak is covered in mist if you arrive very early. It will clear up around 9.00am. That will be a better time to take the cable car."
We will be back to Seorak!,"This place was absolutely beautiful. There was something for everyone; sightseeing, hiking, eating and shopping. We spent the whole day hiking trails and enjoying the outdoors. We did take the gondola ride to the top as well for some beautiful views of the surrounding area. I would recommend doing that first as the lines will only get longer as the time gets later. The views at Seoraksan left me speechless, so I will let the pictures do the talking!Enjoy!"
Stunning,"Very user friendly Park esp for western (English speaking) visitors. All signs also in English, maps available in English. Naver map system gets you here easily if you are driving. Parking looks difficult if you get here past 10am though. We stayed at the Kensington and walked in and saw lines of cars daily. Entrance fee is 3,500KW per day and the hikes are very well marked and traveled. We only did outer Seoraksan trails and it was crowded but pleasant on a September weekend. Everyone appreciated our limited Hangul. Many hiking clubs trekking about. Plenty of food / snacks and trinkets for sale. The gondola is a must. Ulsanbowi a must. Waterfalls a little anticlimactic. "
Great National Park,"Seoraksan was phenomenal- we will be back to see it in more seasons for sure. The park is easily on par with the great Western parks in the U.S. as far as vistas are concerned. The trails were well maintained, and everything was clean and tidy. Recommend you fully research what trails you intend to take however - we had our two young boys, and a “moderate hike” quickly turned into a mini-rock climbing adventure for them. (Proper shoes definitely help in that regard.) All in all the whole area is fantastic - we will be back. "
Have been many times.,"I have been to Seoraksan several times since arriving in Korea close to five years ago, and it is one of my favorite National Parks in the Country. Typically, as with most people, I will hike to the ""rock,"" Ulsanbawi, which is about two hours round trip, before going to the waterfall. However, on my first trip, I went to the peak, which is 13~14 hours round trip. Make sure you bring lots of water and take care of your feet!"
Heads up: locker storage not available until 9:30am,"We had read that the park offers locker storage, which is true, but the lockers are indoors at the visitor info center (inside the park gate) and that office does not open until 0930. We had already checked out of our hotel room and arrived there at 0630. The lockers are NOT accessible from the outside and they would not make exceptions for us unfortunately. We had to walk back to a hotel and coordinate luggage storage with them, which worked out fine but delayed us over an hour as we were trying to beat the heat and get an early start hiking.Other than that, this park is absolutely gorgeous and a must-see. We hiked Ulsanbawi Rock which was very challenging due to all the steep stairs but so worth it. Took about 4 hours up and back down.The park admission does not accept credit cards but cafes inside do."
worth trip,"i was there during the autumn season. even its located quite far from seoul, there was so many tourists. when the leaves turn colour, it was a perfect place to take photo. for muslim, they also provide cable car to get to the middle of the peak then need to hike around 30 minutes to the peak. it was a worth trip."
Nice park,Its 2 to 2 1/2 hours to Seoraksan from Seoul. It was raining and foggy. We took the cable and the visibility was poor. Its the popular thing to do and cost $10. It has several paved trails. There are also restaurants in the park. 
Good Hiking Trails,I visited this park as part of a tour group during our 4-day Eastern Korea tour. We hiked the 3.2 Km trail from Yongso Falls to Yaksuteo. It was downhill most of the way and was a scenic hike. Quite a bit of the trail consisted of wooden planks covered with rubber padding. There is a Buddhist temple along this trail.Parts of the trail have shade but parts were directly in the sun and a hat and sunglasses are recommended. A bottle of water would be helpful during the hike.
The best park in Korea,"No trip to Korea is complete without a visit to Seoraksan National Park which has many hiking trails, temples, a cable car and a few places to eat. Most people would choose the hike to see Ulsanbawi Rock but on the way you will hike through a thick forest, pass three temples and see the Heundeulbawi Rock, a round rock finally balanced on a small rocky mound. The trail is hard going as it ascends most of the way with hundreds of steps but well worth doing. It will take about 3-4 hours, allowing for rests and photo stops."
Loved our hike to the temple!,"Cable car ride and hike up to the temple were the highlights of our family's trip here. It was a tough hike, but we made it and it was worth it. Great views!Clean and many helpful park workers."
quite beautiful place in korea,"although i listened this place quite long time ago but it was quite beautiful which exceed my expectation. i visit here at quite early morning & reached Gwongeumseong Fortress, Biryong Falls & Sinheungsa Temple. that was quite enjoyable. love it"
Great National Park,"A beautiful and large National Park and a must visit in the Sokcho area. There is plenty of nice landscaping and lots of space to roam. There is also an area with plenty of restaurants and shops to grab a bite to eat or a souvenir. Depending on how much time and stamina one has there are various sites to visit. We took the cable car up the mountain. The cable car is very busy, we went on a weekday and had to wait 25 minutes. Going up is a nice ride with great views. Up on the mountain I expected it to be much colder but the temperature and weather was very pleasant. From the arrival area one can hike up to the mountain from where the views are simple amazing. After coming back down with the cable car we went to the temple and enjoyed a nice stroll."
One of the top places to visit in Sokcho,"This park is so large that going around the different trails and mountain paths will already take at least a day. Our group though only visited Mt Seorak, some of the surrounding park amenities and the giant Buddha. I'm a great fan of serene and peaceful places and if I could stay here I would. Just the view of the mountains whether from the ground or from the peak gives one a sense of awe at how wonderful our world is. Going up via cable car is the fast route up the mountain, but if backpacking and trails are your thing.I suggest you devote at least a day to visit this park. I guarantee that you'll love it.We also got to experience one of the Buddhist monks doing one of the daily prayers (I think it was for the unity of South and North Korea). Also a nice experience if you haven't experienced Buddhist monks during their daily prayers."
One of the most beautiful places on earth!,Seoraksan is one of the cleanest and best maintained parks I have visited. There are numerous trails offering a wide variety of levels of difficulty. Many trails are perfectly smooth to accommodate baby carriages and wheelchairs. Some trails are more challenging and appeal to the physically fit hiker or climber. There is a tram ride which will take you to the rim of the canyon with stairs and trails for more adventuresome views of the valley below. The giant Buddha is magnificent.
Wrong day,"With it’s highest point 1,708 m above ground Seoraksan is one of the beautiful mountain in South Korea. Stopped by Shinheungsa temple inside Seorksan National park. Beautiful temple with lovely architecture. Surroundings wasn’t visible clearly due to bad weather. Seated bronze Buddha statue known as Jwabul is well over 10m in height. Boarded seorak cable car at the foot of mountain for a 5 min ride to the top. Cable cars leave every 5 – 7 minutes. It was a rainy day views of the park was not that great through the cable car windows.After getting off, slippery floor and rain stopped me taking the 10 min hike up to the peak – Gwogeumseong Fortress. My husband did. Wasn’t clear day to get a birds eye view. I didn’t miss much. Should have being a picturesque place, but we were there on the wrong day."
They magically peaceful place.,Seroksan mountain is a wonderful place to visit with family and friends. Cool Mountain Water is pulled in many areas as you ascend the mountain. Places where you can take a dip cool off and have some refreshments. It makes for a wonderful summer day trip. Fun for the whole family.
Picturesque at the top,"Another one of our itinerary for our tour of South Korea. We took the cable car up to the top and the journey was breath-taking. At the top, I felt like singing “I’m on the top of the world looking...”. The view was majestic with many different mountain peaks right in front of view. Definitely a must see in South Korea."
Bliss and Adventure,"I spent the past two days visiting this park. Unfortunately, the past two days were cold and rainy days. However, that probably was The reason there were not huge crowds at the park as I had anticipated. I got there early both days which I highly recommend.The first day I went was a Sunday And I climbed up to see the two rocks. There is a map that rates the trails and it is a good guide so you can know what to expect. The hike up to Heindeul and Ulsan rocks was an advanced level and I found the hike to be difficult due to the many many steps needed to climb. The next day I did the cave hike, the end of which was expert level. There was almost nobody else there due to the rain. Towards the end I had to force myself on but felt great when I finally arrived, only to discover the cave was more an alcove with religious statues. I am sure if the day had not been so cloudy I would’ve had a fantastic view from up there. Another hike I did that day was on a trail marked as a meditation trail. It was an easy walk on a forest trail that I absolutely loved - I did not run across a single person on that trail.The third hike I did was the one along the river trail which brought me to see three waterfalls. All in all I had a marvelous time there in spite of the rain. I had a better time the second day because I Put plastic booties over my shoes so I didn’t have wet feet. That made a big difference. I had lunch there one day and paid $15 for a potato pancake. It was expensive but tasted good."
A place of serenity,"Calm, gentle breeze, beautiful nature and geological forms. I can almost spend myself a day in this place, especially next to the river. There is also a cable car to the top. During windy days the cable car will stop the operation. But you can wait a few minutes to see if they open again or not. You can also trek to the peak. There is also a temple there with a fountain. My guide told me the water is so clear that it is good for our health. Take a sip with the wooden spoon. But if you don't feel comfortable, you can use your hands too. I went to this place during spring, so nice to see the cherry blossoms carried by the winds. The weather was also perfect, not to cold but not too hot too."
Climbing the mountain takes guts,"The weather was perfect, but the trek was not easy. Reaching the peak was an achievement, but I was getting jittery when going down. The wind is so strong at the peak but we were rewarded with a great sense of achievement, arguments and a wonderful memory of Sokcho. "
Beautiful nature and serene Buddhism,"We were blown away by this amazing place. Natural unspoilt beauty in abundance with so much to see and lots to discover, plenty of hiking trails too.We spent 3 hours here but wished that we had had more time and we were really lucky to have fantastic sunny weather.Since we had limited time here we decided to take the cable car ride, which I think is a must, it is also very reasonable as we paid around £7 (10,000 won) each for a round trip, however if the weather is very bad/windy the cable car does not operate.As you ascend in the cable car, the scenery is just breathtaking and you can see the giant Buddha from the Sinheungsa temple nestled below in the greenery. When you reach the top there are some viewing platforms and there is also a trail/stairs to reach the top of Gwongeumseong peak. We could hear ethereal Buddhist chants which made it all the more enchanting. It can get quite busy, but it's really worth going to the peak which is quite rugged and as thrilling as it is, care should be taken as you are very near the boundary of some steep mountain edges. There is also a little hidden temple down the side of the viewing platform called Aallack, it's a bit of a steep trail down with some stairs and rugged stones and can be quite stressful climbing back up but it's worth seeing and is very quiet and serene with not many tourists compared to the peak on our visit.Within three hours we managed to take the cable car, explore the peak, visit the Aallack temple and also the Sinheungsa temple complex with a walk by the lake, we were very satisfied with what we fitted into our time frame.Would definitely love to come back here and explore more, there is something for everyone!"
good place to spend a day,"this is a must see and there is an unbelievable hike if your up to it .good food , and drink there . put good shoes for hiking on"
Wonderous,"I loved this place. My brother and I was here during mid May. Me being a flower enthusiast was a little disappointed that we just missed the blossoms of spring. Further, the weather for us was cloudy and drizzly. However, I still went out and hiked amongst this beautiful landscape and I soon realised; different times, different experiences. Whilst I didn't see certain things, what I got was amazing. I saw seoraksan in a mistiful serene setting. Regarding the flowers, I saw the Korean maple, drops of water on it's pretty leaves with it's pretty pink seedling leaves.I'm sorry I suck at describing. It was very pretty suffice to say."
"Good hike, but the shelter staff in Huiungak was unfriendly!","I hiked to Jungcheong shelter for the sunrise the next day. It was a tough hike on certain sections, wonder how people made it down as coming down is harder on those rocks/boulders, need the ropes.I didnt make any reservation for the sleeping space in Jungcheong shelter as I wasnt planning hiking to the peak initially, but a friend I made along the trail encouraged me to make a hike to the peak. As I was passing through Huiungak Shelter, the shelter staff told me dont bother as the reservation for the bunks were full. He also told me this shelter that he manages is also full, and forbade me to even take a look. His discouraging attitude totally pissed people off. I managed to hike to Jungcheong Shelter and the friendly staff found me a bunk for the night. I was totally grateful to the staff at Jungcheong Shelter. They were the ones who helped foreign climbers and not chase them away.The instant rice and water they sold in the shelter were reasonably priced. The Korean climbers brought their own food for bbq. We didnt bring any so can only eat plain instant rice. Even if you bring your own instant noodles, they wont help you microwave it, they will only help microwave instant rice that they sell. They also rent blankets at reasonable price. The bunk room stink of urines in Jungcheong Shelter as the toilet fumes are blown into the sleeping place. The pungent smell refuse to go away all night. There is no water at this shelter, so you can only wash hands using your own bottled water.The sunrise view was amazing. We hiked down to another town Osaek after watching the sunrise, which was a shorterpath than the one we came up from. From there, we can walk to the bus stop and take a bus to Yangyang, before transfering to bus number 9 bound for Sokcho, the town where we came from."
30 years ago,3 of us 2 soldiers 1 katusa and my brand new humv ambulance went here for a weekend trip.still have the pictures .it was 1989 I was 21 .
Hiking,"Just amazing! Easy to follow trails of varying difficulty. Stunning, unspoilt scenery at every step. The monk chanting in the remote cave was the icing on the cake. "
Lovely tranquil area,"This National Park, a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve, is a lovely tranquil area - except by the cable car terminus, where there are hordes of tourists. We took the cable car up, 10K krw, and spent a short time hiking further up to get some great views of the surrounding area, all the way out to the sea. We also did the approximately 2 hour hike up to the pair of waterfalls. The first 2/3 of that hike is fairly level and easy while the remaining 1/3 is much harder with stairs and uphills, It was not heavily trafficed. The water flows down the mountainside at a fairly steep angle and generates a couple small waterfalls. There are a few signs in English - but not many. In the lower park area are a few food stalls/restaurants with limited and expensive dining options.."
A must visit site in South Korea,"This beautiful mountain range is one of the most attractive and visited places in South Korea. There are several peaks in the range and clear hiking tracks are available. The place is easily accessible by road however almost every weekend, public holidays and during fall there is long traffic to enter the park. There are several hotels and guest houses in and around the park. It’s recommended to visit the park early morning. "
Beautiful ,An absolute must do! The location is incredible ~ beautiful scenery with hiking for all levels. Makes for a great getaway! 
seoraksan hiking,"stayed at kensington stars hotel, which is just beside the park entrance. first day arrived at hotel around 4pm and hiked for 2 hr to biseondae and geun-gang-gul (cave). second day hiked for about 5hrs to heundeulbawi (rock), ulsanbawi (rock), bi-ryeong falls, Towangseong Falls Observatory. from sokcho express bus terminal, cross the road to take bus 7 or 7-1 to kensington stars hotel which is the last stop. about 20mins bus ride."
Peaceful even if there's too much tourist,"Morning or Afternoon stroll is recommendable around the area, it is quite huge so be sure to wear comfortable shoes. A trek to the peak is a must, you'll be meet with stunning view and a peaceful ambiance. I bet the scenery will be magnificent during winter, since we've been there during spring only few snow caps are on the peak."
Delightful ,"The early parts of this park area a delightYou get charged for parking, 4000 won, then there is another ticket desk for 2500 won each to enterWe went as far as the temple. A nice serene place that few tourists seemed to reachNice, large Buddha statue on the way there"
Lovely park but..,Don't plan big hikes in the dry season because they close off the major trails for fire risk. I was unaware of this and also affected Oedaesan National Park further south. As it was I made the most of one day filled up with some spectacular walking. The valley floor is littered with eateries and a bit Disney for my liking but this is an important park for Koreans and not all of them are capable of hiking into the hills. I will return another day and do the more serious stuff.
Great National Park - nice walks,This is a great place to visit. You decide what sort of walk you want to do - Easy to hard.It can be very cold here so make sure you have warm clothing. The gondola is great and so is the view from the top of Mt Seorak. On a sunny day with a little bit of snow about - gorgeous
Road trip,This is a must! The hike up to Ulsan Rock is tough in the last K but so worth it. Lovely area First section is easy. Pay for car park and entry but worth it. 
Picturesque,"It's my first-time experience the snow and snow lightly during my visit. so beautiful, went up to the hill using cable car, the view is amazing, just take my breath away. Lots of snow up there. After 10 mins hike went down to explore the park, there was a temple and big Buddha statue. The park also has a nice view, I almost didn't notice the hours I spend walking. Definitely will come back again someday in autumn"
Nice big park,"After we enter the national park, We took a cable car up to a hill. From there, we had a 10 mins hike. Beautiful scenery and wind. We explore the park after we took the cable car down. There are two Prayer places. As the trees has no leaf and no flower when we were there, the park was not as nice as we have seen 11 years back. Nevertheless, we enjoyed the walk. Spend at least half a day here. "
Beautiful!,We visited the park while there was a lot of snow around and in fact it snowed lightly during our visit.It is such a tranquil setting and a joy to walk around.
Very Special Place(s) Hike(s),"If you just have one day = Ulsanbawi hike. Recommend getting on trail before 0900 for smaller crowd to/on the top. Bringing 2 bottles of auga and a sack of snack should make it comfortable. Have a charged battery for tons of pics. If you have the option of going on different days, check the forecast for a better visibility day (after a rain is usually better). As always sunscreen and a hat. IF you have more time 2nd hike choice is Biryong Falls trail(as w/ most waterfall hikes time of year matters greatly for waterflow), 3rd is Geumganggul cave/Buddhist shrine (shallow cave). The cable cars are a nice option if youve got health issues impacting your ability to hike, but if your wheels and lungs are good = Take a Hike! :) "
Magnificent View,Perfect and great mountain view at Mount Seorak. You can take a cable car direct to the top of the mountain or use a jungle trail to reach the top with different mountain view..
must visit spot in South Korea,"there's a large Budha statue inside, and try to go up using cable car and walk upper outside.best view at winter. photo spot around.cafe and snack available."
Picturesque!!,"We went there on a private tour last 24th December. It was so cold that day and it was raining non-stop. When we went down from the car, the mountain greeted us and it was a magnificent sight. Cable car ride was nice and short. It was much better when you get to the top, especially for most of us who were experiencing our first snow fall! You can also get hot coffee and ice cream at the top!"
Wonderful & Magnificient views!,Went there in Fall & the color of the mountain was wonderful. There are museums which kept a lot of things from Old Korea.
Bad weather,"It was too windy and ticket for cable car was suspended. It is really frustrating to see other people able to change their ticket and able to take the ride. That was ridiculous and make no sense. Counter staff asks us to wait, which we did till 4 pm and walked away. We know it was a great view but unfortunately circumstances did not help us."
Beautiful Autumn Leaves,"Visited Seoraksan with friends in End October and amazed by the colorful autumn leaves. If time allowed, we would trek along the path all the way to the peak, but instead we took the cable car. "
One of Korea´s top sghts especially in fall,"We planned our tour to South Korea to see the coloured leaves in fall. That is the season to go there. We were not the only ones. Bus loads of Koreans had the same idea, all dressed in expensive and professional outdoor equipment. We thought all intended for expeditions in the Himalayas. Trekking in that park is very popular, and a visit is worth the detour. "
Famous Bear Statue,"The landscape was beautiful in early december, since it’s almost winter time. I took a bit long walk from the drop off to the famous bear statue. Then, me and my friends took a cable car that can carry around 50 people in one time. We continue to walk on the provided stairs until we reach the top of the mountain. The view was breathtaking, but you have to find a spot or share spot with others to take a photograph. Along the way back and the cable car station, there’re some cafes and restaurants. But if you don’t have enough time, there’re some coffee vending machine that cost you around 50 - 100 won."
Blown Away,"We signed up a day tour with Ktourstory (booked through Funtastic Korea) to Mount Seorak and Naksansa Temple. Finding the bus at Myeondong Station was a little chaotic as there were tons of different tour groups and the guides were not well differentiated. Nevertheless, our guide Finn was friendly and approachable and the rest of the day went on smoothly.After a short toilet break in Hongcheon, we moved on to Seoraksan National Park. Arrived at 11am and was told to board the bus again at 3pm. 4 hours, great!We visited on a cold day, -11°C with winds of 5.6m/s. Finn told us to hurry, as the cable car may close if the winds get any stronger. But we made it!The views at Gwongeumseong Fortress were spectacular! After many selfies, we walked (about 10min) up the stairway to Bonghwadae where we were almost blown away (literally, by the wind). As there are no safety railings, and we were with young children, we did not get too adventurous and stayed near the stairway.After 1.5hr at Gwongeumseong Fortress, we explored Biseondae Rocks (2hr round trip). I would imagine Biseondae Rocks to be breathtakingly beautiful in autumn. In December (early winter), we could still see traces of the red leaves, though most trees were bare. It was still a nice walk, as it was not as crowded and did not have the ""touristy"" feel of the cable car. The trail was mostly flat, with a short upslope (rocky) path at the end. Pretty manageable even for kids.There was not much time for a sit-down lunch after the walk. We grabbed a few burgers at Lotteria instead.A lovely day trip. Perhaps next time, I would plan to stay in Sokcho, so that I have more time to explore the lovely park."
Awesome,The view on top of the mountain is out of this world. A bit windy on top but worth walking up. The whole park is so clean and so peaceful. One of my most favorite places to have seen. Definitely a place to see.
First visit from LA,Great park to visit. We came here on off season which was great. Must do the cable ride to get up to the mountain. Huge Buddha in front of the temple. Beautiful time to visit would be in the fall for the vibrant colors of the trees.
Beautiful park,This park is beautiful. Many well marked trails from both short and longer distances. Bus very convenient (7-1 from Sokcho- last stop). The bus accepted T Money as well as Cashbee cards so you won’t need change if you have these cards. Payment for park entry 3500W is cash only. Stop in the visitor centre on arrival to get a trail map. 
amazing nature there,"The park is awesome with yellow and red leaves. It is highly recommended to make your efforts to the mountain trails which are quite easy to access. The way to the peak is beautiful, really beautiful i meant if you go in autumn. We went with the tour organized by kkkday and it was so smooth. It takes 3 hours from seoul to the park. While you can go there by public transport but it might be very hassle for bus changing. Take a local tour and it gets you right at the entrance, lunch box and tour guide is provided. The tour also includes tickets to cable car. Please note there are many spots in the park that you may choose which to go. Some guests prefer staying near the park the day before so that they can walk early in the morning. But for us a day trip in this park is totally fine. Great experience ever here! "
A popular park among the locals,"Pros: Beautiful woods, gorgeous autumnal colors, a variety of hikes available, entrance close to Sokcho, well-maintained trails, nice views, and interesting statues, etc. at the entrance.Cons: Too crowded (but it was peak season for viewing the autumnal colors); guy at admissions told us the senior rates were just for the Koreans though everywhere else in Korea when we asked we were given senior rates (and there was no remark on the signs at the Park Entrance of the senior rates being applicable only to the locals); charge for parking,The pros easily outweigh the cons so don't miss Seoraksan National Park if you like to hike or take a walk."
Spring Korea,Love this place so much ...A place with beautiful scenery ... lots of good photo spots there ... for Buddhist there is a big and happy Buddha statue with a temperature range of 6 sd. 10 ° C in spring ...Should use light coat and simple shoes...
Nature is amazing,"Nature is truly amazing. Visited the Seoraksan and hiked up to the Ulsan Peak -- took about 4 hours in total to hike up and down; during which you will also pass by the Sinheungsa temple and Ulsanbawi Rock. The route is not an easy hike as there're lots of stairs and rocky paths to climb up and down, but it is really worth it as you'll get rewarded with the magnificent view after reaching the peak.Getting to Seoraksan: Bus 7 or 7-1 from Sokcho Intercity/Express Bus Terminal"
The best Autumn feels,"It was worth it going up and riding the cable car. Love the autumn colored leaves around. although it was a bit crowded when we where there, it was still the best place to visit in Korea."
Amazing place,Seoraksan national park is an amazing landscape with good trekking possibilities. The signalisation is perfect you can lose your way in this park. The best place to stay is in Sokcho just 20 min with bus every 10 min. So you can enjoy the mountain and the seaside. The Kensington Star Hotel I was is very poor. I can not recommend this Hotel. The restaurants in the park are good for finish a perfect day in the mountains.
Maple leaves everywhere in Seoraksan,"It’s worth visiting here during the red maple leaf season.The scene here is as lovely as a landscape painting, and I can’t help but want to stay within forever!Strongly recommend visiting this national park."
Must see!,"A 2.5-hour ride from Seoul, Seoraksan is definitely one of the must-sees in Korea. We went here when autumn was about to turn the whole mountain into red but not quite yet so we had the opportunity to see varying shades of leaves. Take the cable car up and enjoy the breathtaking view!"
Beautiful Autumn colours,"Beautiful scenery, breathing taking autumn colours ,Best hotel to stay for daily walks is Kensington Star Hotel"
Nice,It takes a couple of hours drive to reach the place hence best option is a package tour and once there you can take a chair lift car ride or trek yourself to admire nature's wonders at close quarters .There are restaurants near the chair car starting point for lunch etc .A great place to see autumn leaves as we saw in early November .
One of the most beautiful places in Korea,"The mountains in this area are stunning. The hike up Seoraksan is a long but very rewarding haul. If you make it to the top, there's a guy who will etch your name on a little medal for 10,000KRW. "
"Beautiful views, hikes for all levels, canyons, and more","This was a wonderful park to visit. I did two hikes, The first to a waterfall. That was a more moderate hike though it did involve stair climbing. But for those who might need it, stopping to rest in a beautiful setting is not a bad thing. The other was to the top of the mountain. This is a much more advanced hike. You pass through a slot canon on a catwalk above the river, up a steep incline, scramble over some rocks and visit multiple ecosystems. Just doing walks through the boreal forest in the valley would be great. I highly recommend this out of the way park."
Spectacular in the Fall,"The park is busy in the fall but for a good reason ....the weather is magnificent (sunny and warm by day) and the colours are vivid and photogenic. There is a cable car running up to the fortress rock. Walks are very popular and many are easy although, as the paths rise, they become stoney with steps. Steps all have good hand rails or ropes for support. Entrance is 3500 won and foreign seniors are excluded from the seniors admission which only applies to Koreans."
Choose the right time and season,"Wear proper hike shoes, bring water and wear the right clothes for the season. There would be shops at the outer part of Seoraksan. Ulsanbawi course was easy to follow but I think the fact that our Airbnb host turned driver turned hike guide made it easy for us to find our way.We went hiking towards the end of autumn around Nov 18 of last year. We went for Ulsanbawi because it's one of the most popular ones and can be accessed from Sokcho. It was a short trail and before the actual ridge just around the Gyejoam Hermitage it was an easy hike even for beginners. I was expecting an amazing autumn foliage like the one at Naejangsan but since we hiked during the later part of November it was almost winter. Before we went to Seoraksan we stopped by the Descendants of the Sun film set or recreated film set at Taebek-si and the 38th Parallel East Coast. Our host just thought it would be nice to stop by the coast and it was really interesting and serene. There was one dude surfing in the cold autumn which was pretty amazing how he can stand the cold. We rented a car and a driver as it would be easier for us to maximize that day. If 4 of you will split the cost, it wouldn't be that bad. It was a cloudy day and since ""winter is coming"" Seoraksan felt a little gloomy. Trees and leaves wilted, the sky was grey and we were also tired with all the driving that day.We weren't able to make it to Ulsanbawi Ridge, we managed to get to the observatory and the temple but since it was getting dark and we have a long drive ahead, we decided to head back. The highlights of that trail were Tongil Daebul (The Great Unification Buddha) located in Sinheungsa Temple, observatory, the temples especially the Gyejoam hermitage and the boulder called Heundeulbawi close to it. There weren't that much hikers that time. What you read about Seorak being crowded might be true during the peak of Autumn. If I am going to come back and hike Seoraksan, I will do it at the early part of Autumn, I'll start in the morning and dedicate the whole day for us to have time to appreciate it and stop by the falls and actually get to the summit. I will still rent a car and bring friends who are hike enthusiasts as well."
Seorakson National Park waterfall hiking,The distance for the hike is 2.1 km. It is at the peak that is so beautiful and scenic. At certain part of the hiking there were rocks and path narrow very scary. If you overcome it wow the scenery at the peak is wow. You completed it and you feel a sense of achievement. It is best time to hide as the leaves change colour and so beautiful. It is real and not picture or photo. 
Must visit point,This place is really fantastic. Mt. Seorak in autumn shows the most beautiful foliage in the world. Entrance fee is 2500Won and you have to pay in cash. The cable car is 10000 won and you can pay the card.
"Beautiful view, worth the hike and climb.","Fall is truly the best time of the year to visit this place and i cant agree more. I was amazed by the beautiful views and scenery of the mountain as soon as i got off the bus. The rocks are scary and steep, but it is all worth it once you see the beautiful scenery."
Beautiful,"Enchanting view. Trekked up to biryong falls. From Seoul, take the bus from express bus terminal. Tickets -w19700. 2 1/2- 3 hours ride with a rest stop inbetween for 15mins. Lots of accommodations at the foot of the mountain. Take bus no. 7-1, across from the Nambu bus terminal to reach destination. The last stop is at the entrance of the park.Ticket entry price is w3500."
Autumn visit is special,"A lot of people looking for the beautiful autumn colours. Still plenty of other things to do like visiting the temple, Buddha statue, cable car trip and did a trekking trip. Went to the Biryong waterfall and a not too difficult trip. Did go up the staircase to the observatory; challenging but worth the sweat and effort - despite several efforts have not been able to find the altitude of the place."
Seorak in autumn ,"We're a little early for fall colors but the weather was very cooperative. Mornings were clear and no rain, cool but not cold. A bit cloudy in the pm otherwise perfect weather."
Wish I came on late october,"To come here was the best decision you'll want to make when you come to Korea. I wish I come on late October to see the red leaves. We went there on early October, and have seen some of the trees were turning red. Since I hiked with my mom, we only reach Ulsanbawi top, but it's not that good I think, only rocks and temple. But the view from mountain feet is already good enough, maybe I have to hike up another peak to see different view."
Really beautiful park,To visit during foliage. Many visitors will be there but the view is really wonderful and deserves a visit. Many paths for different level of difficulties.
Great Autumn colors,"My family (with 5 and 6 yr olds) enjoyed the hike to Biryeong (2 hrs round trip) and the cable car ride to Gwongeumseong. These trail heads are close to the entrance to the national park. The Fall colors were wonderful and the temperature/humidity is just right. There are several eateries/convenience stores in the park so don't worry about bringing your own lunch/snacks. We were going to climb the Ulsanbawi the next day but decided not to after 1st day's hike (too difficult for my kids). Instead we went to Biseondae, which is about the same difficulty as Biryeong Fall. The trail map provided at the Visitors Center (located about 2 miles before the front gate) gives a pretty accurate estimates on difficulties and duration. "
Nice place,Nice place and landscape. Enjoyed hikibg there. However be aware that when it's crowded during holidays or high season it's really difficult to reach by car or by bus because of trafic. Same for the way back. But you need to see this if you're going to Sokcho
Short bus ride to a nice park,We took bus 7-1 from Sokcho into the park. Even with the rain we enjoyed a nice 2.4 km (one way) hike to see the waterfalls with a great suspension bridge along the way. 
Sogongwon-Daechongbong Peak-Osaek trail,"It is important to note that the said trail requires at least a good cardio and leg power to the climber, as well as the right hiking equipment. This trail can be considered already as a major climb.I stayed in a guesthouse near Jungang market, and from there, I rode a bus to Sogongwon (Bus 7-1; Bus 7 also goes to Sogongwon). Since the expected duration of the while climb was 10 hrs and 40 mins., I left at around 6AM. The entrance fee was KRW 3500, and upon validation of the ticket, they will give you a map. There's a lot of restaurants in Sogongwon, however, most were still closed, when I arrived. Luckily, there's this café that was already open, serving sandwiches, juice and coffee.I started the trail at 7:10am, and the view is indeed spectacular, especially the foliage has already started in Mt. Seorak. The first half of the trail was generally easy/manageable, with lots of stairs. The view will take your tiredness away so no worries.Right after reaching Huiungak shelter, that is where the real deal begins. Gone were the beautiful views, as mostly you'll see rocks. It also started raining as I reached Socheong shelter. It was in the weather forecast, so I was prepared with my rainjacket, but I wasn't prepared with the continuous assault with nothing but rocks. It also started to get foggy. I reached Socheongbong peak with nothing to see but fog :(.I was hungry, cold and tired, as I reached Jungcheong shelter. I also had to replenish 1L of my water. I bought a warm can of coffee there as well. From inside, I saw nothing but fog outside. Thankfully, as I went outside, full and a bit rested, the fog suddenly cleared, the rainshower stopped. I was welcomed by a beautiful view! Just a few minutes more and I was able to reach the Daechongbong Peak (~1:50pm), took a picture and a quick rest before started my descent (~2:00pm).The descent to Osaek was a torture to the knees and legs, as it was all descent (I can't imagine going up there with straight ascent, without any views to distract your exhaustion). I reached the entrance of the park at 4:50pm, finishing the whole course in 9 hrs 40 mins.Contrary to the blogs I've read, there weren't much taxis when I got down. And there's actually a bus back! Around 1km from the entrance of Osaek, there's a bus terminal. The place looked like a convenience store, but there's a window inside where you can buy tickets. However, as I was to go back to Sokcho, the lady there told me that there's actually a bus that passes by! Osaek is in Yangyang, the town(?) next to Sokcho. I alighted the bus in Yangyang intercity bus terminal, and rode Bus 9, that goes to Sokcho. The disadvantage of riding the bus though, is that it took some time for it to arrive. I got down Mt. Seorak at 4:50pm, but the bus arrived at 6:40pm. The advantage was it was waaaay cheaper than riding a taxi."
Generally we loved it,"We went to both Ulsanbawi and the cable car side. Ulsanbawi took longer time to go up as needed to walk and climb the staircases for 3.8 km from the entrance.The cable car station on the hill side was disappointed. the toilet was less maintained, dirty and extremely smelly considering the price you paid to go up there. You might think you are at a public toilet that need to climb up some kms up on the mountain. However, the view was nice. There was constructions on the way and caused the metal burning smell flying through to the 2nd floor scenery open air floor, very inconsiderable as the majorities of the visitors are families with little kids and babies. "
Very beautiful place,"Most people were there to hike but my family went to enjoy the scenery. Was bustling, I would recommend people to hike there instead of just visiting it. Even though there were some stores, there was a limited variety of souvenirs/food. Really very beautiful place!"
Great day out,We did the cable car and walked a bit on the top. It's probably the best thing to do at the national park if you're short of time. We only had the entire morning and hence decided on doing this. It was very well worth it. The crowd control was seamless and the trek at the top is very doable. We had 2 elderly people with us and they thoroughly enjoyed it. Of course there are a lot of trekking routes at the park but the day we went it was sweltering hot and the waterfall trek we intended on doing was advised against due to the lack of flow along the waterfall.
Beautiful but steep steps to the waterfalls ,"Beautiful hike to the waterfalls but the hike itself was hard. It's for fit people. Especially, the stairs to the viewing platform. "
Yongso Falls Hiking Course,"Seoraksan National Park is a large area, about 398.2km2 and spread to 4 cities. Many hiking trails in this park. Yongso waterfall hiking course(1hr, 3.2km) is one of the easiest and shortest, but it has scenic advantage. Usually people trek this course from Yaksuteo Hiking Support Center (약수터탐방지원센터) → Seongguksa Temple (성국사) → Yongso Waterfall (용소폭포) → Yongso Waterfall Hiking Support Center (용소폭포탐방지원센터), it is going upstream, so you will have a slope a little bit.(Category of difficulty is grade C).In early of September 2017 we went together with our in-laws and relatives, the other way around. We were dropped off at Yongso Waterfall Support Center and the driver will pick up us at Yaksuteo HSC. Because of we walked downstream, the slope was very little, easier.The trek was in Jujeon valley, it was not difficult trek, some part has wooden bridge covered with rubber tires to prevent slippery and also suspension bridge. Mostly the trek was on riverside. The scenery was amazing. Yongso waterfall was a 6 meters high, the debit of the river was minimum, a lot of rocks in the river, some little fishes in some part of the river. The sceneries were green every where, the color of late summer. Autumn's color had not yet seen. Seongguksa Temple was located after we walked 2/3 length of the trail. there was fountain in front of the temple, the water has medicinal effects, we stopped a while and continued until Yaksuteo HSC and Osaek Mineral Spring (오색약수터). Along the 200-300m road here; there were Korean restaurants, and some stalls selling roots, and wild mushroom. Then we stop at Osaek bus stop that has flowing pool of mineral water. So we could rest our feet in this warm mineral water. We also had our lunch served in Korean bento here. Toilet facility was around parking area. Nice trek, nice scenery. Good facility."
"Very popular with local people, for a good reason!","Absolutely fantastic this place! Something to do for everyone.... Buddhist monasteries, restaurants, cable car, short walk to waterfalls, etc.... And best of all, serious hiking on many routes, all very well maintained. Watching the sunrise from the summit is sooooo impressive and unforgettable."
Beautiful National Park,"Seoraksan National Park is a very beautiful place to walk or hike around. so many things to see at the national park, Many trails for you to hike and ride the cable car to the mountain. Amazing view at Seoraksan National Park."
Nice View,"you need to wear a appropriate attire here. its basically, literally hiking. you can ride the cable car and see the amazing view already. but if you want even better view, go up more and see ur self. its worth it. also they have a temple down there, so beautiful."
Beautiful View,"Drove to Seoraksan from Seoul with my parents. Make sure you're equipped with a good GPS. Went in July 2017 - hot days and heavy rains!If you're heading for the Buddha and the cable car - use the cable car location on your GPS. Some of the road signs once you get close to Seoraksan divert you to the hiking trails etc.Took us about 4 hours from Seoul. A few restaurants before you get to Seoraksan National Park entrance, but a few more cafes once you get into the park.Got the cable car up, and unfortunately we only got a brief view of the surrounds due to thick cloud. There's a small cafe up the mountain serving waffles and ice cream. If you're equipped with good walking shoes, there are a few paths you could walk along once you get to the top.Back down - nice paths and walks to the Unification Buddha, and very peaceful stream running alongside.Would be ideal for a hike."
"so little time, so much to do!","My itinerary was set to 2N3D to explore Sokcho inlcuding Seoraksan National Park. Sokcho alone (excluding Seoraksan) already has a lot to offer. But this place is HUUUUGE! There is a lot to do here! I definitely need to go back and plan a longer trip, perhaps an entire week to equally enjoy explore and rest.Goes without saying: wear comfortable clothes: rubber shoes / outdoor sandals, a light jacket (I went end-August), and lots of drinking water. There's an activity for everyone. Different peaks to climb up to, depending on your level of stamina, energy and will-power!"
A must go place!,A must go place in the area. The actual main reason of going to Sokcho. Good place for hiking but also a good place to enjoy for a short time by using the cable car. The view never lets you down and the fancy cafes near the entrance are worth visiting and will give you a different scenery of the park. 
Wonderful national Parc,"We had a delightful moment trekking around the parc and visiting the different temples and rivers.Unfortunately, the rain stopped us 1.8km from the top.Who knows, better luck tomorrow?You have need to come."
Nice visit in inclement weather,"We visited Mount Seorak as part of a tour and even though the weather was on and off rain, it was still enjoyable! We saw the reunification Buddha and is it big! There was also Shinheungsa Temple which was interesting and then caught the cable car to the top. It was a good ride and once at the top a short walk will take you to the very top! I can imagine the view would be amazing but there was a lot of fog on the day and next to zero visibility ! Still worth it, if you're in the area stop and look!"
One of my favorite places in South Korea,The park is beatiful and big - lots of routes to choose from. There's also a cable car going to one of the mountains. Wonderful nature and view of the surrounding mountains and you can also see the ocean from up there! Close to the centre of Sokcho with good bus connections. Would love to come back during autumn or when the temperatures are not so high.
Fantastic Park with a wide variety of hikes,"This national park is easy accessible from Sokcho. Take bus 7 or 7-1 and it will bring you to the entrance.The park has a lot of highlights and hikes towards it. These hikes vary in difficulty and length.We went to Ulsanbawi Rock, which has a great view over the rocky area and the city of Sokcho all the way to the sea. The first part is very easy, the road is not steep. Then you will reach the stone and wooden stairs and you will have to climb for more than 1km. This is a hard part,but really worth it.The return hike is 4 hours in total.Enjoy!"
Stunning.,"Absolutely stunning views.Very easy to access by public transport.Loads of trek courses to choose, with clear signage and information to make your choice.Fill up your water bottle at the tourist information centre, or have your lunch at the many food stores( quite reasonably priced) before your trek.There are clean toilets along the trek too."
Lots of hiking options. Highly recommended,"Loved this National park! Take bus 7 or 7-1 from Sokcho bus station which gets you to the main entrance. They run about every fifteen minutes. We hiked here for three days and could have happily done another. There is a fantastic coffee place that roasts onsite. Go past the big Buddha, before the temple. It is across a little bridge, in a traditional looking house. Great single origin, and yummy blueberry smoothies! Also serve homemade scones and a few biscuits. Set up for snacks, but not meals.There are a variety of restaurants before the big Buddha. No convenience store, so bring your hiking snacks with you. But easy to have lunch here. Veggo options were bibimbap, potato pancake or spring onion (without the seafood). There was also a burger place, and a pizza place. Also an international ATM just outside the park gates, which we used. Don't choose the ""English"" option. Choose ""foreign card"". Then it works a treat! Up to 300,000 won withdrawals. There is a cable car here, if thats your thing. The various more serious hiking routes have cut off times noted on the trail map. You must reach certain markers by that time in order to continue up. If you are too late, you will not be permitted to continue. So get an early start if you are tackling one of the longer routes."
My favorite place in Korea!,Seoraksan national park is by far my favorite place to visit in Korea. It has many trails for all levels. Even a visit to the main plaza is worth a visit!
Nice & charming,Visited this place once in winter many years ago & this time in summer. It provides a totally different view and feel to it. Moreover since it's de low season we could take our time to snap all the photos we want. It requires a bit of hiking but it's not taxing at all. We went up the temple trail & passed by the great Buddha. The temple is 1400 years old! How amazing is that. There's another trail up the cable car way but we didn't take the cable car as it's closed today due to strong winds. 
Great Scenic Spots for Nature,"Very peaceful place. I highly recommend going to this place. There's a cable car going up the mountain. Great views at the top. We also hiked the mountain top. Kinda slippery because of the melted snow. If you want to hike to the top, use shoes that are not slippery and durable enough."
Beautiful scenery.,We hiked the Seoraksan Mountain and it gave us an awe view from the top of the mountain. You can choose to hike from below or to take the cable car up. It's really windy up there so I wouldn't personally advise anyone to bring their hats/caps along. And girls with skirts are less preferable as we've seen a lot of girls wearing skirts having their skirts up to their face. It's fun to hike during spring as it's not too hot nor too cold and you can enjoy the beautiful flowers and nature around. There's a lot of restaurants down at the park so you won't worry having to starve yourself.
Great scenery,Really nice hike. We did ulsanbawi which was about 4 hours in total up and down. There are buses while go from the city to the national park every 10 minutes. Definitely recommend this place.
wonderful mountain.. must visit,"beautiful nature, highly recommend this place.but sadly when i hiked the ulsanbawi, the view blocked by the heavy fog.but still nice and enjoyable hike"
"Beautiful nature, fun experience staying at a shelter","We (4 friends, 25 y/o) did a 2 day hike in Seoraksan Park and made it to the highest peak. Nature is outstanding: clear water streams, beautiful mountains, amazing sunrise around 5am. It was a very safe hike, there were quite a lot of stairs, handrails, and signs. Downside is that you feel a bit less connected with nature. The views were great though. We hiked during the week and met quite a few other hikers, heard it gets crowded during weekends. * Since there are so many signs, you could easily hike here by yourself. We stayed at a shelter, book this in advance on the Seoraksan website! The reservation process is quite simple. Bring your own cooking utensils and food, as the shelter is super basic. Sleeping in the shelter was a great experience and we met some very friendly Koreans."
Very scenic,This park is really stunning. It is so green now in late May. The giant Buddha statue is great. Many people are hiking. Take a ride on the cable car. Stop and have lunch (the margherita pizza was great!). There's a nice gift shop by the cable car with beautiful amethyst jewelry made from Korean amethyst.
Majestic Mountain,"It takes 40 minutes by bus 7-1 from downtown Sokcho to the park (1,200 Won). The entrance fee is 3,500 Won. The cable car is near the entrance (10,000 Won). It is every 5 min. You may have to wait one hour to board. Meanwhile you can go to see the nearby buddha statue in the Sinheungsa Temple. At the top cable car station you can follow a trail up a huge rocky area where many people are. The scenery is majestic. You can also follow a trail down to Anlakam Hermitage where you can try to find an 800-year-old pine. You then go back to the top cable car station and ride down. Unfortunately we did not have time to hike other trails. Next time."
Wow! Truly wonderful,"We spent the day wandering through the woods and exploring the Buddhist temple. There is an admission charge for the park and an additional fee to ride the cable car up and down the mountain. There were many places to eat or bring your lunch. We got there early in the morning and beat the insane rush of people into the park, so go early. "
Worthy a visit,"We arrived at the Express Bus Terminal Station and boarded a bus headed for Sokcho. Had bought the tickets earlier to avoid disappointment as we had only a few days to spend in Seoul. You will be allocated a seat number on the bus which is clean, spacious and comfortable.Be prepared that it is a 3hour bus ride with a 15min rest stop miway. Upon arrival at the Sokcho express bus terminal, we switched to a local bus number 7 or 7-1 to arrive at the entrance to the Seroraksan Natonal Park.Please remember to head to the cable car station to buy tickets if you want an aerial view at the top. Since we went on a weekday, it was a breeze as we didn't wait long for our ride up to the top.After exiting the cable car, we made our way up the meadering pathway filled with steps and uneven surface that led to the peak. Make sure to wear comfortable and non-slip shoes to walk on the rockground. Upon reaching the peak, you will have a beautiful view of Sokcho from the top. There were also lots of rocks formations that are picture-perfect.When we got back down to the cable car station, we walked around the park area with the famous Buddha statue and the surrounding temple architure that surrounds the place.We were afraid that a day trip might be too rush since it's a 3hr to and fro bus ride but surprisingly, we even managed to squeeze in time for the Sokcho Fishery Market where we had a sumptous lunch of seafood cooked on the spot before returning to Seoul.Good attraction to visit in your visit to South Korea. "
Great day out.,"One of our highlights on our travels round South Korea. Great hiking , brilliant views from the cable car. Good food available on site. Easy to get to from Andong by local bus. "
Mountains beyond mountains,"It's almost impossible to run out of things to do here, as there are numerous different routes. There are waterfalls, caves and huge standing rocks to see. And for those not inclined towards hiking there is a cablecar up to a viewing area on one of the mountains.The park costs ￦3500 to enter, and thr cable car a further ￦10,000. Be advised the cable car does not operate of there are strong winds, and the mountains are closed during some parts of the year, so try and find information before you go hiking."
Wonderful Scenery,"We visited Seoraksan National Park in mid April, coming by car from Seoul. The place, the temple and the mountain are gorgeous, particularly in the spring with many many trees in flower. The main attraction is a cable car that goes up the mountain, leaving every 10 minutes, and very fast. From there the view is exceptional and marvelous. On top there are some observation decks and it is also possible to walk around the area with many different prospectives to see the nature.Back in the park we went to see a beautiful temple and a big Buddha statue, all interesting. There are several places to walk around and also cafes and restaurants. There are also hotels in the park. We only spend a day but you can also stay longer because there are many places to visit and outdoor activities to do."
Wonderful!,This is very nice national park. We were lucky with sunny weather so we could see North Korea from here.
Well worth the trip,Highly recommended if you like nature. You don't have to hike- just look! Fantastic views. Try the cable car.
A great place to visit but get there early,WE were up early and out trekking before 8am and there was no one around what a great time we had and the National park is fantastic well worth a visit whilst here. do get there early as the day trips come in thick and fast as soon as the cable car opens
Serenity and Scenery,"A drive up the valley to the Park, the usual slow crawl to the Parking lot, go early! A walk around the Buddhist temples, there's a temple-stay feature. Well made paved paths straddle the manicured flood plain stream. A cable car whisks folks up one side for a high view, the Ulsanbawi Trail is a but of legwork. Partway up is the Heundalbawi Rock photo op and rock cave temple. Oh and the Big Buddha. All in all a long full day, Korean National Parks has brought the outdoors to the masses."
Shinheungsa temple,When i came there cable car not operated because a strong wind.i only go to shinheungsa temple.it's a good temple and easy to get there.you can make donation on its.you can go inside big budha from back side.and there place to pray but not camera allowed
Nice view,Very nice view from up there. We are lucky to get a nice weather. Sunny and not to windy. Maybe come there at autum is better view coz will be a lot of maple tree there :)
Beautiful view,A must walk peak visit. A rocky mountain we goint to one of the top using cable car and a 10 minutes walk uphill.. A very beautiful spot for photography..
Beautiful,"Stunning national park with excellent facilities (plentiful clean public toilets), great well planned and maintained paths and very easy to access. Get bus 7 or 7-1 from Sokcho town centre."
Unbelievable beauty,"We really enjoyed our day exploring Mt Seorak. The park was not very busy and we easily caught a ride on the cable car and then hiked to the peak. We also enjoyed seeing the giant Buddha and the temple. Several in our party hiked to the waterfall and back and loved it. However, we did have our parents with us and it would have been to hard on their knees to make the steep climb and all of those stairs but the teens loved it!"
Snow on top of the mountain,"Coming from a equator country, there were snow/ice at the foot of the mountain which was cooling and nice feeling for us. When we reached the top cable car station, we could see white snow all around. we hiked up the trail following our tour guide to the top part of the mountain. Real cold experience but nice. Had the time of my life playing with the snow all around. Even though spring is approaching, the weather is still 1 deg C or lower at top of the mountain. The top cable car station has a cafeteria that serves delicious hot chocolate drink there.(Very good for the cold weather). Nice to sit around the benches at the cable car station and enjoy the view around."
National park in korea,"a must place to visit when you are in south korea. take the cable car and you will see the beautiful view of the mountain and its surrounding. after arrived at the cable car station, either you want to hiking to the top of mountain or just walk around that area. and i choose to hike. the track are good. almost 10 minutes to reach the top. once you reach , the beautiful scenery is just infront of your eyes. trust me. you wont regret hiking this mountain."
Great hikes,This was my favorite part of my days in South Korea. There are so many hiking trails with amazing views. We had great weather. A must!
Great nature experience ,We were lucky to have such great sunny days for hiking. In april there were not that many people. The cherry blossoms were blooming and mild wind was lovely. Wonderful place to visit in Korea and it's only couple of hours from Seoul. 
Meet up with nature,"Since our time in korea limited, we planned to visit sokcho to go to seorakshan.From seoul we went by express bus, bus fare around W18.100. Takes 3 hours to get there.From express bus terminal in sokcho, walk across the street to the bus stop. Take bus no 7 or 7-1 and in the end of the journey, you will arrive at the gate of seoraksan national park.The place is so big, you can enjoy it with cable car or beat the tracks. It's my second time went there. The first time the weather so cloudy and wind blows quite hard so the cable car closed.If we walk along the tracks we will find big Budha statue, stone bridge and temple in the end of the path.This time, the cable car was open, so we tried different way. After buy the ticket, we wait for a sec, and when the cable car arrive, we all went inside. About 30 people can be in one cable car and take around 7 min. The view from cable car is breathtaking. We can see the national park from above, the sea, the mountain.After arrive at the cable car station, we walk to the peak of the mountain. It's a little rain when we begin to climb. The path is clear and safe. In the end of it, there's a large area for you to enjoy the scenery. We still meet snow, the mountain is cover with snow.After take some picture, we went back to the cable car station to warm ourself.If you got hungry, they sell snack there, toppoki, pancake, grill sausage. And you also can enjoy the nature there."
Amazing if you have good weather,It is si beatifull park of course if the weather is good.you can take easy and moderate or hard trails.very good informatione centre are the right after the park gate.for me number one-Ulsanbawi Rock and second Cable Car.
Great view,"Really enjoy the cable car. After that you have to go up stairs around 10minutes, but it's really worth it to go there because the view is really amazing. If you dont't want to go up, you can stay in cablecar stop, there is a cafe so you can enjoy some snack there"
Snow and cable car...wooohooo,"There is still snow at the top. After a cable car ride...and the ride is quite fast ,step out and my whole family is so excited to found out that there are a lot of snow out there. The view from the top is magnificent and don't forget to try the cheese pretzel at the local bar...its delicious."
Words can't describe,"This mountain was absolutely breathtaking. It was everything they said and more. The first day I started around 430am at the main entrance (sogongwon I think). I was planning to head to Daechongbong peak through Cheonbuldong valley and from there head back through the dragon ridge which is supposedly more difficult than Cheonbuldong. Everything was going smoothly but it was 6am, I was already at Bisondae rock and the sun hadn't risen still. Since the internet told me the climb would be much steeper. At this point I decided to wait and lost about 30 minutes just doing nothing.I reached Daechongbong past noon and since it was autumn, I decided not to risk heading back through dragon ridge since nightfall would come early. Instead, I took the route to the nearest exit. The name is Osaek springs I think.It was so enchanting. I think it was partially because I started the climb before dawn and on a Monday. So I barely saw any people until I hit Yangpok shelter. I climbed on October. So when I started the climb my surroundings were that of Autumn. When I gained elevation it became fall. And lastly, near the peak I felt the Korean winter.This place is so special to me and always will be since this was probably my last trip to Korea. I'm glad it ended with a bang."
Fabulous Mountains Temple and Walks,"Really worth the 2.5hr bus trip from Seoul. Try the cable car on a clear day. Great little café roaster on site. Lots of eateries. The temple complex is living Buddhism and has a temple stay. Entry fee is 3,500 and car parking 4,000. We bussed in on No7 - very frequent from Sokcho town."
Spectacular Views,"We enjoyed the cable car ride to the ancient mountain top fortress and there was spectacular views (the best scenery that we saw in South Korea), particularly with the snow/ice covered peaks. We started the walk to Ulsanbawi but due to the season (early sunset), we turned back before we got there. There were lots of places to catch the bus that travels to the National Park, so have a look at the route on Google Maps before committing yourself to travelling back to the bus terminal. We stayed in Sokcho for two nights, so as not to have to travel too much in one day but we would recommend shortening the time you spend in Sokcho, where possible. We didn't find too much else to do in the town."
Nice view,Enjoyed the autumn view all the way up to Ulsanbawi rock in Seoraksan. The whole journey took us about 2 hours plus to completed. The weather was nice & comfortable. Would suggest to go early as possible to avoid the crowd & have a clearer view from top of the mountain.
Fantastic in Winter,Seoraksan National Park is great in Winter. There is an extensive network of trails and also a cable car ride to one of the peaks hear the main entrance. Ulsanbawi is a good half day return climb but the main peak takes 2 days. Access is easy from Sokcho town ( half hour by bus from the bus station). Trails are will made and maintained - although they may be icy in the winter.
Incredible Mountain Paradise,S.N.P. is an outdoor person's absolute gem. Incredible mountain views with a range of challenging/ beginners hikes for all ages and fitness levels. You can also enjoy some great local Korean cuisine in the main entrance area after a long hike. This could be my favorite place in Korea! 
nice hiking place with a beautiful view,"You can go to Seoraksan from Seoul. There are buses direct from Seoul to Sokcho (approx. 3 hours) and then you can take a bus to Seoraksan. It's about 20-30 minutes from Sokcho.There are several nice hiking routes in Seoraksan eg. rock route, falls route.This is a good place to enjoy colorful autumn."
Nature & Locals,"Arriving on a Thursday at Sokcho was kind of creepy because the hotel village nearby the entrance of the park looked like an abandonned olympic village. But on Friday and Saturday lots of Seoul-people arrived and we had a good time. During weekends the park is crowded with Korean people dressed in the latest hiking outfits. Walking a trail is besides the astounishing views, a cultural experience. If you prefer a quiet walk, try a Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. "
Magnificent Plae,This is little bit out of major town attraction but Korea while well known for cities and factories is less known for natural beauty. This is great place to experience that part of Korea. Make sure you bring good camera and comfortable shoes and let yourself run wild. Scenery is amazing and view from hiking trails is breathless. Be warned that safety in Korea is your responsibility and as such lots of areas don't have railings and safety barriers that would be necessary in the west. if anything this makes whole place a lot more natural. Can get quiet cold up here so make sure you bring adequate clothes.
Hiking,Seroaksan is very beautiful mountain in South Korea. There are few hiking trails so choose the one that attracts you most. Each has different views.
Good for photography,Beautiful place to visit for nature lover and photography enthusiasts. Beautiful mountain view and sunset.
Magnificent,"We went there in early of October, early morning and it was already crowded at the main entry. We walked slowly along the path and realized that there were more scenic view inside. Buddha Statue was perfectly situated with the sound of water and birds. It definitely a place where we could find our peace of mind."
Must see attractions,"The main target of my trip to Korea is to pursue snow in this Seoraksan mountains.When we arrive, our eyes had washed with a thick white snow. We taking to much time play with snow. After the Seoraksan gate, you need to pay for the entrance. For cable car ride need to walk about 15 minutes to reach at counter. It charge different not included in one package."
A Must - see National Park ,Fantastic winter snow view everywhere. Family will love the walk up the hill but be forewarned that the path is very slippery. Will no advise aged people who don't have strong arms to trek the path up the hill. One needs to hold onto the metal railings almost all the way up. 
Lovely place to see,"A tranquil and sprawling area to contemplate. Sights and sound capture one's heart, good for pausing and reflection. Walkable, great many photo spots, but depending on the crowdedness or not, walk as far in as the monastary and temples, pass the bridge, engage your ears with the water sounds against the river rocks below. Look around, and look again. Feel soothed by all your surroundings."
Big Buddha and Beautiful View,"To respect of the Big Buddha and good for sightseeing the beautiful view from the mountain around the park. Visit in winter, snow is all around this place and that's make me have a very good memory here"
Magnificent Scenery,"Went to Seoraksan during early autumn, take the cable car up the mountain. Beautiful scenery at the top."
Beautiful scenery in winter but becareful,"In Dec, the walk path is slippery, make sure you walk slowly and choose the right path (ones with less icy ground). Wear shoes with good gripBig Buddha statue and beautiful colored arches and houses. "
Magnificent Mount,Great view from the top.. take the cable car up. It can get really windy up at the top. Do a short hike up after cable car stop and you get even better view 
Hugh Buddha and Mountains,"Visit in Winter and the surroundings of the temple ground was covered with thick snow.The Buddha was sitting on top of the small temple and the entrance to the temple is behind, Inside the temple, there are other worshippers Buddha to pray. The mountain view is beautiful in winter, just like a portrait."
A must visit attraction when you travel South Korea,"It was nice visit, easy to reach from the city center just take a bus 7 or 7-1 direct to the parking lot. clean and nice view"
Iconic National Park in Korea.,"Seoraksan NP has some of the most amazing views you will ever see in any national park. Incredible cliffs, beautiful streams and an absolute stunner in autumn. If you visit Korea in October / November it is a must see. A 40 minute bus ride or $20 will get you there...."
A place worth visiting at any cost,"I had only one free day and even though the road to Seoraksan from Seoul takes 3 hours i took a risk of going there without staying overnight at Sokcho. The only available way to get there is by bus/car. Buses depart from Seoul Express Bus Terminal almost every hour, the same schedule is in Sokcho. Ofcourse it is much better to stay at least for a couple of days because Seoraksan has a lot to offer. I took an Ulsanbawi course which was 4 hours long for roundtrip, though i wish i had a chance to go deeper into the park, staying in tent, etc. Hopefully will come back next time and during summer."
Seoraksan / 설악산,What an amazing place! I was with my daughter so I did not do the full hike. We went by cable car up to GwonGeumseong and it was truly an amazing view! I recommend this place to those who want to embrace the beauty of nature but are physically challenged to do so. 
Must See,"Beautiful park, tends to be a bit crowded at the entrance but it thins out pretty fast. People overall are very nice, we had some older Koreans give us some of their snacks which was nice. Be sure to wear some good shoes here. If you see Korean women wearing heels then the climbing is moderate, if they are all wearing tennis shoes then it's a serious trail wear tennis shoes or fall of a cliff lol. Water was gorgeous as was the mountains. Trail to the waterfalls was doable for me and I'm out of shape, we decided to go to the observation which was gorgeous but 900 steps high. That was a tougher one but they have break points throughout the journey."
Must visit in Sokcho!,"Easily accessible by public transport, you can spend whole day there at your own time & pace. Good to wear comfort shoe so that you can do a little trekking. It's beautiful when u r at e TOP! "
MUST GO PLACE!,"I REPEAT! IT IS A MUST GO PLACE (Ulsanbawi trek)! We went during autumn and this place was real beautiful. Took a bus at a bus stop near House Hostel (the place we stayed) which was real convenient at early in the morning around 7 plus. It was indeed a cold morning, nonetheless the hike was pleasant. We went on a Friday morning and there was no crowd when we hiked up. The wind was very strong as we were nearing peak. The whole hike took us around 5 hours to and fro. Tiring hike though, therefore, a good pair of shoes are needed."
Great hikes and lovely park,"We spent two days walking in this park. There are hikes for all abilities, and a lovely waterfall. Make sure you see the grotto, so peaceful with the Buddhist monk chanting. I sat there for an hour just listening before starting walking again. It can get VERY crowded so go as early as you can. Recommended."
Probably the Best National Park in Korea,"This huge National Park has got everything!High mountains, waterfalls and rivers, treks, a fortress, Buddhist temples, Buddha statues and even a cable car.The mountains are impressive and a high point can be reached by cable car.The treks are classed into easy, moderate and expert and the map is colour-coded and gives the average time for completing each trek. There are huts and shelters along the way and the signposting is good.There is something here for everyone.Around the entrance there are several coffee shops, restaurants and souvenir shops.Definitely one of the highlights of Korea."
One of the best hikes in South Korea,"Excellent hiking, be prepared to be at the park as early as possible no later than 9am. Good plan to start at the south side and finish in the north."
Go early to avoid the crowds,"We visited just past the peak autumn foliage season so crowds were minimal. The most crowded areas were on the cable car ride and the short hike upwards. If you are planning to hike any of the other trails, I'd suggest skipping the cable car. You'll see much more and it's already in the price of your ticket. Cable car ride costs an extra 10000krw. There's an easy trail (supposed to take 1.5-2 hours round trip) to the left of the park and I would start with that if you don't want to over exert yourself, or if you go late in the day. For ulsanbawi, please ensure you are reasonably fit as the last part consists of a long, long climb up many flights of stairs. There are longer trails stretching across the park which take a full day and require camping overnight. Check the maps near the entrances to see your options. Those are much more detailed than anything else posted online. I wouldn't attempt a visit as part of a day trip to Sokcho as its much too rushed. You'll arrive late in the day and have limited time. There are plenty of affordable guesthouses near the park as well as in Sokcho town itself. We stayed near Daepohang port in Sokcho. Overall it's a beautiful national park and well worth the trip to see it. "
Seoraksan park - a beautiful & unforgettable experience,"Seoraksan National park is a spectacular place to visit for a couple of hours. We were part of a tour group of over 20 people to visit Seoraksan National Park on Saturday in early October. The typhoon just went through, and we were very lucky to be there when the cable car was re-opened after it was closed temporarily due to strong wind.A big tip is to make sure you book the cable car tickets early if possible. Our tour guide managed to get a fellow guide to buy our tickets on the day to save us from waiting too long. Be prepared for a long queue for the tickets & again the line to the cable car, as the tickets are very popular with a 10min interval and 50 pax capacity in each car. Once at the top, walk past the observation deck and head up to the mountain along with the rest of the crowd to reach a spectacular view opening up at the top. Plenty of photo opportunity but watch out for the danger of getting too close to the cliff edge that drops off quite dramatically. The guards will warn the crowd occasionally over the loud PA system to stay clear from the edge, but only for those who understand Korean.Be sure to check out the 'hidden' undercroft of the sitting buddha by walking to the entry at the very rear of the huge status. It offers a nice quiet moment amidst the hustle & bustle of the thrones of crowds outside. There is a Buddhist temple interlaced with numerous hiking trail along a nice stream. Defintely one of the highlights of our trip to South Korea!"
awesome view,"it takes about 4 - 5 hours from Seoul. but it is worth to visit!! there are many tracks for hiking. i've chosen the most earliest one - it took 1.5 to 2 hours to finish. With beautiful scene, easy to walk!"
Great family hike!,"Woke my 10 year old son early for a morning hike up to Ulsan Bawi. Luckily, we didn't battle with hoards of hikers like other reviewers mentioned. We went when it was peak autumn foliage season but were told that this year, the foliage wasn't as ''pretty'' as other years.... something to do with no rain. But still, it was a great hike."
Beautiful natural treasure,"This is a beautiful scenic area. This is a place where you can spend the whole day there. Unfortunately, we arrived in the later part of the afternoon and was not able to cover many areas this place has to offer. However, at the lower area, the temple was a nice place to visit. Beautifully kept national treasure. For those who prefer to take a short cut, there is a cable car ride that you can take. Plan your time properly, for the queue can be long. At the peak, the view is awesome."
The nicest and best hikes I ever had!,We lived in the NW of the US and have been to Mt Rainer and Mt Hood as well as hikes in Europe.... We found the hikes in the Seoraksan National Parks better and nicer than anywhere else... You just have to make sure you travel when you can avoid the crowds!
breath-taking view,"You can go there using bus no 7 or 7-1.The view is awesome. But when i went there, it's quite crowded, so you have to wait around 1.5 hour to get into cable car. so be sure to prepare your time if you visit this place during peak season."
Beautiful autumn leaves !!,"We were in Seoraksan on 17 Oct 2016. It's probably autumn folliage at its best...spectacular !!We couldn't give much reviews though...as we were there with our mother who is in her 80s. So, we spent most of our time driving around, occasional stops for photos and taking cable car. No hiking. Avoid going on weekends. We were there on Sunday. It's traffic jam with hundreds of tour buses, crowded and loud with tourists all over. Very chaotic. No need to take cable car to see the best of autumn folliage. We drove from sokcho to Inje on our way back to Seoul the next morning. It's spectacular all the way.... The drive was uphill with many stops for sweeping views across the valleys down below. Its way better than the cable car experience. Besides, we had to pay KRW 3,500 for each adult at the entrance + KRW 3,000 for the parking + KRW 10,000 for each adult for the cable car, not to mention the long queueing !!"
"Enjoy the majesty of Mt. Seorak, with thousands of others.","We visited Seoraksan National Park over a weekend in early October, along with everyone else. The mountain is gorgeous in the fall and we arrived about a week before the colors really changed. The main attraction is a cable car that goes up the mountain. The cost was 10000 for adults and 6000 for children. It leaves about every 10 minutes and is limited to 50 people per trip. The tickets sell out quickly (especially in the fall) so my recommendation is to get tickets first thing once you enter the park. We got our tickets right when we got there and still had to wait about 90 minutes before our ticket time. Once on top there are some observation decks and a short hike to a section of the mountain with great views. The kids (ages 8 and 5) loved climbing on the rocks. There is a lot to see at the park, including a Buddhist temple and numerous hiking trails, so be prepared to spend most of the day there. We decided to hike on a little trail to a few waterfalls. The kids made it to Yukdampokpo on a relatively easy trail. From there the trail got a lot harder for the kids so they turned back. I ventured on and climbed about 1000 stairs (no longer a trail, but stairs attached to the side of the mountain) to Biryongpokpo then finally Towangseongpokpo Observatory. The view was well worth the hike, although most of it was stairs. The park was crowded, especially the trail which made it difficult to hike with small children. It's a beautiful mountain, but in the fall it's a bit too crowded."
An amazing but very crowded place. Where to stay in Seoraksan?!,"Seoraksan is a very beautiful place with many hiking trials. You can easily spend more than 4 days hiking there. I was planning for two days but ended up doing only one day because I had very sore legs from Hallasan in Jeju.I did the trial to Madeungryeong and back and it is really beautiful. It can get steep sometimes but it is good for a one-day hike if you are fit (less crowded than the others too).The problem with Seoraksan is the crowds. There is a huge number of people everywhere. Maybe this was augmented because I was there on a weekend mid-October though.As for where to stay, I stayed at a hostel 5 min by bus from the park thinking that this is an intelligent move. It was not! Buses going up in the morning were all full when they reached me and I had to walk for 30 min after which I gave up and took a taxi. I advice staying in Sokcho.PS: For your protein intake, they sell these cheap boiled eggs at every shop in Korea (1000 KRW for 3 eggs). I discovered that the eggs are boiled late but found them a brilliant idea!!"
Wonderful Park,"Plan to spend a full day here, giving yourself time for hiking a few trails and taking the lift to the top of the mountain for awesome views. I suggest getting lift tickets early but allowing for a couple of hours to complete the falls trail before going up the mountain. "
Pinnacle,This was the best place we visited all over 2 weeks in Korea. Worth the time and money to arrive to this far place
Seoraksan- Whole day with Mother Nature!,"Accessibility: Pretty accessible! No hassle with the travel :)Transportation:From SeoulTake a bus from Seoul Express Bus Terminal which will cost around 18,000 KRW.Travel time is approximately 2.5 hours.From the Sokcho Express Terminal, cross the road and take the 7 or 7-1 bus going to SeoraksanEntrance Fee: Seoraksan entrance fee is 3,500 wonMy friend and I spent the whole day in the park. We were able to climb the top of the Ulsan Bawi/Ulsan Rock which was really amazing!The view was breathtaking and it was worth the climb.After the climb in Ulsan Bawi, we went to see the waterfalls which were also amazing."
Amazing place to visit ! ,"We visited this on 22nd Oct esp to see this beautiful place during fall.It was very beautiful esp. With beautiful colors of the nature at this time of fall.We also took the trail to the waterfall about 3.5 km as well as walked to the grand statue of lord Buddha and then the cable car.The trail was amazing and then after being tired the statue of Buddha was perfect to relax and wait for our turn for the cable car.Since there are too many people in queue for the cable car, I would advise to quickly book the ticket first and then go for the trail.The ticket for cable car is 10000 won each person, But remember, the time is fixed, any change in time or cancellation is charged 20%"
Half-day trip to Seoraksan National Park,"Start with entrance to Seoraksan national park is in Sokcho, we can see stunning views of mountains and the sea from the mountain peaks. We can use cable car ride to get to the peak and back down to avoid hiking or getting sweaty. A must visit after seeing the peak will be Sinheungsa Temple, within walking distance."
Nice trip,"The Seoraksan National Park is quite far from Seoul city, probably takes 3-4 hours driving, depending on traffic. It is not as spectacular as Naejangsan for seeing red leaves in autumn but it is quite scenic and is good for an outing. Best to go there in mid Oct. I went there in early Oct. and only a few trees have turned red (perhaps this autumn is a bit warm). The buddha statue, the temple and the bridge are the main tourist attractions ie for those who want to spend just a couple of hours there. "
Tips for Seoraksan hikes,"When trying to plan our hikes in Seoraksan, i found it extremely difficult to find suitable information on the different hikes, so here is what i learned!We visited in peak fall season - mid october - and consequently the colours were amazing but there were loads of people around.Tip 1: go early. The park opens at 4am. Unless you're suuuuper keen you dont need to go that early. If you arrive by 7am youll beat the vast majority of the crowds and only see them when you are on your way back down and youve had the whole of your walk in solitude.Tip 2: go 'expert'. Tour groups are rife. If you pick a hike thats a nice easy two hour round trip you will encounter all of them (on one of our hikes we had to queue at every stage the whole way round - no exaggeration). Tour groups and the majority of individuals stay away from the 'expert' routes and the ones that are a little further afield. For example, lots of people make it to Biseondae (go early, youll beat them) but much fewer keep going to Geumggangul Cave or Madeungryeong Samgeori.The walks:We didnt do them all, but on the knps website the descriptions are either a history of the place or just things like 'no swimming' so here is a sample. Pick up a map at the park entrance and the descriptions are better too (see my photos)Osaek to Yongso FallsLovely, easy, ambling valley walk. Stunningly beautiful in the fall (and im sure other seasons). Very easy, lots of bridges and photo opportunities. Will get very very busy unless you go earlySeorakdong to BiseondaeAlso an easy meandering path, similar to the above, but with a fabulous bridge at the top which is overlooked by towering cliffs. Incredibly beautiful again.Biseondae to Geumganggul caveSteep, quiet, beautiful views through gaps in the trees, metal steps in the cliff on the way up to the cave with breathtaking views of several valleys. You dont even have to go all the way to the cave if you are nervous of heights there is a viewing platform before the scary steps start.-- about 45 mins further on from the junction to the cave towards Madeungryeong it levels out a bit into an amazing magical forest with picnic spots and views. Highly recommended to go a bit further. Super quiet and away from the crowds.UlsanbawiBeautiful valley walk which slowly gets steeper and steeper as it passes amazing views and temples. Amazing. Views from the top are unreal. Not as hard as it makes out on the website. Do it!Walk times on the website and map are pretty accurate.Overall, an amazing amazing place, just follow the above tops to escape the crowds! "
Osaek Mineral Spring Trekking,"It's an awesome experience taking this Osaek route. last portion of it is only open this year. It has not been open to public for more than 50 years, I was told.The Journey would take easily 4 hours. The trek is not too difficult but it definetely need certain level of fitness. Path are rocky and uneven. Not advisable for young children. It is the peak season and there are thousands of local swarming this place. Many have a pit stop by the river for a picnic. Great majestic view of the mountain and beautiful Autumn foliage. Wear proper shoes, start in the morning, bring food and drinks. No toilet during the journey, bring selfie stick."
Highlight of our trip,"We have read in other comments and now we can confirm. Seoraksan NP is worth more than one day. We visited early fall just as the leaves started to change color. Despite it being a little rainy, the park was absolutely stunning. We hiked halfway up Daecheongbong peak. This is no hike for beginners. There is a well signposted path but it is largely made of big rocks, sometimes it is quite steep and when wet it can be slippery. However, we found it very rewarding. The path is made as such that you cross a little stream several times with bridges, it gives a different angle on the mountains each time.If we had two days, we would have hiked up to the peak, stayed there for the night and walked back the next day. Along the way there are no facilities. You can buy a little snack in the rest house (about 6.5km up) but it is best to bring food and water.We also took the cable car up the mountain. Again, despite the rain, there were stunning views over the park and Ulsanbawi. Just a tip for using the cable car. 50 people can go up per cable car. By the time we were at the front of the cue to buy a ticket (at 9AM), they were selling tickets for 3 hours later. So plan ahead when and if you want to use the cable car.We found the park a highlight in our trip!"
Nice place with scenery,"If you plan to go to Seoraksan National Park, better if it's not a windy day. I went there twice, once i could go up to the top of the mountain using cable car but then the second time because the wind is too strong so i can't go up. The scenery is very beautiful especially when autumn, cause the all of the trees turn red, orange and yellowish."
Take some time here if possible,"One of my greatest regrets about our recent trip to South Korea is that we were part of a tour group that ran through what was best about the country at high speed. The biggest casualty of this kind of insane, ticking-off-the-bucket-list form of travel unfortunately happened here at Mt. Seorak where we spent three hours nearly running from one part of the park to another getting a very slight and superficial feel for the place. What a waste of the experience. This is a place you want to spend a day or two at the very least to take it all in. Like Mt. Fuji or Yosemite there is iconic look about Mt. Seorak that will draw you in from far away. There are many hotels in the surrounding area with a good view of the mountain and I suggest to stay at one of those (we stayed at the Del Pino Resort) where you can sit and have breakfast or a drink and just look at the beautiful view of this mountain. Leave yourself a full day to go into the park and be sure to go early. Even on weekdays the National Park gets extremely crowded and theres a lot to see, including the Great Unification Buddha and the Sinheungsa Buddhist temple.If you decide to take the cable car to the top of the mountain, I would recommend not bothering to go all the way to the top once you get there. The best views are to be found on the main platform where you can have a beer and relax. The view from the top is nothing more than 100 other tourists taking selfies precariously close to the edge."
One day visit but really it is four days of hiking,We went to Ulsanbawi. It is considered a separate attraction on trip advisor but it is within the park. If you are an avid hiker plan for 4 days of hiking. I believe there are about 7 different summits to hike. We saw many people rock climbing Ulsan Rock but i am not sure of any restrictions. There are a lot of hotels within 15 minutes drive from the park. Parking was ￦5000. It is one of the most popular mountain ranges in South Korea. This is significant because Koreans love to hike. Visitors are of all ages and many of the hikers are older but I recommend ensuring you are healthy enough to hike if you are a senior. We went in the second weekend of October. The leaves are just beginning to change color. I suspect we were a week early. Regardless it is a must see if you can make it to Sokcho. Sokcho is a 4 hour drive from Seoul. 
Seoraksan Hiking,Going to the peak of seoraksan by cable car is good way to see the best view from the top. i would remember this trip forever.
Hiking to the peak,"What a spectacular hike. So worth it and relaxing. We started out Osaek which is not not in Sokcho but in Yang yang on the other side of the mountainamd worked our way towards the Seoraksan park entrance in sokcho through the day. This is a 16km hike. Osaek entrance to the Daecheongbong peak can take 4 hours to hike uphill. However we did it in a solid 3 hours 20 mins including short water breaks. Then we hiked downhill towards the entrance for the remainder of the day. The idea being to get to the peak in morning and take the rest of the day easy depending on how time was going and the terrain. We stayed at the Red house guesthouse near the entrance of the Seoraksan national park. The idea being that when we finished our hike we could just walk home and along the way we could stop for dinner at some of the restaurants in the area.We took a taxi to the Osaek entrance from our guesthouse at 5:45 a.m. we asked our guesthouse receptionist to give us a wake and also to call a taxi. They were very kind and work up at 5 a.m. to do so. We arrived at 6am at the entrance and started hiking at 6:20 just as the sun was rising. We reached the peak at 9:40 after 3 hours and 20 mins of hiking. We spent an hour at the top having breakfast and relaxing. On the way down we stopped at the numerous waterfalls and drinking spots along the way for a break. The hike could have easily taken us 9 hours with short stops however with our long and numerous stops to enjoy the scenery and splash in the waterfalls it took us 12 hours. This is one of the most beautiful hikes in Korea. It may not be the highest peak on korea but it is revered as thr most beautiful and 2nd highest peak on the mainland (outside of north Korea that is. The highest peak in the whole of the Korean peninsula is in North Korea.).Even if you cannot do the long hike id suggest doing the shorter hikes just to see the spectacular waterfalls and to soak your feet in them. ▲ Biryong Falls (1hr, 2.4km): Sogongwon → Yukdam Falls → Biryong Falls▲ Geumganggul Cave (2 hrs, 3.6km): Sogongwon → Waseondae → Biseondae → Geumganggul Cave▲ Baekdamsa Temple (1hr 30min, 6.5km): Baekdamsa Temple Hiking Support Center → Baekdamsa Temple▲ Daeseung Falls (40 min, 0.9km): Jangsudae → Daeseung Falls These are spectacular."
Gentrification of Seoraksan has pros and cons,"Seoraksan used to be a bustling place with many vendors going up and down the mountain. The vendors were older, selling homemade wine out of old vinegar bottles, or fried grasshoppers in tiny paper cups. The shops were a tiny bit dusty, but they also had water, soda, coffee, and snacks to help you on long hikes.But Seoraksan National Park went through some changes. 90% of the vendors are gone, and all of the rustic shacks have been torn apart and taken away. The National Park is building beautiful Hanok style houses and have added new hermitages up and down the mountain.For sure, the place is more beautiful than it used to be. It feels manicured to a perfect Korean stereotype-- of Buddhism, nature, and unique little houses. But all of this weighs heavy on me. There are no more Seoraksan souvenirs. Now, they are selling the same exact memories you can find in Insadong, Seoul or Namdaemun, Seoul. They even quit selling the hiking poles and boots.Probably the worst part is-- they have no water sellers on the mountain. While I was there for 5 hours I saw an emergency vehicle dispatched into the trails two times. You better bring enough water with you, it is am easy place to get dehydrated.The food is amazing though. You can buy it at the entrance of the park. I am both happy with the changes (its more beautiful) and saddned (no water on the mountain and no unique Seoraksan souvenirs).  I have been to this place 9 times. But most will go only once in their life. I realized on this last trip that the importance of Seoraksan is its natural beauty. The powerful mountains don't change, even though the people and commercialism around it will always change."
Breezy and good place for family,Would remember forever. Coverage was huge and photos took over here looks great! My families love this place!
Beautiful park,"We had a great time exploring Seoraksan National Park, such a beautiful park with a variety of different walks/hikes for all types of walkers. We only had one full day in Seoraksan so decided to do a few smaller walks instead of attempting to climb to the Daeseungnyeong summit. In the morning we went up in the cable car to Gwongeumseong Fortress, but the fog was so thick we really couldn't see much at all. So we headed back down the cable car and walked to Ulsan Bawi. Such a beautiful walk up and back, and fantastic views looking up at Ulsan Bawi and down the valley. Heundeul Bawi (unsteady rock) about half way up was pretty impressive - to think it's still balancing there after all this time!We then had lunch at one of the stalls near the entrance to the park. It was quite a cool day, so we welcomed the hot dumpling soup and seafood pancakes! They were delicious.We then headed to Biseondae and were blown away by the beauty of the crystal clear water and dramatic landscape. By the time we walked back, the cable car was still open and the fog had subsided so we caught it up to the top again and wow - the views were incredible!South Korea's natural beauty is so worth seeking out, it is breathtaking, especially at Seoraksan National park. All of the walks we did were easy, with very little hard walking and no steep parts. Even people with very little fitness could attempt them.I would highly recommend making the trek from Seoul to Sockcho, then to Seoraksan National Park. You absolutely won't regret it!Getting there: We got the 2.5 hour express bus to Sokcho from the Express Bus Terminal in Seoul. Then when in Sokcho, you can catch the local bus (from the opposite side of the road to the station), number 7 or 7-1 towards Seoraksan National Park (about 30 mins). I would also recommend staying as close as you can to the park - after a long day of walking the last thing you'll want to do is wait for public transport..."
"Great park, but expect a lot of people","The park is nice by layout. After the ticketcheck, before the bear statue , go inside the info building to get your english map with intresting points. Expect long waiting line if want to take the cable car."
Beautiful ,"Beautiful mountains, well paved, challenging trails. Too many rules (do not camp, do not swim, do not go off the path, do not smoke..) "
Enlightening ,I have visited many temples in Korea. All of them good. But this is something else above good. One of the most beautiful locations I have ever visited. And very friendly and welcoming to visitors foreign and korean. One very special secret. Under the giant buddha through a rear entrance is an underground temple. Such a privilege to see and pray. Seoraksan is a must visit.
Truly great national park!,"The whole park area is truly great! Just like the two other national parks i've visited in Korea so far (Halasan and Bukhansan) it is clean and kept in a good to great condition! The huge budda statue is really impressive! There are a couple of ancient monuments scattered near the entrance which are really nice to look at. Hiking in the national park is fun, even in the rain! Make sure to bring some food and water since prices are higher than usual (as it's the case in all national parks)."
Fall colours at Mt Seoraksan,"We had been to Mt Seoraksan during autumn. Beautiful national park. Took us a long bus ride from Seoul. We climbed, took the cable car, crossed the river to the temple, roamed around the mountain paths, had a wonderful coffee (not to be missed). Leave from seoul as early as possible to make the most of the day and beat the crowd."
Beautiful mountain view...,Visited in autumn season last november...too pity that the weather was raining all day...but I can still amazed by the beautiful view. Feel very lucky that the cable car operated normally.
Lovely place to be in the fall,This is a place I miss dearly when I left South Korea. In the fall the vibrant colors of the fall foliage is a memory embedded in my mind.
Good for one day hang around,"Very Good for its natural beauty, be prepare for trekking if you watch the beauty of the park. Enjoy cable car ride also"
Need more time to explore,"We went with a group tour, so our visit was short. Took the cable car up to the 700 meters elevation, and from there about 15 minutes upward trail with steps to the lookout. The view was amazing, although this was not the peak yet. The peak is still up to 1700 meters they say, so we were less than halfway to the peak. Anyway, the view was worth the climb. Going back to the bottom we visited the Grand Bronze Buddha statue, which was huge."
Lot to explore,"If you are in south Korea and you haven't been here, you have not seen the amazing nature of Korea. place with a variety of courses to choose from."
Amazing,Did three walks and the cable car here. Loved it all. The tracks are well marked and maintained. The scenery delightful. The cable car only had a small queue the day we went and it was a picturesque ride to the top. An enjoyable and good workout day!
Great visit to a national treasure,If you like bush walking this is the place to visit. Serviced by the 7 series buses as well as usual cabs the park is about 10 minutes from town. We did two walks in one day plus the cable car and thoroughly enjoyed the occasion. Walks are graded from easy to strenuous so choose depending on your fitness level. Suggest you go to the peak in the cable car early to avoid fog setting in.
Amazing Park,This park have an amazing scenery. A Great bronze Budha Statue inside the park. You can also used cable car to Gwonggeumsong Fortress. Just follow the small climbers road to reach mountain peak. You can see a beautiful scenery on the mountain peak.
Great hike with scenic views of nature and the town,"This place is great for hikers with little experience. I took a route from yangyang to daebongchang peak, which took 5km and about three to four hours.Reaching the peak, seeing the great views at the top and coming down to the normal tourist information center at sokcho.The hike is simple enough to complete, no techniques required, but it is quite an endurance test. This route took 15km and almost ten hours.With that said, I had beginners in the group. So the trail is manageable, but it will be good to have hiked at least once before this. My friends who did bukhansan the previous week were well able to cope with the hike. The hike from the peak to sokcho was great as you hike in the valley next to the river for most of the way and you will see the great hills. Very well preserved trails as well. However, the last portion going to the peak is very steep and it took a long time to complete just 1.3km. Be preparedFood wise, the rest shelters sell chocolate, canned coffee, instant rice and ramen. But they don't cook it for you, so bring up your own stove if you want to have some delicious ramen. They sell gas for the stoves up there."
Highlight of Korea,"Amazing park. Stunning hikes and scenery. Spend two days which is probably the minimum time you need in the area to really enjoy it. Did the hike to Guemgangul cave (it is tough but short - about 2-3 hours return from visitor centre), also did the climb to Ulsanbawi rock (again very steep, 3 hours return). It is a killer in the heat/humidity - take water and start early. Well worth it though and bot quite different. The shorter easy hike to Biryeong falls also worthwhile. For the cable car - come early and go up before the millions arrive around 10am.Good food options too and amazing coffee. The highlight of my Korea trip"
Beautiful!,"This park is accessible, beautifully maintained, and expansive. Could spend a week exploring here! We hiked to the boulder peak (I forget the name, forgive me) and while quite strenuous, it was one of the most gratifying hikes of my life!"
"Discovered hiking in Korea is different, in a good way","It's been a few years since I've been there. I don't recommend staying at the hotel in the park---it's old and run down, but it is convenient. We went on a few of the easy hikes. While my family of 4 had no problem with them, it would be challenging for those who are less able-bodied. They had installed metal stairways to help you hike up the mountain. But there were times where we wished we were wearing real hiking boots, as the footing could be slippery or unstable. Along the hike, there were rest stop villages that sold food, beer, etc. Definitely makes hiking more entertaining!"
awesome hike and view,Ride the cable car and take the hike up to the rocks. Great views - make sure you were comfortable shoes and take a bottle of water. Kids had a great time
Mt. Seoraksan National Park,"The park is located in the north-east part of South Korea. Seoraksan National park was designated as a nature preservation area on November 5, 1965, The total area of Seoraksan National park is 398.539km and has a total of 30 imposing peaks spread across its area. There are over 2,000 animal species live in the park, including the Korea goral and Musk deer as well, there are also more than 1,400 rare plant species, such as the Edelweiss. From inside the park one can access the Gwonkeumseong Fortress (via cable car) and the Shinheungsa Temple. We were there in April with a clear sky and the cherry blossoms were in bloom."
Nice place to visit,"This is my second time to visit this place. Anytime go there I feel fresh my mind, very clean air, take the cable car and walk some steps to reach the top view. Highly recommended place to visit in Sokcho"
Beautiful place,Seoraksan National Park is a beautiful place to explore while you are in Sokcho city. It is fairly easy to get there by bus from Sokcho. We just got on the bus that stopped near the hostel we were staying at. The park is the last stop so you won't miss it. We got in line to go on the cable car that took us to the top of the mountain and the views were gorgeous. Make sure not to miss this.
Perfect for nature lovers,"Located on the East side of Korea, the Seoraksan is a retreat of pristine nature and breathtaking scenery.Is highly recommended for hikers and nature lovers.Besides the visitor centers at the main entrances of the park, there are many other infrastructures to support the visitors - hotels, restaurants, man-made paths, toilets and so on."
Spectacular view,I am from SF and visited and climbed Japan Australia and USA. Seorak definitely has a world famous spectacular view. dont forget to ride the cable car and visit the temple. biryong waterfall is worth to visit(one way about 1 hr) my 4 year old made it to the waterfall as well. Bravo my son
Beautiful. We love it!,SO beautiful. and the place is SO big. We took the town bus to Mt Sorak. Its very easy to take the bus# 7-1 from the Sokcho intercity bus terminal. We didn't have much time to hike so we just took the cable car to the top then walk to the peak. The view is SO beautiful up there. It must be very beautiful it if snows. We will definitely come back!
Cable car to Gwonkeumseong Fortress,"Lovely area to spend a few hours. Designated a UNESCO Biosphere Preservation District in 1982, it is Korea's most famous national park. The Shinheungsa Temple is beautifully painted, and the walks around the park are beautiful. The cable car to view the beautiful natural landscape is definitely worth doing! Walking along the side of the stream, under the canopy of trees on a warm day was so relaxing. We enjoyed our visit and could have spent longer there."
"Wow, just wow.",The views were spectacular. We really enjoyed hiking and just sitting beside a mountain stream ipenjoying some quiet time. This is a must see if you are in the area.
A really beautiful place,"For a one day visit, the trip was pretty long but totally worth it in the end. We went in the middle of May and it was scorching and rather busy for a weekday, I could only imagine what it would be like at the weekend. There wasn't a lot of detailed information on how to get to Seoraksan from Seoul, so I thought I'd share our trip for those who want more info.We took the Seoul Subway Line 2 (green line) to Gangbyeon Station, which about 20 odd minutes from Chungmuro Station (near our hotel). Go down the stairs and take exit 4, Dong Seoul Bus Terminal is directly opposite the Station. Go up the escalator to the second floor (for the Express Bus), at the counter ask to go to Sokcho. It cost us 17,200 won each and they don't do a return ticket, you would have to buy a ticket back to Seoul at Sokcho Express Bus terminal. We took the 7:00 am Bus, I'm not 100% sure on the bus frequency but I have heard it's about every 60 minutes... but if your only doing a day trip, I would advise to go as early as you can because the Express bus ride takes about 3 hours (including a 15 minute rest). Once you arrive at Sokcho Express Bus terminal, you must cross the street (you would have to turn right from the terminal and further up is a pedestrian crossing) to get to the bus stop. (There is a tourist information centre on the left side of the bus terminal, where we got a tourist map and the lady there spoke quite good English). You would then need to take bus number 7 or 7-1 (we happened to catch no. 7), bus fare was 1,200 won. The ride took about 45 minutes. I got a little worried on when to get off but most of the people on the bus all got off at the same time and the driver kept saying Seoraksan. The park was about 3,500 won each. We also took the cable car up to the mountain but I can't remember how much it cost. The views were spectacular, there were no ropes or barriers to stop you from climbing anywhere. The route to the waterfall was also beautiful, I think I lost a few pounds that day."
So beautiful,"Many trails to explore. I went for 2 days in a row to try out different trails. A mix of easy to tedious trails. Also some of them are wheelchair accessible, which makes it good for families."
Best hiking place,When we went there a lot of seniors hiked in groups. It was said it is where the origin of korean people came from. Half gods and half bear. There is cable car for those who dont hike to get to the top. There is also the biggest budhist statue and classic korea temple. A sparkling clear river and typical korea mountain and vegetations. Tips: best season to go there is at fall
Beautiful with lots of hiking options,"This was the first hiking our family did in Korea so we did not know what to expect. We were pleasantly surprised. The trail maps were easy to follow because there is ample english signage on the trails. The map available at the info center (or online) will show you the difficulty levels. The staff member at the info center spoke English well and was very helpful. We are a family with 2 kids, both aged 5, and we hiked the trail to Biseondae rocks. A little over half of it is paved an could be done with a stroller (all-terrain strollers would be best though since it's not flat). Then it turns rocky. Our 5 year olds had no problem with it as we just held their hands if it got slippery. It was very pretty with plenty of places one could rest. There were no spots on this trail at which I worried my kids would fall off the trail, just some areas of incline/decline that were slippery because we only had sneakers. Near the entrance the park has many restaurants and cafes with the usual popular Korean food, pizza, chicken nuggets (not sure if these were spicy though), ice cream, waffles, and more. I recommend doing the cable car in the morning. We went in the late afternoon and the sun messed up our photos on the top as it backlit the mountains. To get to the top park you walk up stairs, so that part is easy, but then you're on a fairly large rocky area that has some steep drop-offs, so hold tight to your kids if they're young! The view was fantastic though."
Beautiful,"Beautiful National Park. I would recommend going early. If you want to do cable car, buy those tickets first. Tickets are sold by times and they sell out very quickly. "
Nice view,"One of my favourite place to visit. A bit of effort if you are travelling using public transportation as it is located outside major hub, and the information in English is not quite clear. Nevertheless, the place is really great. It could caters even if you are not a mountain person. A sky train is available to carry to a nice vantage point. From there a bit of walking is required, if you want to get to the top. "
Beautiful Area,"The whole park is immense so you could spend a whole day here, particularly in clement weather however even if you only have a few hours you can enjoy wandering around and seeing not only the natural environment but the beautiful well maintained Buddhist temples. In fact the whole area is immaculately clean and well maintained."
"Worth a days visit - cable car, temple and hike","We went for Seoraksan for 3 reasonsTemple - nice, and easy to walk round, also quite actively expanding quarters of monks and decoratingCablecar - up and hike to top for another 5 minutes - nice view - but you ar e onot alone. See picture. We hiked up a separate path to see the waterfalls. This was all steps and builtout with handrails. 2h round trip, tiring but worth, while waterfall was invisible. In between the facilities are great and offer for a coffee and a lunch break if needed."
"If you want to explore more, go in Summer time and spend more time there","Seoraksan National Park is really huge, bet you can't really explore the whole park in just 1 day, when the time we were there, it was snowing the day before, so the whole park is covered in snow, it's really pretty but it's not that good for a walk or trek, but we managed to trekked for 2 hours to Ulsanbawi Rock.Recommended for senior or family with kids to take the cable car, otherwise, it can be tough for them to walk around the park."
A Must See,"A beautiful park, there is both free parking and paid parking ( paid parking saves you the walk ). After seeing the the old temples in the park you can take the tram that goes to the top of the mountain with a nice view of the cities and ocean in the distance. The tram is 10000won and to get in the park was 3500won."
Hikers heaven,"A very beautiful park. You can spend days in this park hiking. Some very arduous trails. Take a cable car part way up the mountain for some awesome views of other peaks and valleys. You can hike farther up the mountain. I didn't being a trifle unfit. Koreans love to hike so they are all over the many trails. If you like to hike, this is a great place. "
A beyond of my expectation trip,"I've seen some pictures of this place from internet and friends. I decided to come to Seoraksan even im aware will took more than 3 hours from Seoul. Once we arrived at sokcho terminal, there's some challenges as they don't speak English, however, peoples there was really helpful and friendly. They always try to explain as much as they can, we do really appreciate them.I really love the park, and it's not crowded, even for the cable car. When i arrived at the top, the view is super amazing, so beautiful, the unbeatable panorama. And i felt the snow for the first time in my life!I love this place, i love this experience, definitely will return here in another season.You will never regret!"
Full day walk,"We walked the main trail from Darian. Signs were very clear, many of them were also in English, which was convenient for us as we cannot read Korean. It was a though walk up, with not so much to see. Once on the peak you get a nice view over mountains, however it was a bit cloudy so we couldn't see very far. You can get spring water at the resting point. Bring enough food so you have the energy to walk all the way up."
Beautiful but challenging hike,"Hiking in Seoraksan was probably my favorite thing to do in Korea, and the one activity that gives you a feel for the country. Hiking is a national pastime in Korea, so go during the week to avoid the crowds."
Beauty,"Visit Mt.Seorak is one of my to do list during my South Korea Trip. It was early march when i was visit Mt. Seorak, still cold but once i reach the peak it was warm and pleased with a beautiful scenery. There are 2 ways to get to.the peak. Take a cable car for 10 minutes or take a walk for 3 hours. It was very easy to travel to MT.Seorak from Seoul. I did in 1 day trip and it was unforgetable. "
Must be fit,"This mountain is absolutely beautiful! It's a tough hike, though, so fitness is a must. I recommend staying at the jjimjilbang and sleeping in the sauna for the night after your hike!Allow a day to travel there (from Seoul or Busan), at least a day to hike and a third day to travel back (three days, two nights minimum).Make sure to wear good shoes, comfortable clothes, and take water, energy snacks, and your camera!!"
A must visit place in Korea,We took a cable car to the top of mount Seorak. The scenery here is very very beautiful. We can see North Korea from this peak. The mountain river is amazing with crystal clear water and small stone along the river. 
Hiking dream,We visited Sokcho for 2 nights. Just for hiking. Such a wonderful hiking area. There are several different trails depending on your skill level. From beginner to professional. You can even skip the hike up & take a cable car. Breathtaking views.I suggest coming during weekdays when it's less crowded. 
Fantastic view,Came here during snow. The mountains were covered with snow and the view is breath taking.While walking you can admire the weather and the view which is fantastic!
 breathtaking view,"After go on top using the skyline, Prepare yourself for a little hike if you want to see the top, it was very slippery during autumn so becareful and wear proper shoesYou also can find big buddha statue in seoraksan complex, if you are buddhist, you can pray and buy souvenirs and 10kgs of rice there for praying? (Or else, i kinda forgot)"
Good for those who loves hiking,I am the height freak type. Hiking up this mountain is not first time to me. They have a very good trail..its all with ladder up to the peak. The view is fascinating at the top. You have 2 option either to climb or take the cable car up to the peak..But for me definitely climbing up is the best option to choose. Yeah i made it with smile..Thanks to my friend Amar!!
Amazing view,Amazing view!! Great mountain. Cool air. Love this place. But be careful it is a bit slippery. Hop on the cable car for more fun. There is also a Buddha temple. Big and nice.
"Unbeatable mountain views and hikes, and facilities","Only 10 miles from the ocean, the park allows for great mountain hiking to waterfalls, viewpoints, streams... and it is justly visited by thousands of Koreans every month. Be sure to take the cable-car. The hike up to Biryeong waterfall is steep, but beautiful. This park is lovely in every season, quite a national treasure."
Magnificent mountains,"As with the Sinheungsa Temple complex, some signs were in English but it would help if there were some staff with a little English. The scenery is beautiful, especially from the lookout that you get to by cable car. It would be a magnificent place to cisit at any time of year."
Beautiful National Park of Seoraksan,"Mount Sorak is one of the Famous spot in Korea for tourism Object. This Object is a National Park. Here we can go to the top of seorak mountain by the cable car and we can enjoy the scenery, the atmosphere at seorak mountain. Here we also can get a medal if we can go up to the South Korea Flag. But be careful while you are up there because there is no safety line near the mountain."
Beautiful Scenery,An excursion trip on one cold and windy day during winter. The cable car was not in operational due to strong winds. Hiking also was out of question. Had to do with a walk around the entrance. Enjoyed a cup of freshly brewed Othaya Coffee..
Beautiful scenery and a nice hike,Luckily we went there when the weather was nice and not overly cold. A beautiful scenery at the top of the mountain. We went there with Chris Lee (tour guide) and he told us the history of another mountain (i think the name was Ulsan) about beauty pageant and stuff! Tip : use a shoes that is good for trekking! As it is so slippery especially on winter! Beware of fallen leaves as they are slippery as well.
"Natural, spacious and not crowded",Nice walk into Mount Sorak and there are several eateries near the main entrance. About 400m away. Tried some of the food and it is pretty nice. There are many streams and trails that you could see further up. Nice for a day walk up if you are early.
"Peaceful, safe for solo trekking ","Visited the park during a solo trip to Korea in Autumn (oct). The weather was perfect to trek. I went up the Heundeulbawi route and sat atop the rocks for a good hour, just relaxing and taking in the view. Do start trekking early, especially on weekends, as the school and tour groups start streaming in at about 9-10am, and may create a slow moving traffic along the route. "
