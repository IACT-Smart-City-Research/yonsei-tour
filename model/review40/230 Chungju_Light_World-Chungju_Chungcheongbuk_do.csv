Interesting tourist place with light,"This is a new tourist spot from what I was told. It was quite a unique interesting place with lots of world iconic statues with lights. Unfortunately, the Mgmt did not switch on the lights for every display. A few of them was turn off. But it was still a quite an eye-opener. Worth a trip there after sundown."
"Fantastic, will take your breath away",Visited while doing the Seoul to Busan bicycle trail. The Italian cathedral is very impressive. Lots of other representations from around the world.
