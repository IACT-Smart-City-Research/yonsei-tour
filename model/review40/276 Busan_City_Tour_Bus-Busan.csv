Practical and beautiful way to see the city,"Busan City Tour Bus in South Korea is a great public transportation facility that allows easy connections between important Busan attractions, for example, UN Memorial Park, Centum City, Haeundae Beach and more. Double-decker buses pass through Busan Harbor Bridge and Gwangan Bridge; drivers do speak English and there is an English commentary on the routes. You can change lines and the timetable is pretty convenient.One-day pass cost 15,000W. Please have in mind that there is no service on Monday unless it is a public holiday"
A way to see the city,Well put aside there is no English commentary and we were left stranded near the Songdo Beach Skywalk because the last hoho bus is something past 3!!! It was ok. At least you got to see some parts of the city you wouldn’t otherwise go to.
????,"I usually go explore by myself cities. unfortunately , as I don’t have enough time in Busan , I chose the bus tour , during the tour that lasted 7h, I stayed waiting the bus 4 hours (2/3 of the time), i chose only 3 stops, as I refrained myself for doing more because of my fear to waste more time, no explanations given concerning the delays, moreover, do not expect any explanations in english concerning the visited place "
If your time is limited this is the tour to take,"We only had less than a day to visit Busan so this was the way to get a feel for the city. It's also very inexpensive. However, if one wants to visit the Haedong Yonggunsa Temple you will need a transfer and allow a lot of time. Overall, well worth the money albeit English is not widely spoken on the commentary which is by video. ."
inexpensive and easy,Buses go everywhere and you can get on and off whenever and wherever you wanted. The schedule was easy to read and buses were timely.
An enjoyable day,"A good day tour with plenty of time at each stop.However, it was let down by one of the stops being cancelled due to weather meaning that the train at the venue didn't run. This stop was replaced with a 2 hour stop at a shopping mall! It stopped raining by 12noon so I feel that if the sequence of stops had been changed, we would have seen all four stops.If we had not a found a lovely friendly restaurant at the shopping mall and had a fantastic early lunch, we would have been very bored. Shopping is not what we signed up for and I cannot see any mention of this alternative venue in the event of inclement weather."
English speakers at a handicap,We started our tour at Busan Station which was a stop for both the Red and Blue lines but the buses stationed there were not clearly marked and the drivers of the buses initially gave conflicting information as to which line they were going to take. Fortunately this problem did not continue as the buses and stops for the rest of this hop-on-hop-off tour clearly indicated which line they took. The upper deck of the buses we took on this tour were all a bit tatty. The aircon in the enclosed part of the upper deck did not work and our ride was very uncomfortable in the hot weather. The drivers did not speak English and the on-board video ran in Korean only. There was an audio guide device in each seat without any user notes on how to use it. This is more an economic bus ride to get your orientation on your first visit to Busan than a guided bus tour of a standard on par in other cosmopolitan cities like London and Paris.
A brief stop in Busam,We only had a few days in Busan and took the Hop on Bus for a quick overview.It ecceeded our expectations.There are 4 routes which merge which makes it easy to jump straight of one bus and onto another or take a 25 minute break to visit an attraction your choice.Only problem is that there is no English commentary.
Stops running early,"Used the BUTI tour on our first day in Busan, with the idea of catching our bearings on the city and it’s highlights. While the routes do visit those, there is no English explanation and the last bus is around 1700, which in our experience is relatively early. Tickets are for the day itself only, not valid for 24 hours, making it even more important to get on early or consider alternative options such as a combination of public bus and subway. We went during a weekend, full of locals also going around so we needed to stay in line for about 1:15min. As the bus was full it was better to stay onboard as getting out and in at short stops wouldn’t work. "
Great Way to See Busan in a Day ,"The Busan City Tour Bus is their version of ‘Hop On Hop Off’. A multi-coloured bus route consisting of Red (most popular), Blue, Green and Yellow at 15,000 won for a Day Pass (a discount is available when you show your SRT train ticket, Air Busan flight ticket or your International Cruise Boarding Pass) travelling to many popular places. Pay the driver to get a wrist band. Unfortunately, I was in Busan for the day and didn’t take the looped tour bus until the afternoon. I only saw the Haedong Yonggungsa temple. Take the red line route to stop #9 (Haeundae Beach) & transfer onto the Blue line to get off at stop #6.The red bus starts near the main Busan train station. TIPS: push the button to get off at the stop and take the night tour. Overall it’s a great way to experience Busan in one day. The only disadvantage is that there is no audio on board. "
Comfortable and convenient Busan City Tour Jumbo Bus,Excellent tourist route. Plan you time carefully and you will get to see the key tourist spots of Busan. It is a one straight forward route . Convenient and value for money.Highly recommended.
Highly recommend this ,"Great value for money. I spent 15000KW to see everything I needed to in Busan. I’d recommend this trip for people strapped for time, but wanting to see it all. For the price I literally only spent 1000 to take the train at Taejongdae Park. As the entrance to all the other places were free. Even for tourists. 12 stops which is so worth it. I’d recommend going early as you’ll most likely want to spend quite some time at Songdo beach, taejongdae park, Oryukdo Island and Biff square. Worth every penny. 10/10"
Full-day Busan city tour,"Excellent trip seeing the key spots of Busan. Just enough time at each sight. Very kind and helpful guides, and interesting facts of history. A great day!"
Busan city tour jumbo bus ,Was wonderful and amazing tour comfortable bus and nice driver Busan city beautiful and amazing I recommend everyone to visit Busan 
Lacking,"The most disappointing aspect of this tour is that it does not operate on Mondays, which was incredibly inconvenient.The other major issue is that the information provided is sparse and basic. There are prolonged periods where no information is given. The descriptions are also ridiculous, such as the promise of experiencing ecstasy when looking out at the ocean.It is really only useful for getting to points around the city which are not easily accessible by subway.I’ve been on tones of hop on and hop off tours. This would rate as one of the worst"
Could have been better,"It was a nice trip, but reduced one point for absence of audio guides on board. Bus at times goes too fast"
Perfect for traveling around Busan,"This is a hop off and on city bus kind of service. At 15,000w per adult, you get to go to many places in Busan! It was especially helpful for me because my hotel happened to be quite far from the city like Nampo... and the city bus takes me right there! With this price, it’s very worth it considering the fact that you’re unfamiliar with the place and taxi can be quite pricey. The bus guide speaks simple English and are very friendly. To purchase the tickets, you just have to pay the driver upon boarding and get your all day pass bracelet that you just have to flash upon boarding as and when throughout the day. Highly recommended."
"Great for tourists, just don’t go on a rainy day","This is a very efficient mode to see and experience Busan. The route was well-designed and at 15,000 kwr I think it’s great value. However, I took this trip on a raining day so the Danui train at Taejongdae Park wasn’t in operation making the visit to this highlight difficult. Also the Oryukdo sky walk was closed on a rainy day. As most of the views will be appreciated with some outdoor walking, I find that you would get most out of this trip on a non-rainy day."
Korean Holiday,"Since our time in Busan was limited, we settled on the adorable hop-on-hop-off bus, which is the most popular transportation to travel within Busan recently! Among this loop tour, we'll pass through many popular scenic spots. We took the tour bus and visit all the famous spots in Busan. With three different loop tour routes, we were sure to have an unforgettable vacation. We purchased the one day pass, which allowed us to travel on of the hop-on-hop-off routes. All buses depart from Busan Station. The red line bus, Busan Station and Haeundae direction, blue line Haeundae and Yonggungsa direction, green line Oryukdo Islands and Hwangryeongsan Mt. direction, and yellow line Haedong Yonggung Temple and Gijang Market."
Simple way to see the main attractions of Busan,"The Bus station is located just a few steps away from Exit 1 of Busan KTX station. First bus depart at 9:30am which I took & sat on the upper deck for a great view of the ride! There are 2 different bus : BUTI (white bus) & Jumbo (red bus). I took the BUTI bus as I find that it covers more interesting places vs jumbo bus. However, announcement of stops are only on the screen & the commentary of the places are only in Korean. So if you are sitting far away from the screen, take note of the number of stops.A great way to hop on & off without having to search for the attractions"
Nice tour of the city,"Catch the bus in front of Busan Station for a trip that includes the high points of the city. The buses run all day except for non-national holiday Sundays, so you can stay on the bus and ride the circuit or get off at a point of particular interest to you and catch a later bus back to the pickup point. It costs the equivalent of about 15 dollars and is well worth it. Narration is in Korean and English. It's probably the best way to see the city while relaxing and leaving the driving to someone else."
"Inexpensive and informative, great way to see Busan","Conveniently located near main train station and boat terminal. Inexpensive and very comfortable buses, English commentary was very good and informative. A great way to see all the major sites in Busan. Stops are well marked when you hop on and off and the timetable allows you enough time to see each place without being too rushed."
Worth the money. Must do the city tour in Busan,"With half a day to spare, I decided to take the Busan City Tour that cost 15,000 won after we had lunch. The tour starts at Busan station. I only drop off at Oryukdo Island (Skywalk), Songdo Beach and BIFF Square. We tried the street foods at BIFF. "
took us to the must-see spots,good as a lazy-day-activity. bus spots all the places in the inner city you need to see. it is a hop-on-hop-off-deal and so we were able to take a closer look at some spots (like freedom park etc).
Worth the money,"There are 2 kinds of busan city tour, the red bus cost 15k won, and it is a hop on and hop off bus, so you can see many places, and if you add 5k won after your red bus tour, the buti bus goes the opposite direction of the red bus city tour route, so for 20k won, you can already see almost all the tourist spots of busan, so it is worth getting this tour."
Sight seeing,"Initially it was tough to figure out how to see Busan in a day but all recommended the city hop on hop off called Buti.. starting at 9.30 till 6.30..it was fantastic ,though we misunderstood the last bus stop at the Busan station was 4.30 and we had to go to the other side we thought we would have to take a taxi back to the hotel and end up spending more , the driver realised our delimma and explained how we could get on the local bus and get there so easily with our tmoney card..so sweet of him to guide us to the stop and bus number"
Quick way to have an overview of the city,We were there in early summer. There are two different companies that provide this service. We took the Jumbo City Tour Bus that is red in colour. The positives. The buses were super punctual. The air-con works. The buses were not full. We had free wifi on board. Brochures were a plenty. Recorded announcements of coming stops were in Korean and English. Drivers were courteous and friendly. The negative IS the driver do not speak a word of English. A tip. Plan ahead where you want to go and with the brochure show the driver where you want to stop when you board the bus. The driver will remember even if you do not press the bell.
Not a mindblowing experience but..,"...a very pleasant drive around that extented city, at a cheap cost, and with impressive views to the the harbour and shipyards. We did not bother with the several attractions visited along the way (they seemed of little interest) but rather ""enjoyed the ride and company. ""Any inquiries made with the drivers are pointless, as they don't speak a single word of any foreign language (a Korean trademark!!)"
The Worse Hop-On Hop-Off Ever,"Awful, awful, awful!!! I travel a lot and often take the hop-on, hop-off buses to get an orientation of a new city before exploring areas independently and this has got to be the worse one yet. So bad that I decided to abandoned the bus less than half way though. They encourage you to download their Buti Bus app, which I did, but it was completely useless as it needs to be connected to the internet to be able to work and the free wifi they say is available on the bus does not exist!The only information given about the tour’s destinations is given in Korean so you are on your own to find out anything about them - now only if they had that free wifi they advertised! So you have to put up with not knowing anything about the stops along the way as well as having to listen to the annoying, non-stop recorded voice of information being given in Korean. The bus leaves from near Busan Station Square (don’t expect any sign posts to help you find the location though). If you have picked up a brochure from your hotel beforehand it informs you the bus’ departure point is in front of Arirang Hotel. Very helpful information you think until you have wandered around in the 36°C (96°F) heat searching for the aforementioned Arirang hotel only to discover that it does not exist (it was demolished some time ago). The buses run every 30 mins and our bus was full and had to leave people behind in the scorching sun to wait for the next bus. The seats onboard are pretty small and uncomfortable but that’s usually par for the course on these kinds of buses. The ‘air conditioning’ felt more like a fan than air conditioning as the air being blown could not be described as cool but it was better than nothing in the extreme heat. As the bus was completely full, it put me off getting off any stops as I was afraid I would not be able to get back on another one as that would likely be full too. Whenever a passenger got off the bus their seat was quickly taken by a new passenger and at times the aisles were full of standing passengers as there were no more seats available. I noticed many of the bus stops had no shade which would have meant waiting for the next bus would have been unbearable. Everyone onboard was already sweating profusely in the ‘air conditioned’ heat, provided paper fans waving relentlessly. It was over two hours since we had set off by the time we had reached the 6th stop and I couldn’t take any more and decided to get off and travel round by metro/subway. That was by far the best decision I had had made that day."
For Koreans,"Important information is given in Korean only. The blue line suddenly turns to red line in Bexco! Not so clear in the information material. Indeed very convenient covering the main points and cheap and as it has air conditioning, it is used by local as transportation. The blue line and yellow line are more interesting. "
Gets the key tourist spots right on target ,Remember there were 12 stops for this city tour. Affordable and an easy way to explore the main tourism spots at a leisurely pace.
Good Transport Mode,It's a good way to travel around Busan and understanding the famous area where crowd likes to hang around.It can even bring you to Haeundae beach area.
The best mode of transport around Busan,Some areas in Busan may be difficult to get to. The city tour bus is an affordable way to move around and cover as many attractions as possible. The bus comes frequently at 25 min interval.
BUTI ,"the tour bus has app that has routes and times. I was looking where the stops were since I thought I could hop it near my hotel. I could not find a route with a map online but the tour bus had an office in the Busan station (behind dunkin donuts in main plaza on 2nd floor) that has a pamphlet with a map of city and its stops with description and picture of attractions. I bought my ticket on TripAdvisor, cheaper with USD rate, and showed voucher that was on my cellphone to bus tour office. u could also pay in won to driver at the bus that is located on corner of busan station where all taxis are lined up. cost is 13,000 won about $11 depending on rate. there is alot to see, could not see all places in one day. I took bus at busan station, then switched bused at stop 4- Yonghoman Sightseeing Boat Terminal, to green line to Oryukdo Islets. this is an awesome stop with a skywalk. The buses run every 30 mins, so I tried to quickly explore. you could also take your time and go to Igidae coastal walk but that will be half your day. I took bus again up to stop 4 and switched back to red line bus to Gwangalli Beach where you can see Gwangandaegyo Bridge, short stop with little attraction. next stop I took was stop 8-Dongbaek Island. Great views and park like Oryukdo. you can walk your way through park and see Nurimari APEC House, then the mermaid sculpture, and then Haeundae Park where I caught blue bus to Haedong Yonggunsa Temple (hidden pass Fisheries Science Museum). I took last bus and had to switch to red line back to Busan Station. if I had more time I would have explored Moontan road, Songjeong Beach, Peace Park or take themed tour for other places. "
Big bus is a waste of money,Got on bus at stop 4 with intent to return to stop 4. Trip had very little info in English about stops or where to go from stops. Ask driver? Forget it.. they don't speak English. Asked if there was another stop further that was closer to where I was going and was told yes. Next stop was 2 miles and I missed where I wanted to go. Got back to stop one and had to wait 30 minutes at the stop before bus continued on again.
Great way to experience most of Busan in a day,"This is a great way to spend the day visiting the city. There are several courses to choose from, but the red line seems the best course to see most of the major landmarks in Busan. The buses were on time for the most part, with some delays but it's worthwhile to purchase a one day ticket to get around. Bus runs all day until about 6-7 pm, but stopping at only 3-4 stops would require at least 3 hours so best to start the tour early.The driver describes each place along the way but too bad they only spoke in Korean, which doesn't make much sense as most of the passengers are non-Korean tourists. If the drivers can't speak English, perhaps a pre-recording explaining each of the places would be helpful. There is a touch screen by the seat though that you could use to read the descriptions of the places in English on your own."
Trip To Busan From Seoul,"Being for the first time in Busan, I took KTX Train as early as 8.00 am and reach Busan at 10.35pm...Rushing towards information counter... Requesting on Hop in Hop Off schedule... I was told that the services off on Monday. Well as an alternative... I just took a public bus no. 1003 where major tourist attraction are covered within this line. Check your itinerary and confirm with the locals... About the services rendered.... "
Sightseeing ,"Reasonably priced, about $15, there are three routes that interlink with each other, from the most extreme points its about an hour and a quarter, the views are terrific as you cross the bridge out of Busan, on the way back in to town, ask your driver to drop you off at the nearest stop to the fish market, worth a visit. "
Buti tour bus,"The tours run on 4 loops - red, blue, yellow and a little off-shoot green line. An all day wrist band costs 15,000₩ (you can buy it on the bus) and you can hop on and off where ever you like and change between loops. It was a sunny spring day when I went so I followed the blue and yellow loops round Haeundae so I could be outside all day by the sea on trails, at lighthouses and temples (everything was free) - fantastic way to spend the day. The drivers were very courteous and spoke a little essential English. The only thing is to keep an eye on the timetable - there are about 10-12 buses a day at most stops but the last one leaves quite early, around 16.30 - 17.00, so if you want to pack a lot in its best to go for an early start in the morning."
punctual,the bus is always on time... the coverage of the tour is comprehensive - youll get to see Busan in its entirety for a day! good drivers and very kind! they even give outright discounts if you ask( a group of 6 grown up guys asked for discount and they were made to pay kids ticket which is about 50% less).
Slow,"So we only had a day in Busan and decided what better way to see the city than the hop on hop off City Bus Tour. It’s probably the best option if you want to go see Haedong Yonggungsa. If you are manly there for the city/ beaches just take the metro. The tour costs 15000₩ per person so it’s not all that cheap, the buses are always late, and the drivers are not that good ( if you get car sick you may want to avoid ) and it’s pretty slow going if you only have a day. One thing that’s good is you get to see the city and fantastic views from the bridges that you would not on the metro."
Wish the commentary was in English,"Though it was a good bus trip around the city, and there were three lines/routes to choose from, I just wish the commentary was bilingual. Everything was in Korean, and there was nothing we understood from its commentary. "
"No seat, no English","First the good things. The buses run on time and do go to most of Busan's main tourist sites. Unfortunately there simply aren't enough buses. The result is a wait of up to 30 minutes for a bus that will be standing room only. A couple were so full that waiting people had to continue to wait for the next bus. On the most overcrowded bus the driver seemed determined to throw it round corners and brake hard. Leaving the people standing to hang on for dear life. I predict that one day we will be reading about some horrible high fatality tour bus accident in Busan.Drivers didn't use the a/c so the windows were constantly steamed up. Not much use for a bus tour, if you can't see out or understand the commentary, you may as well take the metro round the city. The only available guide brochure was only in Korean. The tour guide on the bus spoke only in Korean. The only English was a timetable and a display of the stop names. Bearing in mind this was a cold Saturday in January, and the buses were so overcrowded, I'd hate to see it in the summer."
Busan City Tour on BUTI,The tour started at 9am instead of 0930 am as printed on the brochures.There was no commentary or device to translate the stops made along the way unless you have download the apps before the tour and the wifi was not accessible. One of the stop was Oryukdo and there was no information about the ferry ride to the island and I found out later from the information it is the small fishing boat at the pier. You are able to change from red to blue and even the green line but the interchange from one line to another is not well planned. Beside most fo the buses were crowded and many people had to stand and the coaches were very hot without any aircon during winter making one very sick from cold to suffocating coaches. Not a good choice of touring Busan.
Mandi Bus,"Spent a day touring Busan using the Mandi Bus. Made our way to the bus stop right outside Busan station. There were 2 staff waiting there in red jackets. Paid our fair of 10,000 won each and were given maps and a bus timetable. Only had time to check out Songdo Beach, Songdo Skywalk, Gamcheon Culture and dinner at Jagalchi market.Advisable to be at each stop 5 to 8 mins before the pick-up time as the bus driver would just drive off if he doesn't see anyone waiting. "
Busan city tour and fish market,The city tour was interesting. We stopped at various points of I teredt including local international market and the fish market. Fish is prominent in So. Korea and they eat all kinds of fish & seafood. Very intetesting.
Had a wonderful experience in Busan,"This was my first tour in Busan and Kee and Sandra were wonderful people that help me with everything I needed. Also explained all about our visit spots! I found in this experience friends and great people, so if you are looking for a great Busan tour this is for You! Thank You again!"
Tour bus,"The bus tour got 3 routes that are quite value for money. Each tour is about W20,000 per person and will pick you up and drop you off at your hotel or at the bus terminal. The guide can speak little English but the bus tour saved us a lot of time finding each scenic spot. The evening tour is impressive also."
Good way to get around the city,"At only 15000 it is a good way to get round to all the tourist sites, but you will have to chose carefully where you get off as the bus only runs 10am to 4pm. Pick the far away points where you only need to spend a short time and then catch the next bus (30 minute intervals) or you soon run out of day. the last stop you can then plan to return to your hotel by metro. I think there are 2 different tour buses but they didn't mind us getting onto either of the buses. Some of the Buses have open tops."
Winter call....,"I supposed to visit this city in January but as I was in Myanmar so finally I travel to Busan in March. The weather still cold here but it good as I am from rain forest country so we do not have this kind of climate. Busan is lovely city especially colorful village which there are lots of tourists visit this place. I like that they turn their house to be small shops, coffee shops, food stall, small restaurants and they sell local product. I tried many type of local finger food and me and my friends spend half day there. We already planed to visit again next year."
Buti and Busan Stamp Tour a Must do in Busan,"Buti Bus is excellent to give you the base to get to know the city. Especially for first timers.There are 3 lines: Red, Green and Blue. If the Skywalk Oryukdo is in your things to do list, i would advise to start with that one 1st. Take the Red line at Busan Station and from there its the 4th stop to transfer to the Green Line (Oryukdo islets). Ask the driver if the Green and Blue line are operating. If its raining or the traffic is bad the Green or Blue Line or both will most likely be closed.If Haedong Yonggungsa Temple is your priority, you can hop on the Blue Line at Haeundae Beach where it starts or ride the Red one until you get there. I have added photos of the Buti Guide to Busan City Tour where you can check where the Red, Blue and Green line stop and where the transfer stops are.It is important to mention that Blue and Green are the only lines subjected to weather and traffic conditions. The Red line will always be operational. Start early in the morning to take more advantage of it. You can hop on and off anytime throughout the day without paying more for it and you have a bus every 30 minutes. It is also a first come, first served basis.The bus stops are announced in Korean, Chinese, Japanese and English. Some drivers speak English but not all of them although those who don't will try their best to make sure you got their message or to answer your queries.You buy the tickets from the driver. He accepts cash and/ or credit card. He will give you a wrist ticket. Put it immediately on your wrist to avoid losing it. If you lose yours you will have to pay for a new one.The tickets cost 15000 won for adults and 8000 won for kids. Go to a Tourist Information Office and get a Busan Stamp Tour leaflet. That will give you a 5000 won discount on your ticket (adults ticket only and 1 leaflet per adult/ discount) and while you are at it collect the stamps for its rewards. Each stamp will give you a souvenir (a mirror) and when you get the 4th stamp you get a tumbler cup. If you want a tumbler from Haeundae Beach you have to go there for it and so on. Its fun and easy to do especially if you are riding Buti.Show the Buti driver the discount info printed in the Busan Stamp Tour leaflet or else you will pay the normal price. It seems they are unaware of it.When you ask for the stamp also ask for your souvenir from it. Some people didn't know about it so i missed 2 from all the places i got the stamp from. You can only get 1 tumbler per leaflet/ person. So choose where you want yours from. If you have kids they will certainly love it for its rewards and stamp collection. Mine certainly did."
Best way to Familiarize yourself with Busan,"The Buti Bus is a great way to find your way around Busan Korea. Since parking is hard to find and traffic can get heavy the Buti Bus makes it easy. They have a Red, Blue and Green Line. We took the Blue Line from Busan Station. It make stops along the first half of the Red Line such as the UN Cemetery, Busan Museum and Marine City before reaching the start of the Blue Line. You really get to see a lot of the city and can get on and off any of the Buti Buses all day for only 15,000 Won, less then US $14 in July of 2017."
Amazing city tour ,"This city tour was amazing. We loved everything : the service, people and places. Our guide crew was very friendly and polite. They explained everything and guide us through each stop. Helped us and suggested what to do and what to see which place to skip (because there was nothing interesting). I would definitely recommend this tour to all people. "
The best USD10 ever spent!!!,"Just back from a lovely week in Busan. Love the city - its people and their lifestyle, its climate, the picturesque spots, with beaches just minutes away by subway from the city centre, its awesome and totally reliable public transportation system, and of course, the shopping!!! I would recommend the Busan City Tour by BUTI for all visitors keen to discover and explore the many places of interest and beauty. My friends and I feel that the tour charge of 15000 won (discounted to 10000 won for travelers with vouchers) was the best USD10 we have ever spent anywhere!!! We managed to go on all three lines, with stops at places like Haeundae Beach, Shinsegae shopping mall (awarded the title of ""the world's largest"" by Guinness Book of World Records), and the Haedong Yonggungsa temple. Lovely walks in gorgeous weather! Truly, value for money!"
Enjoy Busan in 1 day,I can maximize my stay in Busan thru this BUTI. Its a big help indeed when your stay in Busan is just a day or 2.
Quite poor,"Some of the destinations were very good but the system is pretty awful, example:The ticket is supposed to give discounts on other attraction using the receipt but the driver didn't give one and we couldn't explain to him that we needed it, so no discounts.I saw people unable to get on a bus after waiting half an hours meaning they would have had a one hour wait at least.I saw a half empty bus pull out of the station five minutes early and saw passengers show up having been abandoned.Since the brochures were in multiple languages I expected the commentary would also have been - wrong. Speaking to people who took other buses they had multilingual commentaries.The buses were overloaded with adults and small children standing despite the notices against.Poorly organized and very inefficient."
Over crowded,The bus covers mostly all important areas of sight seeing... Except few which you can cover by taking metro from tokyo station.... Good view... But Always over crowded.... Difficult to get seats... And there is no fun of city tour without seats.... The reason it is over crowded.. Because the less number of bus... One bus every hour... So sometimes big queue at the bus stop... And no commentary in english... So forget the information abt the city just enjoy the view.
It was a fun day tour!,"We opted for this city tour as it was our first time exploring Busan and we had only one day to do so. The tour turned out to be pretty enjoyable with friendly bus drivers who arrived on time. And the attractions which they covered were great. When we were tired from exploring, we just had to hop on and rested our legs while enjoying the sea breeze on the top deck! However like with those typical group tour, you never know who you would meet. We were annoyed by a man who sat behind us and waved his selfie stick onto our heads repeatedly. And also a group of friends who were chatting and laughing away so loudly that all we heard was their chatter at one point. Even all the beautiful videos we took had their shrilly screams and laughter in the background. Thankfully we could just alight at the next stop and hop on the next bus! "
Great routes.. decent price,"First, you do not need to get to the main station to buy tickets, you can find a route closest to you and get on the next bus and buy tickets right there. A credit card or local cash. No American cash accepted on our bus. We made the mistake of walking 2 miles to get to the station. Two come with the same ticket, one is separate, we took the red route which takes you out of the city to the various sites and tourist locations which were of more interest. We got off at a couple places and then got back on when the next bus arrived in about 30 minutes. You may need more time at some places... please research the locations to decide in advance where you want to get off and back on. The fish market and the downtown street food area is worth taking the time to see. "
Excellent,Very good way to see the sites in Busan. So easy to jump on or off. Drivers were very friendly and assisted with questions as much as they could. Highly reccommend this option to see the sites.
Alright,"Well we wanted to take the other buss, the double decker but we took this one. BUTI operates three lines, Red, Green and Blue and by changing at certain stations you can get a larger tour of the city. We got a good driver at the start (we started at the train station) and he gave some recomendations about what places were go to exit and then hop on the next buss.We actually encountered him several hours later when we got back on the red line after the green line. He spoke some English and had a good sence of humour.Sure, youd like some more info in English about the places you see (like in other tour busses), but we used the buss just for transportation. While in the red line with the mentioned driver we got some info in English. He also wrote some addresses over places we wanted to visit in Busan for us in Korean, so we could just show the taxi drivers later (since taxi drivers here speak almost no English at alland we had difficulties to explain to the where to go).Don't know how it is on the weekends, but we all got sitting space. And we got a double decker while joining the red line for the third time after the blue line. At one point before sime tunnels we were little bit slow because of an accident on the road, but you can't blame the company. Worth the 15000 woon/pers."
Glad to have this in winter!,I took something similar in London before. I just love the flexibility of getting up and down in whichever stop. Especially I'm in Busan during winter. This makes my Visit more comfortable. The drivers are very polite and kind and friendly too! 
Very interesting to get a global idea,"The tour lasts 2 hours, and also goes to Huandai Beach and the surroundings. You can leave at different stops and hop in again later."
Excellent little bus tour,"We took the bus tour from busan station while my sister had a layover to Taipei and I was staying in busan. She had a 10 hr layover so we did the tour till she had to leave for the airport. We enjoyed the short ride through busan. For a hop-on tour it was very reasonably priced, about $15 instead of close to $50 as grayline is. There are a number of routes. We got off at ganghali beach and walked around. Enjoyed the views of Marina city too with its very modern buildings. We got off at Haeundae beach and took some pictures, then went for dinner, and took the metro back to the airport afterwards. You pay for the ticket at the bus and they accept credit card. Took in November 2016. Was a sunny, but chilly day, but still braved the top deck to see the sights."
Should not be missed especially for short visit to Busan,"We had only spent 1 day in Busan since we were not able to plan ahead for Busan and our airbnb was in Seoul. Nevertheless, we have somehow had a glimpse of Busan through this Busan City Tour Bus . The bus follows routes that pass through the tourist attractions around the city (red bus starts from Busan Station). You get to choose which course you like, as in our case, we chose the red bus. You can hop on and off whichever bus stop you wish to and just catch the next one (schedules are posted in the bus stops and indicated in the printed guides). The good thing about this is the time you can save as compared when you do all the thinking of what to visit next and how to. And the best thing is, the buses are double deckers so you can enjoy the view on top! for The notable attractions were UN Memorial, and Heundae Beach. Overall, it was rather short but a great way to experience Busan in one day."
Excellent way to Busan Sight-seeing,"My first trip to Busan though has been excellent, thanks to BUTI bus. Covers the Red, blue and Green loop which is more or less the must see in Busan in an economical way. A - 12000W C - 10000WExcellent Bus Driver for Green Line! Entertaining, friendly and informative and advise us lots more places to visit."
All. around Busan,"My interest was to visit the UN War Cemetary. The City Tours offered a hop on hop off round trip for 15.000 Won (about 15 US $). The tour is extremely exciting because it takes you from a beach into the city, across the harbour to the main train station and back. "
"Convenient, not a guided tour","The best way to visit around Busan tourist sites. You need not to worry to get lost while wandering around Busan. Relatively cheap compared to a private tour bus. Though it doesn't go to all the tourist spots Busan has to offer. Departure point is at Busan Station Square, in front of Toms cafe. One time payment of SKW 15,000 for adult and SKW 8,000 for children up to high school students. You can ride all the 3 buses. Red line offers the ""top down"" type bus while the green and blue line don't. No services on Mondays unless it is a public holiday. Downside is that the drivers doesn't speak English. "
Great value way to see the sights,We took the Red Bus as an alternative to the cruise ship shore excursion. It was great value for money and allowed plenty of drop off areas along the coastline and in the city. Definitely worth getting off at BIFF Square for a look around and for lunch and also to check out the Jagalchi Fish Market. We only spent a couple of hours on the bus due to us only having limited time but it is possible to link with other bus routes to pretty well cover the whole city.
 Good if you have only one or 2 days in Busan," Yiu can buy the ticket from the bus driver at any stop when you board the bus. Cost is 15,000 Korean won. About USD$15. It allows you to take the blue, red and green line. Runs from about 9am from Busan Station so you have to check the bus stops to find out when the next bus comes. I find the blue line more interesting, more photo spots where you can take nice pictures. Nothing much on the red line quite disappointing as we wanted to go to the islets but the green line was cancelled,"
There is no better way to see the entire BUSAN City -,"This was my second visit to Busan and I took the JUMBO BUS again. It is by far the best and cheapest way to see the entire city. There are in total 12 stops for HOP-ON / HOP FF. If you want to make most of your day, take one of the first tours of the day. First tour is at 9 AM (every 30 minutes)."
Awesome Tour!,"For 20,000 Won/$20 US per person, it's an affordable way to see Busan at it's best. Tour lasted about 8 hours. Departure and arrival location is outside of Busan KTX Train station. The driver spoke very little English so I had to translate to other English speaking tourists. (I didn't mind) This is not a ""jump on and off bus"". The driver will give you ample about of time at each location for your to view and learn about each sites."
Excellent way to get around town ,"Great way to experience a day trip to Busan. Stops at all the great locations so if you are limited to time in Busan or want to get your bearings hop on and hop off. Starts at 0930 and runs all the way til last bus st 5pm. Very reasonably priced and if you have a day trip from Seoul show your train ticket to get a discount. Convenient and clean transportation, bus leave directly out of the Busan Train Station. "
Best way to see the city,"They have 3 loops, but the Red line has all the sights on it. It cost 15000 won, but well worth it. I qould recommend starting early to maximize your time at your prioritized locations. There is no way you can do it all in one day, but with their tour your get a great overview to develop your plan of attack. Enjoy Busan."
Good to do with kids,"Our kids really enjoyed the bus rides. It is an easy way to get around the city in one day, but really don't have enough time to get off and explore more than 1 or 2 places."
Great way to visit Busan,"As far as City Tour Bus goes, this is a great service. The tour takes you from the far east of the city all the way to the West at the Busan Station. You get to stop by the three main beaches of Busan, the old and new shopping zones and many tourists friendly location. A sure recommendation for anyone who doesn't know Korean but would like to venture through the city a bit. The bus have air conditioning which was welcome in the hot days of August 2016. It costs $15 a day an adult. $8 a day a children. The bus stops each 30 minutes pretty much everywhere."
Good overview,"Did the red and blue loops of the tour. One price for all day. Great way to get out to the temple by the sea. Nice views of and from the two main bridges in Busan. Wish the onboard video had English subtitles, but not really room on the screen for two languages....it was easy to use and know which stop we were at. The timetable was accurate - be sure to notice if it says ""arrival"" or ""departure"" for some of the stops. Overall, well worth the money to see the city in one day."
Busan Night City Tour - A Night to remember,"I took a Busan night city tour on July 02nd 2016.It was an excellent night journey to remember, especially when the bus was riding under the Busan bridge. It was a fantastic feeling for riding underneath the rainbow lights of the Bridge lamps... And also for seeing a spectacular night lamps of Busan Marine City, was a very night to remember.If you have a KTX ticket, make sure that you'll have a 20% discount price when paying for the official city tour from the starting point in front of Busan station, and please make sure that you are already make a reservation first... the official tourism center will help you to make reservations.Thank you, and have a good night trip"
Perfect way to see everything we had wanted to see and then some,"Being prepared is the best way to travel and efficient planning is essential. The Busan City Tour Bus, at a reasonable price, will take you to all of your Busan essentials. Be aware that there aren’t any guides or suggestions by a worker. It’s all in Korean. Fortunately for us, my father in law is Korean so we didn’t need to worry at all but don’t let that stop you. English is not needed and the places are not difficult to find. It sure beat taking taxis who might overcharge you for a ride so take the bus and leave the stress and enjoy your day of Busan."
First City Tour Bus,"It was raining non-stop when we arrived at Busan. A letdown.. but I managed to spot the City Tour Bus once I stepped out of the KTX Busan Station. Unfortunately, it was not sheltered and we bashed through the rain, quickled paid 15,000W/pax.And we were happy that we took the City Tour Bus - my first experience. The bus went through all the major places. I got down at a maritime museum and jagalchi market only as the rain did not stop at all. Since it is the kind of hop-on hop-off bus, it was very convenient and the bus timings were on schedule.Even when it is not raining, I still will recommend this!"
Great Way to See The City,We made a last minute choice to try out the bus tour and should have done it the first day! We found all the main attractions in a short morning ride and were able to make plans for the places we wanted to visit again for longer periods of time. No info as you ride the bus (unless you can speak Korean) besides what stop is next (as compared to other cities Hop On/Hop Off buses where you get tour guide tid bits as you ride) but still worth it for the price! Sitting on the upper deck lets you see the city from a wonderful view!
You can hop off and hop on to any Busan City Tour Bus.,"You can buy a ticket and utilise it for a whole day, meaning you can get on a bus, choose a destination you want to go, get down talk a tour and then get back on another Busan city tour bus tht come on the same spot you get off. Meaning Hop on Hop off as you like.Convenient & Cost effective, expect no tour guide like a normal tour guide but the provide Map with multi language.Recommend for tourist that are short on time or get on to familiarize with Busan before exploring on their own."
Tour Bus,Wow - this was amazing - able to see everywhere getting off and on as we wishBusan is beautiful and so very clean - the people are so very friendly
Service not available on Mondays,"Came on a Monday and was told that it is not available. But no fear, the subway here is quite good and easy to navigate. Got a 1- day pass and we had fun hopping on and off the different stations to explore the places. "
Very efficient way to see Busan,"I agree with every one esle! Very efficient. If you have alot of things packed in to do at Busan or if you just need a basic review of Busan this bus tour will take you all over. They don't say anything or give you any tips, if they do speak its in Korean. But you can get the general layout of the place and they take scenic routes like the bridges, along the beaches, and downtowns. Do it on a bright sunny day and you will really enjoy it. Also quick tip this bus stops at the Busan Ferry so its also a good way to catch a ride there"
Effcient Way To Tour Busan Especially for First Time Visitors,"On my second day in Busan, due to limited time available, I have chosen to jump in the Jumbo Bus to tour the city to see as much as I can. With my KTX train ticket, got a 20% discount (said to be the same if you fly in by local airlines). Big double deck buses available from 9:00am at every 30 mins. Shortly after our bus left the first spot at Busan Train Station, it was raining hard but we can still manage to take a quick look at all the spots along the route. Will definitely go again on my next trip to visit the nice spots along the route."
Effiecient Way to Tour Busan,"We had only three days in Busan and wanted to cover as much as we could. So we decided to take the city tour bus. It's convenient, no need to struggle with directions, and much cheaper than if we were to travel on public transport. Or have control over which stops you want to alight and how much time to spend at each spot. We took the first bus out at 930am and spent the entire day sight seeing. So start early if you want to cover as much. There are two operators, so check on the routes you prefer. The buses are right outside the KTX station (on the left when you face out). It is easy to spot the red or yellow double deckers from the KTX station exit. Cost 15,000 won per person. There's Englush announcements on the bus."
I heart Busan More than Seoul!!!,"Frankly speaking, Busan is the best for my camera. The scenery is superb!! Get on the BUTI as early as you can, because u will regrets if you cannot manage to cover all the place around the pitstop!!!Forget the tour guide or tour package!! U do not need that in Busan, because BUTI give you more than any tour guide can give! Hop off as many place as you can. It's totally worth. And don't forget to hop on the other BUTI blue line and green line. Next time when I come again to Busan. BUTI will be my 1st choice on the 1st day in Busan. "
City tour,The tour of smart city of busan is best seen on hoho bus It has 16 stops and covers major flyovers and modern districts besides tourist spotsIt takes to heundae beach where you can hop on to another tour bus to cover other islands Hoho bus is a wonderful experience
Not suitable for Foreigner !!! Probably the only tourist bus in the World only speak their only Language!!!,"We took both day and night.Full n had to stand in few occasion.Night views are wonderful, when I request to switch off the internal light driver saylaw not allow but he occasionally switch off the light on certain good view area, so I wonder his law or the govt ??? We are like seeing mirror from in side the bus most of the time. Advertised as double decker but only few operate, rest all normal bus.The only English we hear n see from TV screen in "" The next stop is..........""Guide book/map only tell you name of stop(in English) without explanation, sowe have to imagine the place by looking at the name n make a decision to stop or not, luckily we only make wrong stop once. Driver are not so friendly with foreigner although he speck understandable English.This is my first tourist hop up hop down bus with no headphones, no spoken or written foreign language but local language."
