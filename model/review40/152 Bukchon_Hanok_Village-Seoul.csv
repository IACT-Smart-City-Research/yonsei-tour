Charming hilly neighborhood ,"On a hill between the two famous palaces, this area is very pleasant for a 1-hour stroll around traditional houses. There are a few eating and coffee places."
Pleasant Walkaround ,A nice quaint district to walk around observing the hanok architecture. About 1km or 20mins walk from Gyeongbokgung Place. Slightly hilly and good walking shoes are best.
Good experience ,The Hanok village is conveniently located near the Gyeongongbuk Palace and its definitely worth visiting after leaving the palace. It recreates the “authentic” Korean experience and has a lot of souvenir shopping opportunities. I was unsure of photo opportunity though so I didn’t snap.
A good walk in Bukchon,We spent almost whole day here walking around. Bukchon Hanok Village is the real residential area with 900 hanoks. There are many interesting photo spots here especially when you put on the rented Hanbok!
Historic area with character,Went to this residential neighborhood and learned about the history of the locals. The neighborhood has hills so be prepared but it’s not too challenging. Make sure to drop by at the coffee shop called onion. Fantastic baked goods and you can see the architectuee typical to this area. 
Bukchone Hanok Village,A great and beautiful place to visit. You need to be quiet while walking along the area as there are people living there. 
Too many noisy tourists,This traditional Korean village is beautiful but is somewhat destroyed by inconsiderate tourists who talk loudly and make too much noise in a residential area. Pity.
Quaint Traditional Korean Village,"This place has maintained the traditional cultural look of a Korean village and has opened the streets for tourists. There are rules here, though. We are supposed to keep quiet of speak only in whisper so as not to disturb the residents. Nice place for good photographs."
Old Seoul preserved beautifully,"Great place to walk around and take in traditional South Korean architecture - we especially appreciated that visitors honor the request of those who live there, by being quiet and respectful."
Korean Traditional Village,Good to see and enjoy the walk with many house in its original architecture. There are also some souvenir shops and coffee to stop by.
nice and authentic,"not easy to find this place, as I walked and walked trying to look for this place. it is a village where people are living, so we dont really see inside of their house, is quite tiring too as this village is just a two rows of village"
Nice little get away,Visited this as part of a hop on and off bus tour and spent about 45’ there. Interesting but very touristy... and I found it difficult to watch and understand the performances... but the garden is nice and there are good restaurants nearby!
Village visit,"The hanok is a type of housing once popular in Seoul, in this cillage you can get a glimpse of the past architectural wonders of Korea. "
Get here early ,"You need to get here really early to meta the crowds. It can get very busy, lookout for the people in red they have free maps "
Tucked away treasure,Very interesting to see a traditional Korean village in the middle of Seoul. Wonderful wooden doors lead to secluded courtyards and private areas where people live. Rather steep hills await the walker. Cafés are nearby. 
Peaceful in the morning - busy in the afternoon!,"If you want to experience this area without throngs of tourists, get up early and walk around in the quiet before 10am. There’s and easy map with a route to follow for beautiful views of the traditional rooftops and the hills surrounding Seoul. Gorgeous in November with changing leaves. Fun to watch the area fill up with local tourists wearing charming traditional outfits and posing for photos everywhere! Easy to get to the places from here too. "
Great little area,Fantastic place to walk around and see some very cool old architecture. Make sure to stop by Layers Cafe near the area.
Crowded,"Too many tourists all the time and you cannot make noise as this is housing area.The road is too long and deep, be prepared to walk alot.Alot tourist wearing Hanbok to visit here too."
Too many tourists! ,There were too many people and I hardly had the chance to snap a decent photo. A very touristy place indeed. 
Place of remembrance,Nice to visit this kind of place that reminds the Korean Culture and History. The place is clean and tourist friendly especially the shops and cuisine near the area. Keep up the good work. Will visit again and tell our friends to visit the place. Thank you 
Very interesting. Beautiful area.,We visited on our own and with a guide. Definitely recommend with a guide. We used Top Korea Tour Our guide was Miae. Learning about he history and current-day occupiers of this area was interesting
"Beautiful, traditional and quiet",This is one of the most wonderful suburbs in all of Seoul. You can get lost in the many streets up and down Bukchon. Check out the many trendy cafes and stop in at one of the delightful pubs or drinking spots. I’d recommend everyone visiting Seoul spend an afternoon in Bukchon! Love it! 
Just go through the hanok village,Although I did not stay very long at this place I really enjoyed going there. I like the contrast of these old Korean traditional houses with the Seoul building. if you are looking good you can find cute little cafe and have quieter places where everyone gathered to make pictures in hanbok. I recommend this place by staying there for several hours does not really interest. thought to also respect the tranquility of the inhabitants (the houses are not empty but well inhabited).
Good introduction to 'old' Seoul,Bukchon is a nice place to have a leisurely walk along narrow streets and old buildings where you can catch glimpses into hanok courtyards and there are plenty of places to stop off for a drink or a spot of shopping. The only annoyance is the hundreds of young Koreans in hanbok (traditional dress) constantly taking photos of each other so you have to endlessly stop and wait for them to finish.
For Instagram only,Cringy tourists taking ridiculous photos here for their Instagram. Don’t waste your time here. More historic views/buildings elsewhere. 
A nice walk,It was nice to go about the narrow roads and watch the houses over there. There are also a lot of small shops and plenty of things to see. 
Traditional houses,"It's a residential neighborhood, tourists are advised to keep their voices low and not to disturb the residents.A good walk, a bit uphill. You can wear hanbok and take pictures in the neighborhood."
Bukchon Hanok Village,"A nice stop to walk around, located on a hill, many alleys, can be very crowded. I do not feel it is a must see. There is a long history to this village. Located between 2 of the palaces.Houses are in the hanok style."
Very much over rated area,"If you don't intend to do anything except shop in Seoul you might find the area interesting. It mainly consists of narrow lane ways edged with new and some older style houses, it is somewhat lacking in authenticity. You will mainly see roofs but the occasional house is visible. Many houses are now coffee shops or boutiques. When travelling around Seoul, if you keep your eyes open you will see much more genuine examples of older style Korean houses. This is the most disappointing Korean attraction I have come across. Perhaps it is worth a look if you are visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace as it is close by. See it first because after the palace it would be rubbish. South Korea has some amazing sights, but this isn't one of them."
Very interesting ,"Beautiful traditional Korean houses lined up this village, which is free entrance. Touring this Village, one has to be silent as these are residences and they don’t want to be disturbed understandably."
Bukchon Hanok,"Lovely quaint place with plenty of little shops offering good food, coffee, dessert. A bit of a steep walk but wee worth it. The place gives you great photo opportunities."
Picturesque ,Well worth a walk up these streets of old South Korea. Interesting finding out people live there and how quiet it is. Great views of Seoul aswell
Bit of a peek in to history,"Personally not impressed with the visit while one do see the Korean style homes and some of the traditional arts like dyeing with natural substance, incense making etc. The center is good but not sure I will consider it as a must see"
Traditional ,Good chance to see traditional houses from the exterior amongst new modern style houses in a very regenerated area of Seoul. Lovely views at the top. 
New Money Rebuilding Old Houses,"This hillside district is an interesting place to walk, but the people who live here for it’s charm put up unwelcoming signs and have people stationed around the neighbourhood with signs saying “shhh”. That said, the houses are beautiful (on the outside) and well worth a look. The streets are narrow and can be dangerous for pedestrians. The area is also quite popular with tourists, so expect a crowd. Visiting people do dress in traditional costumes, so there are lots of photo opportunities. Not all welcome the attention."
Traditional Village,Even though the place is bit hilly but i am like it very much and love this place..There is a shop to rental hanbook as well
A lovely Village to visit,"Arrival to Hanok Village to have understanding about traditional houses and culture of Korean.Trust me, you’ll have nice pictures here. There’s a delicious restaurant of Ginseng Chicken Soup nearby that you can try. It’s one of special dishes in Korea."
Tiring but Worth the Effort,"Just behind where we are living (itself in Bukchon). The village is very pleasant. While we were there, the place had tourists who, except for one, maintained the pleasant quiet of the neighborhood and the respect for its residents.Because it was a Tuesday, the “museums” we wanted to see were closed. However, just walking around and seeing the old buildings , which are juxtaposed against new magnificent villas, was a pleasure.The prospective visitors should be warned of the topology: it is inevitable that you will climb and descend some steep inclines; sometimes using steps and sometimes without. Tiring but definitely worth the effort."
Nice but crowded,"It is a good spot to view older buildings, is Hanok style. There is a popular trail that many visitors take, which makes some parts of the street rather crowded.Given that the village is sandwiched between palaces, it is nice to walk through the village after visiting one palace and on the way to the other. Overall, I found only a few spots in the village that was nice but awfully crowded. Perhaps coming earlier in the morning would have been better."
"Quaint, but not a must-see","The neighborhood is quaint, in parts - some of the buildings are maintained in the old style, some are modern. They're largely intermixed together. Most of the buildings can only be admired from the outside; you can't enter. Also note that this is entirely a residential neighborhood with one main thoroughfare with tourist shops and eateries. To get the full effect of the old-style housing you'll need to wander into the side streets with the residences.Notes:- If you're looking for an anchor point, look for the Bukchon tourist center. Get a walking map of the neighborhood; it will help- In case it's not obvious from the pictures, it is a hill climb. A STEEP hill climb, in some parts"
"Love the architecture, feel sorry for residents ",We love history and culture and are firm believers of preserving heritage. This area is of historic interest and definitely of historical Korean architecture value. The sad part is the fact that these are actually people’s homes and therefore make it quite sad. People have day in and day out strangers on their doorsteps dressed in fancy folk dress taking endless photos and making an enormous noise. Yes I wanted to see it for myself however felt sorry for the residents. The younger Korean visitors dressed in fancy folk dress couldn’t care less. I wish they shown a little more respect.Part of me say don’t visit to give the residents a little rest but it’s definitely of historical interest.
So much fun!,"We visited here and decided to dress up in traditional hanboks. They rental stores are all around and rent on an hourly basis. The village itself is lovely to tour around and get great pictures of the hanoks. I would highly recommend, esp silly if you have children, dressing up. We had a great time and it made for wonderful pics. "
Nice to see but .....,"Pretty, narrow streets with old style homes.Residents still live there so you need to be quiet, which really is not a problem. shops geared to tourists and depending on when you get there, it can be very crowdedwas nice to see but not t the top of my list. was still very hot in beginning of Sept and no respite from heat "
Lovely stroll,"Traditional houses dot the hillsides of the traditional Bukchon neighborhood. Bring your walking shoes and be ready for some hills, but the different variations in architecture and a glimpse into Korea’s long and turbulent history - and their architecture’s quest for peace along the way - are worth the effort."
Traditional vs Contemporary,Love this area! I appreciate its calm and peace and the detailed architectural design of the houses. If you move out and head on to the roads you’ll see modern shops and cafes. Really cool place!
Nice walk,We had a couple of hours and we went there Hanok village for a relaxing stroll. We were not disappointed! The old houses are super well maintained and the view of the city's skyline mixed with the old houses was breathtaking!
Quieter part of Seoul.,"Spent only 20-25 mins strolling around the traditional village area, but ended up spending another couple of hours enjoying few roads that has all small art shops that houses very pretty range of artwork, postcards, souvenirs, paintings and more! Prepare your cash! The neighbourhood is very peaceful, walk slow and enjoy your quiet time here."
Worth it,We spent two hours and took lots of pictures. One day it will disappear. A very pictoresque area. A purely walking area.
Worth a few minutes walk through.,"If there you must go up the hill. We followed the signs to the Observatory, but never made it the whole way.Disappointed in that we had hired a private guide to show us all over Seoul, but because there is no place to park near the 'village' (which is practically downtown), he just dropped us off for 30 minutes on our own with a designated pick-up spot."
Nice to see a bit of preserved history,"I liked walking around this village and soaking up the cute architecture, but also the idea that these little walkways have been walked up & down for many many years. Get up to an elevated spot and clock roof after roof in the old style - nice!"
"Lots of walking and stairs, great view at the top.","You can walk here after visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace and have lunch is one of the many small restaurants. There is a lot of walking on hilly streets and stairs. It is not all original, most buildings have been renovated or are new construction but still with the same style as the old ones. This is a residential area so cars are allowed and the residents stand outside with signs asking visitors to be quiet. There are lots of shops and restaurants"
Nice,Had a nice walk here. Full of shops and tea houses. Some sold traditional handcrafted items. Would recommend it. 
Crowded but interesting.,This is a residential neighborhood of very old homes. The houses are not open to the public but the streets (many very steep streets) are interesting to roam about (quietly because people actually live here). Great for photographers. Many visitors rent Hanbok costumes and pose for photos. Lots of little shops and places to eat along the way. Streets can be crowded on weekends.
Beautiful from a distant ,"as this is still an actual residential area the inside of the house can’t be seen, but it is the interior + exteriors that makes the Hanok ever interesting ... fine other hanok villages that allow you to have a meal in it I.e onion cafe "
Should visit but will probably not revisit ,"The taxi ride from our hotel in Gangnam-gu to Bukchon Hanok was 32000 won. What makes it worse was that the Naver Map direction didn't bring us to the correct spot. We were left at the end of the street near a park and had to walk for 20 minutes looking for the old village. Well not exactly old. Its a residential area with old houses and people still live in it. Snap some pictures and good to go. One of the checklist. And oh yeah, decent amount of climbing needed especially when with kids "
Quaint Village - Go Early!,"I wish I had read the prior review before wandering over to Bukchon Village. I have been to the neighborhood independently (not part of a tour group) a few times and it is lovely however, very crowded. The area is located very near Insadong, Gyeongbokgung Palace, and Changdeokgung Palace so a combined visit is absolutely possible. You can get a little map of the area that slows ""8 views of Bukchon Village"" which is a nice guide for a non-guided tour visit. Walking through just to enjoy the small homes, stores, and tea shops is also possible and enjoyable. The major downside to visiting this area is the hordes of tourists dressed in Hanbok trying to take the perfect picture down the quaint alleyways - difficult to just enjoy when you are trying to dodge disrupting their photoshoot."
Not what we were expecting,"Visited with my family on Sunday morning.Perhaps our expectations were unrealistic (was expecting a real old town/visit to the past experience), there were signs all over asking visitors to behave (talk with lower voice, not get in, not peeing, etc.); to me is just a nice residential area where the people living there seem to be annoyed by all the tourists.Took a few pictures and headed to Insadong, that was more fun than this."
Early morning visit was perfect time,"We visited early before people were up and loved walking the quiet streets.It was magical.But by the time we left, hoards of tourists were arriving .The neighborhood is a major tourist attraction,so if you want to capture the magic,go early."
Long walk but what a view!,"You'll need your walking shoes to get up there. Steep narrow roads but for those who love Korean architecture, this is a must see. Fantastic view of Seoul skyline from the top of the hill too. Breathtaking. Got to keep your voice down though because there are people living in the houses."
Must visit for tourists,"Its a long alley filled with Korean traditional houses. It just gets crowded with tourists. As i know, there are still people living in them so visitors are discouraged to make too much noise. I didnt go walk further because there were too many people."
The Past Retained,"Located between the Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgong Palaces and just a short walk from the Anguk Metro Station you will find a little section of old Seoul retained. It is a mix of old and new, traditional and tacky but it is very interesting. Take the walk from Exit 3 from the station and walk up the hill . The place is well-signed and maps are available of the area showing the preferred walk. It is about a 3 KM walk and some points give good views of the city and the old buildings with their tiled roofs."
Neighborhood With Many Traditional Houses,"Bukchon Hanok Village, in a Northern hilly area of Seoul, is my favorite neighborhood in the city because of its distinctive traditional architecture, known as hanok. Boasting several hundred of these homes, it has the largest number that still remain in the metropolis. On my most recent visit to Seoul, I took a friend here to introduce her to this earlier-era style that relies on natural materials. The one-story, tile-roof houses with patterned walls, first designed and built in the 14th century, feature an interlocking framework of uwooden beams that rest on blocks of stone. Other elements often used include earth, clay, straw and paper made from mulberry bark. The traditional courtyard garden remains hidden from the street.We stopped first at Bukchon Tourist Information before the village for free maps and brochures. The man working there spoke excellent English and proved to be most helpful. But we did not go there directly. Instead, we stood looking confused about where to go at a crossroads and were approached by a mobile tourist information rep. Dressed in a red jacket and red hat, he was in the area to offer assistance to tourists, armed with English, Japanese and Chinese language skills. I have never witnessed this service in other cities worldwide. These reps can be seen throughout popular tourist destinations in Seoul and have steered me in the right direction more than once.As we ascended the hill, the hanoks suddenly appeared and the modern city had been left behind. Many of the houses have been turned into tea houses, restaurants and workshops, but there are still private residences galore. Two women in yellow hats and yellow vests with “Please be Quiet” in English, Japanese and Chinese emblazoned on the front and back walked along the narrow alleys, often putting an index finger to closed lips. I also noted a poster on one wall, requesting visitors to be quiet. It appears that the residents would like less noise in their neighborhood.We arrived here in midday and it was like tourist central. Despite efforts to keep noise down, many visitors could have cared less. One even noticed a gate ajar and rushed into the courtyard of a private home to take a photo. But there were plenty of photo ops along the alleys and at the top of the hill, where a stunning view of Seoul could be captured. We headed off to more quiet streets to simply soak in the atmosphere. In the past, I have gone here in early morning and the whole area was naturally quiet.Bukchon Hanok Village can be reached by subway line 3, Anguk stop. Take exit 2 or 3 and follow the directional signs."
Nice traditional architecture in the middle of a bustling city,"When we visit anywhere new, I always like to have some historical places to visit as well as seeing how local life is at present. Having seen lots of castles and shrines already, a traditional village, where people still live, sounded like an interesting place.It really was beautiful, and in some places, the contrast with these ancient homes ith th buildings of modern Seoul in the distance showed how the city has changed. There were several girls walking about in traditional hanbok costumes, and that enhanced the feeling that this probably had looked the same hundreds of years ago. All of that, I liked. A lot.But, if you head to Seoul, or anywhere in Asia in the summer, it's going to be hot. Because it's hot, it's not the peak tourist season, but that doesn't mean that tourists aren't out in force. Just like us, hundreds of others decided to come here mid-afternoon; it was very crowded. In order to get decent photos of the architecture, etc.. you have to be pretty creative in angling your shots, or at the very minimum, wait it out for enough people to walk by so you can get a picture.I would guess that this is pretty typical no matter what time of year you're here, so if I were going to go back, I would head there first thing in the morning, when the residents are about the only people you'll see in the streets."
A cultural village,A beautiful little village portraying Korean's culture and modernism. Wear hanbok to take exquisite pictures.
Love the surrounding,Its a very pretty housing complex to walk in small alley. The houses are very pretty!! There are 2 side areas that you can visit. If you get lost there are local guide which offering you help to reach the area. 
Beautiful ,"Hanok Village I will fully recommend those who need to take pic and enjoy the view of the village. It was beautiful and the village offer many things such food area, shopping and souvenirs. "
Must to visit!,"This is a MUST! to visit, this place is definitely one of the most important historic places in Seoul, you can find lots of souvenirs and also rent a traditional Hanboks dresses and much more."
Traditional ,Narrow streets with more traditional korean houses. Very crowded with many tourists though. Few souvenir shops and a couple of cafes.
My favourite thing to do in Seoul,"Excellent part of the city - beautiful houses, nice little shops, good food - great for walking around and get lost ;) Artsy and beautiful area, close to the main palaces. Cannot wait to be back!"
Wow! Ancient Homes in the Midst of Bustling Seoul,"After visiting the palace, I continued my walk and ended up here at this ancient portion of town, where I believe the homes are about six hundred years old. I walked the alleyways to get a real feel for the homes there. In this area you will also find cute shops and some restaurants. I felt very safe walking around by myself."
Stunning houses and streets,"We visited as part of our Seoul full day tour. Stunning houses and streets. If you visit you need to be quiet. The residents love their little community, but it is popular with tourists as it's so stuuning. "
Pretty but busy,"Very easy to get from subway, very pretty, and the people dressed in traditional costumes looked amazing, small than I thought it would be but worth a visit"
Nice place to visit,"This village is an area in the city center of Seoul very famous because you can find there the traditional houses, where nowadays people live. Actually I expected them to be more authentic, but in fact those houses have been renewed and they have just tha appeal of a traditional building! I went there on a Saturday afternoon and in the streets there was also a handmade market with lot of jewellery and artisanal products. The place is also full of bar and cafes where you can have a break dipped into this tipical atmosphere. "
Not that great ,This village is actually local residential area. There were shops that provides the traditional hanbok where tourist can walk around and take pictures. You don’t really feel welcome there as there were few protest signs on local unhappiness. 
Culture to touch,The Hanok Village is a great place for you if you wanna explore the culture parts of Korea. You can rent a hanbok (traditional cloth) or vitit old houses and get some tea. 
A touristic thing...,"It has been a pretty long walk from Gyeongbokgung but, actually, there's nothing to see.it should be an ancient typical korean village, but it has become a tourist thing, with shops and many coffee houses.There are many other places in Korea if you want to see a typical village."
Experience the old way,This Korean traditional houses are interesting and for me a must experience. The traditional villages have lots of alleys and the house have open air in the center court with rooms around it. We stayed in one of them in order to have the sleep experience. Sleeping on the futons and enjoy the close community. 
Korean traditional houses,"This place with Korean traditional houses is very popular for tourists for sightseeing. There's a place where the tourists can get experience the korean traditions such as Tea time,korean traditional game,... It's really interesting place for visit. "
Highly recommended to visit - Mix of modern & quaint buildings,"Very pleasant to stroll around the village which is mostly made out of quaint buildings. Although a tourist attraction, it's still a residential area. Some parts of the village are quite hilly so be prepared for some steep walking. Along the main street, it has some nice cafes, restaurants & souvenir shops. Overall, visiting Bukchion Hanok Village must be one of the items in your itinerary when visiting Seoul."
Amazing place,"Great place, great atmosphere, a must visit before even other places. Need an hour to two hours minimum. "
Lost in the city,"A small town outside the city, a must to visit in Seoul. You also have great view on the city. Take time to walk around and not only go in THE tourist road !"
Tour With Oppa,We did a tour here of the village. I loved it. It's a beautiful historic site with lots of interesting history and it has been apart of different KDramas. Lots of walking but worth the trip.
Beauty!,"These streets are unique and must be seen. Although there are guards to warn us to be quiet, you can observe today’s artists houses. Perfect!"
Traditional village but not too old,You should keep silent when you go here and the contour is going up so keep your energy. I love Jeonju Village much better but this is also a nice place.
Very quaint. Just feel sorry for the residents ,"The village is close to the main palace, set close to some trendy shops and cafes.It's a great place to wander and get lost.It attracts a lot of tourists so worth remembering this is a residential area and the locals deserve to be respected. There are people around trying to get people to keep the noise down and stop you from entering the doorways of houses."
Small area but worth it,"Good to visit the place and see the traditional houses.Try to find EGG DROP sandwiches, they sell really good sanwiches. It was very sunny in summer, so pls bring your necesseties. I think qinter is the best time to visit the place. Bec we wanted to try thr traditional costume but it is too hot so we have to pass."
"If you don't have a teenage girl, it's quite boring","Girls who like to dress up will find it amusing to stroll the streets with the traditional Korean attire. For the rest of us, however, it's quite a boring place. Tourist-trap prices, not very pretty (lots of electrical wires hanging low between houses, looks somewhat run-down), and quite exhausting to go up and down the streets in the humid heat of summer with no clear aim, except seeing some old houses here and there."
Put comfy shoes on for this hilly walk,This was really enjoyable walk to the top. There's a lot of unique shops at the bottom and a Cafe at the top that has a 5000won entry fee as it doubles as an art gallery. Be careful not to slip if it's raining and note there are a lot of signs to keep quiet as it's a residential area and even people enforcing the silance. Families with loud kids take note
Bukchon Hanok ,"Great place to go. There are free guides - our guide is Seong II Yoo. The walk around the lanes, stories about the past, architecture and history Great place to visit "
An afternoon immersing in traditional culture of wearing Hanbok,"We rented the Korean traditional outfit, Hanbok and wore it at Bukchon Hanbok Village. It was a scorching afternoon but certainly a great experience of being like a Korean for an afternoon. This activity is recommended to people who are looking to immerse in Korean traditional culture! "
Uphill walks,"It is actually a beautiful Korean village filled with Korean styled houses. However, it is located on a hilly area. So do expect some uphill walks while there. There are signs posted around the area and staff wearing high vis vests patrolling to remind tourists to keep their voices down as it is still a residential area. Interesting to see the Korean styled houses."
"Beautiful place to visit but, be polite!","This is a very nice and quiet area of Seoul. Well conserves streets, you can imagine the old Seoul walking among those streets...but is a real neighborhood so be respectful!!!"
Walking along Bukchon Hanok Village,"We were there leisurely walking through the streets of Bukchon Hanok Village. It was a memorable one for me seeing those traditional korean houses. I regret not having worn the Han Bok custume. It could have been so challenging walking with that custume. It was worth the visit. If I have the chance to visit Seoul again, I would gladly come back to this place again."
Fascinating place,"Fascinating area, still inhabited by regular people not just kept as a historical landmark. We stayed at one of the guesthouses in that area. Authentic hanok house. Amazing experience. Highly recommend to anyone. The only downside - streets are never empty, crowds of tourists are everywhere. Unless you wake up really early. Crowds take away some charm from this place. "
Past meets present. Bring comfy shoes.,"Bukchon was really the only thing I wanted to see in Korea. We went on a tour and I was quite disappointed, not by the village, but by the tour guide who rushed us through. It also started pissing it down raining. I managed to get some decent shots which I have to edit, but I could have used more time. The houses are all still inhabited and are worth upwards of a million dollars each. Although the facades are required to be preserved, the interior of the houses are all very modern and updated. There's signs asking tourists to keep their voices down, no loud pictures, music or talking. I guess some rude westerners had caused problems in the past. Anyway, bring comfy walking shoes as there are a lot of hills in the village. Bring a wide angle lens as well."
The old style architecture of Korea ,There are many houses with the traditional Korean architecture. It is worth to wall around. Koreans are respectful and they expect tourists to be respectful too. So it is nice to keep voices down while going around the neighborhood. ;)
Bukchon Hanoi Village ,Beautiful village with interesting architecture. It’s a residential area so it’s important to be quiet and respectful when walking around. Cute little shops and lovely views.
Nice but not really special ,It is nice to wonder around. But if you have only a few days....skip it.To may people.....Ok lots of small nice shops.... but as soon as you know you are out of the district. So practical there are just a few nice streets...
A must see ,"The neighborhood has the largest collection of privately owned hanoks, or traditional Korean homes with tiled roofs, stone floors and amazing wooden doors, in Seoul. It’s located on in a hilly neighborhood nestled between Gyeongbok Palace and Changdeok Palace which are both walkable for this location. While I strolled through Bukchon Village up, down, back and forth it may feel like a trip through the ages, the neighborhood is not frozen in time. Some of the hanoks are still private homes, but others have been converted into tea houses, coffee shops. These are neat little places to get a look inside on of these beauties majority of them be historically updated renovations but they kept it to the err of time. I really enjoyed my time even while it rained. Remember people still live here so a quiet ordinance is in place and is patrolled. "
Nice residential area,Nice place walked for about n hour n then left for palace which is near by old traditional houses n people still live their so u need to b decent by not disturbing them n making noise or knocking doors Lots of art houses traditional shops and cafes 
Traditional Korean house,This is a cluster of Korean houses (Hanok) situated nearby the palaces in Gangbok.Most of the houses have been modernised but maintained the traditional Korean architecture design.It’s on an incline and may be a challenge for older people or parents with strollers.Generally a residential area and will have to observe general etiquette when visiting this area.
A nice traditional village,"It's a nice traditional village that located in a big modern city. Here, you can admire korean traditional architecture through hanok house. There are some cute souvenir shops here. It takes time if you come here for the first time because there are many corners so that you have to explore to looking for nice spot for photos. Be quiet because it's residence area. You can rent hanbok outside and come here to take some great photos. And don't forget to check Baek Je In museum house. You can enter the house. It's really nice"
A route only for the healthy and adventurous,"We spent so little time there in the morning, as we brought our parents. We visited a nice cafe inside that served delicious muffin and drinks.Some of the routes are steep, and require good stamina. Heck, we just stayed for around 30 min walking and maybe another 30 in that cafe. We just had a couple of good photos (since we were all dressed in hanbok) and left.Maybe if I travle with friends someday I will visit this village again, maybe even make a traditional stamps or two. But travelling as a family... I won't recommend this place."
Nice place to visit but there are so many people,"Many nice traditional houses, there are so many shops and cafes on walking street. But it’s so crowded, some people talk loudly even though they have attention boards. It made us not enjoyable, although its great place to visit. Luckily we went to another part, its a short street. less people "
Very pretty,"Picturesque village, can have a walk around, and look at the old style buidlings, also lots of souvenir shops and food"
Picture Perfect ,We rent a hanbok in Bukchon Hanok Village. It was a beautiful place for taking pictures in a hanbok. Many historic and ancient korean house there. Overall it's beautiful.
Long walk for nothing,"It was nothing like in the pictures, and way more smaller. If you come here, you won’t be able to understand what is a traditional Korean village. It looks like it just visited to be the perfect instaspot, but even for that, you’ ve to be in the perfect position, otherwise it’s nothing."
Beautiful but busy,A super place to see some traditional Korean architecture but it can get busy with tourists taking photos. Be sure to get there as early as possible to avoid the lunchtime rush and enjoy the cultural alleyways in peace.
Traditional Korean Houses,"Lovely neighborhood with privately owned hanoks. Start out at the Tradional Cultural Center and pick up a free detailed area map. The Cultural Center has restrooms and displays of typical hanok houses that you can peek inside. Shops and restaurants are along the way although on a Tuesday morning there did not seem to be many places open but the crowd was also sparse. Signage is good at helping one find the way. Some of the streets are steep. We took the metro getting off at Anguk Station, exit 3."
Korean national dress optional!,"Probably the quaintest part of Seoul, this neighborhood is a great place to spend a Sunday morning. Wander up and down the hill and look at the beautiful old houses with incredible details. There are cafes, small shops, and galleries dotted around for refreshment or a spot of shopping. There are also shops renting our Korean national costumes, perfect for an IG moment!"
Nice To Walk Around - 很值得走一走,"It is nice to walk around the area if you are in the city. Up & down hills with ancient houses, nice small shops & restaurants, cozy cafe & design goods, this is the area worths to spend at least couple hours. Popular cafe houses, restaurants, photo taking spots & local and ancient life sightseeing can be all found.如果你在首爾，這裡肯定適合走一走，上坡下坡於老房子、很不錯的小店和餐廳、舒服的咖啡廳和設計小店，這個地方可以花個幾小時慢慢走一走，有名又受歡迎咖啡、餐廳、拍照熱點和當地又古老的生活在這裡都找得到。"
Beautiful area,"This is just gorgeous, it is worth the steep and long walks, a lot of empty, narrow and cute sidewalks and streets great views and great spots for photos. This is an amazing area to feel the traditional Korean culture. "
Beautiful traditional place,"I love this place, very beautiful. Don’t forget to have some handmade dumplings after walking around and taking lots of photos "
What an amazing place,We visited on a Sunday morning while it was quiet. So able to walk around freely before the crowds. Amazing photo opportunities along the route. Ditch the guide book and just go for a wonder. Free museum and galleries also made for interesting tour. Steep roads in some places. What an amazing place the neighbourhood was aliving museum. Well worth the 3.8mile walk. 
Korean Traditional Houses and Practices,"Try walking around this area maybe around 1pm for you to be able to enjoy every traditional practice they can offer, including weaving, doll/crafts making, paintings, house scents and even food because it all closes at 6pm. They also offer wearing of Hanbok for only 7000KRW in one day.The area is a community, with people living in the old houses so they have these signs which tells you to minimize your noise. But when you walk around, it feels like tradition meets modernization. Roofing of houses are still old but there are newer buildings which conforms to traditional architecture. And try to spot the house of their ""national"" artists (or so i thought) living in the area.The people in the neighborhood are friendly too, they will tell you which way to go and what to do on the area, and there are also Tourism officers dressed in red where you can ask questions."
Traditional houses,"I visited this place in the afternoon at 1630hr to avoid the morning tour groups. There were pockets of visitors exploring this area. It is a general uphill walk to view the traditional houses in narrow lanes, called hanok, that dated back to the Joseon Dynasty.Most of these houses are private residential, hence there are many signs as well as staff to remind visitors to lower their noises. Some of these hanoks operate as souvenir shops, restaurants and tea houses. Well worth a visit together with the nearby palaces."
very traditional,"if you would like to experience old Korea, I strongly recomend to go Bukchon rather than Insadong. Bukchon is less commerciallization. "
clean and nice neighborhood,Nice place to visit when you are in the area. You can find nice traditional houses but of course you can only take pictures outside since people actually live in them.You need to be quiet too.
Interesting,"If you like long walking, looking at old buildings. Then this is for you. I don't think it's really suitable for people who have difficult in walking because some place as hilly. In order to visit this place, it is very near to Anguk station. After visiting this place, you can also go to Unhyeongung Palace which is around Anguk station as well"
A walk through the past,A must do when in Seoul. Make sure to rent a hanbok before walking through this area to have a complete experience. Just make sure to respect the residents of the area and keep your noise at a minimum. 
One of my favorites spots in Seoul.,"Cobble line streets, historical neighborhoods, swanky cafe's, eateries, easy access by metro, quaint neighborhoods make this one of my top destinations in Seoul."
Not worth it,"We went on a very hot day, after reading our tourist guide we found our way there very easy , but how disappointing, the normal cheap tacky tourist shops at the entrance , and then what looked like new houses trying to look old , very steep hill going up , nothing really to see, big disappointment .Glad I never paid a guide to take us there ."
Must come for the restaurants after,"According to data by the Bukchon Traditional Culture Center, 30,000 people visited the area in 2007. However, after the village was featured in television programmes, such as 1 night 2 days and Personal taste , the number rose to 318,000 in 2010. In 2012 the figure is expected to double to more than 600,000.During the Korean War, in between 37°N and 38°N was totally destroyed particularly Seoul and this old village was the only refurbished and awarded by UNESCO for their effort to resurrect the Korean Cultures.Due to too many tourists overwhelmingly the neighborhood, Sunday was closed. Although this is a must place to visit but is not worth the while for hours of walking around. However, there are a number of good restaurants nearby that you must try and perfectly blended into your tour schedule."
TRADITIONAL HOMES--WORTH A SHORT VISIT,"This was part of our tour of South Korea and Mongolia..The village a good spot to see traditional Korean homes, but it does involve a fair amount of walking. These are occupied dwellings, so one can only see the facades and roofs of the houses."
Silence please,You have to be sensitive when you go to this place because this is a residential area. It has many souvenir shops and ice cream shops.Old housesYou will see many peopke wearing hanbokOutdoor activity
"nice to visit but be warned, a lot of walking and hiking","it is very tiring to climb all the hills just to get to the photo scenic spots, but i think they're worth it..? the view is really nice. on the base of the path there are some shops around too. i wouldn't go again, but once is good enough :)"
Charming traditional Korean houses in a hilly village ,Bukchon Hanok Village is located to the east of Gyeongbokgung and I guess in the olden days the houses here would be likely to be owned or occupied by people who worked in the palace.This is a charming village with old Hanok houses and some modernised houses. It is a residential area so there are signs and staff reminding tourists not to talk loudly.Some boutique shops offer hanbok (Korean dresses) for rent so you could take pictures wearing the traditional dress.Some sections are quite steep so be aware.
Experience traditional Korean housing,Wandering the streets and alleyways of the Bukchon Hanok Village is both entertaining and educaitonal and helps one appreciate classic building methods.
nice for photos,there are really beautiful traditional houses originally built by royal family members and noblemen who wanted to be close to the palace. 
Tired but worth it ,"The village is located on the hill, so you have to walk up a bit. To avoid being lost, you can get a map from tourist information before entering "
Must visit place,"if you are looking for traditional Korean building, but not a theme park? Bukchon Hanok village is the right place to visit. It is close from palace and samcheongdong. you will see tons of tourist around this area, but you will find out why so many people visit this place when you actually see the place."
residential village with beautiful buildings,Take a walk thru this residential area with beautiful korean style buildings - whispering is necessary as the residents should not be bothered. it is a steep walk but worth it. At the entrance some nice souvenir shops to visit. 
Pretty as a Postcard,"Some dress in the hanbok costumes to do Instagram photos. It's just very picturesque with the hanok houses with tiled pagoda roofs, beautiful doors, walls, flowers, etc. Walking up the alleys there are lots of tourists and one needs to respect the residents and keep the noise down. This traditional Korean village is between the palaces and so worth walking around in to just see the beauty of this architecture."
See The Open House,"The walk through this traditional neighborhood was enhanced by visiting a home that the city had acquired and opened to visitors. We were able to walk into the courtyard and then after removing our shoes, enter the house where 3 rooms were available to us to walk through. In one room, traditional tables and chairs were setup on the floor but it was not so easy to sit down. In the other rooms were displays of vases made out of wood and a person was available to answer questions. We continued walking through the very narrow and sometimes steep streets looking at the other homes and cafes. We also stopped by the Bukchon Traditional Crafts Experience Center which was a building that housed a number of local craftspeople who taught you about traditional Korean crafts for a small fee."
Holiday,"I heard so much about this place I had to go. The issue for me is I was expecting a self contained village of original traditional style. The buildings are styled in the traditional sense but they are mixed between modern apartments and houses. There is really only one street with the same style of housing and the sight of air conditioners, wiring and hot water services detracts from the traditional aspect. There are attendants at each end of the street holding signs asking people not to make noise as this disturbs the residents. There are a few souvenirs shops and some very modern cafes in the village. Pleasant to look at overall but nothing like the promotion given to the area. "
Area with traditional houses,"Bukchon village is actually a private housing estates prized with traditional Hanok houses. Hence, there will be volunteers to ask you to not to make too much noises to avoid disturbing the residences. It is located near the gyeongbukhung and changdeokgung palace grounds and within walking distance from Anguk station. It is just an area with lots of traditional houses where you can rent Hanboks and walk around the area for photo taking. It is a very tiring climb and not recommended for older folks with knee issues. But the hike up is worth is for the magnificent view. We did not pay for the observatory as the view up on the hill was good enough. Worth a visit but only if you are in the area."
Buchon Hanok village,Beautiful place to be. Great view from the top of the hill. I heard a the place is popular for filming Korean TV dramas.
Wish to have one unit,It was amazing the way it was built. Have a hard time walking to the top and we made it. I am impressed with structural design even though the buildings aged with the passing of time. Great place to visit.
Do visit with a guide,The area is not very big but you can get disoriented and end up going around in circles. Best to go with a local or plan your walking route well. Buildings here are beautiful and some are renovated so you can spot the difference roofing modern and original. Do look out for the beautifully hand crafted clay tiles in some of the original roof of the Hanoks. Do make a stop at the Baek Inje House in Gahoe-dong area. This is free and you can see the interior layout of a typical Hanok house. Absolutely beautiful! 
Worth a visit,"Great to visit traditional village and see that these homes are still lived in. A lot of them have been turned into tea houses , souvenir shops etc. There are some that offer workshops in various Korean crafts. Beware- it is all uphill."
Great place to spend a few hours,"Nice place to walk and spend a few hours, some good shops and cafesPostcard perfect views of old against a backdrop of new."
Quiet place,Nothing much to see except some old houses and nice ice cream. Go if you have extra time. I won't go again. 
Cute part of town,"The area nearby to the palace has some of the traditional Korean housing as well as some interesting shops. It is a residential area, so visitors are exhorted by signs and uniformed monitors to keep their voices down in respect for the residents.Set in the side of a hill the streets are narrow and winding and there are some cute houses that evoke another time. Shops include art galleries and unique crafts - a great place to find that special souvenir."
Bukchon Hanok Village is Great!,"My daughter and I wandered the streets in the Bukchon Hanok Village and enjoyed tea and rice cakes at a cafe. It was a lovely place, with a wonderful sense of history. I imagine the residents to be very patient as there were many sighteseers walking the streets when we visited there. "
Picturesque glimpse of the past,"This historic area is definitely worth a visit while you're in Seoul. I went on a weekday, so it was less crowded than I've heard it gets at the weekends. You'll encounter many people walking around in traditional clothing they've hired for the day - this adds to the atmosphere if you set your imagination to work! The village is hilly and very pretty in the springtime, with some great views over nearby areas of Seoul. The village is still a residential area and offers a contrast to the modernity of all the high-rise apartment buildings, and a link to the past."
A good meander... but SHHHHH!,"Took a lovely walk through the housing area, just a quick turn off from Samseong-dong. The terrain was hilly and be prepared to use your calves!"
Somewhat underwhelming,"There’s no clear path to follow through this traditional village in a sense that, you just wander through the streets but aren’t told where to look or what to look at. We found this didn’t allow us to properly engage with the location, and as a result we most likely didn’t get the most out of our visit. Some of the houses you see will be the most beautiful in the entire city, but it’s still hard to distinguish what’s what here."
Picturesque,"Great to look at, you feel you've stepped back a century. Other than that novelty bear in mind it's a residential area so doesn't really have anything other than the experience of the traditional houses (from the outside only) to offer. Great photo ops."
Ok,Not bad but not a lot to see. Fairly packed with tourists even on a rainy day. Expected more to be honest. 
Way too crowded,"The houses look great and it's nice to walk around here, but it was absolutely packed with tourists."
Good to see their traditional places alike..,"This is people's housing area/resident. At same time they do business such as rent Hanbok, tea/coffee shop, souvenirs.. You can spend sometime here and need to walk up to high slope across all the street. The scenery here is beautiful. You can take few pics on how this unique street looks so traditional and beautiful. I guess for me, its a bit too hype on this place but for me i would give just a average review. Actually nothing much u can do here.. Surrounded by buildings."
Some old and some new,"Bukchon Hanok Village is situated in the middle of modern part of the city. Once you find it, the area is beautiful and you can enjoy a walk through the hillyneighbourhood of traditional Korean houses. Because the houses are occupied, all you see are the outside. Below the village, there are restaurants and shops catered for tourist.A 'must' visit attraction in Seoul, no sure."
Great mix of traditional and new,"Really enjoyed the walk around this hilly neighborhood. Clearly it’s gone thru changes and you’d need some money to live here, but the mix of new and old and the views made it a great tourist experience"
Well preserved old traditional korean houses (Hanok),"Beautiful area on the hill with small alleys, many still inhabited traditional korean houses (Hanok). Need a bit of hike and from the top of the village we can see good view of Seoul. A must visit attraction in Seoul. Quite crowded with tourists, but still can find some quiter areas."
Nice,We like it here nice and relaxing and quite too you can walk around here and outside have a lot restaurant and shopping too
very romantic!,A nice romantic local korean village. Walk in korean costume to have great photos!!Also has lots of small restaurants to try.
A moment to reflect ,"We were lucky enough to walk through the streets to the less crowded ones and come across the Bukchon Observatory ... when no one was there. It was 3000 per adult, which included a beverage and a balcony to sit and contemplate the scene and passage of time of the 600 year old village below. We enjoyed tracing our way up and over the hill and admiring the detail of the homes while respecting the privacy of the residents in the area who are constantly faced with the selfie stick / Instagram crowds chattering away and blocking the streets or posing with private property rather than simply enjoying the architecture and vibe of the area. "
Definitely a Must Visit!,It was like being transported back in time. Definitely a must just to observe and admire the architectural feats alone. Take the time to explore this cultural gem. You will not be disappointed!
Vies,This place is a good visit with great view and peace Cos the there are residents leaving in those houses. There’s a nice cafe on the way to the cafe. Can have it before or after 
History meets modern ,"This place was great to see such old homes, however some have high tech door bells from Samsung so old meets modern! I would highly suggest visiting here"
Korean Traditional village in Seol,Just a few minutes away from Gyeongbokgung Palace and Changdeokung Palace lies on top of the hill is the Bukchon Hanok Village. Before entering the village were told by our tour guide to observe silence and respect the neighborhood. Strolled a few alleys quitely and took pictures of Korean Houses for memories sake. Spent around 30 minutes aound the area and proceeded our next stop.
Well worth wandering round,"Was glad to have been accompanied by a guide who explained the background to this “preserved” area and the various anomalies of ugly, more modern buildings whose time, thankfully, may be up soon"
Traditional houses in korea,"If you are interested in architecture and how the Korean houses are constructed, this is one place that you have to visit to enjoy it. The houses are simply beautifully crafted and the place is peaceful. Getting there by foot after morning of much sightseeing nearby sights can be quite tiring as there are quite a number of slopes to walk through."
Beautiful traditional houses,Visited the village in the weekend and it was very crowded with tourists taking pictures in traditional clothing. The houses looks great and are obviously still inhabited so visitors are requested to be quiet!
Tradisional house,"In this village, you will see a lot of Traditional Korean House with various model. A lot of tourist will take picture witb the background of this house. This is a must to go place if you visit seoul."
Below initial expectations but worth to take the walk,"We expected to see something else, so slight disappointment. But many people around with traditional dress for photo shooting, interesting architecture make it enough sexy to take the walk."
Don’t miss,"Don’t miss this place. This is one herritage place with lots of thing to do. But must be quiet because this is a real village, there still have people stay here. Almost shops will close at 5 pm. Reccommend be here in the afternoon after visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace."
A breath of Korea inside Seoul,Feel free to visit this traditional pretty neighborhood right in the heart of Seoul! Of course you have to respect the residents and take a quiet walk through the small streets! 
Overrated,"There is ther famous 8 views of the village. You can definitely skip most of it. Or at least i did. Be prepared to climb slopes. The place is still a residental area, so keep your volume done. Too many tourists to take nice photos."
Interesting but not worth going out of the way to see,This was part of a tour and it's lots of traditional houses in a specific part of Seoul. The houses are not open to the public and before you go you are asked not to make too much noise as its residential. There are people there with signs saying don't make too much noise. You really don't see the houses inside it's just the exterior and they are 100 years old it was interesting but I don't think I would make it my business to take time out to go there to see it specifically. It would be nice if one hone was on view. 
Go early or late: Too many tourists!,"Family of 3 adults. We would include this as a PART of your day - early or late. Too many tourists in-between :( However, for those tourists that hire the Hanbok costume … and to see them here... adds for thinking of what it might used to be like in the old days: 600 years ago! Also, just South nearby, is a restaurant called Warm Kitchen, Share Kitchen (opposite the Library and just beyond Pink Butter café in Samcheong-ro 2-gil Road - where you will see a man in a Panda costume to entice you in: don't be put off!) which was a very tasty place for a quick lunch and good value :)"
Overrated,"I feel like this is more a tourist trap than a tourist attraction. Tourist trap because many local businesses overprice their food and drinks, and products.If you want to get the true feeling of a Hanok village, visit the one in Jeonju. Less crowded and great restaurants."
AwesomeExperience ,Highly recommend this place for great photos in your hanbok (traditional Korean dress) There are a few store that allows you to rent these costumes for 18000KW for 3hrs. Please take note that you are only allowed to try on a costume twice. Every other time thereafter you will be charged.Visit the palace and try traditional Korean food at reasonable prices. So many cool places to take the perfect-shot. 
Travel back in time,I'm kindda a history buff so having to experience walking along and inside the urban environment dating back 600 years ago was a chance not to be missed. The houses are so well maintained and beautiful to look at. Love it here!
Beautiful but hard to find,"We got lost searching this place, even when we asked around and was using the Google maps. It was beautiful but a bit crowded. Not really a ""must-see"" in my opinion, but the houses looked beautiful."
Getting to Bukchon Hanoi Village,"I read from previous review that some people got lost when they walked to Bukchon after visiting Gyeongbukong Palace.I suggest that after visiting Gyeongbukong Palace, head towards Subway Gyeongbukong Palce, leave exit 2 and head to Tosochok for the famous ginseng chicken for lunch. After lunch taking the subway 1 stop to Anguk and take the exit to Bukchon. Walked on the main road northwards for about 5-10 mins. You will reached the obvious entrance of the village on the left. Do remember to cross over to the other side and see the other parts of the village. By the time you walked over the other side you will be near Anguk station again. Please use Waver map in Korea. Goggle map can still used but not accurate."
My Mini Family Spring Vacay 2019,"This year we choose spring for our vacation.It was our 2 yrs wishlist and this year we found it by walking from myeongdong area and if we knew it was not far from our hostel stayed back in 2017..We rented a hanbok & we can walk along the area with our hanbok,why not right?Our hanbok this year i can say it was more pretty that our hanbok we wore at Ihwa Mural Village back in 2017 "
MUST SEE PLACE,"If you come to Korea, this is one place you have to come and visit. Place was so clean and people polite and courteous. The view was fantastic. "
Beautiful location frozen in time a little,It is a functional township that sees thousands of tourists every day.Be respectful and be quiet while there.It is a lovely walk. Head into the museum shop just over the top of the street. Has beautiful souvenirs and even some very well priced antiques.
Traditional Korean Houses,It is a lovely residential are with beautiful houses on every street and corner. Here you can see people wearing Hanboks (you can rent them from the shops nearby) walking around. Take a nice leisure stroll along these lanes and you will see the beautiful architecture of these old houses. You will also find delicious and cheap fresh fruits and local sweets sold from a truck. I didn't want to upload pictures of people's homes in respect of their privacy.
Signs telling tourists to stay away,"I'm not sure if we went at a bad time, but there were signs posted everywhere about how the people who lived there were suffering from tourists, and asking tourists to stay away for a while. Near the the entrance, it looked like there was some kind of filming going on (for a news station). We entered, but upon seeing the signs, we left, since we didn't want to disturb them."
Ancient Korea arrchitecture,This is a beautiful village with ancient architecture and traditional house of Korea.Beautiful place to have good photos.You should visit here early morning because of crowed people.
Traditional Village,"A very nice place with steep slope. The area is occupied with residents and offices, good to be there with Hanok to get pretty photos with nice background."
Instagram worthy! ,"The place is about 10-15minutes away from the nearest station. If you are lost, there are friendly tourist guides along the way, who can explain how to get there. Be sure to rent any traditional Korean dresses (hanbok) for that Instagram worthy pictures before going up the hill. Because it is a residential area, tourists are adviced to keep quiet and to not make any noises. There are also lots of coffee shops and cafés nearby for people to rest while taking photos"
Nice Area of Local and Traditional House,It's a residence area. Better come here on early morning because so many people come here to take photos. People shd be quiet if visit this area. Only 1 alley which famous with its hanok house and so many people took photos here with hanbok. But nice to walk around this area and took some photos with hanok style house using hanbok or not. The road is quite step. So it's not for elderly people. Also near to changdeokgung palace.
See the traditional house of Seoul,"i take my kids here to learn the traditional house of Korea, a lots of wonderful home to see, even some of we can't take a picture of it"
First time here!,"Quaint area, love the details of the houses here, and I’m not disappointed with this tour. This time of year is the best time for me, weather is cool, needed to wear jacket. We had a great time, slow paced, totally relaxing tour. "
 Traditional view of Korea,We explored an alley which is famously known for traditional korean house/street. It is located at Bukchon-ro 11-gil street. It has view of namsan tower. We went there around 8pm (weekdays) which less crowd and manage to snap some photos. Just to remember not to make so much noise as the resident might be sleeping. #instagrammableplaceinseoul 
Old village in the city,"If you're looking for a place you can stroll around, this is it. We were there in mid March, there were no sakura blossoms that time. It could have been perfect scenery with the blossoms. The village has the old houses but not as many. It's more like a big park that's a bit hilly with sakura trees. Some people go there for a jog. I recommend this place for those who want to see sakura flowers in April. There might be some event show sometime as I've noticed a stage and benches."
Step Back in Time,Perhaps a 30-minute walk from Gyeongbakgung Palace is the historical village of Bukchon Hanok Village. This extraordinary village is made of up homes from the traditional style of Korean homes. It is still a living village where people live so when you visit you must be respectful of the fact that you are on their residence. The homes are gorgeous and truly bring you back in time. Where comfortable shoes are the streets are hilly and you need to be in good shape. Well worth a visit for a few hours.
Great place to visit,"This is an interesting area to visit, especially on a Sunday when many local people dress in their national costume.The walks are easy and there are some cafes etc on route."
Nice and cute area!,Take the free map at the information center and they tell you which route you can take to see nice houses and cafes. 
good place to see korean culture ,this place is not really a tourist place but Koreans actually stillare living privately in this place. It is a good place to see the old way of life and culture. You need to be very quiet when visiting this place. Nice for picture taking.
Nice but too crowded,"Bukchon Hanok Village is pretty much close to Gyeongbokgung Palace. After visiting the palace, you can walk yourself to this heritage village with ease.PROS:-Paved road going to the village. If you’re bringing kids in strollers, it will be easier.-Since this is located in a residential area, even if there’s a lot of visitors, you will feel the quietness of the area. -Tourism staff are everywhere in case you lose your way. You’ll also see them bringing placards reminding everyone to be quiet.-You will also see a lot of souvenir shops in the area. Some food stalls too in case you need something to munch in.CONS:-There’s nothing much to do other than take photos with the old houses as your background-Tourists flock to the area on a daily basis so be prepared to get your way to get good photos-If you’re bringing a car, there’s not much parking space available as the alleys are really narrow. Street parking is not a good idea.-Get yourself ready for a lot of walking.Will I go back to Bukchon again? Probably not but it’s always good to see these types of heritage at least once."
Bukchon ,"I enjoyed a lot been on this “neighbourhood”, it’s obviously that this is a very ancient place in Seoul. Is very close from the main palace in Seoul, I remember that you have to be like “quiet” in that place cause when I started to talk louder the people from there shut/silenced me. You can take you pictures with the people there, some of them are friendly and some of them are not, there’s also a place for souvenirs that are not very costly."
S.Korea Village,"Place to visit while in Myeongbokgung palace, you can walk or take the bus to the village. They have good restaurant, authentic korean food. Try Beef Bulgogi, chicken soup, and kimchi fried rice."
Disappointing Hanok Village,The village is not so great. Only a small part is beautiful and good for taking photos. Other than that nothing much. I think Jeonju will be much better. 
Korean Traditional Village on a Hill,"It is a residential area where you can see old traditional Korean Houses on a hill. Some are more than 500 years old. Many foreigners rent a Hanbok which is traditional Korean attire and take pictures there. Also, take a picture at the street museum in the urban core. Furthermore, there are many small Korean restaurants and coffee shops in the area...a great place to have lunch. And a great viewing point"
Uphill climb,"Is about 10 mins slow walk from Anguk Station Exit no. 2. Is a residential place. Therefore do keep your voices low so. as not to disturb the locals. Not suitable for elderly as there is quite a fair bit of uphill climb. We went in early afternoon and there was not much crowd. There were little shops, cafes along the way. Is a serene walk. "
Beautiful,This has been kept as a heritage place with all sound boards in Korean.Get a local to explain the details.Have tea and time cakes at a traditional tea house.
Steep walk,"If you're going to Bukchon, best to go in the morning because it gets crowded in the afternoon. The streets are quite a climb so its not recommended for those who tire easily."
City visit,"Unfortunately it is just so busy, full of tourists like ourselves! But these are huge busloads of them and the area to view the houses is just so small. It should maybe be restricted to non bus tours. The houses are so pretty and well kept, good to walk round the tiny little streets. "
Tour,Interesting to visit the outside of the houses in that village. Quite unique as compared to city dwellings. Reminder of done K drama scenes. 
Nice to see,This place is very popular because of the renowned korean moviescenes. Very interesting to see. Along this place are great food and restaurant.
Feels like korean,I am not reqlly a fan of korean novela but I reqlly want to go here and wear their suit. It was a great experience though there’s a lot of tourist who are taking pictures still I m still hooked.
An authentic village - be quited please,There are a famous destination for touristActually there still an houses for the local peopleA crowded place..Every door is noted “please be quite.. dont disturb..”But too bad the tourists is cannot read and dont care... talk aloud.. laugh aloud..I just can psssstttttt....hffffttt too bad
Weektrip Seoul,"Local old Korean style houses, nice to walk through for a while with interesting small shops and craftmanship stores but not that impressive"
This is selfie heaven for Korean people ,"These heritage homes and streets are nicely preserved and presented. It's nice to explore and sample Korean life.It seems to be the number 1 selfie location for Koreans, hire a traditional costum, and join them."
A lovely walk amongst traditional houses. ,It was our first afternoon in Seoul and we wandered around here for a few hours in the spring sunshine. Although it is allegedly closed on Sundays it certainly wasn’t. Many a Korean here dressed in hanbok’s added to the scenes. It may not be suitable for those with walking difficulties as much of it is up and down hills. 
Lovely buildings,"This is less of a village, but more a collsction of old buildings dotted around with one or two streets where the whole areahas been preserved. There is also a new, reconstruction of a hanok building showing their construction. It's interestng walking around the larger area as it's got some nice little shops, coffee bars and food shops. It's also a large residential areas with noise wardens to keep the tourists no use at wispering level. A great idea as it's people's homes and their local street we're walking through.Well worth a visit."
Lovely,"Despite the crowds, this is a lovely place to visit. Seeing the architecture and knowing the history of the area makes it worthwhile. Finish the visit with a pleasant spot of tea at a traditional tea house."
Used to live here. Nice place.,I lived next to bukchon for 18 months. Nice place to wonder around and see some traditional Korean style houses. Just remember people live here so it's not a tourist attraction in the true sense of the word. Be respectful when visiting.
Gorgeousness right in the middle of Seoul,Not necessary to wear your rented Hanbok here but is was gorgeous as easy enough to get to from main palace. This is the place to find a tea house. Sorry that I did not mark the location or name of tea house but the owner mentioned that the home is her inheritance. The teas were excellent and this is a lovely strolling area. 
Cute and old school little village,"Lots of uphill and downhill slopes. The buildings are old school. There are many little shops and coffee/dessert restaurants. It’s a nice stroll around the area. I got a nice fedora for 10,000. "
Cool,This is embarrising but pretty. We ate in the village then we put dresses. Even onni suri she weared the hundok. 
Beautiful Place,"The place is easy to reach by using public transport, it is a traditional Korean houses in the middle of Seoul, it nice to see the old Koreans lifestyle, it is best to visit after 10 AM, befor that the shops are closed, there is a small coffee shop serves tea in old traditional way, good thing is that you can rent a Korean custom and walk in the village."
Unique and beautiful view ,"Over 900 hanok, traditional Korean houses in the middle of Seoul. It supposed to be the place where the royal family used to be live. A popular film location for movies and TV dramas."
A cultural place ,Really enjoyed the scenery at this village as it encompasses the traditional houses built during the Joseon dynasty. The area is really large and some of the houses are open for public viewing. 
Beautiful Hanok collections..,"it was a nice walk at 8am in the morning before tourists starts crowding the neighbourhood (we did not know that tourists are only allowed to visit after 10am, sorry)."
'Bukchon Hanok Village',"According to the 1906 data, it was a gathering place of houses of 'yangban' and bureaucrat.높은 곳에서 한옥들과 저 멀리있는 빌딩을 보고 있으면 묘한 기분이 든다.실제로 주거하시는 분들이 있으니 큰소리로 떠들거나 쓰레기 버리는 행위는 삼가시길.."
Time machine 600 years back to the streets of Korea,"If you’re into history and old traditional buildings, you should add Bukchon Hanok Village to your travel itinerary. Imagine yourself walking through the streets of Korea dating back 600 years. The houses are well maintained with various gift and coffee shops if you need a break from all the walking. If you’re into Instagram, this is where you get the iconic picture of the traditional streets of Korea. There are no cost to visit this destination. However, bring you’re tennis shoes as there’s lots of walking involved."
Beautiful old houses,It's an old valley with old houses that's still preserved til now. It's a residential area so the tourist can't make a loud noise but unfortunately some tourists can't understand that and stil make some noises.
Beautiful place with a view,"Beautiful place with a view!preserved in very good style! very much watched by tourists because for every building there is a sign ""do not enter"" the fact that people live there makes people find it more interesting!"
Peaceful,I really liked that the people hired to work here had one job: to keep things quiet. It made a world of difference. 
No. I sightseeing in Seoul,Buckchon meaning North Village is in fact a residential area with all those traditional Korean old houses. It’s amazing and looks like a film set. We managed to get hold of a map of the area and explored it on our own. There’s a few uphill streets to climb but well worth it.
Interesting and quiet ,"Had a nice Sunday walk around Bukchon Hanok Village. Being between the two palaces, you can do all three in the same day. Would come back and would recommend to friends. "
Nice walk to do,"Located very near the main palace, this old district of Seoul is interesting to visit. You will see traditional old houses and there is a nice view of the city from the top of the hill. "
Near the Gyeongbokgung Palace,"To have less awkward walk towards the village and Gyeongbokgung, better choose the hanok rental place near here. You need to be quite around this village to respect the people living in the area."
A walk to the past... 600 years ago,"A nice walk around the neighbourhood that preserve to showcase an urban environment 600 years ago. Wear Comfy shoes, be prepare to walk up hill! "
Interesting free walking tour ,Joined a free walking tour by the Seoul cultural organisation. The area has a lot of traditional restaurants and some specialty shops. This village is around 600 years old and still has some of the traditional Korean houses for homestay or visit. Quite an enjoyable walk with a nice view of the city and the palaces. I prefer shopping around this place than the famous Gangnam area where all the big international brands are. 
Nice and charming,"old renovated houses, but in a nice area, where you can have an idea how the people used to live. A house is open for the public viewing. "
Bukchon Hanok Village - A treasured heritage,This is a very well kept ancient village that was traditionally the residential quarter of high-ranking government officials and nobility during the Joseon Dynasty. It is a very pictureque place for photos as it is set on on small hill overlooking the fringe of the city.
Art & History,Rent a hanbok in here with a very cheap price. It was so nice to got to experienced walking around the 'village' while wearing a hanbok in a beautiful and artistic design of house and shops
More a precinct than a village.,"It was super fun to walk the narrow roads past beautiful buildings. Especially in Hanbok, which I highly recommend. It is up and down, so if you have knee problems it can be a little challenging. I had lunch at a great little restaurant and did some traditional sweet shopping. They have these lifesaver type lollies that whistle when you blow or suck through them. Entertaining and well annoying, but fun. I also did a Korean knot tying experience. It is really for beginners and available on a walk in basis. You get to choose from two types of bracelets, a key chain and two types of necklaces. Most of it is done for you, it is just a matter of choosing colours, and tying the macrame type knots. No Korean is needed as most have basic English. It was fun, but too simple for me. You can book a class for the more intricate knot projects. Which I will do next time. Just on the side, you sit on the ground, so with my dicky knees this was a little challenging. Also fun in Hanbok as it puffs out around you when seated."
"City views, narrow streets","Located not far from National Folk museum and royal palace. Visit the area if you want to experience anything different from steel, glass and concrete. Plenty of narrow streets going up and down, some houses are old, some are quite modern. Galleries, coffee shops, some places with a nice view from the top."
Average...,"I have brought my family to Japan, Indonesia and Thailand. This Bukchon Hanok Village is average compared to the other places my family has been. My kids took minimal photos..."
A very nice place to walk and take pictures ,This is a very nice place to visit and I like the architecture and the feeling there. It is still a residential area for the locals. I love to take pictures here. Except there are many tourists and hence lots of photo bombs ：）
Blast From the Past,Experience 600 years of history at this village. They have a lot of restos and ingenious shops and it's just nice to get lost on the alleys. You would certainly find something nice at any corner.
Just tourist attraction,This Hanok Village is pure tourist attraction without soul. Area consist several street or alleys with mostly new build look like old style buildings. I didn't really see point of this place? BTW. Hanok Village observation place is somebody's home at third floor. 
Nice stroll to observe traditional architecture,"We took the subway to Anguk station to Bukchon Hanok Village after visiting the Gyeongbokgung Palace and enjoyed an uphill stroll into the traditional village. All the homes are built as low rises with unique roofing characteristic of architecture from 600 years ago. Unless waiting for a unique photo opportunity of the horizon during sunrise or sunset, I would not spend too much time here as there isn't that much to see."
Explore the Traditional Korean residence,"Being close to the center of Seoul, There are many traditional Korean houses(Hanok). This village is definitely a must-visit Seoul attraction for its unique architecture and the traditional Korean streets.Before the trip, I heard that there would be too many people, which would ruin the scenery. So I chose to visit it before the sun rise and hoped to enjoy the golden hour of photography. There were only several people when I came to it, which save me a lot work when taking photos. Walking down the empty streets, I saw many traditional houses and found many unique features of the houses. Generally, the village is a wonderful place to explore the traditional Korean residence and a instagrammable photo location in Seoul."
A lovely traditional village,"This is a traditional village close by the centre of Seoul. Whilst it is quite nice to be able to walk around these traditional houses, it is clear that the hordes of tourists have ruined this area. There are guides around that make it clear you should not be disturbing the peace of the people who live there. However, it is a nice place to walk around as you will be able to get some awesome photos of the unique architecture of Seoul. If you get a chance to find them, there are lots of little tea shops around and you can enter to take a breather from walking around!"
Fascinating walk through a traditional neighbourhood,"Our guide was a retired military man, and he gave us a wonderful tour of this area. He was very knowledgeable, and was able to pass this on in an interesting way. I highly recommend Seoul City Walking tours, they truly are free and provide a great way to see the city."
Good trip,"Had a good experience walking and finding for this famous tourist spot. From the Angguk station it takes 15-20 mins to reach this place. Overall, it was a good trip. "
Nice Traditional Neighbourhood,Came on a quiet cold morning and there were plenty of photo opportunities. Just walk around to enjoy the views and soak in the atmosphere.
An interesting insight into traditional village ,We walked around this traditional Korean village. The area is vast and as such a lot to see. You will be able to see traditional Korean houses back in the olden days. Overall a nice area centrally located. You will also find a lot of locals and tourists dressed up in traditional Korean outfits. It’s a place kids will also enjoy walking around. 
Very interesting,I liked this village because of the old houses and relaxed atmosphere. Lots of little galleries and activities to stop at and learn more about the Korean culture and history.
A nice climb and use your Google Maps,"Lots of small shops while making the way up.You can use your google maps and it will lead you there. Great photo opportunity! 15min walk from Anguk Station. In case you get lost, shop owners are kind to show direction"
Good experience,"I took the subway and get off at Anguk station, exit 12 I believe?? I walked straight and saw the area that is Bukchon village. Once you get out from the exit and walk straight, that whole area is Bukchon village. To get to the main area, you must keep going straight and walk for another maybe 10-15 minutes until you see the CU convience store and then turn right. There, you would see a bunch of traditional Hanok houses, and it was very interesting. I recommend to come here, if you like to experience a traditional feeling of Korea. Around the area, there are things to do and see. You can experience many traditional arts and crafts, there are little shops in every corners for you to dive into, and immersed yourself into what you like to do. There are many restaurants and gift stores nearby too. Also, you can wear and rent traditional Hanbok and wear it, while you go around your business in seeing the Hanok village. Overall, it was a great experience, and I sure would go back."
"Very picturesque, so different","Very much enjoyed walking around. Very pretty, so many unusual doorways, locks etc to photograph, so I took lots of photographs, many enhanced by young people in traditional dress. Not to be missed. I felt sorry for the residents, as despite notices everywhere asking people to be quiet, not many people took any notice. With three days notice, you can get a free guided tour from a volunteer from Seoul city government.Can reach by Metro line 3 to Anguk, exit three"
Korean Houses,I think we just need 1 hour to explore this place. Only for photostop around the korean houses and there are many shop for rental hanbok and some souvenir shops
Pleasant neighborhood of traditional Korean houses,"A place where you’ll see a glimpse of Korean traditional houses called “hanok”. There are actually residents staying in the houses so tourists are advised to lower down their voices. It’s a steep walk so elderlies may tire walking up the lane..most of the houses have walls so you can only see the front gates or doors and rooftops.. if you’re in a tight schedule, you can skip this place."
interesting area of traditional houses and streets,"You can rent traditional dresses and visit the neighbourhood dressed with it. It is a very good idea. We saw very old and pretty houses, well renovated. And the area also offers stylish shops and restaurants which we visited during our 60 minutes there."
A place for your IG post,"It is good to know the infrastructures and culture of the old seoul but it is quite tiring to walk through the slopes, not really suitable for old people. Snaps some nice photo and have some tea at the tea house will do. "
Don't miss this place but respect the residents by keeping the noise low,"Bukchon Hanok Village is a quiet Korean traditional village. It has long history and composes of tight alleys, traditional yet beautiful houses. However, the village is still houses to many Koreans so there's a lot of signages requesting the tourists to keep the noise level down. Do also note that the alleys are quite steep so may not be suitable for the elderly to visit this place. Overall, a beautiful place to visit but remember to keep your noise level low."
Lovely Traditional Village,It was an amazing experience that you still could admire the traditional architect of old Korean houses. The village is a residential place with many lovely souvenir shops and tea houses. Be quiet and respect people who live here.
a different kind of experience,"Bukchon village is a very different kind of experience - puts a smile on your face. Narrow streets with cute houses, very different from other tourist spots one will visit. This is a residential area and these are peoples' homes, so please be respectful and quiet. We are glad we went there."
"Beautiful, quiet village","I took the subway to go to Bukchon Hanok Village. Stopped at Anguk station and walked around 300m to reach the village. This is where you can find hundreds of beautiful traditional houses which date back to the Joseon dynasty. These traditional houses operate as guesthouses, restaurants, tea houses, and souvenir shops. A good place for a calming evening stroll."
Worth the visit,We took the subway here which was very convenient. This is a nice little neighborhood that has kept the old traditional architecture which is a nice change from the modern high rises of Seoul. There are some houses that are open to the public but keep in mind to take off your shoes and to be respectful to the residents by keeping voices low. There are plenty of public restrooms which are surprisingly clean. Worth the visit!
Pleasant walk,Visited the Bukchon Hanok village on a cold Friday afternoon. We enjoyed the very pleasant walk through the sands of time. Nice friendly shopkeepers along the way too. We really loved the views of old Seoul juxtaposed against views of modern Seoul in the background. A must see. 
Visiting a 600 year old urban environment,This is a place where visitors should visit. It has a very long history and located in between Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung. This village was traditionally the residential quarter of high-ranking government officials and nobility during the Joseon Dynasty.
A hint of cultural history with a mix of modernity,"It was pretty nice seeing the people were able to preserve the styles of their houses, and the vibe of the street even though south korea is a first world country. Fitted along antique doors however, are electronic doorbells and other high tech gate control systems, which parks the residents' kia and hyundai vehicles."
Don't go out of your way,"It's a village with actual people living there. There is nothing to do besides taking pictures, and the village is actually pretty little so don't expect to stay here for long."
Boring but a Must See,"Not as exciting as I hoped it would be, but it was December and the middle of Winter, which also made it unpleasant.The architecture and village layout is fascinating, but unless we missed the right spots and location, there was not much to see.Please research before you go."
Seeing bukchon on pedicab,"Well, touring Bukchon on pedicab is quite interesting but seeing the young chap peddling so hard somehow made you feel a little awkward. It’s not cheap so I hope he is well rewarded for his hard work.Apart from that feeling, seeing the village on pedicab is quite enjoyable! You could see things in slow pace as the “cab” weaving through the alleys where cars are not allowed!"
Interesting Tour,Toured the village with a group of students. They provided some interesting tidbits on the buildings. Generally all you can see is the outside of the entire village as the area is actually the homes of the local population. Interesting visit but nothing spectacular.
well preserved and informative tour,we toured this village and went thru the whole village with its peaceful courtyard. we learnt of its history. highly recommend 
Korean Tour,"Back to old times. Enjoy the ambience of old Korean dynasty, old houses are well maintained and be quiet when roaming around because its a residential area"
Traditional beauty of Korea,"Please feel the traditional beauty of Bukchon Hanok Village, where people still live. And please refrain from any action that interferes with their lives."
Good sightseeing place,"I don’t think have to write long review for this place since Bukchon is one of the most tourist spot in Seoul. Tips from me that you have to come here earlier if want to take many pictures because this place will be very crowded if you came later. Also, please be quiet. There’s some places also not allowed you to take a picture so mind the sign."
A Glimpse of the Past,"A hilly neighborhood with hundreds of traditional houses or hanoks bating back to Joseon Dynasty, this Bukchon Village which is in the north-central part of Seoul lies between Gyeongbok and Changdeok Palace. Though most of these Hanoks have been converted into tea houses, restaurants or guest house, art galleries, some are still held privately. Lot of efforts have gone into these hanoks to keep the original form intact. The village also has an old well called Seokjeong Full Moon well which in ancient times was the main source of water for the entire village. It is believed that this well provided clear good drinking water only for fifteen days and unclear water for the next fifteen days. The village women is said to have also believed that drinking this water helped them to bear a male child.Not to be missed, the attraction requires lot of walking so for those your are regular walkers may find it a bit difficult here.This place can be easily reached thru the city bus or metro. The visit to this place can also be clubbed along with G Palace."
Bukchon Wanderings,"This is a picturesque neighbourhood where a large cluster of privately owned traditional Korean houses has been well preserved for a long period. The village used to be an upscale residential area for wealthy aristocrats and court employees. The traces of old roads and waterways, as well as the stones and timber dwellings, rewind the present to centuries long past. The village has retained it's original shape and feature historical sites and cultural properties that tell the history of Joseon and modern Korea."
A glimpse of history in Seoul. ,Reachable via metro orange line and off at Anguk station and about 10-15 minutes walk north and you won’t miss the place. It’s crowded and hard to take a good photo but if you’re lucky it’s a nice nostalgic place especially if you’re wearing their traditional hanbok dress! Be Very careful when you rent the dress since every additional ornament is chargeable. People are warned not to make to much noise since the place is actually residential but most tourists can’t resist making loud voices! It is advisable to come here during week days to avoid over crowding. 
"Too crowded, save up and visit Jeonju for better experience.","The place is too crowded and you cannot make too much noises, because its a village of private houses!It is very easily reached from Insadong trip, walking about 10 -15minutes from there. The village is not big, but walking uphill of the village was worth it as you get to see some beautiful scenery too.Overall, you guys should visit Jeonju Hanok Village instead."
Quick photo ,"Maybe because there were just too many tourists when we were there to take any nice photos. However, still interesting to know that these traditional houses actually have residents staying inside. "
Nothing really fantastic ,"If you do have extra time, you may consider visiting this place, otherwise I do not feel it is really worth the visit. It was just a stretch of houses which resembled the ancient time. Time spent there is around 15-30mins"
Worth a visit if you come to Korea,"Old heritage house built hundred years ago . Close to the palace where still have the residents live in. Good location for many tourists to change to korean costume and take picture in this village. Nothing really big deal to me once you have visited to china. However, too many through out the year and hard to talk a good pictures in my view.. "
Walking trail to see traditional house,"You get to spend approx 1.5-2hrs to see local traditional houses.Besides, you can rent the Hanok from the shops and take some nice photos.Along the way, you can get see the high school featured in goblin Korean drama "
Nice area to visit and walk around,"Great area to visit and walk around. Really pretty and close to the Gyeongbokgung Palace, Insa Dong and Jogyesa temple. Great free activity and would allow 30 min - 1 hour to walk around."
Wonderful place to explore ,"Do take your time to explore the neighborhood. Wonderful architecture and feel of the place is amazing. Plenty of nice eateries. But do be respectful as you walk around the residential area. People still do stay in those houses. Being Respectful includes not talking at the top of your voices. Seriously, no one enjoys having so many tourists /outsiders thronging your front yard whole day long.. "
Convenient location for quick snaps,"There are multiple Hanok Villages scattered across Seoul. This was a convenient stop for us as it's near the downtown palaces and a ~20 minute walk to my hotel. Getting to the top most vantage point is quite a steep vertical climb, and footfall here is high. Many tourists will invade the residents' front porches to take photos for the 'gram, such that the residents have put up CCTVs and signs to protect their privacy. There's another on the Seoul City Bus Tour that may be more comfortable and convenient to get to. The architecture there also seemed nicer there from street view."
Lovely architecture,"Great place, unique architectureEnjoyed the visit, people wearing local costumes.Enjoyable trip! Rafael"
Nice Afternoon Walk,"Great place to spend a few hours strolling. Do try to get away from the crowds a bit as the scenery becomes much more enjoyable. Also, while not all visitors will be, it is best to be as courteous and quiet as you can as this is a neighborhood and not Time Square. "
A vintage vibe of Seoul,Best to stroll in this area in the afternoon for a quiet shopping or coffee time. Loved the vibe!! Recommended for the down times of your trip.
Nice to experience Korean tea and items.,"Just walk along the road deep inside the Village.You will find traditional Korean tea houses, restaurants, and item shops.However, be aware of the residents. They dislike too loud voice."
Heritage Visit,Went to Bukchon and be amamzed bybthe traditional houses still situated in the city. A lot of famous korean dramas and movies are made there as the palace is still well maintained. Nice sunset if you go at the right time. 
Give them a break please,"The village has nice traditional Korean houses. However, they are suffering from tourism. The houses are mostly occupied but families living in them. But tourists are not letting them live happily and with privacy. There are signs by the residents (see photos) indicating that they are suffering. There are signs on most doors asking people to not open doors/knock on them. There are also staff with yellow vests asking tourists to be quiet as they visit the village. Yet, I witnessed so many people talking loudly, knocking on doors and trying to go inside, and many other disturbing behaviors. This is unsustainable and unethical tourism. There are many other places in Korea where you can find that style of architecture. Do yourself and the village a favor and skip this place - let the locals live. I would’ve skipped if I was aware of this problem."
Charming,Strolled through the village following a recommended walking tour provided by a tourist info center. Charming traditional houses. You could go inside a couple of them. Some areas with shopping & restaurants. Many people wandering about in traditional Korean dress added to the experience
Definitely worth a visit,"This is a village with traditional houses beautifully conserved. These are both owner-occupied as well as converted into shops selling jewellery, souvenirs and restaurants. You can also get a walking map of the Bukchon Hanok Village from the tourist centre nearby. Definitely worth a visit. Do note that the elderly and those who have difficulty in walking will find this place challenging. "
"Picture perfect, just be quiet and respectful","People actually live here, so it's best to mind your manners and your volume. If you reside here, you wouldn't be pleased with noisy uninvited tourists either.If you have time, check out the Baek In-Je House Museum. It's worth the time and it's free (with clean toilets by the entrance)."
I love this neighborhood ,"I have visited this area about 5 times. I just love the boutiques, the dining is great. One finds beautiful little stores with wonderful items from great shoes, coats, scarfs to tea and coffee places. In addition the Village delights the visitors with ancestral architecture. I just love this place!"
Tour trip,A nice photographic view of traditional Hanok houses. Not allowed to make noise as this is still housing area to some. 
Probably glorious without tourism infrastructure ,"Well-maintained and surely different from 'Seoul' but crowded with boutique fashion shops, coffee bars and such taking away the charm of an ancient place. "
Bukchon Hanok village is limited Hanok houses,Bukchon Hanok village is confined to just 2 streets of main bukchon. It is limited Hanok houses as compared to Jeonju Hanok village which is world UNESCO site. Some of these houses are converted to guest houses for rent.
Lovely historical architecture in seoul,I enjoy visiting bukchon hanok village when in Seoul. It is easily accessible from anguk train station. Though be aware that there is a lot of walking in some quite steep areas. People live and work in these houses so in the evening they have staff posted asking the many tourists to please be quiet. At one part there is a street if interesting stalls and eating places . A lot of people dress in national costume to take photos here and a lot of wedding photos are also take here. Take your time and wear good walking shoes and visit some or all of the open dwellings whilst meandering throhgn
A taste of old Seoul,This is a residential area in Seoul and one should have that in mind when visiting the place. It is made of small private homes with history boasting 600 years. The houses are small made with wood and stone on a very peculiar architectural style. Some were turned into small restaurants and coffee shops giving you a chance to see the inside of the houses. Some locals wearing yellow jackets can help you through the narrow streets. The visit should not take long and it is definitely a spot you should not miss.
Lovely houses but overcrowded,"Well there are some really nice old houses in the area, but there are hundreds of tourists as well. As the area consists of just some little streets it is absolutely overcrowded. There are several people from the tourist bureau holding up signs „quiet please“ because it is a residential area and people do live here. Well, I am sure on one hand it is an expansive neighborhood, but I would not love to have a house in those streets with hundreds of tourist passing by each day.So basically: as described by someone else already: overrated, not really worth to go."
Beauty in Silence,"We were told to make little to no noise as we ascend our way up the village. If you are a fan of K-dramas like me, then you would definitely see some familiar sights. Posters of no loud talking, and proper waste disposals were plastered everywhere. Our guide told us, that residents from this area got annoyed at first because tourists came barging in disturbing their everyday flow. It is one of the country's villages that was preserved and protected by the Korean government. So as a win-win solution, tourists are allowed to the village with the condition to respect the rules set by the residents. The village is closed every Sunday to allow the villagers to enjoy their private space. I really love how it is incorporated in the modernity of its surroundings. You will not also go hungry and thirsty on your way up because there are food stalls in the area. Really worth seeing!"
Nice place for korean drama,Here this place for many many korean drama shooting... very famous for everyone... you can see beautiful scenery about palace etc from up up here... you can rent hanbok if you want... with local house that you can use to take photo
Overrated ,"Although it is considered as an iconic historical dite in Seoul, the truth is that this street is quite overrated, crammed with tourist, and the people living in this area are so tired of tourist visiting this street that they have posted “keep quiet” and “do not come in” signs all over the street.The whole visit is uphill so, if taking a stroller or wheelchair along for the ride keep this in mind.The ice cream shop at the first turn of the street, near the entrance, is quite good."
It’s cool I guess,"Worth going if you just want to see some old houses in Korea, but if you’re in Korea for a while you should go to Jeonju instead. That’s a whole town full off old school houses, this is two streets. Nice streets, though! "
Good for strolling,"You probably know what you're expecting to see when you get here. We also came here to shop at Gentle Monster's flagship store at Gyedong-gil. The store has been converted from a bathhouse. They have preserved the history by merging the design. Tiled floors, bathtubs and the fragrance!! Must visit and shop at if you're a Gentle Monster fan!"
A place to kill time ,It’s a good place to go if you want to wonder and browse. There’s plenty of food options in the area. If you’re short on time you could give this place a miss. 
A beautiful architectural traditional part of Seoul,A really lovely area in Seoul where you have traditional Korean architecture.A wonderful place to go for shopping and eating. We just strolled about and tried out some of the superb Korean bakeries.Easy to get to on the metro.
Old folk village,A nice place to see because it is surrounded by high rise building. Hanok village is a traditional korean house. You can feel korean tradition in this place. 
free admission,This showcase village depicts ancient korean life with mannequins in an old setting. It's free admission but the entrance is a bit difficult to find. We stumbled upon it.
Traditional Neighborhood that felt Touristy!,"I really enjoyed my time wandering the streets at Bukchon Hanok Village, but I felt it was a little to touristy. There were crowds of people walking up the hill to get here, and shops near the entrance, with groups walking all over the place. Sometimes, I actually felt bad for the people that live in this village. Put that aside, the majority of the small houses here were traditional and cute. Some of the hills and alley ways were a climb, but made for great photo opportunities. I did not have a plan and just walked around the village looking at the interesting architecture. This village is well worth a visit, but don't treat it like a tourist destination."
A bit gentrified but still worth visiting,.... great to eat stuff but stuff. Look at stuff. There is an amazing traditional woodworking museum round the corner up the hill close to palace. Not on the map but great!!!!!
Seoul Traditional Korean Village,If you are in Seoul you should take some time to visit this Bukchon Hanok Village. You can get a taste of how the history of Korean architecture of their homes
Beautiful Traditional Village,"I visited the Bukchon Hanok Village to experience the traditional Korean Houses which are said to be well-preserved over 600 years. It was an amazing experience as you can still appreciate the traditional architecture of old Korean houses first-hand. But I have to warn you that the route is quite hilly and sometimes you can get ""lost"" if you are not mindful enough. But the real challenge is its hilly path. If you are up for an adventure and is fit enough, this is a must visit place in Seoul. To go there just take Subway Line 3 (Orange Line) and alight at Anguk Station and use Exit 3. It will take you there."
A nice maze like village to get lost in. Quiet please!,"This is still a residential area for the locals, so we should respect that and be mindful how 'noisily excitable 'one can be when in throes of wonderment of the beautiful and authentic style of yesteryear homes. These are quite amazing to look at and a good area to get lost in. Unfortunately, precisely because it is a residential area, there are no public facilities ( other than the shops). Good for a half day walking tour."
The most beautiful neighborhood in Seoul ,No visit to Seoul would be complete without a stroll through the Bukchon Hanok Village. Wander through the hilly neighborhood and imagine what it was like walking in Seoul hundreds of years ago. You can rent Hanbok (traditional Korean formal dress) for both sexes at numerous rental places nearby to wear for a few hours or a day to enhance your Bukchon Hanok Village experience. The best photo opportunity is at the top of the hill. It will be obvious where that is once you ascend the hill. At the top of the hill you’ll see handmade signs leading you to the “Bukchon Overlook”. This is not an official overlook but simply an older gentleman who charges admission to look out from his top floor about 6 stories up. He serves you a drink and there are some nice photo opportunities so it is worth the 3000 won IMO. He also has a cute parrot. I got a kick out of his business acumen because he does attract numerous tourists. 
A quaint walk,"If you have the time, make sure to walk through Bukchon Hanok Village. The houses are absolutely beautiful and you feel as though you have been transported to hundred of years ago.While there, also be on the lookout for restaurants serving traditional Korean food. They are the best finds!But please be conscious that there are people living in this area so to please keep your voice low and other noise at a minimum. "
Nice ,Yeah our tour guide took us here and it was great to see how the old houses were built and you have to great view of the city 
A disappointment,"This was my third trip to Seoul and first visit to the Bukchon Hanok Village. As I walked through tne neighborhood, I saw the banners of the residents living in the area and felt a great deal of sympathy toward them. I felt like an intruder! We did visit one restored mansion in the area. A lot of the shops and small galleries were closed for lunch time. While it was picturesque to see many tourists dressed in hanbok, I felt I did not have a deep cultural experience."
Beautiful old houses,"Bukchon Hanok Village is a residential place with beautiful old houses. It is quite a walk from the train station and still an uphill walk to see the houses. Walking there, you'll pass by mamy shops with interesting souvenirs and other items. You can also rent a traditional outfit for a little cost.There were several tea houses in the village.The houses were beautiful and reminiscent of the olden times. It just feels quite wrong to walk around a village where private people still actually live. Tourists are not too welcome there, as evident in the signs around.We stayed for less than 10 minutes and left."
Truly Tourist Photo Spot,"I love the cleanliness of bukchon area. You can easily find a good spot to take a picture. Get your phone or camera and take a selfie You can rent hanbok, a traditional Korean dress with 12K - 15K WON for an hour and feel like a truly Korean But remember dont make any noise coz actually this village is residential area.Not far from this area you can find many cafes and restaurant where you can eat to fill your empty stomach after strolling around the area or just have a cup of coffee or tea to reboost your energy."
Beautiful south korean atmosphere,We appreciate walking through the streets of the village and visting the traditional houses. we did it withto a guide from seoul city for free and it was really interesting to understand how south Korean used to live.Nice photos from there. Recommend it during a stay in seoul
Nice to have a walk,It is nice and cute to walk in the little streets. Nice artshops in the area.However after 1hr you have seen everything.
Bukchon village,Its a very nice and little village of Bukchon where you can still see houses of the old times. Stroll along the streets of bukchon village and take a beautiful picture around
Very sweet,"Well worth a walk around this area. As people live there, you must be quiet. Really liked the architecture. Easy to find. "
Beautiful Place for Photos,"Very nice place for photos of Seoul, definitely recommended this place for soaking in the Korea atmosphere here. There is also shops for u to rent the traditional korean gown to take photos around with quality gown and cheap price. MUST NOT MISS!"
Picturesque village,"My friends and I visited Bukchon Hanok Village last year. The place is so picturesque. Of course by wearing the Korean traditional hanbok, we can blend in with area well "
Hanok Village!,Village that is picture perfect. Careful that you should be a little quiet while entering this premises because there are actually residentials living there.
There's a protest going on and there's too many tourist,"We went there after visiting Gyeongbokgung and I must say it's not what I have in my mind. The place was full with tourist and there's a protest from the resident. It says that you have to keep quiet and I think I'll also join the protest if I live in the neighbor. It's still fun to see the houses, but not fun if it's full of people"
Traditional Old Homes ,A good place to take pictures but mainly along a few alley and a main. Saw a couple taking a wedding shot there. Keep quite as the locals dislike the noise tourist makes.
traditional homes,We enjoyed walking through the streets of the village and seeing the traditional houses. We appreciated the presence of tourist information officers who guided us and even gave us a map to find restaurants. 
Old town ,Pretty houses to look at and take pictures. I would not say it is a must do. But if you are visiting the palace near by you might aswell pop by.
Beautiful Village,Beautiful village indeed to walk around. But please keep your voices down around this residential area. You definitely won't like flocks of noisy people at your door front everyday. I heard that the residences there actually requested their government to ban tourists from entering that area due to some rude tourists actually go knocking the doors and entering their premises without permission.Please behave so that more people can enjoy the beautiful walkways of Bukchon. 
Spectacular Area,The village is best accessible by walking from Gyeongbokgung Palace and roaming around the nearby streets. It was a wonderful experience to get lost in the dizzying streets and finally reaching your final destination of Bukchon Hanok.Take your time in roaming around the village away from the tour groups. Best to experience walking around in silence.
Many school trips,"When we visited there were many buses taking student on trips here. So it’s a good place to learn about Korean culture and way of living in the past, because it’s even popular among the locals. A drama was being filmed at the village, there aren’t many tourists (few) according to our guide tourists visit the Palace more. I only didn’t enjoy the equestrian show - I don’t like shows with animals in it (personal opinion). But the farmers drums and dance was good. "
the best in seoul ,"well this is my best place when going in seoul , habitants are suffering from tourist so better be quiet while visiting the street .... "
Always nice,Always nice to walk but it does get very crowded nowadays... Lots of tour groups. Nevertheless I love walking up from Anguk side and finishing in Samcheongdong.
Attractive place,"Bukchon is the natural link between two palaces and therefore a natural stop over. Rich in small exhibitions, artworks, old historical houses. Plenty of cafes, small shops and restaurants. Go for it!"
Renting hanbok and taking pic here ,Wearing hanbok and taking pics here bring you to the olden days . Although this place is not huge. If you want to have a whole town with this kind of building. Do go to jeongju
Nice stroll with old village style,"Actually, once you have exit from Anguk station exit 3, it is consider bukchon hanok village. This is what the nice local mobile volunteers told us & gave us a map. Nice scenery but a bit taxing on your legs, especially if you have been walking for the past 5 days as there are a lot of uphills & downhills. Very hard to spot the photo op as per recommended. It would be great if they could put up a sign to mention this spot is for photo! Sigh"
Art village with lots of restaurants,Is was advertised that it is open until 9:00 PM so by the time I arrived at 6:30 PM most of the local artist studios were closed. But the main road has dozens of restaurants and other food establishments open. Come earlier!
Wear comfortable shoes ,"This is actually a residential area of the locals, you will see some aunties standby at the road side to make sure every visitors are keeping their voice down and not to distribute the residents. Some road ups and downs so wear comfortable shoes because it actually involved a lot of walking including slopes and downhill road. There are shops provide renting of traditional Korean costumes, it is indeed a nice place to take photos with the costumes on."
Nice walk ,Seems like place where artisans like to set up shop. Unfortunately I was unable to explore further as there was a heavy downpour. 
A great walk at this place ,"There is not much to see here, but it's a great walk around this area.After you see the palace which is closeby, you can then visit this attraction. "
Traditional Korean Village,A traditional Korean village inside the city. They have preserved the heritage. You have to walk up and you can take photo with the headless traditional figurines n front of the village!
Nice place,I think this is a nice place to go once time but I think this's enough for me. I dont think this is the old village. That's the new village build by the old style.
Perfect spot,This old village is a perfect spot to see the city on the horizon during the sunset!There is a bit of climb to reach it but is totally worthy.
Traditional old houses,"We stayed in a guesthouse in the village, so had the opportunity to wander the streets both at night and during the day. Lovely traditional old houses and craft experiences and many many coffee shops! It is primarily still a residential area and the majority of visitors were being respectful and keeping the noise down, although you can see why some residents are less welcoming to tourists! For the best photos, you need to be there early in the morning (before 10)."
Heritage view but...,"We have spend too much walking on the first 2 day hence not really enjoy the view here. The scenic is nice if taking picture with Hanbok. Else it just a tourist place with some many selfie stick on your photo session. But, a short walk after lunch is nice."
Good afternoon walk,"Great for leisure walks, there are different activities offered. You can rent Korean dresses and walk around the village. "
Heritage village,"The Hanok Village is an old heritage village. There are a few very old houses remaining.The village is a 20 minute walk from the Palaces and Museum .The area has become very commercial with a lot of modern ""made in Korea "" shops and a lot of restaurants.A good way to spend the afternoon ."
Traditional Korean Houses,"The village is located about 10-15 min walk from Anguk station. The station itself is one of the most artistic station I have ever visited in Seoul. I must say that the village is a good place to get to know Korean heritage through its traditional houses (you must know that some people still live inside those houses). There is this one house that you can enter so that you can experience living like a Korean. For those who loves learning about different culture, this is the place to be !"
Community with an old charm. Just be quiet!,"The narrow streets and traditional roof design gives you a feel of an old Korean community, perhaps of the nobility class because of the house sizes and hilly location. Because of the large number of tourists who flock this area, the community is less welcoming as shown in their street banners/signs Tourist guides also warn tourists not to talk loudly so as not to disturb residents. Still worth visiting."
Beautiful neighbourhood to visit,"A really beautiful neighborhood with lots and lots of traditional style deigned houses on a steep hill slope. This is actually a residential neighborhood so visitors are requested to keep the noise down you will see people holding signs advising visitors to respect the residents and not make noise.The village basically opens to the public at 10am at which time I am told lots and lots of coachloads of tourists arrive and the place changes into a busy and bustling area. Fortunately I left me hotel in the very early morning and arrived there shortly after sunrise when there were zero tourists. However, actually visitors are not meant to be here so early but I was alone and making no noise at all.Along the many lanes can be seen beautiful architecture with ornate roofs and wood details. Views of Seoul Tower can often be seen in the distance. This is definitely a fantastic place to visit and should not be missed."
Beautifull place to visit,"Hanok village is beautiful, you have to be silent because people live there, and obviously quite rich people, so you are not allowed to disturb them "
Beautiful,It was so nice to see traditional houses of South Korea. It's well worth visiting and in a really nice area of Seoul. Lots of nice restaurants around too. Highly recommended.
Neighborhood,"Neighborhood that has a right to limit the tourists. After wandering for an hour and seeing the area overrun by tourists and tour groups, I feel sorry for the locals. To experience the Hanok Village there are better when you won’t be a bother to people trying to live their lives."
Neat Area,"Went here to check out the traditional architecture, definitely enjoy checking out the area! Enjoyed seeing what a traditional village would look like. There are a few different shops, didn't find it crowded and its a decent enjoyable walk."
Lovely area for wandering,"This area is a short walk from the Gyeongbokgung Palace and can easily be combined with a trip there. There are many interesting little back streets with craft centres, workshops, ceramic shops, and traditional architecture, as well as plenty of places to eat. Do visit and see another side of Seoul."
traditional,Very traditional houses surround this area.Take 1-2 hours waking around here without any destination.Enjoy the houses and atmosphere here.這個地方有很多傳統的房屋。花個一到兩個小時在這邊沒有目的地與目的性地亂走，好好享受這邊的房屋與氛圍。
A Homey Village,"When I was here, I felt like I traveled back in time. The village is very homey too. There are nice like shops and I get to wear a Hanbok."
great little shops lovely people,I loved making the silver pendents the shop is just at the top of this road on the right side. Have a nice wonder enjoy
Normal traditional village,Nothing much to explore here imo as everywhere sells basically the same things. All you could do there is to take pictures and enjoy the building styles? 
old village,It is most famous Korean old villege in the city center.It is live town. You can see the how was the people living and how is now.there are many shops and many thing to eat.you can enjoy there.
One favourite,"Loved walking around this suburb. Charming traditional houses, galleries, art & craft shops, fashion.You can obtain a local map from the information volunteers around (dressed up in red) or walk around. "
Step back in time!,"This is a lovely place to reflect on the past while respectfully walking the streets. As this is a residential area, it is very important to remain respectful and quiet while visiting their neighborhood.Near the neighborhood are little shops and stops where you can look for souvenirs or grab a bite to eat."
Charming Village !,"Lovely charming village with lots of photo opportunities. Bring you away from the city of Seoul back to the old traditional houses of Seoul. Very residential, thus should be sensitive of one's surroundings when walking around. First stop - go the Bukchon Traditional Cultural Centre to understand the past and present of Bukchon Hanok Village and get a walking guide map. Follow the walking guide on the map and it will bring you to many lovely finds.Be prepared with lots of walking and go with a pair of good walking shoes to go upslope, steps and down-hill.Throughly enjoyed the visit !"
good place for strolling at evening with beautiful houses,"is great place, really. but i only give 3 rating due to this area is residential, not really some place u can go as you like. at first, i was though this is a heritage site but in fact this is a residential area, it make me shocked. hard to imagine i living in a house where there is a ton of people walking around my house everyday looking (peeking) into my house. so, it is really a great place, but please be considered to visit this place due to privacy problems."
Old World Charm,"Crossing the street to this area transports you to another world. Slow, prim, old world charming. Enjoy the small stores around"
day tour ,was there with hyeyoung ...lovely place lots of tiny shops and alleyways great place for photo opportunities ...but keep in mind that it’s still a residential area and people remind you to keep it low!!!!!a couple of hours are possible if you plan to have lunch there ...would be apprehensive for people with knee back problems as the rounds are a tad steep !!! comfy shoes are a must !!nice places to enjoy coffee or lunch 
Fabulous ,Best place to take photos in Seoul as it is very beautiful. It has strong Korean feel and its a pleasant walk for tourists.a must visit when you’re visiting Seoul! 
Wonderful place to visit ,This seems to be the only place where you can get a sense of tradition now that Insadong has been ruined. We wandered the alleys looking at the beautiful buildings. There are buildings you can visit and nice places to stop for tea. A must see. 
Be prepared to walk,I loved Bukchon Hanok... it can make you travel in time. But be ready to walk into sloping streets. Definitely worth the exercise.
old street,"walk along these streets and the rustic feel welcomes you. Thought i assume some or most of these houses have been revamped recently, the rustic feel is still there. clean and fresh feeling."
moody and traditional,"it’s good to walk around:)there’s lots of small shops and great Hanok.It was so impressive I think, and I do recommand you to go here "
Private & quiet village,"A place for old korean houses. You'll have to walk the stiff hill just to get to the top. However this place have restricted tourist from entering already because homeowners no longer want their village to be disturbed. So no longer interesting, but below the place/village there are still some restos & shops"
A pleasant place to wander round,"Rated highly as a must do but I didn't really understand what all the fuss is about. Bukchon Hanok village is a pleasant place to explore for an hour or so. The house are pretty and situated on a number of steep hills, with a main street selling refreshments including some great non-dairy ice cream. The village does feel too touristy though and it's not that easy to photograph, unless you have a wide angle lense."
Be respectful,"While I believe that the area is well preserved and stunning architecturally, the atmosphere is kind of destroyed by the large posters saying, 'No Tourists'. Make sure you keep quiet, especially in the morning as the locals don't particularly want you there. Aside from that, it's a very beautiful and historic area of Seoul and I do believe you should visit."
Well preserved but locals disapproved,Local residents disapproved Bukchon become tourist attractions in Seoul because of the noise and damaging effect from tourist. Many houses isn't intended for tourist. Need to be very quiet when visiting this place.
You need strong legs to visit all 8 scenes!,"Beautiful traditional Hanok village but very hilly! You need strong legs, good walking shoes and lots and lots of water!"
Very touristic ,Nice to see and ok for half day - yet too commercialized and full of shops ... logistics is good and helpful info points are everywhere — is a should do when visiting Seoul 
Amazing,It’s a definite must on your trip to Seoul. Please be respectful and quite as it is a neighbourhood. We rented costumes and it was hot so we sweated the whole time. But it made a few memorable photos. 
Traditional Korean's House for your insta feed.,"This place offer an authentic Korean's House that will be a great feed for your album. If you have time, wearing hanbok will be advantage :)"
Good experience,Strolling in this area was my best experience ever. And you know what? Every single picture taken here was so nice. I love the scenery. 
Traditional village in the heart os Seoul,I spent a half day wandering the streets and lanes of this beautiful village. A great place to just wander and get lost to experience traditional Korean buildings and homes. Be prepared for a few steep hills.
Traditional houses in modern times,It's amazing how they managed to keep the traditional houses. It's like you have traveled back in time. What's even better is if you are wearing a hanbok. You will truly belong. 
I wish I could stay here forever,"Bukchon Hanok Village is a Korean traditional village located adjecent to Gyeongbokgung Palace. Great place to find Korean architecture with no entrance fee. It was peaceful to walk and explore the narrow streets of Bukchon and view from the top was just magical. There are shops were you could rent korean traditional dresses. Guesthouses are available for rent within the village. You may visit the traditional craft experience centre and attend the workshop with a small participation fee. As it is a residential area therefore, strict policy on noise and littering needs to be followed.Visiting hours are restricted to 10 am to 5 pm Mon - Sat Quick Tip: Make sure to wear comfortable shoes as the sight is pretty hilly and takes couple of hours to explore it entirely."
My favourite neighbourhood in Korea,"This is an area where people live in. Nothing commercial hence respect the neighbours when visiting. Shhhhhhh... there are, somehow, a lot of rude tourists who would chat loudly and walk in to people’s homes. "
Lovely place ,"We visited during the cool autumn weather . We walked through the traditional village wearing their traditional Korean costume . With all the awesome backdrop for the photos , it was an awesome experience! "
Amazing but sad to visit,"This village is beautiful and worth a visit. But it is so crowded that the people living there seem to be tired of tourists. There are signs all over the village saying No tourists are welcome, Keep out, Silence please etc. In a way I understand that since it’s like the people are living in a tourist attraction. "
Try to spend a night here ,Very well preserved historical village. Lots of selfie opportunities together with hundreds of other tourists. Try to spend a night here in one of the traditional house. It is memorable. 
A village like no other,"If I could, I would get myself a house there. It was nestled in those uphills with unique designs. The houses looked old but with a touch of modernism. Make sure you go visit it. But please, be silent while admiring this gem. "
It becomes more modern..,"In my imagine , Bukchon Hanok is ancient village ( as Old architectures something ) . It was modernized by all new painted walls and become a tourist spot . Nothing i found is exceptional here :)ㅠㅠ one tip : if you had a good camera, wear hanbok and pose thousand of photos by your ways :) "
Traditional Korean houses,A residential and tourist area full of Hanok (Korean traditional houses). Good place to take picture in Hanbok (Korean traditional clothing)
Be considerate to respect the residents,"After reading some guide books I have made this village a priority in my Seoul itinerary because this is a real village resided by real residents. Only when I read some TA reviews about real residents don't like interruptions by tourists did I start to hesitate. But our Korean friend who lives in Seoul said it's ok to visit during daytime on a weekday so off we go.A few alleys on a small hill make up the village. Two alleys are particularly pretty, and thus full of tourists. Yes there are signs asking visitors to keep quiet, some even say do not take pictures of the house or touch the door. I think this is understandable because this is a real neighborhood. I may do the same if I live there.I only took pictures from a little distance away instead of leaning on someone else's door. Nonetheless, I enjoyed a quiet stroll to admire the very well maintained hundreds years old traditional houses and soak in the atmosphere.Be considerate and enjoy!"
Nice look into Korea's history,"We took on Bukchon Hanook on our hop on hop off bus tour. Was a lovely look into an ancient style village. Be aware this is a replica village, for some reason at first we thought it was a real village lol. Definitely Worth a look though. You can see a Taekwondo demonstration at about 1pm."
Beautiful Hanok architecture,This is a must visit place for someone visiting the city. Beautiful traditional architecture where you can probably shoot one of the best photos in the city. Don't forget to stay quiet as this is a residential area!
Keep very quiet here,Lovely hanoks to admire but it’s good to be really quiet so as not to disturb the residents living there. If we put ourselves in the shoes of the residents we wouldn’t want our day to day life to be disturbed by tourists either. 
Peter G,"Very interesting original buildings demonstrating the history and architecture, if you really look in detail some amazing artisan drawings and local needlework can be purchased "
Lovely arty area to walk around,"We took a free of charge walking tour, from Seoul walking tours. We met at Unhyeongung Palace at 10.00 hrs. Spent some time in the Palace then walked up to the village, lots of nice tradditional houses and street views, bit hilly.......but you do need to work off your holiday food. Lots of art places, and good value restaurants. Lots of Koreans in traditional dress. Rained while we were there, dont bother with a rain coat get an umbrella like the locals."
Great Historical Area,The village has been very well maintained. It is a great place to walk around and see the Hanok houses. An easy walk from the two main palace attractions. 
They don’t like tourists,"It is uphill streets lined with traditional houses. It was nice to take pictures of the traditional houses. If you visit here, be aware that the residents strongly discourage the presence of tourists. They see them as a nuisance. So please be quiet when you are here. There is a hanbok rental shop at the beginning of the street. "
Empty,"i dont know if there was anything else going on when i went but the was hardly anyone around, which made for a really nice relaxing atmosphere as apposed to a crowded crazy one. the area is so nice and the small cafes and shops were all really cute too~!"
Nice but touristy spot ,The Hanok-village Bukchon is a traditional korean village in between the skyscrapers of Seoul an right next to the Gyeongbokgung palace. It‘s nice to walk around and see the traditional housing there. You can rent a Hanbok there and with this you‘ll get free admission to the palace.
Make Sure You Have A Guide! ,"When visiting the Hanok Village, it is almost necessary to have a guide take you around! The hanok village is actually a residential neighborhood, and from what we learned, in recent years, the residents have not been happy with the increase in tourists visiting the area. The neighborhood is actually completely restricted to tourists on Sunday - but you wouldn’t know it unless you had a guide to tell you! Definitely hire a guide to take you through the hanok village - it’s definitely worth the money and you will get some great pictures out of it! Our guide, Matt from This is Korea tours, took us through the village and showed us the best spot for pictures!"
Very nice,Good for educational and sightseeing and photo ops purposes. Gives you ancient koreanovela feels if you watch K-dramas.
Cool to see! ,"An ancient area dating back 600 years. It’s a residential area, and you can tell they aren’t that fond of being a tourist attraction, but accommodating to let tourists walk through. "
Go as early as possible!,"A ""Must Visit"" place. One of the nicest places to visit in Seoul and... it's free!!! It is very busy with tourists so go as early as possible in the morning if you want to enjoy it all by your selves! But as it is not an actual ""touristic place"" by choice and people still live their daily lives in their homes, please be respectful and quiet. It is always mentioned on other reviews as well but it was sad to see that a lot of tourists did not respect that. It goes without saying that having your camera or phone camera is essential! Lot's of great photo opportunities."
"Nice, not spectacular","Nice area with beautifully kept houses and some small restaurants. Nothing special, but I have a feeling I only walked trough a small part of the area. "
Residential village,"Good to see all the streets of Korean housing, people do live here so bear that in mind. The roads are VERY steep so not for those who struggle with that."
History Written all Oer the Walls,"How about seeing an old village in the busy heart of Seoul? Interesting, isnt? I was really happy to find a place like this because, even though Seoul is an economic power, Koreans still preserve a little piece of their heritage in a their very advance and modern metropolis."
Quaint place,The place is quaint and easy to navigate. It is a brilliant idea to preserve the village! Many shops and cafes around too. 
Great experience ,"I loved the village, got to see abit of history , long walk around the village, need a map to get around, but will definately go back again."
Seems like they don’t want tourists there,"This place was cool but there are lots of banners up saying tourists not welcome, as a protest from the residents. This made us feel a little uneasy! I preferred Gamcheon cultural village in Busan as it was more welcoming and had a stamp collection element which made it fun"
"Very interesting architecture, fantastic spot for photos","These are traditional Korean Houses back from around 600 years ago. There are many small alleyways, and long roads for great pictures. I came here after exploring Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Blue House, a walk away! Afterwards, I'd highly recommend visiting the renovated courthouse, a walk away again, haha. Also, there was a Hanok that was available to tour and explore, so that's a must!"
For fans of the traditional,I would plan at least a half day to spend in Bukchon - such a beautiful area and hard to believe you are still in Seoul when you are there - lots of uphill walking so bring your sneakers! Plenty of little boutique shops and cafes - perfect for a relaxing afternoon 
Love this place ,"Very nice village to visit, very traditional and very pretty and nice to walk around. Just that some areas were steep, elderly need to be careful. Very well preserved place, there are still people living there and hence pls be considerate and do not talk loudly and behave rowdy. Overall, I think it I worth a visit. "
Worth a visit,This is a lovely residential area which worth to pay a visit. The houses are beautiful but we didn’t have a chance to look inside!
A slice of Seoul,We enjoyed wandering the streets and also spent one night in a traditional guesthouse. This had futons on the floor and breakfast was served in a traditional style the next morning. Well worth the experience.
Old town in the middle of a modern city,This is a must-visit place. It's very well preserved and it's like your transported back in time. It's always packed with people but you can still manage to take pictures without including them in your photos. Place is good for kids too so you may take your family here.
K drama feels ,"Bukchon Hanok Village is a traditional residential, Most popular tourist spot in Seoul, most of them very well maintained, very nice place visit. do respect the residents there and enjoy the place in a quiet manner ☺️ "
Traditional Village in the city,"Bukchon Hanok Village is the small village in in middle of buzzling city of Seoul which keep its traditional architectural houses. If you'd like to explore the inside of houses, try not visit it in the evening because you can not go inside after 5 PM. Wearing hanbok while exploring the house will give you new experience of the real Korean village people."
Nice stroll,"We strolled through this village which is well-preserved from hundreds of years ago and still has inhabitants throughout. It was OK but once you get here, there is limited observation other than externals of buildings."
Not as good as I thought,"The view points of Bukchon Hanok Village was not as scenic as I expected. Perhaps I started in the wrong direction and it was a long day after my 4 hour visit to Gyeongbokgung Palace. I gave up looking for some of the view points. Anyway, I’d like to share with you the route map of Bukchon Hanok Village. I think if you start from Exit 2 of Anguk Station and head to “View Points” 3, 4, 5, 7, 6 and 8 first, then View Points 2 and 1 you may have an easier time to find the View Points and will be walking downhill. I started with View Points 1 and 2. From View Point 2 to 3 was a rather steep uphill climb. Anyway this is just a suggestion. View Point 1 - Panoramic view of Changdeokgung Palace was a disappointment. "
Beautiful but...,"The Bukchon Hanok Village is undoubtedly on a lot of tourists radar during their visits to Seoul - but a lot has changed! I stopped by here after visiting the nearby Palaces, especially as Lonely Planet recommended it as a ""must-see"" part of Seoul. However, due to the high volume of tourists, the residents inhabiting the village (it's one of the last areas you can see this traditional architecture) make it very clear that loud noise, pictures, etc. are not welcome or appreciated. I personally just walked through to appreciate the area, but couldn't stay very long as a result. If you want to go, it is a really special part of Seoul, but do keep the ""warnings"" in mind. "
SHHH- they dont want you here,Amazing picture worthy area but it is very picky neighbors do not like to have visitors in the area in fact there are lots of signs telling everyone they are to be quiet. 
Amazing!!,What a beautiful place but must be ready to walk. Also a must visit if you want to feel the history of Korea. Beautiful old buildings and you can envision the Josean Dynasty time. We travelled in the beginning of Summer but it was still memorable.
Bukchon Hanok Village,This is a good walk around the old Korean Village and you will see all the old houses and of course some have been converted to shops and eateries...
Traditional Korean houses,"Close to subway Anguk station (line 3). We spent 2 hours walking around ancient Korean houses . Very unique style of the buildings and amazing atmosphere. We traveled in the mid of August and the weather was super hot, but still enjoyed our trip to see this village "
Traditional sight seeing ,A good place for having a feel of what old Korea is like. Authentic food and beverage also served here along with souvenirs galore. All ages welcome 
Amazing,"Amazing how did the village still kept it’s old look and modernized at the same time ... I would really advice people to visit the village however, it would be very much appreciative to be quite as the people are negatively affected by tourist and kept silence is something really good, the architecture of the place is well maintained I loved the place ManalOman"
One of the last remaining traditional villages,"Bukchon Hanok Village is one of the last traditional villages in the ever-developing city of Seoul where you can still see cobblestone paths and traditional Korean houses. A great place to appreciate the architecture but sadly due to the high volume of tourist that visits this place, the residents are unwelcoming and there are signs telling people to keep quiet or not to take pictures outside their gates."
Leisure ,"Quite nice architecture but all doors are closed except for one or two which have been turned to shops. The street can be narrow and steep. I was surprised to see a banner that roughly says ‘No tourists please ‘ and no talking signs pasted on most doors. I guess people live inside these houses and the whole atmosphere is very quite except for those made by tourists. Despite the hot summer, some tourists are game enough to wear traditional dresses to take photos."
Be very quiet ,"Even tho locals don't like you visiting as they feel it's invading their privacy, it is a beautiful street with lovely traditional houses worth seeing. Just be mindful that people live there and dont make too much noise. "
Don’t be intrusive,Only good if you like taking pictures with traditional Korean houses. I felt it was too intrusive as there were noisy tourists everywhere even though the signs say “Please Be Quiet”. A quaint little area but pushed slightly beyond my comfort area.
Just too many guests.,"This is a popular scenic spot in Seoul. It is famous for the Korean traditional houses and streets. Many tourists are here experiencing the traditional Korean costumes. It is ironic that you can see a lot of angry banners reading “no more tourists, we are suffering from noise” from the local residents while tourists still take photos and chat loudly around."
Korean Village,"This is residential area. I admire the idea of ""showing"" Korean traditional houses (only several houses were open and allowed to be entered), but still caring for people who lives there. There were persons who standing with banner to remind all visitors to be quite and to keep the area clean. Around the village, we can find small tea house, cafe and shops."
Most of the shops are closed on Monday,It looks lovely enough but I would avoid coming here on Monday because most of the shops were closed and definitely not in late July. The heat was just unbearable and all I wanted to do was to stay indoor.
A good mix of old and new,"We walked around lot of places to see,local restaurants, shops.Museums, and art gallery.Even a place to experience the dark, led by blind folks."
Must see,My daughter lives in Seoul so she took me here. It is a very charming Korean village. Many local Koreans live here. It is beautiful and if you are in the right place you can get pics of the old with the new seoul behind it. We loved walking around here. 
Refurbished traditional houses,"There are lots of refurbished traditional Korean houses here. You can walk around to explore the area and it is very picturesque. Some of the houses are converted into shops, so you can go in for a visit and take some photos.Many little shops and cafe here, so you can stop and relax, when you are tired. "
Wander the streets of a picturesque neighbourhood of traditional Korean homes,"Perched high above the more modern streets below, Bukchon Hanok Village is best visited during the summertime at dusk, basking the low buildings and their details in a soft glow. Per other reviewer comments, some locals don't like the attention and have signs begging people to be respectful and quiet; a request I was happy to oblige. However, given the world's most populous nations have yet to travel to Seoul en mass, my best advice would be for those unhappy with the noise some tourists can bring to sell up now. Regardless, there are plenty of great photo opportunities for the curious traveller, as well as some shopping opportunities and cafes hidden throughout. A good access point is from Samcheon-Ro, which runs north-east from the eastern side of the Gyeongbokgung grounds. Follow the sidewalk maps and signs until you find a narrow, steep staircase disappearing between the cafes and houses (Google maps: 37.584644, 126.982128 .) Climbing the staircase you'll soon reach a street overlooking Samcheon-Ro below, with views back to Gyeongbokgung. Follow the signs carefully and you'll soon find yourself amid streets of stunningly restored and maintained homes. Follow the streets in an easterly direction before gradually following the twisting, turning narrow streets downhill in a southerly direction. A dusk visit will also avail you to some great dinner opportunities as you approach Yulgok-Ro."
Bukchon Hanok Village,"This is a a place with nice buildings and architecture, but as it is also a residential area, the residents were not happy with tourists visiting this place and had banners and signs put up saying they dont welcome tourists. There were also signs to say we have to speak softly. There were guides nearer to the main street, you can get a map from them to aid in your walking"
Not worth the time!,"Perhaps it was a hot summer day, we were dehydrated and hungry, the visit to Bukchon Hanok Village was not the best experience in Seoul. We walked and walked, and came upon some small alleys with traditional houses, that was it!!! It was interesting to see many visitors, dressed in traditional Hanbok, and taking poses in the 100 degree weather. The highly rated Ginseng Chicken Soup restaurant was a disappointment, too hot, lack of taste, and varieties. What menu choices? the restaurant only served one dish during our visit. "
Bask in the old heritage,"Backdated post: May 2017.Loved admiring the architecture of the hanok houses. Amazing wood work and the tiles were so pretty. Its VERY hot in May, recommended to go in spring or in autumn. Take a map from one of the guides and guide your way through.Along the road once you are out of the area you can find the famous O’Sulloc cafe where they sell all things green tea."
We were unwelcome guests ,"The village itself is wondetful, it has beautiful plants, lovely houses, and architecture. But this is a residential area, and the residents are not happy about the tourists disturbing their peaceful neighbourhood. There are some gentle signs on the houses by the government to keep quiet, but the residents have put up flags that say: Get out, you are not welcome! These really degraded my experience, but if you talk quietly, it's definitely a must see."
Quiet place,"Visited here as part of a private tour...just me, my daughter and the guide. It's a quiet change from the larger more commercialized tours. Worth it if you have a historian as a guide. There were some locals starting to gather to protest against the large tour groups due to the noise. But there are also a lot of local shops geared towards tourists. "
Rent hanbok and take pictures here!!!,"Hanbok rental can be a bit more pricey than at the Palace around 10,000krw for 1 hour, however, It’s better for pictures here and you wont have to do much photoshop to cut out strangers from your photo :D go there around 9am, no one and no tour is there yet! Btw, keep the noise at the lowest level please, I did feel really bad for those people who lived there since there were a lot of tourists around after 11am."
Must to go for cultural experience,"This place is one of the best place to take picture and having an image of living in the old Korean. The houses are so pretty but when I went there, there are a few house that's under construction (which is the government help the people to maintain their house). And this place is sooo crowded. If you want to have a very good picture with less people you should come early morning."
NICE PLACE TO VISIT,"You can walk for some hours and learn more about Korea, there are nice houses, doors, little stores and coffe"
"Interesting, free and near other attractions","What's not to like? It is interesting, free, sandwiched between other sites you are likely to visit and a good place for a nice stroll. It is much more pleasant and less crowded than the more frantic, packed Namdaenum market. "
Beautiful!,This village offers you a way to look into past history housing. People still live in the houses so you have to be quiet and be respectful when you are walking around. The doors in some of these homes are gorgeous! Bring an umbrella if you are coming during summer months.
Ancient Heritage,One of the tourist attractions that offer Korean culture. Many historic old buildings of Korean cultural heritage sometimes have art performances here.
Nothing Special,There’s not much here to see. It’s worth a 30 minute visit if you’re in the area. There is one street where you can take a picture. 
Old City,"Step back into time, the architecture in this village is one of the most beautiful places I have ever seen. The streets are a little bit hilly so I don't recommend going here in the summer like I did, it was super hot."
Average,I don’t regret going but I will probably skip this/will not recommend visiting this area to anyone. Its actually a residential area and there is a very big sign to say that tourist are not allowed in the area. I just don’t feel welcomed at all in this area. Although I know there are very nice shops/cafes in the area I just don’t feel like wandering around the village. Do not have high expectation if you go! 
Koreas traditional houses,"Bukchon which means ""Northern Village"" is found north of two famous landmarks in Seoul, Cheonggyecheon stream and Jongno. The Palaces surround this village (Gyeongbokgung, Changdeokgung and Jongno Shrine). In this village, you would be able to admire hundreds of Koreas traditional houses, called Hanoks. Aside from this Hanoks operating as cultural centers guesthouses, restaurants and tea houses for tourists to get to immerse themselves in the Korean culture, a lot of this Hanoks are still residential homes so make sure not to loiter and be too loud while going around the village."
"Fun, but tourists beware...","It was fun to walk around this neighborhood, but I felt kind of guilty that people live there and have to post signs telling others to be quiet. They post it in English and what I guessed was Korean. Tourists from other parts of the world were so loud, but you can't post in every language of the world. Some fun shops crop up randomly between the homes. Beautiful homes, fun, historic feel. But tread lightly and quietly."
Taste of tradition ,You can walk around the streets and look at all the cute shops that the area has to offer. I found a place where you can drink some traditional Korean beverages. It is a little bit expensive but the drinks are great so I would just go for it and enjoy the experience.
You could probably skip this,"I don’t regret going, but it was a waste of time. There really isn’t much to see or do, and the people living in the village are very vocal as to how much they hate that you are there. In prominent display are signs specifically complaining about and admonishing tourists. Who cares though because it’s not really a cool place to go. "
Nice but already too well on a tourist path?,This is a hilly part of Seoul amidst two royal palaces. Clean and safe but seems that - according to many notes on houses - the residents do not feel very happy about the many and loud tourists.
Wonderfully kept quarters in the heart of Seoul!,"This is a really large area and we had the pleasure to have a private guide showing us around! The village itself was ""closed"" this day refering to ""tourist-hours"" and it felt calm and serene :). Take your time, it is quite a bit of up and down walking. As we were guided by a girl we met at a gym who lived in the area, we were shown the local library and some other places where people lived ""at the side"" of the tourist routes, wich was unpayable!.The vew over Seoul from the highest point is Amazing! "
traditional house,"what should I say, yes it's old and traditional houses but imagine that a hundred year old house with a Lamborghini inside. nice house but not a must to see in Korea"
Nice but not a must see,"I was expecting more but it was just nice. You should get a map from the tourist info guides (red t-shirts) before going in, the map has got recommended walks withing the village. From a Tourist Information Office near Anguk Station I also got a map of the area. Insadong Street and Changdeokgung Palace are close by, I even walked here from Gyeongbukgung Palace. So it's not a wasted journey if you do not find the village that interesting as there are other tourist places to visit within walking distance."
Not as interesting as I hoped,"I expected more, but wandering through the streets it wasn’t very impressive and definitely not a must see for me."
Beautiful and interesting,Having ancient houses in a modern city is an amazing combination. Love the view of modern seoul from an ancient village. Lot of Interesting thing to explore and take nice pictures.
Lovely village ,"Beautiful and good photo op. Nice quaint cafes and tea house along the roads. Go for this teahouse in the picture, offers some serenity & serves flavorful tea"
Tiring and unwelcome ,"The walking journey from Gyeongbokgung was very tiring and hilly. Lots of tourist didn't follow the advise to keep their voice low. Noticed several posting on the wall indicated the tenant not welcoming tourist to their village.However, I enjoy looking at many beautiful doors each houses have."
dwelling village disturbed by tourists,a village with amazing folk houses used by local Korean as dwellings; I agree that the residence were disturbed by tourists. I would suggest tourists visiting Namsangol Hanok Village instead.
some place crowded but some not,actually i don't stay in city of seoul quite long time & always went to countryside in my short tour in last autumn. but i take this bukchon hanok village. easy to reach here & area was quite big actually. some place was crowded but some quite. good for viewing historical korea house. spend a day here to walk around & take picture. enjoyable.
Seoul vacation,"Seoul is a cosmopolitan city where you can still see traditional buildings. You just need to be able to manage some streets with incline. Since the area is a residential one, tourists need to respect the privacy of the residents. It’s a good place to take pics of the facades of traditional houses. "
Great Historical place in Seoul,"First, you should get a map from the tourist info guides (wearing red t-shirts) and follow the recommended path. Don't rely on Google Maps as it will lead you to the wrong place.While visiting this area remember that this is a residential area. Enjoy the area quietly and respectful towards the residents."
Amazing Old Village,"I was amazed by this place, because it was preserved by the community/the people living on this village. It was a nice experienced roaming around with the Korean Traditional costume."
So Interesting,What a great place to visit. Spent one evening in a traditional guest home. What a unique experience. The whole area is really very different. A one of a kind place to see.
Nice historical buildings,"spent about 1 to 2 hours there.This is a residential area so do be quiet and not be a nuisance to the residents there (not all welcome the prying eyes of tourists into their personal homes)Beautiful architecture. Would recommend hiring some traditional dresses for more authentic pictures but we were too hot and sweaty to get into those.But besides just looking at the resident's houses, there isn't very much to do there. But still worth a visit.PS : There is a self-proclaimed Michelin star Ginseng Chicken soup there near the entrance. It's a fake! We tried it and were disappointed. And my husband checked the Michelin guide and it's not there!"
Excellent place to enjoy traditional Korean Architecture,"A very quite place, beautiful architecture, it is a place as a example for traditional Korean neighborhood , please respect the local and do not make noise.You can pay and access to the observatory,It is a must during any Seoul visit, also the you can walk around the neighborhood where you can find good shops, cafe, bars."
Project Arirang - Jun 2018,"We found this place thru Air bnb. Very traditional lodging from the Jeosun dynasty. Reminds me of the traditional ryokan of Japan. The property is situated on a hill slope and built like terraces. There was a cellar basement room, 2 bed rooms, sitting room end a kitchen and toilet. It was made mainly of wood.We slept on futon mattresses. Quite comfortable. The place was comfortable with air con in each bed room plus the basement. The home was in traditional renovations of main wood and wooden floor. The modern part was the bathroom toilet and kitchen. The feel and experience is really authentic and we are happy with the choice of having this accommodation in our first of 3 segments to soak in the korean culture and history. From this home we can walk to gyeonbakkung palace which is anotger historical sight within the city. There is also the subway station. Around the whole village, there are many little shops offering a wide range of shopping and food beverage options.The only downside i believe is walking back to the home after a full day outing! It's quite a climb but manageable on paved little roads. Take a look at some of the pictures posted. This place is really very popular with many tourist and even TV crews spotted outside our home. Some tourist even thought we lived there and asked if they could come in but we had to decline as it was not our but someone's private property. "
Old style housing,"Get yourself a map before you enter the place as the road is very confusing. Luckily, there are tourist information officers with red shirt where you can spot at some places. Ask them of the famous spots so you won't waste energy to roam aimlessly.Toilets are hard to come by in the area.There are cafes and shops around, as well as some houses that are open for public free of charge.Make sure to respect the residents and do not cause any disturbance and loud noises."
"Used to love it, not anymore....","Really liked Bukchon the first time I visited but not this time. It was very touristy both times so nothing new but it was the banners around the village through which locals expressed their anger at tourists and how they are suffering through tourism which put me off. While I understand how constant flows of noisy, disrespectful visitors can be oppressive, it's really something they need to work out with the tourism authorities to find a solution rather than hang out insulting messages. Also at the end of the day, it's no big deal. It's quirky and quaint but the hanok buildings can be seen in other areas outside of Seoul. So if you are going to be going off the beaten track in S Korea it's not really worth visiting Bukchon. Its location between the 2 most popular palaces in Seoul make it an inevitable stop though. So if you do visit, be prepared for an unfriendly reception and try not to piss the residents off more by talking and laughing loudly (as we saw some inconsiderate visitors do). "
historical district ,"This is authentic hanok village, beautiful houses, small restaurants and boutique shops. However this is a residential area and they don't like tourists."
Bukchon,"Interesting place with many shops, restaurants, cafes. Generally it is possible to see some street activities also. Other than all these, you can see nice traditional houses, also many art galleries.Prices in all those shops are above the average level in Seoul. Also, in my opinion, no need to join any guided tour for here, even it is free. Just good weather is required."
Interesting Old Houses,"Seoul must change a great deal from the old days, so it's kind of fun to walk among the old building from the bygone area, narrow streets have some interesting cafe and shops, Korean folks still live here, please speak low, try not to make any noise, not to disturb their daily normal life."
Buckchon Village,"If you want to have a glimpse at South Korea's traditional architectural style, visit Buckchon village, with its narrow streets and extremely beautiful houses (hanoks). A piece of advice: since the area is inhabited and since there are lots of tourists coming to this place, try to express your admiration quietly, not to disturb the residents."
Pretty view from the overview spots,"There are many shops, cafe, restaurants in this area and the pretty old houses!! People are actually living in the old style houses, so you should have a respect to residents when you are going around. There are some overview spots which you have to pay but the view is pretty!! The streets are up and down, so it will be better to wear comfortable shoes!!"
bukchon hanok village,"Went on a late afternoon on a cold day. Very hilly be prepared to walk. Enjoyed it though, will coming back."
Time warp !,"When in Seoul, you must visit this lovely village. Clean , neat , well laid out. The houses of era gone past. lovely botique shops. You may be lucky to spot women dressed in traditional wear strolling on the roads & lanes.An enchanting experience"
Rustic place,"The place is wonderful well kept and pristine, but please understand this is a residential areq where ypu are free to roam please keep quiet and dont litter in the area... the people living in the area are annoyed of the noise in the area."
Skip if you're tight on time,"Visited June 2018. This is a low priority attraction. The best part of this attraction is the del monte mango ice cream popsicle at the nearby convenience store at a street corner. I don't remember the name of the store. For 50 cents, it was the cheapest and best mango popsicle ice cream I've ever had. Real mango flavor. We looked for this ice cream popsicle every where we went in Seoul and bummed we couldn't find it anywhere else. Bukchon Son Mandu dumplings restaurant was really good too."
Lots to enjoy,"Pleasant stroll through the neighbourhood. Mobile tourist information (people in t shirts with maps and recommendations ) available along the streets. Certainly not undiscovered, but a charming neighbourhood to spend a couple of hours exploring. We shopped for gifts here. The cafes and bars are quirky and interesting. Cool glasses shop in a converted workshop. Fun boutiques with interesting fashion , though surprisingly a number of them had no changing facility to try on the clothes. There is more of this neighbourhood than I was expecting. Charming traditional buildings, some open to the public for free, with quick craft activities to experience. Lovely tiled roofs and cute passageways, some pedestrian access only streets. Lovely Saturday afternoon. Lots of visitors wandering around in (hired)traditional dress, looked like there were enjoying the experience."
Time travel,"Walking there was a fantastic experience, for ambience and architecture. Lots of people rent traditional hambok clothes and stroll free there (this gives up an interesting flavour to te scene). The owners of the houses are not happy with the huge ammount of tourists every day,. but have definitely to cope with that.."
Small Village,Very nice place to visit. Easy access via train. Be cooperative to the villager so that they will allow us to visit this very nice place. We rented hanbok to go around. 
Bit doubtful,The walk was a beautiful but left us bit in down as on many places one can find posters asking tourists to leave - it is a residential area that is crowded by people yelling and taking pictures
Quaint village in the city,A quaint village in the heart of the city. Must see place if you want to experience traditional Korean culture and architecture.
Nice walk through the hanok village ,"It was a nice leisurely walk we took but everywhere around the village are signs to reject tourists and signs to say keep quiet. There are residents residing in the hanoks and i think tourists are really a bother to them. So try to keep the noise level down and move along fast. Don’t take too long to snap your fotos or selfies as well. Oh this is where the drama Goblin was filmed, but I didn’t bother to go find the exact alley and wall. Was trying to move along and finish my tour asap so as not to bother the residents. If you have time and is travelling solo, then mayb you can slowly explore. "
must see place,If you like the historical place then you need to see here a folk village. it is very interesting to know how korean live back then.
Traditional & Quanit,Definitely worth stayin here at a traditional Hanok. It’s worth the experience. The hanok cultural centre is very informative and the manager there was quite enthusiastic 
A village in the heart of a modern city !,Small remnants of a village can be found here in the center of Seoul. Try to have a Seoul map with you because korean people are not able to speak even a little english but they are extremely kind and polite.
Site seeing,Its really a sight seeing placing. Beautiful architecture and friendly business owner. U gotta walk the slopes. 
Interesting,"Although it was nice to see the village and the houses, I personally didn't think it was a must see or do. If you have a limited amount of time in Seoul then you can skip this village. It's just a bunch of traditional houses that most locals still live in. If your really into taking pictures at a traditional village then go ahead but be aware that not everyone's house want people in-front of it. I only recommend if you have a lot of time or extremely interested in an old town. "
Typical old village,"Typical old village with ancient houses, not many activities to do here. The view is also not really impressive. Can skip if you don't have enough time"
Sadly the locals aren't that welcoming to tourist,"A decent view of old Korean houses, many which are still residences. I have a mixed feeling about this place - as much as I want to walk around and see more of these olden architectures and there are official tourism officers roaming around to help in directions, we saw banners than hinted that tourists aren't that welcomed. I can fully understand - if you are a resident, you wouldn't want to have tourists roaming in your neighborhood, taking pictures and making noises!"
Telenovela Experience with Hanbok,- cultural experience we even rented Hanbok to take photos from the Hanok Village - a place where historical places / houses are preserved 
Lovely area of Seoul,"Stayed just next to Bukchon Village which I can highly recommend as you will not have a ton of tourists there early morning so if you are an early riser and wants to get in some nice photos before the crowds come, you should stay here. Overall, the traditional area is pleasant, and scenic. plenty of small cafes and craft shops. Taking a stroll here is a must if in Seoul. "
Well preserved residential area ,The streets and buildings are well preserved and served as residences for the locals. A lot of photo opportunities. However the locals seem to dislike the throngs of tourists flocking to the area and have put up banners stating their displeasure with visitors. 
A nice way to spend an afternoon,Its a few streets where there are old houses. The houses are occupied and you can stand outside on the streets to see. The houses are all along the hill so you will need to climb up
Traditional houses and quaint cafes,"Do the walk to Bukchon, eat at the samgaetang ginseng chicken restaurant and sip coffee at a nice cafe"
Cute,"The houses More interesting to look at. However, there were signs asking tourists not to come in because it was disrupting their lifestyle there. And many signs asking people to be more quiet."
Not bad,Went early morning with a friend of mine and the place is already packed with tourists with millions of selfie sticks. There are a number of quieter streets to walk around and there are also houses that converted part of their living room to a cafe. I recommend spending sometime at the home style cafes to get a feel of the interior. There are also people with information walking around (they can speak different languages to accommodate the tourists) and it is a good idea to get a map off them so that you know where to go. The streets are very narrow and be sure to stay quiet for the residents. 
Great shopping area,Lots of cool shops ranging from inexpensive to high end.Full of cafes and restaurants as well as museums and art galleries
Smaller than I expected,"Before arriving at Bukchon Hanok Village, I thought it would be streets and streets of old traditional buildings. But for some reason, it was smaller than i expected. Maybe we also went during the summer and there were fewer tourists around. The structures are REAL houses of people inhabit and they have many signs that said ""to be quiet"". I guess they're not too fond of tourists visiting their homes. There are also plenty of hanbok renting stores outside so you can rent the costumes and have a photoshoot there. Overall, we spent about 30 minutes to an hour exploring the place. "
Good old hanook village,Went there from gyeongbokgung palace and the village was lovely but beware of steep hill. Lovely place to live but they suffered a lot of noise from tourist and now banning tourist from entering their village since they live there and lots of ppl means noise. 
Nice cultural village,It was an interesting walk to see the different types of traditional Korean houses. Would love to walk around more had it not for the hot sun that my friends could not take the heat.
Good experience,"Difficult to find, but worth the effort, very old, traditional buildings housing small, quirky independent stores and coffee shops, very close to Changdeokgung palace! "
Long walk and steeps upslope!,If you wish to come here please get hold of a map. The map detailed the required walking route and photo point. The weather and the slope is a killer and not suitable for elderly with walking issue. There are also volunteer tourist information ambassador going round. So if you need help just ask them!
Old Seoul experience great for picture-taking,"We were a little lost when we went there because we thought it was a specific place but it turns out it was a whole neighborhood. It is a residential area and has signs everywhere reminding tourists to be quiet. There are many hanbok rental shops around if you want a more authentic experience. We stayed there for only an hour or less since there aren't many things to do aside from taking pictures. My tip is to go there early and find a nice, hidden spot if you don't want pictures where there are a lot of people."
Deep dive in old Seoul ,Entering the village feels like stepping into past. This is really nice to see these traditional houses . It gives such a nice feeling and contrast compared to modern Seoul. Must go visit!!!
Tourists were not welcomed,"It was indeed a cool place to visit BUT as the title says, we were not very welcomed by local residences. Banners were all around to remind tourists to keep their volume down and also there were some expressing the residents’ anger towards the government for making their neighbourhood a tourist attraction.If you’re looking to visit here, just be respectful and keep your volume down. It’s a nice place to take some photos, there are some places where there are slopes so becareful."
Worth visiting but keep your voices down,"Though I felt bad about walking around in this area because of all the sign telling tourists to keep their voices down and not disrupt the neighbourhood, since this is a residential area first and foremost, but it was still a really worthwhile place to visit. It did feel a little closed off though because every house had high walls and gates or bars to keep tourists from trampling around."
Original traditional Hanok houses,"Visited during my Essential Seoul Tour. These are the original Hanok houses. Some are open for visitors, art galleries, you can take a peak inside (shoes off first)."
Ok but.. ,This place is so adviced by hides but I was actually a little disappointed by it. The place is residencial you walk around houses and go inside but it doesn't feel so traditional compared to other place in Korea. 
The korean heritage houses!!,"This unique place is really in the heart of Seoul, Korea. We really amazed the Korean's preservation of their ancient houses which still exist to date. This is one of the place you need to visit in Seoul."
Old originaliteit village,"Surely you must visit to get a good impression of the originaliteit houses of old Korea.IT can be crowdy, thats also the reason that the inhabitants are not happy with all this visitors.Korean people can hire orginal cloths to dressed up.It is a nice view"
Little streets of history,"Had a great wander through these streets dotted with cafes, art and boutique pieces of souvenirs. Lovely vibe and saw many people dressed in rented traditional gear strolling around here.It’s very accessible from the palace and would be a recommended stop for those interested in doing a walking tour around the area. Plenty for all ages."
Restored and lovely,"The hanok houses here have been restored, very lovingly, and have attracted many visitors. These days the people who actually live there are starting to resent the constant stream of tourists gawking at their homes - but it is still worth a visit. Stick to the museums and main street and you will see wonderful examples of Korean architecture."
Heritage well kept! ,"Such an interesting place with lovely views, many flowers, trees, old houses and some amazing activities for families and youngster. You should go in early morning to feel the peace and the stillness there! "
Out of the way but picture op aplenty ,We thought this place was near or in Insadong but we were so wrong. The nice folks at the tourist Info sorted us out so we legged it there and carried on legging it. It's a nice mix of old albeit refurbished and new. Lots of photo ops around so let the inner photo maniac rip!
"Fairly easy to find, interesting historic village.","We caught the Subway Line 3 to Anguk Station (Exit 2), walked straight about 250 meters to the village. Walking up the hill you will find many traditional houses that appear to have been kept in very good condition. Well worth the walk up to the top of the hill where you will see a nice view over park land and the city toward the Changdeokgung Palace. I'm pleased we made the effort while visiting Seoul."
Traditional suburb,It is a place where you can see how ancient homes looked like. It is interesting to occidental people to have a look on the differences of the construction styles.
Traditional place ,Traditional place with the beautifull view. It is like i live in korea. I love it. I recomended for you guys
I love IT,"If you are crazy about the pictures challenges go on this historic area!You ll do some beautiful pictures and in same time a good physical exercise !It s really crowded , you can feel that some historical houses are fed up with the tourism, too loud, rude some of them don’t respect the privacy of the people who live there and who take care of this city patrimoine and witness !So go , enjoy but respect the life !"
Lovely area to stroll around,"Would recommend to visit when you're in Seoul, the view from the hill is pretty nice, and seeing many traditional houses is really something, when i visit, there are many tourists taking pictures, a little bit crowded, it's a residential area, so it's better to not make any noise while there."
Village of Hanok,"Even though many houses are built new and people don't live in old styles, this is still amazing place to feel old times.- Fun fact is to see lots of foreign tourists trying Hanbok on.- Good to have a connected trip with Seochon, Gyeongbokgung, Insadong, Changdeokgung, Changgyeonggung, Naksan Park, Jongro Street and some other places."
Traditional Wooden Hanok houses and village - must see,"At the Northern edge of the city lies the traditional village of Bukchon, A must see for visitors to imagine how life was like in Seoul before the high rise apartments took over the landscape. Making the effort to walk up the hill through the small streets is worth it with great photo opportunities of the old houses with Namsan tower in the back ground. Stop for a coffee, cake, street food or try one of the many Korean restaurants for a taste of the local cuisine. While the distances are not far there are plenty of stops along the way to keep occupied for a few hours. On weekends start early and plan for lunch there. Evenings are also good but can get busy. We went with 10 YO boys and it was fine."
Feel of so Korean traditional houses and charming place to visit...,"You can experience the real Korean narrow, inclined street and so cute traditional house... Such a great place to enjoy the view for photographers and feel the stunning view of sunset over the city... It's must place to visit and feel the taste of up town life... But privacy of Residences is destroyed by tourists and locals... suffer from littering and noises... :("
Just make you tired,Residence here are suffering with tourist. You better explore other place. Nothing special here just make you & your feet fatigue. Trust me. 
Charming traditional houses,"There are signs all over that this is a residential area and to please be quiet, refrain from,smoking, etc. Charming old style houses set within the city. There were a couple places which had, for a fee, traditional art workshops. A number of tourists chose to rent traditional outfits, hanboks, at nearby stores, to walk in costume thru the area."
Cute area but the residents don’t want you there,"I will admit the neighborhood is cute and the houses are beautiful. I’d like to say go there if you have time but the local residents are very opposed to the tourism and have hung a huge banner stating tourists are not allowed and are ruining their community. As we walked around I could understand their point. Despite the signs to be quiet and respectful, most tourists weren’t. There were crowds of people talking loudly, being obnoxious, kids were running screaming down the street with parents yelling after them. Worst of all, people were climb onto the doorsteps of the houses to pose for pics. I’d be mad too if strangers were literally at my front door everyday. "
"Nice, but visitors ruin it","This is a nice area with beautiful old traditional houses. But many visitors do no behave properly. Remember, this is a residential area. Be quiet and considerate and respectful. Come on your own and spend 1-2 hours. Don’t book a tour. These kind of things should not be exploited commercially. Big groups block the roads and the front gates of the houses. Just imagine how you would feel if hundreds of visitors would walk around in your street, taking photos of your house and blocking you? Be considerate, it’s easy and rewarding. If this was helpful in any way, we appreciate a like. Otherwise we’ll never know whether anyone reads this. "
Nice and quiet,Enjoyed walking in this neighborhood. Not as commercialized. Very nice visiting those old courtyards.
Average sight seeing location,"Actually not a very fantastic place to visit. Can go take a look if have the extra time and energy, but do not expect too much from this tour. As this is a residential estate, be careful not to be overly excited or speak too loudly, or you risk getting scolded by the locals. There are residents patrol to look out for tourists especially those behaving badly. When we were there, we saw signs put up by locals to remind tourists not to speak too loud, not to touch their properties, and some prevent you from taking photos in front of their house. "
Nice area with good atmosphere,"Bukchon village is a lovely area to walk around in this arts and crafts shops along with a nice atmosphere and pretty, old hanoks. Go to the information center for the area to get a map of the area showing where the good spots are."
Old and New,"Nice neighbourhood to walk around since the houses are mostly the traditional houses. Be prepared for an uphill climb if you were wanting to walk up the village. Fairly small and quaint streets with nicely decorated gates, some of which are shops while others are residential, although most of the souvenir and food shops are at the lower end of the village. There are signs around asking you to not talk too loudly. There was one house which looked like a museum. You could go in to see what one of these houses look like inside and it was free entry. Most of these houses have electronic gates and garage openers. The houses slowly become more modern as you walk away from the village."
History/Tradition,"People who wants to take photos are not allowed to make noise. It's great for photos and to walk around because its quiet. though there are too many people/tourist there, some are wearing traditional clothes that you can rent. Great experience for me as I'm into vintage stuff."
Beautiful traditional Korean houses,The street is narrow and you can see beautiful Hanok House side by side. There are some coffee places too. Do keep your voice low and do not disturb the quiet and peaceful environment there. I believed it is a good experience to stay in Hanok house.
"Nice neighborhood, but I feel bad for the residents","Very nice quaint neighborhood with lovely traditional houses, but there are signs at most of the doors saying 'keep out', 'don't touch', 'silence please', 'this is a residential area, muted talking' etc. I could not imagine living like this, I feel very sorry for the residents. This should maybe be a paid attraction with limited number of people, otherwise too much noise, but beautiful! Please keep your voices down when visiting!!"
Keep silent and make some photos,There are family inside the house so keep your big mouth. The government seems to keep this traditional house in the city. I believe the owner of the house is quite rich now because the have nice car and the automatic door complete with cctv around their house. Unfotunately there were some renovations around so I need to choose another corner. There was one open house that you can stop by. There was not any furniture inside but they sell some little gifts. 
Experiencing the traditional Korean,"An area where the traditional Korean houses still well maintained with lots of them housing residents and/or specialty art craft shops. As it is a resident area, the whole place is serene and peaceful, even though it is near to the main road. It was drizzling when my friend and I visited so made it even less crowded to stroll around."
Mainly for picture taking,"The houses are occupied, so the best you can do is just to have your picture taken in front of their doors. It seems there are workshops on some traditional stuff on the other side of the village, but for the residential area, it's just that -- lots of traditional houses. Make sure to stay quiet though so as not to disturb this residential area."
Great way to spend an afternoon,"I walked here after spending the morning at Gyeongbokgung Palace (amazing, by the way). The village is full of quiet, steep and winding roads with beautiful private homes, amazing views and interesting things to look at. Most of the buildings are historic representations of the architecture from many years ago. If you go on a weekend, you will be delighted to see many people dressed up in period clothing - I’m told this is a sort of Korean cosplay that has become very popular in recent years. "
Historic Jewel in Seoul,"Greatest views of the city. Great historic village. Wonderful cafes and art scene. Get a feel for how the elite lived hundreds of years ago. It is still an active residential district , so be mindful and respectful for people who live there. Visit the tourist center at the base of the hill for a local map and what not to miss. Great tourist tips from friendly staff."
Traditional Korean,Instagram for more food and travel @oppakulinerI love this place because you can see how the architecture of korean traditional house through this village. It's like I'm living on the same era that i watched at Korean drama and it's exciting for me
Busy place,"I was visiting Seoul as part of Olympic Games journey and fortunately a lot of people were off to the other coast to watch the Games. Still, there were people walking around, so if you are planning to see the village (where people reside btw, so quiet please) it is better to do it relatively early in the day. Otherwise, it's like Venice or Paris - you only get heads of hundreds of tourists on your pictures and do not see the soul of the place. "
Traditional Korea,Bukchon Hanok Village is home to traditional wooden houses called Hanok that dates back to the Joseon dynasty. 
What a wonderful place,You can smell the history of South Korea in here. People still live in this village and you have to be quite when you walk around the streets.
Little Korean Village,You can see the old Korean houses here. A must go if you travel to Seoul for the first time. It's a beautiful place to take photos. 
"Traditional residential street, no shops or restaurants ","This area is a residential living area, so it is great for photos. Don't expect to find food or shops here. If are looking for that there are a few streets outside of this area for crafts, art, and food. "
Keeping traditional arts and crafts alive,"This arts and crafts area is about 15 minutes walk from Gyeongbokgung Palace. We walked through narrow streets and into grand old buildings that had housed traditional craftspeople for hundreds of years. The buildings were pretty nice, so we presumed the area must have been pretty wealthy. There were people that dyed fabric, people that gilded gold leaf items, people making traditional Korean knotted items among others. We were allowed to enter the buildings to look around and if we wanted to take a class there was a fee. It was interesting for a quick look around but not really our thing."
Nice place ,"Nice place, easy walk from the palaces, full of good cafes and restaurants. We had a very good time here "
Absolutely beautiful! 100% recommend it!,We went up to Bukchon Hanok Village and was really worth it.After visiting the main palace next door just take a stroll down to this typical Korean village were people like to dress up with the tradition Hanok and you can take amazing pictures.Lots of restaurants and shops will recommend to spare 2-3 hours to visit.
Walking Uphill Could be a Challenge,"Jst eats of the major palace complex, they have info guides on hand and maps to direct you to the major sights. Be prepared for uphill climbs. Also fairly steep downhill stairs to get back down (if you do not retrace your route up)."
More cafes popping up,"Having been to Bukchon village at least 3 times in the past 2 years, my recent trip showed more newly opened cafes and pop up stores. Overall it is still a nice estate to wander in Spring, watching people dressed in Hanboks, sitting in old tea houses, visiting the remodeled traditional houses. For 1st time visitors, you can get a map from the tourist info booth. Coming here by subway is easy too, Anguk station"
Nice introduction to Hanoks,"A nice little cosy place for introduction to Hanoks, Korean traditional houses, in Seoul. One will find several signs of ""Silence Please"" as people still live here. Our guide told us that there are mostly used as vacation homes. It might seem intrusion into their privacy with loads of tourists invading the narrow street. Only a very few houses are open for visitors. We couldn't cover the entire stretch as we were tired coming here after visiting Gyeondbokgung palace, but I would believe its worth a stroll."
"Not bad, but maybe a bit overrated","You can see some nice traditional streets and houses (hanoks), but it can be a pain to find them. The so-called ""observatory"" is just a small top-floor apartment where you are asked to pay to enter - however the old lady is kind and gives you ""free"" tea, coffee or juice. You can only enjoy the view through windows.If you have a day for it, visit Jeonju for a real hanok village!"
Best Hanok village!,This is the best Hanok village in Seoul where one can get to see the architect and the beauty of the buildings. Walking around and taking photos here is good.One can also rent the Hanbok and experience being a Korean back to the olden days walking around the village in it! 
Cultural and Relaxing,There is a nice route for tourist to walk around.Not many of the traditional home open to public.Took us less than one hour to finish the route including photo taking.You do jot need to join a tour if you just want to stroll around.The rental of the traditional costume is just at the beginning of the village.
Interesting but 'weird',"Hard to decide whether this is a touristy area that would rather not be or a homely village that gets invadedThe old houses are lovely to see in the narrow streets but our is people's homes and there are signs everywhere asking for peace and quiet, no peeping etc, so it felt a little uncomfortable at times knowing who behind the closed doors wanted us there and who didn'tThere are some that are 'open' to tourists, typically as a retail outletBut there is also an enormous number that are freshly refurbished "
Over-rated; Touristy,"It was a hike which we didn't mind. We followed a walking tour but yet we still didn't learn much. Houses were well, houses. Don't get me wrong. I totally adore beautiful architecture. The houses were nice but they are all rebuilt with new materials so it looks astonishing new. Comparing with Kyoto and the alleys of Shanghai, this place pales in comparison and it's extremely touristy with tourist traps all along the way. It's a nice walk but if you don't have time, give this a miss. "
Traditional Houses,"The Bukchon Hanok Village can be accessed via Anguk Subway Station Exit 2. This village is famous for its Bukchon's Eight Views for photography. We dropped here to have a look of the traditional houses in this village before heading to Gyeongbokgung Palace. The design of the traditional houses was beautiful. Since this village still occupied by the locals, hence the visitors must be ensure quietness is to be observed. We were here early in the morning, hence we could take various pictures without others appearing in our pictures. There is a shop for Hanbok rental located near the entrance of this village."
Nice houses. But way too many people. ,"Nice houses. But way too many tourists. Need a fair bit of walking to get here. Other than taking OOTDs, There's a tokudu museum in 1 of the houses. Very interesting information about the past death rites of the Korean. Admission is free, takes less than 1/2 hr to see. Worth it to go in to take a look. "
Traditional living area of olden days Korean,The place has undergone quite a change as was told by my local guide. As the local find it worthwhile to do preservation of their property even without the support of their government. Thus I do see some construction going on within the neighborhood.
simple neighborhood,"I thought I was going to see a lot from this area but was wrong. It’s basically a small residential area with traditional homes from many years ago. You can appreciate the design/structure of the homes made of wood. There were a lot of tourists walking around, there were signs all over the place to be quiet since it is a residential area to this date. The streets are really narrow and long. I rented out the hanbok dress at the store closest to the entrance of this village. It was pricier than others, but this was my last chance to dress up :).When we walked down out side the village, we came across the chicken ginseng soup resto, it was delicious!"
Good place to take pictures ,"Fun to wander around and take pictures. The tea houses are really expensive over there, but the village itself is fun to see. There’s some uphill walking but it’s not too bad. "
A slice of history,"This is a very lovely area of the city, which is a nice walk from the palace. Here you can see an active neighborhood that has preserved it’s old housing. There is a steep incline, or stairway, to get to the heart of the Hanok village, but it isn’t too long and worth it. "
Great Old/Modern Village,"You are not visit Seoul if you was not visiting Bukchon Hanok Village. An old village that kept to be its traditional style in the middle of modern city, makes a very great combination and art as well background of Seoul now and then. There are a lot of stores, boutiques, cafes, restaurants that can spoiled your shopping desire to the maximum.Eat lunch or dinner on this area and get the feeling of being local and blend with the environment.If you like, try to wear old traditional costume of South Korea and just walk around on this village. It make you looks like very South Korean people :)"
A jewel in the middle of modern Seoul.,"an interesting passage of traditional neighborhood in the middle of modern Seoul.These residential still maintain traditional architecture.Some of units has changed as coffee shop, etc.Unfortunately, there were groups of tourist when I went there, so it was quite noisy."
 just a neighborhood,Nothing wow or cool about it. The village is only a neighborhood whose houses are traditional. Kind of a waste of time for me. 
A bit underwhelming,"I had high expectations before the visit but left a bit underwhelmed. There is a suggested trail with 14 stops starting from Bukchon Traditional Cultural Centre. It can be reached from Anguk metro station by foot via Exit No. 3 in less than 350m.I was lost when I arrived so I only started from Point no. 6. There are shops that rent traditional Korean garb, and you’ll likely see many visitors (mostly ladies) wearing them. Photo opportunities along the picturesque paths will depend on the number of tourists. But chances are, it’s going to be a challenge to get a clean shot without others in the background. It was not that crowded with tourists when I visited, but enough to make the place feel cramped.Follow the tourist signs as some of the paths are dead ends leading to residential homes.Be prepared to walk upslope along some of the paths (something most able-bodied visitors should have no problem with, as this is a residential area).At the end of the suggested trail, you can continue walking to Samcheong, where there are eateries, coffee places and souvenir shops.There are also other tourist spots within walking distance, including Insa-dong, Gyeongbokgung Palace and Changdeokgung Palace, etc. Overall, be prepared to spend at least 1-2 hours wandering around."
Beautiful area in central Seoul,We enjoyed 2-3 hours wondering around the streets in this area. We started with a map but then just wondered down whichever road looked the prettiest! It does get busy but it is worth seeking out the quiet streets to enjoy the architecture without masses of people.
Our favorite part ,"Our favorite part of our trip , people wore in traditional dress. Made you feel like you were part of the old world . Found a near by small street with a few traditional restaurants (highlight) lots of boutique shops . We ended up visiting 2 times during our 5 day trip . "
Amazing,"Amazing! Old traditional residential area.Greta traditional architecture, also has nice views of the city. I recommend 1 hour to 1.5 hours"
Excellent Place - Experience the inside of a Hanok House,"I loved the walk in the Bukchon Hanok Village. It is such a peaceful and quaint and picturesque place. The place is residential and hence it is advisable to maintain silence. You can get amazing views of from the observation point. Make sure to collect the map at the information center. There are a few museums, Perfume gallery and tea houses and cafes along the way. Make sure you try the Korean tea at one of the cafes. The place where we went was a very cute little cafe / guesthouse and the hosts were so warm. The place was very old fashioned and antique looking. The hosts were very warm and friendly. They welcomed us warmly and the menu has variety to choose from. We went in for the traditional raddish tea and the berry tea called omija. The prices are pretty decent for the ambience and the experienc. It costed us less than 10000 KWr in total. The hosts are more than happy to take pictures for you and also suggest you good photo spots. The cafe name was in Korean language. I have attached the card for your reference. It was HoeHwaNaMu GuestHouse. It is a traditional Hanok House."
Good traditional place ,This is a wonderful place which I haven’t seen in before. The old building and lots of tourists really let this place cheerful. I like it. 
Well,"It is pretty nice but touristic. To me, it doesn't has an original character. It's just for tourists who walk around and take pictures. If you have time, you should go there. If not, you won't miss anything. Seoul has a lot of beautiful places... "
Nothing much to see..,"Just a neighborhood with some Hanok styled houses where some people actually live there. It is quite interesting to see such kind of place to live..but that’s it. So, if you’re going to Gyeongbukgong, don’t waste your time and energy to come here, since there isn’t much to do or even see."
Quaint town,A lot of steps up but view was amazing. What was nice was the area surrounding it with small cafes and shops. 
True Korea,"If you want to see and feel real Korea, go to Bukchon village. It’s within a walking distance from the main palace. Wander the narrow streets, pass by traditional houses...find a hidden observation spot in one of them. "
Big Traditional Village,The Village is quite big for Traditional Korean Village. People are still live in the Village so that make it unique.
experience of traditional Korean uptown,This is traditional uptown of Korea located close to Kyungbok palce. Powerful families used to stay in this area in old days and some of the architechs are well maintained still now. You can have rental hanbok and enjoy traditional tea enjoying the atmosphere.
Traditional Village In The Middle Of Modern City,"Bukchon Hanok Village will bring you to the latest year of Seoul, the village here was so cozy and clean. many shop provided for tourist to learn the traditional way."
Nothing special,"Thank to good weather it was pleasure to take a walk there, but village itself just bunch of old time building and you cannot get in there"
Want to go again!,"A really beautiful place in Seoul to enjoy traditional architecture. There are many cafes and restaurants as well as souvenier shops, so it's a good tourist spot. +you can rent a hanbok to walk around and take cute photos! Recommend!"
A little piece of history in the city,"Very easy to access, small area that can be finished in 30 mins. A look back at how houses were before. You can also rent traditional Hanboks along the way."
Small Village,"If you are curious how the residential area of the Koreans look like, you can drop by here. Maybe take a few photos, maybe an hour will do. This has become a tourist spot so you see signs of the residents to ""keep quiet"" to respect their privacy. Small village, nothing much to see and do. "
OLD SCHOOL Korea...,A must visit! So much fun walking all around town and seeing the true Korean culture! Good Times....
Quiet clean Village,I like this place.Its so quiet and the villages we visited was very clean.They even let us use the comfort room.Nice walkway and a lot of shops within the area.
Be patient for photo opp!,"This whole stretch of traditional houses nestles in between of busy roads. It can get very crowded though and very hard to get photo opportunities.When we went in december, one section was closed for filming (maybe it’s some korean drama) and the annoying part was there were cars passing by the narrow street. If you’re going to the palaces nearby, may as well visit here as it’s within walking distance (quite a long walk though).Not recommended for eldery or family with young children as the walk can be pretty tiring."
A must Visit place,I really enjoyed this historic village as there are a lot shops that offer numerous choices for me to rent a hanbok and also they offered items with a good price. There are certain place and area that is very picturesque as a good choice for a tourist to take a good photo in this place.
a nice walk,it is a very nice walk very close to the centerhouses are very well preserved and the overall area is very nice to walk trough 
"A space in the city, you don't expect.",Quietness all around. Cozy tea or coffee shops. Arts boutiques. Private houses well maintained. Ancient and elegant ambience. Not to miss. 
Good experience,Good to know and see the korean traditional house. Nice place to walk and take photos. Can take a break at the locals opening restaurant there.
Heritage Houses in the city,"Got to see how Korean maintain their heritage house. Tourist guide can be found easily in the street and can able speak English, Chinese and Japanese. Some tourist rent Hanbok and take pictures with houses."
Great visit to the traditional Seoul.,"If you enjoy architecture and culture, this is a good place to visit for 2 hours. On the way, they have great rice cake stand made out of real rice. It is a rural area where people live, so do expect some walking and do not expect a lot of shopping, although they do have some stores opened.Located nearby the Blue House (Korea's White House) and other government buildings."
Well kept,Good experience to see the 'older' side of the residential area. Most of the houses are well kept and clean. Many tourists rented the hanbok to take pictures.
Heritage place for great photography..,"We rent our hanbok at 公主韓服 (韓服租借)Princess Hanbok at 52-6 Anguk-dong, Jongno-gu, is 2 hours at 10000 won and 4 hours at 15000won for normal hanbok, if you choose different type of hanbok the price will be different (do take note) you can always ask the shop assistant, they speak very well chinese. By wearing Hanbok you can visit the Gyeongbokgung Palace for free. Places around this village is nice for a heritage photography, Goblin fans do take note, there is one scene from the drama itself is located here too. "
Heritage houses,A few houses along a steep slope with some shops selling souvenirs and ice-creams nearby. not worth the visit. Waste time
Very interesting,It was facinating to visit a traditional village that has been so well preserved. There are many interesting exhibits as well as live performances of Koreans in traditional costumes.
Not what I expected,After spending most of the day at the palaces my husband and I took a short walk to Bukchon. The area is totally not what I expected - there isn't really anything to see or do! There are a couple of restaurants/cafes and an okay view from the top of the hill but it was lacking the historic charm and vibrancy that I expected. There are a few galleries around but nothing worth writing home about.I would check out Bukchon if you are in the area but wouldn't suggest going out of your way to come here.
Hanok - traditional Korean house,So cool to see all those old houses. It is possible to peep into some of them and see what's inside. Also many old coffee shops
very intresting,Spent sometime walking through the village and and is interesting to see the wooden houses. It's pretty close to a metro station is one the things to do in Seoul. 
Picturesque Modern Old village,"If you are a lover of old architecture, you would love this place. It is also a nice place to capture lots of photos if you are wearing a Hanbuk bt overall it is just stroll to see the old village that has been modernize. We spent 1-2hours here while crossing from Gyeongbukgung to Changdeokgung. "
Amazing view,The view is fantastic! You get to see a lot of traditional houses and there are a few good traditional restaurant next to the Hanok Village
Good exercise! ,Place was easy to find with Naver Maps app. It’s basically an uphill walk and a quiet residential area. Good for exercise those legs with steep hills. Many areas for Instagram worthy photos. 
Walk Down Memory Lane,"This place was part of my check list before arriving in Korea, however due to time constraint and prioritization of sites this was initially deleted. I prioritize museums, after visiting the National Palace Museum, on our way to National Folk Museum we found ourselves walking on the lovely streets of this beautiful village. Rows of well preserved traditional houses, coffee shops, souvenir stores as well as stores offering hanbok rental can be found in the village. The walls that surround the village makes the place more beautiful. It was really like walking down memory lane. I wish I have longer time left to explore the village and to walk in every alley. I only spent 30 minutes here but I was in awed with its charm and beauty. I will surely visit this village again once I return to Seoul."
Beautiful village!,"Happy to be able to visit this village. It was a great experience to walk thru the village and see how the older homes used too look like! It's such a beautiful place that, it is still home to families, so respectfully, do your best not to make any loud noises or try to open any doors, they also have signs on their homes that say the same thing."
interesting and worth the visit,"traditional Korean village where you are able to learn more about some of korea's history.many places of interests, gift shops and restaurants nearby.walking distance from subway so it's pretty convenient.quite a fair amount of walking required if you want to see more sights.tourists or locals can rent their traditional outfits for photo-taking.not sure on the rental prices or the duration cause my wife didn't want to wear them.but you can see many people wearing them along the streets."
Rows of traditional Korean houses ,"We walk here from Gyeongbokgung palace using naver map and also the free map of bukchon provided by the red clothes tourist information were helpful . Some of the houses here have converted to tea house , b&b, etc . It was a steep walk and needs good stamina walking up the hill . "
traditoonal korean village,first it is quite a distance to walk from subway..please board a village bus if you have difficulty walking.secondly it has a slope so high that one must rest on and off..very nice views of the old traditional korean villages.please note museum was closed on sunday when i visited..wasted trip.many tourist ambassadors wearing red helping tourists on how to reach destination.but i have problem looking for the observatory.gave up eventually..should try the other namsangol hanok village which is easier to locate.
Old seoul preserved,Feels stepping into 700 years ago in the heart of modern Seoul. Small houses preserved and all renovated and converted to small shops and restaurants and B&B. Nice walk and exploring time.
Bukchon Village,I feel sorry for the people that live in this neighborhood. There are signs that ask visitors to be respectful and speak quietly. But the chance to see Korean architecture is not to be missed. They have beautiful homes and views with some shops that will allow you to go inside and see what the home is like on the inside. 
Leisurely peaceful stroll through a picturesque traditional village,The Bukchon Hanok village is up on a hilltop not far from the hustle and bustle of the center of Myeongdong and the Palace. It 's a fairly steep climb up through the narrow but picturesque little streets. Inside some of the homes are workshops selling or teaching Korean craftsmanship. There is a nice view of the rooftops from the top of the village. The doors on some of the homes are quite ornate and fun to look at. Walk down the hill and stroll through the nearby shops and cafes. Nice place to spend about 3 hours.
Bukchon Village Seoul,"Quaint village like area in the heart of Seoul, this is a real residential area and not made up for tourists, lots of little side streets and some are quite steep to walk up. From Anguk station take exit 2 and follow the signs, there are also tourist information people around to ask as well."
Rferreras,Must experience. Rent their traditional costumes then tour the village! Great for unlimited pics and memories.
Dark Too Soon,"It was kind of disappointed when we finally arrived the village; but it was too late and too dark. We could not see too much. We started the day touring the old Sejong Village and the Tongin Traditional Market on the other side of the palace, had late lunch then, walk around top of the Palace to the other side. We tried several pathways shortcuts into the Bukchon Hanok Village area; but not successful. Finally we had to walk down further and cut back in. The better way to the village is from the south end, subway station near the Japanese Embassy."
Colorful art,"Beautiful place to spend a afternoon, looking some designs, art, color and great coffee shops. U can wear a traditional clothes there and walk around."
Thoroughly enjoyed explore Bukchon Hanok Village area,"I loved wandering the narrow alleyways of the village. It was great to see the traditional housing. On the down side their were lots of tourist doing exactly what we were, but we found by ditching the map and just wandering, rather than following the crowd, it worked better. It's an area of new and old houses, all in keeping with the traditional style.Important to be respectful as these are peoples homes and there was a lot of publicity about noise levels etc.There are some great cafes in the area, so we had a good mix of exploring versus coffee, food and wine!We ended up going down some steps and ending up in a really hip cafe/bar area which was a good find as well."
Very interesting place to visit. Worth the trip ,Went to the Bukchon Hanok Village and it was a trip worth making. The traditional house is really nice. 
Beautiful traditional old village,"It's a nice place to visit, you can even rent their traditional Hanbok costume for taking pictures around the Hanok Village, costume rental costs 10,000won per hour, hairdo + 5,000won"
"Interesting look at the traditional houses, but crowded","While we visited the Gyeongbokgung Palace, we realized it was only a short walk to the Bukchon Hanok Village so we thought it would be a good opportunity to look at the traditional houses. First off, even in the middle of winter it was very crowded. Since the area is essentially just a neighborhood of new and old houses which keep the look and style of old Korean dwellings, to walk around is free. This attracts a lot of people as expected. What I personally found is that you don’t truly see much while you are there. Because you walk in and around streets and alleys you only really see roofs, walls and doors. Don’t get me wrong it was interesting but not what I expected. It is also more visually stunning than what pictures will ever be able to capture, so in my opinion take a few photos but don’t be worried about photographing a ton of structures. You can go in a few places that are now shops, but we decided to forego that process since they were mostly tea houses and I’m not a big tea drinker. Also the touristy shops on the main street are nothing to get excited about. The one thing we did do is find some great food in the neighborhood. We ended up at a great noodle and dumping house where we partook in both delicacies. It was amazing and for only 15,000 won (or a little less than $15 US) we were both stuffed. "
Not much to see,It is an area to visit once and only takes about 10 mins since not too much to see. The Ginseng Chicken Soup Restaurant is definitely a pass. Not worth dining there. 
A taste of days-gone-by Korea,"Take a walk through this ‘village’ to get a taste of what Korea was like before Seoul became a megalopolis. More like several, wide city blocks Bukchon village is a nice mix of narrow streets, tea and coffee houses, museums, craft workshops and little shops interspersed with private homes from modest to quite grand. Stop at the visitor center for a map with a nice walking trail laid out and then be prepared to wander for the next hour or so as you explore. Tip: stop at the tea museum (top of the trail) for a great view of the village and surrounding area. It costs 5,000 won to get in but includes a nice cup of tea with your view. "
Charming historical environment,Charming small streets in old town of Seoul. Easy to walk. Nice craft shops and cafe's. Close to CBD. 
A stroll through a different time,"It is like time stood still in some areas, a look into traditional Korean housing. Many Koreans walking around with traditional outfits make it even more authentic. Remember to keep your voice down as people live there, but provides great views and takes you around eventually to some nice shops. "
Mix of old and new,"I took a free Seoul walking tour of this area, which was great for getting the historical view. Even without that, one can get a great look at historically-preserved homes that keep a bit of old Korea around in the heart of the growing city. The homes are typically private residences and very well maintained. It’s fantastic for photos to really capture the blend of old and new."
Good on a sunny day,"It was nice to see the place and the street but I was expecting more traditional houses and the life styles of people. But this place become more touristic and less traditional , but it's good to see it"
Amazing,This place is incredible beautiful. Even tho it was super cold we had a great time. Korea is not just kpop. A must go! 
Traditional houses dated back to Joseon Dynasty,"The traditional houses at Bukchon Hanok Village is extremely beautiful. There are cultural centers, guesthouses & tea houses at the village providing visitors with an opportunity to experience Korean cultural. "
Another place to take pictures,"From the Gyeongbokgung palace, you can just walk about 1-2 km to this village. Please get a map from the information counter. If not, you will lost. You cannot make too much noise because this is a residential area. I don't recommend you to buy souvenirs from this village, it is a bit overpriced."
Great for Photos,"Great for photos but other than that, not much to do as it's a residential area with a few converted to galleries or shops."
Nice traditional korean town,"It was something nice to see. There’s not a whole lot to do here except to see the old traditional houses. It’s possible to do a “korean experience” here, but was too cold when we went so didn’t stay too long. "
Amaizng stroll,"Great place to see some architecture, take some pictures and meander at your leisure. Easy to get to from metro. Multiple places to stop for some shopping, eat or drink. Highly suggest if the weather is nice strolling from the palace over to just enjoy the area."
Beutiful doors,"This Village have really beutiful hanoks, tradicional Korean houses. Some times you can see the TV stations shooting o show in this location. If ypu like wood work you can see that some of this houses has a really pretty doors. Is really well take care and really clean too."
"Very touristy, but worth a quick wander","Worth a quick wander to see the old houses, and enjoy views of old-and-new side-by-side. Rather full of touristy shops though. "
Unique!,"This is a very unique place to visit, but a little strange to be wandering in a neighbourhood and snapping pictures of actual peoples homes. Some are not too welcoming, but that is understanding. Be mindful and quiet as this is an actual community... Don't be the guys we saw, LOUD and posing for multiple pictures, etc. Great views when you reach the top too! One tip? There is a paid observatory, avoid it. Instead, walk around the corner and see the beautiful sunset for FREE! "
"A little ""Lost"" village","A little lost would've been an understatement as my sister and I followed the original Google maps & Naver direction but ended up quite far from where we were meant to be. Whilst lost, we also caught up with another 4 tourists who had the same directions as we did and were completely mistified on how we could've missed a whole village. After 25 minutes, we caught up with a local who advised us to walk down the complete opposite way for another 8 - 10 minutes and we found it as per our map screen shot below.All in good time and only good things come to those who are patient Right? Sure enough we found it along with a Michelin star ginseng chicken soup restaurant. #win."
Lovely little town in the city,This is a lovely little place to just get lost in. There are many small museums/galleries and interesting shops and of course the old Korean architecture. We found a nice little tea house in one of the old buildings and had a wonderful cup of traditional Korean Omija tea.
Traditional area,I may qualify this area as traditional...if you are a big fun of culture palaces then you should definitely visited. They are many hanok the traditional korean houses....you can take pictures inside the house also there's a palace nearby...you can also rent the Hanbok before going there from Hanbok shops nearby ... it's a very quite neighberhood where you can find nice restaurant we have tried an italian one which is very good....also don't miss a shop of traditional croissant...they're so much delicious they taste like a little drops of heaven
Nice korean homes,You can see alot of traditional house of korea in bukchon hanok village. The vibe is good. Remember to keep voices down as there are people living there. Wearing a hanbok to stroll around seems like a good activity.
Worth seeing.,"Not a large area such as Jeonju, but an authentic living space. Easy to get to from the central Insadong area."
Good place to visit for foreign travelers as well as for koreans,"This is a small village of traditional korean houses (Han-ok). This area was the place where government officers lived during Chosun dynasity, because of its location close to the Kyungbok palace. With an one hour, self-guided walking tour around the village, you can enjoy a scenery of korean traditional houses on narrow alleys. There are several shops where you can rent korean traditional outfits for your memorable picture. There are many attractive cafe, restaurants in Sam Cheong dong, a village near Bukchon. In addition, this place is close to other tourist attractions such as Insa dong and Kyoungbok palace. You can visit here after of before visiting these nearby places."
One of best spot in city fringe !,"Traditional houses, designer shops, houses architecture and nice cafe! Suggestion: Walk around with your hanbok "
Historical Place,Really a good place to go. It is a real houses so you shouldnt make noises there because the neighborhood..Come here and rent hanbok.. You will feel like in historical drama
Bukchon traditional culture center 北村文化中心,It’s a nice place for photo shooting if you have limited time to visit Bukchon. 如果你沒有時間，只能輕度遊北村，這裡很適合拍照。
Great place to see traditional houses,A great place to walk around and look at traditional houses for a couple of hours. Make sure you get a map which takes you on a guided walk all around the village. We got ours in one of the museums. Lots of little shops and cafes around.
Back to the old time,A nice walk with good food and souvenir shopping. The houses are very pretty and bring back the old time
Traditional Homes,Bukchon-ro 12-gil: A Row of Old Korean HousesThe architecture is unique. Glazed roof tiles to protect the house from the bitter winter of Korea and the torrential rains that regularly visits the country during its rainy months. The wooden walls of the main house is to keep the temperature inside as constant as possible.Just by walking down the road where these row houses were built makes one wonder and appreciate at the same time the conceptual design and construction of Korean houses. It is a traditional Korean village with lots of alleys and narrow streets. It was the residential quarters of traditional Korean people and was preserved to show the world a 600 year old urban environment. Tourists as well as amateur and professional photo enthusiasts crisscrossed the street taking as much pictures for posterity and what have you. Visitors experienced the atmosphere of Joseon Dynasty. These houses are simply a sight to behold. Bukchon means “north village.”
Authentic designs,Very beautiful and authentic place to visit to see the old traditional houses of the locals. Beautiful designs and very photogenic place especially with some snow on the roof of these houses. Place to visit. 10 mins walk to subway station and palace so can kill 2 birds with a stone.
a Village that represent Korean history,"i love the architecture of this village, lovely place to take a picture... i love walking and sightseeing here"
Nice sight of a mostly lost beauty,"If you imagine, pre war Seoul was filled with these traditional Korean houses you will find in this area. All lost for a more concrete solution, but here. On weekends people rent the traditional Korean clothing (Hanbok) and roam the streets which adds to attractiveness of this area, nearly nestled between the two major palaces of Seoul. There are many nice cafes and tea houses where you can relax from the busy streets and enjoy the inside of a Hanok.Do not forget to bring your camera and enjoy this glimpse into the past."
Back in Time at the Bukchon Hanok Village,"It's very nice to see a village of traditional houses nestled in South Korea's very urban capital. If you're not visiting the countryside, coming here somehow gives you an idea of the how things used to be before all the modernization happened. So peaceful to walk along and observe the traditional Korean architecture since the village discourages very loud noise from visitors as a lot of these houses are still being resided in.For the ""complete historic experience"" it's nice to go around in hanbok and have your photo taken here. And while you're at it, might as well continue the day in a hanbok visiting the Gyeongbukgong and/or Changdokgung palaces nearby."
Back to Joson Era with this civilized well decorated Villege,"The villege are well build, some foods and shopping along the way. Recommend to walk from Angkuk station along to the Bukchon villege to Kyongbokgung palace. This will consume around 4-6 hours in total (uncluding brief cafe hopping) to see it all around."
Not what expected ,"The walk through the village was nice, but not much more than a stroll through traditional Korean homes. Gives a good perspective of traditional homes, but very little shopping. A few places for tea. "
Cultural and best palce to take a picture ,This place is so cultural. Many traditional architecture houses and tea rooms. You can have many good photo spots here. 
Time travel,This little village set atop a hill takes you back in time and lets you see how civilization was back then
Self tour,Was lucky enough to have a local Korean friend take me walking through this area. Worth the walk to see the traditional architecture and visit the homes.
Hanbok rental ,The shop is a bit hard to find as it is located at the underground floor. It’s only three minutes walk to changdeokgung palace. Their service is very good and friendly. Price ok and have many types of hanbok for rent. 
A bit underwhelming...,This village is somewhat interesting and offers some nice views over the city. If you are into art then there are plenty of galleries within the village but I didn't really get a quaint feel from it. It's hard to be charmed when you pass by several international stores that are geared towards tourists who like to shop. What happened to the Korean-ness of this place?
"My favorite neighborhood in Seoul: Picturesque historic buildings, hipster cafes, and palaces!","Bukchon is a gorgeous neighborhood full of beautifully restored historic hanok buildings interspersed with hipster cafes, small artsy boutiques, and traditional Korean restaurants. There are two parts to the area. West Bukchon is bordered on the west by Gwanghwamun Palace and contains arts-related attractions like the National Museum of Contemporary Art, the Hyundai Gallery, and many others. West Bukchon is full of established boutiques, restaurants, and cafes. Many people take photos along the high palace walls and in front of White Birch Story Cafe because the popular K-Drama ""Goblin"" was filmed here. This is also where you'll find Artee Riders pedicab tour company - book a tour and enjoy a glass of vin chaud in their cafe, but leave room for a hottoek (Korean deep-fried doughnut filled with cinnamon, sugar and seeds) at the stand across the alley. West Bukchon also has the huge, flagship Wood and Brick bakery and restaurant, which is definitely worth a visit for excellent salads, sandwiches, pastries, and coffee. East Bukchon is just across the busy road called Bukchon-ro and is bordered on the east by Changdeokgung Palace. This area has the most picturesque streets and lavishly restored hanok houses - you could spend hours wandering the hilly alleyways taking photos everywhere. There is also a main shopping street in this area, that has more hipster, independent establishments like industrial-chic cafes and a bespoke tailor/whiskey bar called Knockers where they play Frank Sinatra and is run by the most stylish father-son duo you'll ever meet.If you only have one day in Seoul I highly recommend spending it exploring Insadong, Bukchon, either or both of the major Palaces, Gwangwhamun Square, and maybe pop into Jogyesa Buddhist Temple. They are all so conveniently located and everything is easily walkable."
Walk back in time to how ancient Korean houses looked like.,"It was a pleasant surprise to see that it was not just a tourist site. It was in fact a living, breathing, real life residential community that has successfully preserved old Korea look and feel. We had to be quiet while admiring the houses as actual residents were in their houses. Everything was picture-perfect and we spent quite some time posing at beautiful streets lined with quaint Korean houses."
Pretty,"Don't fool yourself into thinking that this place is very close to the palace. It is quite a bit of a walk. Recommend taking a taxi. Taxis are much cheaper in Seoul as compared to a lot of other countries in the East or West. The village is on both sides of the road and there are a few points from where you get good photos. Steep climb and not stroller friendly, No baby changing stations.The place is pretty though. We had our GInseng chicken soup in one of the nearby restaurants which was fab."
Must visit!,"I recommend you to rent hanbok (traditional korean costume) & take tons of photos! Love getting lost & going through back alleys. You will find lots of quaint cafes, boutique shops & the amazing Korean building architecture which takes you back in time!"
Short visit,It is nice to walk around and take photos in front of the traditional houses but not much to do here. There are a few shops but not very many and when I have taken guests jere both trips have been short. This would be a good site to take a guided tour if that is offerred to get a better understanding of what you are looking at.
"Organized, well maintained & beautiful","Traditional korean houses neighbourhood,well maintained and clean. U need to lower down your volume as to not disturb the residents living in the area. I managed to find kokdu museum which sells pretty souvenirs & there are cafes as you stroll along the neighbourhood. "
A taste of the past!,"I highly recommend visiting the village, although it is set apart from the rest of the tourist area. I took a free tour offered by the city's tourism department, which took me to two museums, gave me some history of the city, and had great views! The day I went was quiet, although the guide said usually there were a lot more people. There are also some places to get Korean street food, some traditional tea houses, and a few shops with clothing and souvenirs."
Ok,It's a residential area. Nothing much to see but old houses. Nice cheap stores in the area. Close to some palaces. Clean streets.
Amazing!,"It's amazingly beautiful place! So aunthetic and quite. Also, many interesting traditional coffee shops and museums here. "
Didn't see this as that worth it.,"This is a residential area with some korean themed houses, there is nothing much else to do in this area. I wouldn't not make it a priority."
Quaint houses,"Beautiful Hanoks, the street view was very nice. At the time we went, several Hanoks were under construction. It could be more picture perfect."
Lovely traditional stroll,"One of the top tourist attractions in Seoul. Small houses with decorative roofs, traditional tea houses and small gift shops. A Korean TV show was filming when we were there. Nice view of the city from the top of the hill."
Beautiful Korean Village,"The village has alot of spaces to take pictures in, a couple of houses are open for display and don't require entrance fee for. You can easily spend half a day exploring this area taking your time to take pictures. Lots of shops also rent out hanboks for the ultimate Korean experience."
Wonderful,"Wonderful attractions of Seoul. understand the history not Korea, Seoul & it's culture. Cultural programs also happens. "
Nation Korean soul,Located near Gyeongbokgung Palace Village is very beautiful and feel to much national there. Also through sreets there are places where u may rent national clothes and may take photo in the streets. For me its on most 5 things to do in Seoul
Trek,"If a semi heritage self tour is what you want to do, this is one of them. Old houses and new houses with the era architecture. (Although there are new styles). It is a walking tour so be prepared. It should be mentioned that this place sits on a hill, so there is a good deal of climbing. We were there during the winter and I would imagine the place during the summer where it would be hard finding a shade. There are places selling snacks in the base of the hill, but again, it is a walk. "
Nice village for a stroll ,"I went there to kill some time during a layover of my flight. It was easy to get there by underground and then to have a nice walk around the area. It’s actually a residential area which still bears the traditional style of old times Korea. Unfortunately you can’t enter the houses since they are private, but there are some photogenic spots and also some nice tea houses and shops. "
Not much to see,"There's really not much to see here except houses in traditional Korean architecture. I went before lunchtime, so there weren't a lot of people, and the area was exceptionally quiet (there are signs all around saying to not make a lot of noise since families actually still live in the houses). "
Disappointing,"We were here as it's one of the must visit places in Seoul and we were anticipating to visit this village. We followed the map, and unfortunately couldn't find the exact location so we kept walking up and down the slopes until we saw a lot of other tourists and yup, that's the place. It was crowded with tourists and signs boards were everywhere asking passersby to be silent as it's a residential area. Wooden structures of the traditional houses were interesting but the crowds, the over expectations of this place and weariness of finding the right place just put off the excitements of visiting this place.Good for first timer to Seoul but don't expect too much. "
Interesting place to visit but not a must~,"I went there with a friend and was amazed by the traditional houses - i mean the whole area was actually filled with those type of houses like those you saw in their dramas. But Its a bit disappointing as it was actually a real residential area and you can only see it from the outside. We manage to go in one of the residence - Baek In Jae House. It was really huge and he even have his own reading pavilion! the house were well kept but...we are not allowed to step in the house, so we just stroll around. But i like the environment tho! Along the narrow road you can find few souvenir shops, but its a bit pricey as it was unique and not like those souvenirs we buy in bulks. Most of the items sold were those made in small quantities and they look very precious and artistic to me. I end up buying their Korean biscuit - unfortunately I forgot the name... Its super yummy!!!!"
A must do for photo opportunities,Did a small walkabout the area as it wasn't too far off GYBHK palace. Nice quaint place for pics and even rent traditional wear and snacks.
Interesting place but was disappointed,"I was looking forward to seeing the old building. BUt this is actual residential homes, so you can only see it from the outside. And have to be mindful to keep it quiet. IT was also hilly, so walk is quite tough."
Experience the past ,"Well preserved and maintained traditional housing village. Rather hilly to walk around but absolutely fascinating place to visit and stay! There are many traditional style inns with modern setup for your convenience where you can even cook your own meals. Many cute stores, where sell handmade jewellery, good quality leather goods and so much more! "
Just ok but worth a visit,"There is no much to do but to walk and take pictures. It was confused for us to find the starting point. So we just walked from where we were, still not knowing if we have missed part of the route. The houses are traditional and well maintained. Must come here one time if you visit Seoul."
PAST SCENT,A NICE TO PLACE TO VISIT. has nothing to impress you its just nice. to hang out and see how old days houses and suburban's in Seoul lives. I wouldn't vistt again if I had the chance
Very cozy place ,If you want to just chill with your friends i do recommend this place. It’s 10 min taxi drive from anguk station. They have very interesting Cousins and cafe with comic books 
Lovely tourist attraction,A lovely village with many old traditional Korean houses. Saw many tourists wearing hanbok and took pictures. it is a bit of uphill and downhill climb but worth it since the view is good!
Family vacation,It have many historical buildings and the structure are unique. It was well preserved and very clean. Many tourists came here to visit. 
Beautiful tourist attraction,It is a nice village with traditional Korean houses which enhance the beauty of this place. There are many view points from where beauty of nature can be enjoyed. One has to walk a lot & a little bit uphill too to explore this village . There are not many dustbins in Seoul. Its better to carry a plastic bag for trash while exploring the city. This village is full of life with many tourists. Palaces & temples enhance the beauty of this village.
Very touristy,A nice village with old traditional Korean houses. People live in them so it is advised to walk quiet. The roads are nice to walk along but it feels very touristy with many tourist aimed businesses at these houses. 
Beautiful,Absolutely serene neighbourhood with traditional style homes. It's a bit of an uphill climb but worth the view when you get to the top. You'll need to be quiet though as people still live in the village. There are shops + restaurants lining the climb that are also worth visiting.
Pick up a Free Map,We picked up a free map in the area of the Bukchon Hanok Village. I would advise getting a map. You don't need a guide. The map and the staff will tell you the best route to walk. It is pretty popular with tourists and some even rent the traditional costumes for photography. Keep in mind this is a residential area so refrain from talking loudly.We enjoyed walking around and seeing the historic architecture.
If you've never been... A must stop,Been to Seoul many trips but this time tool the effort to visit. It will be a sure stop next trips. Such a lovely place to spend the afternoon. The houses were magnificent and gorgeous. Found an ahjumma selling hotteok and it's simply divine. So so good. Only wish I could eat more than one... 
Serene and enchanting residential area,"We liked the whole relaxing atmosphere of Bukchon. The houses were beautiful and we also chanced upon a 'shop' selling candles and perfumes/oils. Some of the scents were really unusual so we could not resist buying some. Overall, it was a relaxing afternoon for us and although we would have liked to wear a hanbok like some of the other tourists, it was too cold for us."
Goto the observatory ,"We followed the signage to the observatory. It's on the top floor of a building in the area. Paid 3,000won/adult for the entrance fees. Quite a stunning view but it's not something that you will view for hours. We sat in the observatory area for half hour to rest our legs after all the walking, took pics and left. "
Peaceful place in Seoul,"we could see really peaceful and traditional village in the middle of Seoul. It was fabulous to see skyscrapers in Seoul from the traditional village, such as a combination of modern and traditional one.I used the map I got from the entrance well since without the map, it is probably easy to get lost or miss some spots to see.There are some shops to buy gifts or beverages at the beginning of the village, so it was quite enjoyable!Also left side of the village, there are restaurants and cafes, so we could have a nice meal at there!One thing I was uncomfortable was that there wasn’t any trash bin on the street"
Travel in time,"Seoul is one of the most modern megacities in Asia I have come across, also with the least amount of old buildings left. Bukchon is a travel in time. Unfortunately also for the residents it has become a tourist attraction. I spent as much time taking pictures of Chinese tourists posing as viewing old houses."
Very authentic! Full of locals (and tourists too),Go on weekend. It's very croud but very authentic! A lot o locals go there and there are places to rent traditional costumes for you to take pictures. I have amazing pictures of locals with there costumes. Some nice places to eat to.
Beautiful but nothing special,"Beautiful streets, but walking here is quite annoying because it's either uphill or downhill. They have stores here as well as food stalls."
Preserved traditional houses in the city,"This neighborhood is close to Insadong, and approximately 15min walk from Gyeongbokgung palace.It was well-signed, so feel free to wander and appreciate this cute little neighbourhood. The contrast of old and new, busy and peaceful, modern and traditional of Seoul It is an active residential area so there were signs to keep noise to a minimum.Cafes and little souvenir shops were aplenty. There were several public toilets too. The stroll can range from normal straight level to several hill slopes depending on which route is taken."
Remainders of old-time Seoul,"Mixed old and new residential buildings, including some of few left traditional Hanoi houses. Many restaurants. Several workshops and one hanok house converted into a museum. Easy to access by metro, a nice one hour walk giving an idea how Seoul looked in old times. "
Silence is golden,"The village is located nearer to one of Seoul's major palaces, Changdeokgung. You can get off at the Anguk, and start looking for groups of giggling hanbok-wearing girls (locals + tourists) making their way somewhere. Chances are they're heading to this village for their cutesy photos. This is a residential area where traditional houses are preserved for modern day use. You'll find average looking houses interspersed with grand structures with formidable gates. However, do remember that there are real people living inside these houses, so a little consideration for their peace will be much appreciate. Silence is golden."
Lovely to stroll,"Located near the major palaces in north Seoul, this village is free to walk. The streets consist mainly of residences so don't expect much in terms of shopping. Yido pottery and KwangJuYo Pottery are nearby if you want the best in Korean ceramics, however."
Great village especially with a walking tour,"Had a great time by taking a Seoul City Walking Tour of Bukchon Hanok Village - in total the duration was around 2-3 hours and the guide spoke extremely good English. We enjoyed it a lot, and definitely think we enjoyed it more than we would have if we just walked around on our own"
Beautiful place to stroll,I really enjoyed taking a walk just to look at the streets and buildings. Great place to take photos if you're renting a traditional Hanbok. 
"Nice stroll, good for a few pictures ","If you happen to be around, it’s worth it to stop by for a few pictures, but there’s nothing that special to do.Somehow I feel that the people around prefer not to be disturbed by tourists."
Nothing much to see,"We took a trip down specially to this village. To be honest there wasn’t much to see except a few streets with some older looking architecture. There’s shops renting hanbok, which adds on slightly to the experience. Wouldn’t recommend a special trip to this place unless architecture and history are your thing. "
Interesting,"I visited Bukchon Hanok Village, with a friend and it was really interesting to see a traditional style village, which is actually still a residential area. Lots of people walking around in Hanbok. Nice observation point where you can have a glimpse of the city. "
Early Morning Visit,"We were staying in a hanok (Irang Guesthouse - highly recommended) in Bukchon Hanok Village. Hence we could explore the area and the famous 8 sights early in the morning, before tour buses arrive.The other advantage of staying in the village was that we can start from the top (near 3rd view), and walk down. (So many friends who started from Anguk Station complained that there were many slopes to climb.)It was a lovely morning walk, and we found it interesting to meander around hanoks which are lived-in (and not museum pieces). There was some construction near 6th view, which was a pity as this was one of my favourite views.Enjoy..."
Feels like you're in the past,"Lovely street to stroll around and admire the architecture of the houses. It's also a residential area so it's recommended to not make too much noise. However, there are a lot of tourists taking the opportunity to take photos in every building which can be annoying. Also, it's very near to Changdeokgung Palace and Samcheong-Dong."
Soul of Seoul,Samcheong dong is a quaint neighbourhood just east of Gyeongbokgung palace. It's filled with small cafes and restaurants; art galleries and museums as well as boutiques. Here you may also find some colourful murals and interesting art installations. You can walk through Samcheong dong en route to the Bukchon traditonal Hanok village which is very close by and a great way to experience some Korean culture and history.
Good afternoon walk,Great place for an afternoon walk. Lots of cafes and what not to stop for break. Very enjoyable with good views
Very cool place to visit,We have visited this village through a free walking tour and it was great. Tour guide showed us few unique architectural characteristics of the Korean buildings.
Historical buildings and streer,"For me it’s nothing special. Just some small street with old fashioned house. Anyway, it’s quite historical as new building are everywhere in the city. Not a must-go in Seoul. "
Touristy but good,"One will have a more pleasant experience if one goes early and beats the crowds. There are a few quirky shops and photographers will have a good chance for some memorable shots.Go early, though. "
Interesting traditional village in the city,Walked around this traditional village for about 2 hours. Checked out traditional houses which partly have been converted to restaurants and shops.
"Neat, but not necessary","The are is neat. If you're looking for a nice walk, then this place is worth going to. The pictures basically capture what you'd see so you won't miss much not going. It's a little hard to find the right alleys so make sure you get your hands on a map that shows you the route that you need to walk. You can find one at the cultural centre or with one of the tourist helpers that stand around some intersections."
Authentic Korea,"Excellent in every way; especially if, like my girlfriend, you have a lifelong interest in wearing a Hambock dress which you can hire for around 20,000 KRW for 2 hours. The buildings are mostly private so enjoy the authenticity in a respectful manner."
Great place to visit! We loved it! ,"My wife an I spent several hours wandering around here. A brief flurry of snow at the start of the day added to the occasion. We went to the museum first and the helpful gentleman there furnished us with a map, which was useful. We followed the suggested route. There are lots of nice old buildings, and plenty of photo opportunities.There are also several places where traditional Korean clothing can be hired, if you are that way inclined.Overall a wonderful experience! We loved it. "
Very unique place,"Always we seen from TV drama, should drop by to see. Subway can reach. But need a walking distance, about 20 mins. If happen you lost, there is a tourist person. Who dress in red t-shirt & black pant & with a hat. They can guide you to the area.Once you reach ""Bukchon hanok village:, must be quiet . That location still is a resident area. Of course, you can enjoy the place and houses."
Traditional districts with nice walks,"More authentic than Insa-dong, BHV offers a few quiet walks along narrow lanes, mostly car-free. A nice rest from the busy capital, and an interesting way to discover a more authentic side of Korea. A bit hilly, wear good shoes. Be sure to grab a map at the visitor centre.The closest station in Anguk."
Evening was better time ,"We went to there on Evening time(around 1800~1900). This time, The Village haven’t many people to take pictures with Korea traditional cloth so we could see and took picture with only us Also we could see Soul tower from top of the village."
fast walking course for me,"This place is some neighborhood that full of Korean traditional house. It's full of cafe's and some craft studios. The architectural and structure is amazing, but for you who visit this place just for taking nice photo's you better visit this place in the morning, because it will full with tourist that you will hard to find nice spot to take photo's. And because this place is a neighborhood which is people still live in the house, so you can not walk loudly, and you need to mind the person who live in the house if you want to take photo's in front of their house door."
Traditional Housing,Such a cool thing to see while in the city that there are still old fashioned looking homes. They’re out of the way and somewhat easy to locate. They’re real homes that people still live in so make sure you’re quiet while visiting the Bukchon Hanok Village. 
Gorgeous-Must,Caught the sunset from up above! So beautiful! Walking around the old town was peaceful and scenic. Check it out for sure!
Quick walk through,"It’s a small community with some traditional and modern architectural low rise buildings. It is a real community with shops, restaurants, convenience stores, restaurants ,schools , church,etc. The major added bonus in this community is that there are many hanbok shops and few tea houses. There were few restaurants where several Korean TV programs filmed and commented. It is a good place to take pictures and enjoy a meal. "
Quick tour on a Saturday,We really enjoyed touring this village as it had old world charm and showcased the traditional homes and the korean style charming village. It’s a wonderful place for the foreign tourist to get a quick intro to old Korea. We had much fun people watching and enjoyed some traditional hot tea at the tea house. We highly recommend this place as a destination in Seoul. 
Not impressed,"It's too commercialised, shops everywhere. Shops are more attractive than culture. I'm not very impressed."
Nice Cultural Village To Wander Around,"Has quite a bit to see and do. It is a real village with current residents living beside attractions and museums for tourists. They offer workshops for several traditional arts like calligraphy, knot tying, arts and crafts for a reasonable price. I regret not planning in advance. But if you have time, go explore and make reservations for later. Classes are run every day. They take as little as 30 mins to half a day."
Ancient views,"From Gyeongbokgung Palace we walked to Bukchon Hanok Village. We got lost and good thing we found information center where they give you a map but they don't speak a lick of english. There are 2 areas of the village and we chose the left side entrance of the road. We rented hanbok for only 1 hour. Rental for an hour is 10,000 won while 5,000 won for the hair arrangement, 1,000 won for the peticot and another 1,000 won for the locker where you keep your belongings while you roam around the village. Many tourists flock the area in the afternoon so better be early if you want to have a moment on your own with no photobombers. The village is very quiet and the houses are picturesque. If only one owner of the house would allow tourists to enter his house then that would be great. We can see the actual beauty of the house inside out. It's also possible to see the inside beauty because there are houses that turned into a guesthouse but very pricey compared to other hotels. All in all its good."
Authentic ,Not so crowded and many hip independent shops among Korean traditional houses. Good place for walk! I highly recommend here. My favorite place in Seoul 
Hanok. Come early in the morning to avoid the crowd,"Came here early before I went to Gyeongbokgung Palace. The area is so photogenic, everywhere is a photo spot. As it is a residential area, there are signs urging tourists to keep the noise level down. It is a refreshing experience seeing how old Korean houses look like and comparing it to the high rises that they have now."
Nice ancient area,"It is a complex of old villages in the centre of Seoul. It took us a while to figure out the most popular place where there are full of tourists. Again, when you come to popular places, try to beat the crowds by starting the trip early. The villages are beautiful but guests are expected to make less noise as people are still living there. Many of the houses become guest houses so you can come there and stay. It is on the hill so it might be difficult for old people. "
Quaint village in the city,The Bukchon Hanok village is a lovely area just next to one of the big palaces. The traditional architecture is interesting.
it's a unique residential,"this place is private quarters for many locals so behave, be quiet and respectful. similar to walking through a french village, you could take photos of the unique architecture. bring good cameras. one of the road has namsan tower in the background "
"Bukchon Hanok Village, Seoul",This fascinating area of Seoul is on the tourist route and demonstrates some of the earlier Korean way of living and architecture. Well worth a visit.
Bukchon Hanok Village,This area is gorgeous and very historic. People still live here. It tends to get very busy so plan to go in off-peak times. It’s great to be able to see such a preserved piece of Korean history.
Korean for a day,We visit bukchon hanok village and dress up in hanbook to feel “koreans for a day” and took loads of photos. Be mindful of noise as this is an actual neighborhood where people live. Great little nooks and alleys for photo opp.
Small Narrow Maze-like Street but Full of Beautiful Korean Traditional Houses,"Enjoyed maze like street full of Korean traditional old houses. Amazingly people still lives in those houses. Watching roof tops at higher place was spectacular. If you are not sure about navigating street, join the short tour. But lost in the maze would be a fun too (if you have time)"
Nice stroll:),You will see traditional style houses preserved like in the old days situated not too far from the urbanized Seoul:) I felt like I time travelled in an instant:) There are people walking around on their hanbok dresses so it’s so fun and educational at the same time!
Can be skipped,"When one reads the blogs and travel books, this place is written up as more exciting than it is. Yes there are Korean houses on this cliffside community. But thats it. If I had known, considering our very limited time, I would just check it out on line. The time could have been used for other activities where being present would have made a difference to our experience."
Must Visit!,It was truly an amazing experience!The rental of the costumes were seamless and the lady was really helpful. The were information staff stationed at different parts of the village and they speak English and were extremely helpful.It was a beautiful village and worth the visit for anyone visiting Seoul the first time. 
Traditional architecture for a quiet walk,"This neighbourhood is where the traditional Korean houses (hanok) are located. Some houses are centuries years old and while most of these houses are still occupied by actual living people, some have turned them into shops selling teas, souvenirs, food, perfumes, etc. Good place to have leisurely strolls or people-watching while taking a sip of tea or a bite of pastry."
Heritage Visit,This is our first time exploring this place. We love their house building & their culture. They also have nice cosy cafes & restaurants. It's a must go if going to Seoul as we don't always get to see traditional house building & structure.
Amazing,"Surrounded by Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changdeokgung Palace and Jongmyo Shrine, Bukchon Hanok Village is home to hundreds of traditional houses, called hanok, that date back to the Joseon Dynasty. The name Bukchon, which literally translates to ""northern village,"" came about as the neighborhood lies north of two significant Seoul landmarks, Cheonggyecheon Stream and Jongno. Today, many of these hanoks operate as cultural centers, guesthouses, restaurants and tea houses, providing visitors with an opportunity to experience, learn and immerse themselves in traditional Korean culture,.... a must see in Seoul."
Traditional Korea,"Bukchon Hanok Village was amazing! Filled with quirky shops, delicious food and traditional architecture. It's surrounded by palaces, galleries and museums so if you plan your day you can walk through Bukchon whilst visiting palaces and galleries. "
"Not a typical village as you would expect, however full of character and arty shops","This was a very pleasant area to walk around, lots of craft type shops and many smaller clothes shops. There a number of small museums in the village area including a typical Korean house.There were many local tourist guides around offering free advice and maps. Each time you came to a fork on the map a guide seemed to magically appear with directions, so efficient.Plant places to eat and drink in the area.Well worth a visit."
Quiet Stroll in the morning with Traditional teashops,Viewing old traditional houses gives you some nostalgic feel to the the culture. Traditional architecture of the Hanok house acquaints the visitor on the wisdom of how the hanoks were built with surrounding materials available with a view of the family as a basic social unit and the how the community lived. And it is a good contrast with nearby vibrant Samcheong-dong area and Seoul’s cafe culture.
Love this village!!,Love this village!! Visited in the month of October and the weather is just right that makes this place feel so comfortable. They do have much cafe choices in this area. Will definitely come n visit again next time
A must to see when in Seoul,"We used the a Lonely Planet walking tour plan which was quite successful as we are both good walkers and not afraid of hills. The village is well preserved with many old houses with original roofs. It's sort of upmarket touristy, with not too many tacky souvenir shops, although several tourists were wandering around in traditional clothes they had hired taking selfies."
Traditional Korean houses,"The Bukchon Hanok Village is a charming village with lots of traditional Korean houses called “hanok”. Some of these houses go back to the times of the Joseon Dynasty. Bukchon lies north of the Cheonggyecheon Stream. At the time of my visit, various tourists hired local costumes and dressed up in the traditional way. There were a few shops selling souvenir items and snacks. The village has guesthouses and tea rooms. In essence the hanoks are like small culture centres where you can learn and gain experience of traditional Korean culture. It would be best to take the metro to Anguk station and walk from there. Admission is free.You should aim to spend between sixty to ninety minutes here."
What’s all the hype ?? ,Small houses have been ‘preserved’ according to korean tradition. Beautiful handicrafts and aesthetic architecture but apart from that horde of tourists clogging up narrow alleys does actually take away the charm. Understably local residents would like tourists to be quiet as possible but the cacophony of increasing decibels can be unbearable. Definitely not for a second visit. 
"Residential Area, good for a wander around!",We cheated and took a taxi to the highest point in the village and then walked down ! It is a lovely little village with houses still faithful to the original buildings. We spent a few hours looking around and checking out the little museums and coffee shops. 
Different for non-asian people,I had couple of hours before I leave for my flight. I went there. Nice place to see. You can see how the historical houses are and they are still residential and some of tgem renovated. Worth to see if you are close. 
A Walk in History,This place is literally a neighborhood for residents. They just kept their houses looking like the old houses. It is advised to keep quite here. There is a bit of walk for you here but literally almost everything looks the same.I recommend you spend 30mins to 1 hour in this place.
"Know what to expect, look for and do as part of a day of attractions","The Hanok Village is neat to see, but if you come just as an attraction itself it might be a bit disappointing. Since it is so close to Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changdeokgung Palace, Jongmyo Shrine and Insadong you should try to visit all of these things as well as the Hanok Village as they are all within walking distance.It was neat to see the buildings and there are shops where you can dress up in traditional dress and take pictures along the way as well.Things to Note:1) Keep your voices down as it is still a neighborhood where people live2) There are wonderful tea houses, I recommend you stop at one for the experience and the view. An example would be Cha Masinuen Tteul, located along Bukchon-ro 5 na gil3) There are several must see views while in the Bukchon Hanok Village. ""Bukchon 8 Views"" is where people can fully enjoy the beauty of hanoks and the alleys in the area. Seoul has nominated eight different views and has set up ""Photo Spots,"" from which you can easily find delight in the surroundings inside of Bukchon in order to develop the area as a Seoul’s most representative cultural tourist attraction. Reserach them before you go so you don't miss one :)I would probably allocate an hour or two at the most to the village if you include the tea stop."
"Expected a bit more, but still worth a visit","Having missed this on my previous visit to Seoul, I decided to make it a point to visit the village on my next visit. It's quite a hit and miss for me.Hits- The architecture in the area is a great study into how the traditional houses, called hanok, were made.- Some of the houses actually allow you experience, learn and immerse themselves in traditional Korean culture.Misses- So much reconstruction has been done to the area, it made me feel like being in a exhibition, rather than being part of history of the city.- Too many Hanbok-dorned tourists, who don't adhere to the rules (keeping your voices down as it is, after all, still a neighbourhood where people actually live), and that creates quite an unpleasant experience.I can only blame myself for not having included it as part of my list when visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace, Changdeokgung Palace, Jongmyo Shrine and Insadong, as they are all within walking distance of one another! if you're going to plan a visit, I'd set aside an hour for this place."
Pretty area,A pretty area to walk around but it might be best to go with a tour as that would be more meaningful.
Explore Jeju Island,"We were welcomed by a very sweet and professional volunteer . She explained about the History of the village with so much fun. Then were brought to a room where she promoted their products. Wow, very expensive! Even the bottle of honey costs more than RM100. "
Loved visiting this village,"We loved visiting this street. The little shops are cute, and it is a great place to get a tea. Would go here again. "
Always fun to roam the alleyways,"On a sunny beautiful day, the views are spectacular. Fun to roam around taking pictures and photos of all the ladies dressed up in Hanbok taking selfies. Cute art galleries and cafes in the surrounding neighborhood between here and the gyeongbongdong palace."
Nice walk to see Korean traditional houses,"Couldn't find the place last year and would have failed too this year although we have the ""Korean version of its location"" to the taxi driver. Luckily came across the Seoul Hanok center where the nice lady there gave us a detailed map of the area including a suggested walking route to see all there was to see. The major areas were a bit busy with everyone wanting to take photos and selfies but the majority of the path was quiet and very peaceful to explore.Came across the ""observatory"" which is actually someone's rooftop home where he charges for access to take photos. This can be skipped though. Also found a nice Korean tea house along the way that serves excellent tea in a tranquil and beautiful Korean traditional house setting."
Worth a Stop,"This beautiful traditional Korean neighborhood is worth a walk through. It won’t take but maybe two hours or so out of your day, but is a quaint little place to see"
Traditional Architecture.,"It is very sad that there are tour guide services. But it is worth to visit if you love traditional Korean style or Traditional Architecture.But please read and prepare the related information before going there. Since there are famous 8 views.If you didn’t read the information, you may miss the view. Please quite during visiting. It is because still a lot of residents living there.It is very sad that there are tour guide services.

good but. .,"A few places where you can see traditional Korean houses in Seoul. Very good place. The residents are still living, but the Chinese tourists are lousy."
Traditional houses & many cafes ,Nice area gives nice scent of traditional Korean-style. Many cafes and nice places to have a cup of tea or snacks.
Nice walk ,"After the visit of the palace we went to the village walking around the shops and houses. It offer variety of cosmetics, hand made shops which offer classes, coffee shops with nice atmosphere. Worth going for sure."
Filled with traditional craftspeople and great old homes,This is a great hilly area to walk around. You get sweeping views over the tiled roof tops and also many traditional craft workshops and stores are to be found here. Take the walk and also the area just south and east of it is worth the stroll as well.
Traditional Korea Neighborhood ,"Its a sight seeing area where you can see traditional Korea housing. Just a short distance, with 10 minutes walk you can see everything in this neighborhood. Don't forget to take lots of pictures. "
Wandering around in Joseon kind alleys,"There are lot of shop offers cheap hanbok rental as u wish to wander around the alleys and take cute picture. Its advisable to not make noise as this alleys now become residential area. Take time to walk around as enjoy the fine architerature arts. And there also convenient store, cafe and galleries around. "
"Houses where rich government officials stay, climbing up the slope is not easy","The view was great and very ancient. Feels like Kyoto. If you have issues with legs, suggest to get a cab up there. The stairs will drain your energy."
Very cosy place you really feel to be in a village and not in Seoul,"You can get lost in the Street of this very cosy place, really feeling to be in a village and not in Seoul"
Tour guide would be helpful,We were lost looking for this place as it is spread out and not very well signed. I would have enjoyed hearing about the place through a guide. Go when you aren't tired. The teriyaki chicken stick and beer saved the afternoon for me!
Downhill walking,"An interesting sreet full of people during the Chuseok. Restaurants, cafes shops, life on the street. This time also beautiful Korean national dresses."
It is a collection of old traditional Korean houses,"This is an area where ordinary people live. Many houses are in traditional Korean form, but not sure whether they are newly built or historical. They are all similar so after a while you feel so so."
Beautiful and traditional,"Loved how everyone were wearing hanbok. Village is full of cute shops, where you can spend all your money on beautiful Korean made clothes. Prices are little bit cheaper than Myeongdong shopping street. From village you can walk to the Palace. "
Fantastic,"Loved this place. Real authentic and lots a photo ops. Many small shops and restaurants, traditional houses. Excellent tea houses here and there. Bukchon was the highlight of my Seoul trip."
One of my favorite places as Seoulite!,"As a girl who lives in Seoul, here is one of my favorite places in the city. When my foreign friends come to visit, I never skip to bring them here. 1. Bukchon Hanok Village is traditional residence areas in a peaceful and calm atmosphere. 2. This area is connected to Samchung-dong main street where you can visit pretty cafes, cosmetics shops, art galleries, and fine restaurants! 3. There are plenty of shops to rent Korean traditional clothes called Hanbok in this area. With wearing Hanbok and walking around the village, you can enjoy the old town 100%."
Place of history,It is good to see how living conditions were many years ago. Our tour guide was able to explain for better understanding to tourist. Many locals in the area due to holiday season. It a nice small village reach in history.
Authentic Korean life - must see,"Bukchon Hanok Village, I was told, is the only Hanok area in Seoul that actually has people living in them as homes today, whereas other Hanok villages are made for tourism show purposes and are not lived in. We didn't get to see inside of an Hanok but just to walk around the area was pleasant enough. There were several quaint cafes and boutiques that made the place feel like a cool hangout area. The area is pretty large. Be prepared to walk a lot to cover them all,"
Love this place!,"Love walking this area because it really feels like you are walking inside a real life Korean drama scene in the olden times. Do wear comfortable shoes though as there is alot of walking to do. You can also rent a hanbok for an hour or two to walk around the area. It's definitely worth a photo shoot. Also, you can visit the high school that was used for filming in Winter Sonata (yes, it's a long time drama, but still worth a visit. We all love Korean dramas don't we? :))."
A walk through culture and history,"I suggest you include this in your itinerary if you are interested to see traditional houses in Seoul. Get a map from the tourist information center. Not sure if seeing students in their hanbok is common but it was truly a nice scene when they are around the area. Wear comfortable shoes and I think it is nicer if it will be done in the morning or during sunset. It has 2 different areas and you can easily get lost in the small alleys and small stairways but never fear because there are a lot of tourist around. You must schedule this on a day where you won't feel pressured walking around. The more you pay attention to the details of the houses the more it will be interesting.Before you go, check what else you can do because I noticed that there are cooking classes or some sort of art classes around there too. Also, if the news shows that there are a lot of people on streets on rally/picketing around the King Sejong statue then avoid this area as no cabs will take you there or pick you up if it is late at night.I also recommend that you stay around this area, its quite a good place to experience traditional houses and it is also close to the tourist hot spots. There was one area with a lot of good food and office workers are actually dine there."
Very interesting,It is an interesting experience walking on the streets of this village surrounded by traditional korean houses. There are even visitors dressed in hanbok. I feel like being transported to joseon dynasty.
Great place to view traditional architecture.,Recent history of Korea has been very tragic and many things have been destroyed by nearby nations throughout history. As such being able to view Bukchon through the eyes that this village allows us a glimpse into something that has been destroyed is enlightening. Going on a day in fall where the weather is nice and it is not busy is awesome. You are able to take many pictures with the scenic spots and there are quite a few cafes and shops to drop by as well. Overall I thoroughly recommend going here and keep in mind the tragic history of this area as well.For more on Bukchon check out my website in my profile.
Really beautiful ,We have spent entire day with our 3 small children walking small beautiful streets of this village. Enjoyed it a lot! Highly recommend.
Feel like local,"Today (5/10/17) our next stop is Bukchon Hanok Village. We came here by subway from our Hotel (Nine Tree Premier) stop at Anguk Station. Take Exit 3 at Anguk Station and just go straight, the village located around 600m from Exit 3. There are few shop provide rental for Hanbok on your right sight heading to Bukchon. You can rent your Hanbok before proceed to village.Few restaurant also available at this area. We have our lunch Korean Restaurant just outside Exit 3.From this Bukchon Hanok Village you can walk to Geongbukyong Palace or just go back to Anguk station & take subway to Geongbukyong Station which is on the next stop.However we did not go to the palace, instead we took subway to Yeouinaru station for Hangang ARA Cruise. "
Interesting Section of Seoul,"OK residential area to walk around in and grab pictures. There will be some small exhibits, cafes, and vendors around. Avoid during humid or hot summer days, there's a serious lack of shade and a ton of uphill areas."
Beautiful street to look around,You can find beautiful traditional house and street in this place. Plus you can find a cozy cafe :tea story which has really good ambience! Great place to take a time for Korean tea
Traditional village ,This is a fun place to see where people lived and continue to live in order to preserve their heritage I really enjoyed this spot though it wasn’t as exciting as I had thought check it out if you have some extra time but don’t be afraid to skip it either. 
Nice glimpse,"Nice glimpse of a traditional korean village. Unfortunately, there are a lot of ongoing construction/restoration during our visit. You can enter some houses and have a feel of korean tradition. Be on the lookout for quaint coffe shops, art studios and activities in the houses that are open.Tip: you can rent a Hanbok/traditional Korean dress and roam around in traditional attire for a ""full"" experience :)"
Historic village ,"Our favorite neighborhood in Seoul. Old meets new in this friendly and inviting neighborhood. Easy to get to by metro. Spend the morning exploring, then go find a great spot for lunch!"
Traditional Korean houses,"A popular tourist spot where we can see a lot of traditional Korean houses. Good for taking photos but some tourists are quite noisy and might disturb the residents there. It will be great if one or two houses can be open to the public.,"
Wonderful place ,Area itself where the village located are great you can just set after the visit and get drink nice clean street and village itself it's magical some few houses converted to cafe shop where you can set and enjoy the atmospheres don't forget to RENT the hanbok wear while you going around and don't miss the walking distance palace 
Nice place in seoul ,"A very iconic old neighborhood in seoul. Lovely small alleys and hanok houses. Lots of young people wearing Korean costumes, and it makes the place more picturesque "
Village,"One of the ancient village in korea which a lot of tourist come ,see ,explore how the old Koreans lived before.This village are open all year round for free admission You can also wear a traditional dress if you want,there's a store before you can enter the village It cost 20$ I think for the rent and free photo ,"
Beautiful place. ,This place has its ancient Korean look which will give all photographers chances to have their best shot. Visitors will have a chance to experience how a korean person live back to half of century. 
Lovely place!,"We had a really lovely walk around this village! I love all the traditional houses so much. We did have a talk with owners of E-oot hanok, they are super nice and friendly! A good option for those who want to experience ""night in a traditional hanok"" when in Seoul - they even offer cooking class by the owner herself! "
Overrated,"Nothing interesting, it just a few houses with korean traditional architecture. Prepare for lotsa walking."
nothing,not really ancient thou. It's good for photos. That's it. You can rent hanbok there but I suggest you should do so at some palace. 
No what I expected!,"I heard so many good comments about this place. Once I got there, I got very dissapointed. Its a little town in the middle of Seoul but nothing to do around. There is a few restaurants and shops but nothing interested. Definitely I wouldn't go back to this place. It was boring!!!"
Great to walk around,It's a quaint set of alleyways where you can get to experience Korean lifestyle and architecture. There are quite a few street performances which is well worth a pause. A lot of shopping too from the general souvenirs to the more niche hat shops. A good place to while away an hour just to experience South Korea.
Historical culture visit.,"A place worth visiting as it consists history of village residential, truly fascinating when walking and climbing the steepness hill along the residential. They're people living in that village, though its name as a village, rather, more on very much developed small town as compared to my hometown. There are a lot of steep climb along the residential area, I was just lucky because I've carry manfrotto along as had it setup steadily to avoid and beat the uneven road surface, gradient and etc. Spotted one of the houses' walls stacked up by raw bricks inside the village, taking advantage to make use of this wall to do our couple shooting. Many tourists doing their own smartphones shooting too, they were laughing why the hassle where smartphone already sufficed for the photography. I don't blame them, indeed smartphones' quality could be very good for photography, just that maybe I am still old school fella who still doing photography in an old fashion way. "
DO NOT RENT HANBOK HERE,"This place is a 15 min walk from Gyeongbokgung palace and another 15 minute walk to Changdeokgung and Cheonggyecheon palace as it is in between the palaces. It is cheaper to rent Hanbok in Gyeongbukgong as they only charge 15-18k KRW for for hours, but in bukchon hanok village it costs 10 KRW per hour so places offer rentals from 30 - 40 k KRW. ALSO DO NOT RENT HANBOK in the rental shop inside the Bukchon-ro 11 na gil street (after Etude house and can be seen as soon as you enter the street left side). THE LADY THERE ALMOST SCAMMED US! first she said that the rental for four hours was 30 KRW, as we didn't have any choice left as we didn't want to walk 15 mins back, we just agreed. And then when we already had the hanboks on they were offering hair clips, bags etc. They just put it on our head and gave it to us. Good thing we resesrched that these things have additional charges so when we asked she said yes we needed to pay extra. So we returned it and said no, we just wanted to pay for the Hanbok rental. So after putting it on and paying for it, she sat us down and pointed at the headband. She said ""already included"" and then braided our hair and gave us bags. We said, no no we just want the hanbok rental. And then she said ""sorry I made a mistake, already included."" Ok then we let her do her thing. And then after braiding our hair she was asking for 41 k KRW! because she said that she made a mistake as 30k KRW was onky for 2.5 hours and not 4, plus the braiding services bag etc. We said no we only wanted the clothes and we were refusing the add -ons since the beginning. We stood our ground and almost got very angry until she said ok. But we should've just removed the Hanbok and embarass ourselves in the store because WE SHOULDN'T have continued to rent that hanbok there! My friend sprained her ankle just minjtes after rentinf the hanbok and we adked if we cpuld just return it since we were going home and we will pay for 1 hour worth of rental fee. SHE DID NOT agree despite the situation being an emergency. Given everything she put us through she wouldn't budge even in this situation. She honestly ruined the experience for me. Bukchon Hanok Village is not worth the effort and hassle we have been put through. I feel really disappointed because the people were very accommodating, kind and agreeable until we reached Bukchon Hanok Village. So no, not worth it at all. Just go to the palaces if you would like to see and take pictures of historical architecture."
"Traditional Korean architecture, natural stair master!",Lovely traditional Korean architecture. You get a view of the city and it's a lovely way to walk off the lunch. A natural stair master! The houses are situated on hills and some parts are quite steep. So be prepared for the climb. Also there are many tourists dressed in traditional Korean outfits so it may be sometimes hard to take a photo without others inside. 
"Not worth it at all, just traditional hanok houses","Located far from subway station, walk 15 minutes go uphill, and nothing than houses.. not my type of tour, "
A fine walk,The area was fine... seemed to be a popular area for white collar lunch break. We just walked around and took in the hustle of resident life. 
"Smell history of Seoul and enjoy walking, fantastic place, don;t miss visiting please.","My friend Dimitri insist that we must visit Bukchon Hanok Village, many thanks for him for that, this is a wonderful and amazing place, it's a must visited place in Seoul, the beauty of this place is that showing Old city of Seoul, the streets are so clean, tourist guide informing you where to go, shops, resturants and coffee shops are there for you with reasonable prices, houses are for rich people (may be second house for them) or big families have houses there, you can see very luxury cars inside the houses, you can meet as well Korean with there heritage and tradition dress, they are so friendly, you need to walk for 30 minutes between the houses, I was there with my friends, Dimitri from Greece, Faten and Rana from Lebanon."
Somewhat Overrated,"Korean travelers seemed to enjoy this the most. It was interesting to see the architecture, but it is a small area and is flooded with people. I feel sorry for the residents!If you only have a couple of days in Seoul, this should not be one of your stops. The tea house where you turn right off the main street is a gem of a find though."
A residential area of traditional hanok houses,"We walked here during our walkabout in the area. It is quite near Changdeokgung Palace. We arrived in the evening before it got dark. Even then, there were lots of tourists. As this was a residential area and people were still living here, there were signs asking people to keep their voices down when visiting. There were several alleys you could wander about. It was quite interesting to look at hanok houses in the city and compare them with the many skyscrapers and modern buildings nearby. We left when it go dark."
Unique experience,Wanted to rent a hanbok to take photos with the beautiful houses but the summer weather doesn't allow :( awesome place for ig worthy photos!
Highly recommend a visit,"It is worth spending a few hours here meandering the small streets, and you get great views of Seoul in some spots. There are a few houses that are open to visitors, and there are interesting small shops running through the main commercial street."
Interesting. Well Kept. Quite crowded.,"This place is known for its traditional housing images of Korea. It is interesting to see and walk around because cars hardly go through there. The downside is all the tourists are also there like tour groups, families, friends, and couples all walking throughout. So that means getting a shot of an entire empty street is not easy especially if you want the best views. It's a quiet area and there are no shopping stores within so its not like modern areas taken over by all the lighting and music."
Pleasant but overrated IMHO,"Strolled around here, and yes the houses are beautiful, the narrow streets are cute and the craftsmen are nice, bit all in all my opinion was that it was overrated. Of course, this is not 'how people used to live in the old days' (fortunately): this is an idealized one-dimensional (and yes, very cute) view of the past, in ultra clean, perfectly restored Hanok houses loaded with gift shops (which says enough... :-))."
Traditional and vintage,"the best moment to visit this place with hanbok experience. you can rent it out for 2 hours or more for around 15,000 won. There are alot rental shop surrounding this area"
Adorable,Such an adorable neighborhood - charming with no commercial chain stores and love the local independent boutique business mixed with neighborhood charm. Actually shopped much more in this neighborhood than others too. 
Checking the place,This place is the traditional village for locals. So many shops and restaurants along the way. It was very hot when we went there but we enjoyed it taking a picture and trying the little shops. Here you can feel how to become locals like the one you see in Korean drama. Just be careful because cars and motorbikes passes here and they drive crazy.
Early walk ,Started an early walk to Bukchon. Don't expect to see anything much as most places are close before 9am. Nevertheless a good walk without the normal crowd when you are early . Some cafes are already open at 9am
Old Korean Houses,Take your time and watch these beautiful houses very carefully.Most of them are really very beautiful.
Old houses not that impressive,It is not strictly a village. more like few Streets off a main road. Probably will need to ask someone to locate it.We visited this on a rainy day. Got down at anguk station took exit 2. The village is supposed to be on the left about 500 meters away. However we could not find it so ask for a Korean couple who pointed across the road. We still could not see it and we were lost. A middle aged Korean lady was walking towards the opposite direction from us heard our conversation with the couple. She accompanied us and showed us the nicest part of the village. For this she had to walk in opposite direction for more than 1 km as well as had to get wet in the drizzle.I suggest if you are going there get a map of the village from one of the information centers around there.
cultural,"bukchon hanok village is the place to take photos and soak in the cultural atmosphere of South Korea. its unlike the hustle and bustle of the city or myeongdong but very quaint and peaceful. be careful not to disturb the residents who are still living there, but do say hi to them if you meet them. an absolute visit for cultural and architectural buffs :) "
Traditional Korean Village,"Feel the place, live like local. after going to Gyeongbokgung Palace, I plan to go to this place, walking around 20 mins then you can taking a deep breath and see the surrounding area, just imagine you live in Bukchon, feel so happy to get here :)"
Wearing Hanbok and Enjoy the ancient atmosphere,One of the must have places when traveling in Seoul. Make sure you have hired Hanbok to take great pictures
Not worth the time,"As a tourist looking for interesting places to visit, this area seems to be just old houses and narrow streets. "
A walk around Hanok village,A nice place to visit & do try the pumpkin toffee if you can from the old man selling it from a bicycle. The toffee is really delicious. You can only get it here!
Nice stroll,"The scenery is nice, and it's definitely quite hilly so be sure to put on some good shoes to prepare for the walk!You can rent Hanboks from many places around (I didn't do it; but it seems to be a touristy thing to do so that you can catch nice photos)"
More fun to explore without a map,"Bukchon is a fun area to walk around in. There's a lot of cute stores and restaurants along the main streets, but it's also fun to explore some of the more residential streets further north/uphill. There are some great views and lots of picturesque traditional homes. I recommend ditching the maps (resistance is futile) and not worry about getting a little lost."
a respite right smack in the middle of a metropolitan,"go early. very very early. things may not be open yet, but you can get your drinks/meals/souvenir somewhere else. it's a lovely place to walk around wherever your feet takes you, take in the atmosphere. by 9.30 the area will be buzzing with loud tourists taking selfies although there are many signs to warn people to be quiet because real people still live in the area. be considerate. it will be great of you can stay at one of the hanok so you can be there before/after the horde. "
Visit in early evening,"I was visiting Seoul on business and wanted to experience some traditional culture- not easy when you are working all day. My colleague and I took a taxi to visit Bukchon village around 6:30 pm. At this time of day it was quiet and calm. We encountered very few other visitors. We could leisurely explore the beautiful homes and quaint walking streets. The air was cool and breezy- so refreshing after a hot day of trains and taxis. The only downside was that most stores were already closed. At this time, you need just 1/2 hour to 45 mins to explore this area which makes it possible to do at the end of the work day. Then you can easily walk 15 mins. to Insedong for dinner. "
Love it!,"If you are interested in seeing a traditional Korean house, so this is the right place to come. Bukchon Hanok Village is the neighborhood area with traditional house. There are also have coffee shop, boutiques and many more shops inside this area. Worth it. I suggest you go to every 8 spots to take a amazing pictures."
Nice village,"It's a quaint little area with streets lined with houses from the olden days. We saw many people in Hanbok and decided to try. Inexpensive, starting from 10,000 Krw an hour plus optional add ons. As the streets were lined with Hanoks (traditional houses), the walk in Hanbok was made even more memorable. "
Fantastic,If you are interested in historical architecture this is the place to go to.A large area of traditional Korean housing and buildings. Most are occupied so there are only a few that you can enter and they are either retail outlets or in one case a small museum. If you can go inside do so as it gives you a much better feel of the layout of these unique buildings.Gave us a great feel of Korea
Disappointing ,"I was quite disappointed with this place ... it's nothing more than just visiting rows of homes built centuries & decades ago. I was expecting the place to offer greater authenticity, culture & history ... but instead there are modern shops, cafes and private homes with 'Silence please' notices on their closed doors (obviously constant flow of tourists is not quite welcome here). I didn't even get chance to see the inside of a home in this so-called village. Be prepared for the uphill (literally... some of the roads are almost like 45 degrees!) and downhill climb ... so you'll need strong leg muscles and good walking shoes ... no heels! And certainly not for the elderly. Personally I'll advise my friends to give this place a miss ... it's really nothing to shout about. "
Traditional Homes and Great Views,"If you're interested in seeing some traditional homes, this is your spot. Lots of tourists line the streets, so getting an early start definitely works to your advantage. Since it's in one of the hilly areas of the city, you can walk up to the top and see all the traditional roofs surrounded by more modern buildings surrounded by mountains. It's quiet and beautiful and harbors lots of cute boutiques, mini museums/galleries, and food spots along the way."
walking along traditional Korean houses while looking over the modern city of Seoul,"Gyeongbok palace & SamCheongDong & Bukchon Han-ok village are close enough to walk around. Looking around Gyeongbok palace, having lunch or dinner in SamCheongDong and then walking along Bukchon han-ok, it is more like a timeslip, experience tradition and modernity at the same time."
A Feast for your Eyes,"A shop owner where we had just bought some Korean tea highly recommended we come check out this area. Not sure why, we began our hike, I mean exactly that, a hike, because of the steep grade the streets are on. It didn't take long for us to see why it was essential we come see this place. Right next to busy, loud, modern downtown Seoul, you can find this magnificent old town where things appear to not have changed much for centuries. What beautiful homes, this is truly an architectural jewel in the middle of Seoul. Ladies, don't wear high heels! Wear comfortable shoes and take a jacket. Even it it's a warm day, it can get very windy and chilly once you reach the top. This is not appropriate for parents pushing strollers! We loved all the narrow alleys, the old homes that still look today as they did hundreds of years ago. It's wonderful to see how the locals take such excellent care of this old neighborhood. Just lovely! Take lots of photos, if the crowds let you. That was the only negative part of the time we spent here. It's so crowded at times, sometimes you have to wait long periods of time to find an alley or a façade with no crowds to take a decent photo. Enjoy your time here. It really is a must see! Pay attention to details in the craftsmanship of the structures, the wood carvings, the designs, everything! Absolutely stunning!"
Dress UP!,Our two kids dressed in traditional korean clothes and walked through this beautiful village. Certainly a highlight of our holiday.
Old city,"This is amazing place to discover while walking along the small streets, it is in the area of Gyeongbokgung Palace and Changdeokgung Palace, if you like to spend a night there you need to stay in guest house."
A must go in Seoul,"If you have 2 or more days in Seoul, you should include this place in your list. There you would find a village of beautiful houses with unique korean style structure. These houses are well kept and maintained. You would also find a number of locations for taking good photos and so be prepared to allow about 3 hours there. As the place is still resided by local residence, visitors are advised to keep quiet when touring around the area. "
Historical charm,"It is well worth a wander through this historical residential neighbourhood containing over 900 traditional Korean houses or hanoks. The narrow streets meander through the relatively confined area and contain many small artist and artisan studios, the odd traditional tea houses and a range of curio shops. There is very little traffic so it is easy to lose yourself in the exploration."
Nice to stroll around away from the busy center,We stayed in a Hanok for 2 nights in the Bukchon village. When you visit Seoul I would really advice to stroll around in the Bukchon village. It's great to leave all the high buildings and the busy live behind and walk between the traditional houses and visit some shops. And when you stay some nights I would also recommend to sleep in a Hanok and experience the traditional live over there including the great Korean breakfast (like we had in the excellent Cheong Yeon Jae Hanok Hotel).
brought old memories,"It took me back -- way way back to my childhood. I was very happy to see that the city tried to save the neighborhood. Maybe because the weather was too hot, i didn't enjoy it as much as i would have. There were some charming tea cafes which would have been good stops if i had more time. "
Peaceful and Beautiful Hanok Village,We walked here with our son who lives in Seoul. We enjoyed a very quiet and peaceful view of traditional Seoul culture. The streets are steep so be careful if you have problems walking.
A piece of the past,Bukchon Hanok Village is a great place to visit to see when\\at Korean looked like in the past. The homes are beautiful and well kept. It's important to be mindful of the fact that people actually live in these homes. Wear comfortable shoes because it mostly narrow walkways that go up and downhill. Expect to see lots of people taking photos is tradition korean outfits. 
"Commercialised, quite boring","It's still a housing estate so you shouldn't be making a lot.of noise there. The houses are quite pretty coz of their roofs. If you wanna see prettier and much more bukchon houses, go to jeonju, outside of seoul , 3 hr bus ride.If you wanna see even older houses, travel back.in time, visit the Korean folk village at suwon. traditional Performances included. About 2.5 hrs away from seoul by metro. However, it's just a remake of a village not an actual one"
Outstanding architecture and the traditional beauty,"I had chance to stay the night at Bukchon Hanok village and was a bit worried about how to find the place. However, I used the Airvan Service which brings me to the destination from ICN and that just shorten my travel time. The neighborhood is really cute and beautiful with traditional architectures, Hanoks. As it is known for it's traditional houses, there were so many people walking around even in Hanbok. I loved how the traditional and modern buildings coexist together in this busy city. The Hanoks made me calm and everything looked so peaceful."
Wear good shoes!!,"Hilly walk with sweeping views and small workshop places where you could take a class or just watch others crafting away. Cool to see so many dressed up in hanbok (traditional clothing). Find the library and take a break there, too. "
Must visit,"There are not many culturally unique place in Seoul to visit, beside the palace, this hilly Korean tradition houses are unique and great to roam around in Korean traditional costumes (recommend to rent one, the price is reasonable). It's not very close to the station,need to walk for a while, do take exit 2, if you come by metro Angu station. Recommend to stop by tourist office to get a map."
Beautiful traditional houses,This village provided a wonderful insight of traditional Korean life. They were very clean and the local people were friendly. It was really nice to see beautiful traditional clothes being worn.
Step back in time ,While the houses here are the historic ones they are actually real houses that people live in so be wary not to make too much noise. Worth a visit if you are visiting the nearby palaces (can walk by foot). Check out the information centre to hear about the free house museum that's worth going to. 
A quaint old town with traditional korean homes,Good place for a 3hr tour. Most residents are already used to the invading eyes of tourists peeking into their homes. Uphill/downhill narrow streets . Outside of the hanok village are many good restaurants including touristy ones. A great place is the steak house just at the road junction at the entrance to the billage. You can't miss it.
bukchon hanok village,one of the old quarters of seoul where the traditional houses have been renovated. it gives a good view on the living conditions of wealthy Korean families in oldersn times.
back in time,"There is no bad time to come here. Day, evening, fall, spring, it has little treats around every corner and everyone seems to enjoy being there or discovering it."
Avoid in the hottest month,Nice place to explore but August is the hottest month so this not an ideal attraction. Will be better for other months and Seasons.
Back into old Seoul,"This is a must see if you want to see the traditional Korean house. Beautiful area where you can enjoy shopping, unique shops and food. A nice way to spend half a day enjoying the views and food."
Back in Time,"Bukchon Hanok Village take you back in time to olden Korean houses and structure. Very picturesque and quaint to walk along the area to see the houses, street lamps and roofs. What is incredible is that people actually live here. Make an effort to visit as you will not be disappointed."
Pretty place for photo-taking,"It's quite a hike to get to Bukchon Hanok Village but the view is worth it! Look out for the guides in red shirts to guide you to the village.The traditional houses are stunning and the neighbourhood is peaceful. If you have some time, pop by into some of the stores there.Good to grab a banana milk and some snacks while on the way:)"
Beautiful traditional area,I love this area very much. It is very traditional. Just walk around and you can imagine yourself dressing in Hanbok! This area is also a walkable distance to Samchongdong which is full of shops and cafes. It is also very nice to walk in fall. 
South Korea's Best Kept Secret,"Seoul's largest concentration of Hanok, traditional Korean homes that dates back to the Josean Dynasty. It's a busy tourist area, but it's still a pleasure to get lost in the streets here admiring the patterned walls and tiles roofs contrasting with the modern city in the distance. Many operate as cultural centers, guesthouses, restaurants and tea houses providing visitors an opportunity to experience, learn and immerse in traditional Korean culture. Anguk Station Subway Line 3 Exit 1/2. "
Bad experience in on of restaurant ,"Just ordinary view. I suggest you to find a restaurant with a fixed price that show in front of it, or you should pay the expensive price like we did."
Must do,We stumbled upon this street while walking around the palace - it's a must-do. It's super cute and just wander around the streets and stop for a bite or a fun drink. 
Nice to walk through but admittedly quite boring,"This area is often described as a 'living-museum' but that oversells it. The walls in the area are plastered with posters advising where you cannot take pictures and constantly telling you to stay quiet. I understand this is due to the fact that people live and work here but then there are stalls exploiting the tourists who are playing music out loud to attract people. A strange place which, though not exceptionally busy, still a tourist spot through and through. Not that much to do or experience."
Nice Korean traditional village,"We walked throughout the village. There are many shops selling different items, from clothes, shoes, art items, etc... loads of restaurants and cafes too. Different from city shopping. "
"A bit of ""old"" Seoul still in place.","I like this old style village in Seoul. It is nice to have a look there, get a drink in one of the cafés and take some photographs."
Traditional and Modern Korean architecture side by side,"Here one can see the traditional and modern korean structures side by side, Narrow allies, well maintained traditional building structures.it's an amazing view."
A pearl in the middle of the city,Beautiful old and small houses. Just take a slow stroll between the houses. Many tourists though. Since there are locals living there you have to be quiet to show respect for them. Unfortunately some people dont seem to understand that.
Korean village,I love this place. I visited Bukchon Hanok Village right after GyeongBokGong in my rented hanbok. I felt a different vibe walking around in my hanbok. Should give it a try ( you wont be the only person walking in a hanbok).
Traditional korean houses,"We originally planned to visit this village around 2pm after our gyeongbokgong palace visit and ginseng chicken lunch.However, the scotching hot sun is really unbearable for us and we decided to visit here around 5pm. Houses are beautiful and built on inclined pavement. There are lots of signs to remind visitors to lower their volume. Quite a unique experience despite the hot sun."
A piece of Korean village in Seoul,We had a nice and peaceful walk through the streets of Bukchon. There are some nice views of the city from the hill.
Very interesting ancient neighbourhood,"You can take the subway line 3 (orange) and get out from Anguk station at exit 2 or 6. Go north towards Buchon-ro. There at interesting quaint shops along the way, and some Sundubu restaurants the local visits. Walk about 100 M or so to the intersection and Bukchon village is a little further up to the north. Turn right 100M to Changdeokgung Palace or turn left a 120 M to Gyeongbokgung Palace. You will find plenty of Hanbok rental stores and I recommend 3355 Hanbok rental for their cleanliness and service. Do be very quiet in consideration of residents still living in the ancient houses. The structures, doors, roofs, walls are very interesting and make good photo back drops. It is not necessary to go where all the bus loads of tourists are led to. There are some more further up and opposite the road. "
Nice,Nice to see but still missing to renovate some of the houses there and it will be perfect. Nice places to see and drink and eat. Very charming anyway. Nice pictures to do but recommend it on the night mainly. Thanks 
Beautiful Korean Traditional Homes,"Loved my visit to the Bukchon Hanok Village! This is the only place in Seoul which still has traditional korean hanoks around. It's amazing to see traditional houses right in the middle of the otherwise cosmopolitan city, almost like taking a time machine back to Joseon era!"
Traditional Korean houses,"If you never been to a traditional Korean ""village"" this is a place for you! The village is not far, and when you walk in you feel this is very different from the city - you can see the old architecture, building, culture. If you love those old style building, don't miss this place."
Better visited when the Bukchon Visitor Info Center is open,"Strolling through the neighborhood on a Sunday, when lots of Koreans are in traditional dress, is fun. But having informaiton about what to see, provided by the Visitor Center, would make the visit even better. So don't plan to go on Sunday!"
Good for a meander,Good for a quick visit and to see genuine hanok houses that people still live in. Close to palaces so can wander through the village on the way to or from them.
Didn't find the exact place,We use Google maps to find this place.We walk along the road of some of Hanok village but some of it has been modernise.Definitely will go again to find the right place.
Beautiful area,The tourist infomation centres can provide maps to the more photogenic parts of the village. We also noticed map stands placed at various locations within the village.The tourists were out in force on the most photogenic street. Nearly every door and every wall had a sign reminding people to be quiet as these beautiful old homes are lived in by normal people. I don't think the signs were working.It was quite obvious that the hanbok rental places were doing very well in this area as we were vastly outnumbered by the hanbok wearers.Be prepared for some hill climbing.
Nice for a little walk,This area is a great contrast to the modern city. Lovely old characteristic houses. Good for a nice walk around.
Travel in time!,"A place where you can find Korean traditional houses. Felt I was transported to a different time. Considering how ultramodern Seoul can be,really nice to find a place like this! A must visit for tourist. An Iconic village! Wearing our rented hanboks, me and my daughter enjoyed roaming around this beautiful village. We felt like a local!"
Nice Hanok Village Right In Seoul,"If you don't get the chance to get outside of Seoul during your trip and want to see a Hanok village, this is a good option. Our Korean friend was super excited that we were finally visiting Korea and wanted to show us around, Bukchon was one of the places he brought us one afternoon. It's a very pretty, quiet place to walk around for a couple hours, and there are some nice little shops there, especially if you are interested in Hanbok clothing or crafts. If you have the opportunity to see other Hanok villages on your visit to Korea, you probably don't ""need"" to visit this one, but if you have an interest in them, this is a very nice place to walk around and take some photos."
Traditional buildings,"Probably worth visiting once but not as good as the traditional streets in Kyoto, Japan. Many resturants. "
Okay,It's ok. A bit overrated I think. Wear the tradition clothing will make the experience a lot nicer! It's a bit hard to find if no maps or wifi... but sure u can experience the local atmosphere herex 
One of the quietest places in Seoul,"We stayed in a Hanok in this ""traditional"" neighborhood. It is also a bit touristy but in a relaxed way. It is a sort of open air museum. A lot of houses are restaurants, shops or hotels now but it is one of the best places to relax and escape the frenetic pace of the city."
Beautiful little village,Need to climb small hidden stairs. Beautiful quite little traditional village. Must try their tea houses. 
Our walking tour in Bukchon Hanok Village,We went to this village on 29 June. It was awesome. Lots of cosmatic shops. We also had a local lunch at a Hanok Resturaunt. the food was delicious. Within Seoul it gives a flavour of village life. lot of school children were running here and there.Full of vibrant life!!
Nice place to visit,"Bukchon Hanok Village is a Korean traditional village in Seoul with a long history located between Gyeongbok Palace, Changdeok Palace and Jongmyo Royal Shrine. Just go to Anguk Station and. Just drop at Anguk Station exit 2 and walk straight. However, if you like you can visit first Gyeongbok Palace and after walk to Bukchon, at Bukchon you can also find the best Korean Ginseng Chicken Soup going to Insadong area. There are so many traditional Korean houses here and if you are a Kdrama fanatic, you can see the house of Lee minho in Personal Taste drama , House #3. Enjoy your visit at Bukchon hanok village."
"Americans visiting Seoul, and staying in a hanok","We are from California and are in a hanok right now! It's so beautiful inside. If you get a chance to rent one, do it! We have had lots of people knock on our door, asking to look inside. I don't mind though."
Overrated but good,I found this overrated but good nonetheless as it gives you a glimpse of actual Korean residence without the trappings of highrise living. When visiting this place be mindful though that it still a residential area so keep your voices down. Just take good photos. 
An over-valued scenic spot in Seoul!!,"Be smart to avoid becoming one of the non-sensible tourists who just follow what most others did....unless you are a westerner who has never visited the east and seen nothing about Chinese/Asian-styled temples or architecture online.There you could only see the walls mainly, and some roof, that was all. Not a big area, just two to three small streets. It was rather ridiculous (for me at least) that so many tourists went there and caused disturbances to the living residence, thus there were many notices reminding tourists to keep quiet now. While there was not much to see or not easy to get any surprise, one worthwhile thing you can do is perhaps renting a set of ""Hanbok"" (Korean traditional clothing) at a cheap price of W10,000 and then take photos. But better do this in the early morning, or more and more tourists will be there."
nothing much,"tough way to walk uphill in the hot summer weather.most of the houses are closed, cannot view the interior.only can take photos from outside. after a while, all of them look the same."
lovely traditional houses,"To find this easily, go to the number 8 must visit spots in Bukchon which is available in all maps. The place is hilly but worth it. There are many tourist here but you can still capture the hanoks. If you are into kdrama (personal taste) this is not where the filming was shot. It is on the other street."
Korean traditional houses,"This community is on the slope of a foothill. We followed the google map and got off the bus at wrong stop and walk back to the village. The sign was hard to understand the best way to visit the village. Confused us a lot! The authority should improve the sign to make it easier to understand and please...in English! Almost everything here cost you money, take a look at the signs carefully..."
"Beautiful part of the city, a pleasure to walk through","I loved strolling through the narrow and quiet streets of this village. Traditional Korean houses, beautiful gates, a lot of green! Here and there you'd stumble across small artsy shops selling anything from souvenirs to leather shoes and ceramic works of art. You feel quite removed from the city in this area and you feel compelled to check out every single store that you encounter as they are all so different and creative. There are also small old style restaurants and modern cafes so one could lose a couple of hours walking around.This part of Seoul was my absolute favourite."
"Amazing historical place, beautiful and quite","I went there after lunch and had a pleasant walking for the whole afternoon. There is a lot to see. Better get the village map in advance, becuase the village have two parts that are separated by a main road, and one side is much larger. Don't miss any part of it !"
Traditional Korea,"First of all - it's residential area, so don't talk loud and behave nicely :)Second of all - try going there in the early morning if you want to avoid crowds and take pictures of empty streets. Otherwise wait and queue.Third - if you come early, be prepared that most of cafes and shops open there around 10 to 11 am.Overall definitely worth a visit if you want to see traditional culture and buildings."
Very cute area,Beautiful traditional houses and quaint little streets with nice views. Shops and restaurants too. Had great Korean BBQ lunch!!
Please observe good manners!,"If you want to see traditional Korean houses in Seoul, the best place may be Bukchon Hanok Village. But, someone live here. You need to watch your manners in public places. "
Old Seoul city,"Most of the houses in this village had been renovated but they maintain the outside facade, so it is very interesting to walk around the narrow alleys in this village. Each house has different main gate design."
A walk through time ,This would a must visit destination for those Korean drama lovers. To avoid crowds go in the morning as the tour groups tend to arrive by 11am. Please avoid making too much noises as these houses are still resided by residents. The top of the hill has a great view of the city. Also enjoyed traditional Woojeon tea at a traditional tea house. A street vendor also sold amazing fresh fried dumplings between Anguk station and Bukchon Hanok Village. 
Such a nice neighbourhood in Seoul centre,So nice to walk in this neighbourhood with those old traditional houses. Many people do hire the traditional korean outfit to visit this area. A pleasure for the eyes to see those coloured Hanbok in the streets.
Quaint and beautiful,"These are essentially people's homes. Such beautiful traditional buildings and quaint narrow streets...but imagine having your neighborhood so overrun by noisy tourists that you need to stick up ""Silence Please"" signs on your doors. Sad...."
Combine this visit with Gyeungbokgoong Palace and rent a hanbok for A$20,"Tip #1: Download maps.me app as you will need this to walk around BukchonTip #2: Download Seoul subway and bus app so you can see which transportation can get you thereTip #3: I took taxi from Seoul City Hall for 10 000Won (A$11)Tip #4: The little streets have no semblance of logic. Road 1 is cut off and suddenly appears somewhere else. Maps.me could help but you just have to mosey around a bitTip #5: Great cafes and places to sit and watch the world go by hereIf you go to Hanbok-Nam, for A$20 you can rent a hanbok and walk to the palace and take some cheesy fotos. This is good fun. Or wear it and have some selfies taken in this quaint ballina which hides cafes, restaurants. Its is about 10 min walk to the palace. Go early so you don't get the smattering of tourists, say 11?"
"Heritage, Cultural and more","Love the little allies here surrounded by Hanok - traditional Korean houses, one can find a few DIY jewellery shops as well as little cafes and Korean eateries. Try to be there around noon time as most shops open after 11. If your schedule allows, book for a Hanok Stay, well worth it!"
Traditional small village,Very cute place with many old traditional small houses and narrow streets. Has many cute small cafes and souvenirs shops. And have many hanbok rentals
Pretty village nice coffee,Went here after a visit to Namsan tower. A lot of hype from people about taking selfies in a hanbok. The site offers a glimpse of the past with a lot of alleways to get lost in. Enjoyed the walk then found some pretty good shops with a some good deals. There are a few boutique places to visit but the coffee shop with its cold brew equipment was great. Try their homemade cookies for snack whike walking around. Then going further down a few good souvenir shops. When tired there are a lot of taxis to hail and taxus in korea is cheap although they can be a bit of a maniac.
good walk through,We walked through here with a tour guide so it wasn't so confusing which might have made the trip nicer than it could've have been if we were on our own but we had a great time in the Hanok Village. The homes were beautiful and we got many beautiful photos. We even made a stop where we went inside one of the homes that was on exhibit to show tourists the size of the inside of the houses l (which are tiny by the way-I don't know how people live like that). It was a very lovely walk through and lasted about an hour. However it was a bit of a walk to get to the village so if you are not up to a 20 minute walk or so with an incline I would not recommend the Village to you. 
Nice area to take a walk and pictures. ,Bukchon has really old traditional houses that people live in actually. On the hill you can see Seoul N tower. A bit hilly but nice to take a walk 
Lovely visit,A lovely place to visit in the city. Nice area and walking routes through a residential area featuring the old style of houses. Great photo opportunities and views across the city. The quaint shops lining the streets toward the station were interesting and nice to pop in. Nice away from the real hustle and bustle of the city.The only reason I give it 4 stars is because I currently live in Jeonju and we have the infamous hanok village. 
Interesting,"We walked through the village after having visited the palace - a 10-15 minute walk.The village was very interesting although we weren't fortunate enough to get into one of the houses.Lots of souvenir and finger food opportunity as you stroll the streets.Some great views at the top of the hill, the village houses with the city views in the background.Worth a visit."
A Must!,"Such an adorable little village and a must to visit during your trip to Korea. If you can, book an Air BnB and stay in a hanok for an amazing experience."
Nice and peacefull place,"This was very nice rest for me in this place. A lot of interesting architecture buildings, beautifull park with a lot of flowers and green leaves. Nice introduction of Korean history for me and nice rest in this rush city. I recomand this place for visit and spent nice time."
Cultural houses with modern shops ,"The best thing about it was the traditional Korean houses which the people actually lived in. Very instagram-able and photogenic place. The modern shops were nice to know, but not so much different with others in the city. "
A few old houses on the hill - reminder of days gone by,"Small ""village"" which is basically a few old houses (representative of traditional Korean houses) on the hill overlooking the city that has not yet been demolised to make way for tall towers. If you really don't have much time in Seoul, can skip this. "
Cute area to walk around,"Seoul is obviously a very metropolitan city, so it was nice to walk around an area with very traditional Korean houses for a little bit. We should have looked up beforehand because we ended up joining the ""trail"" halfway through. But you get the gist of it pretty quickly. The village is now dotted with cafes and artisan shops that are worth stopping by if you're in the market for some souvenirs. If you want a nice break with a view, go to the cafes at the top of the hill."
Interesting place! ,"This place is near by Palace (around 20' walking). The area is totally different from the Myongdong. You can discover the houses in traditional styles stand beside the ones in modern but the general is so harmonies. At the end of the Main Street, you can see an university which is built with the style of Europe. "
Tourist spot,"Bukchon hanok village very near to Gyeongbokgung palace.From main gate of Gyeongbokgung palace we just follow the street and then turn left after that just go straight untill you find the street name at right side.( you need to cross the street).Btw,its better you if you get a map from tourist information office.so many people wearing hanbok around this place.Great experience.In small street got many mini shops which sell cloth and light food."
Modern clean and lacking character ,It was awkward wandering living neighbourhood which was clean and well kept. The building design are interesting to look at. There are none to go in and I spotted to drink stops on the outskirts.Worth a look if you have time but Seoul has so much more to offer.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful 
Beautiful traditional houses,"Road abit steep at some point, would required to walk up slope.Do wear comfortable shoes.Beautiful place for photo taking."
Remember you are in peoples backyards!,"A nice enough place but nothing too impressive about this area. You see some nice architecture and some nice houses a lot of which have been modernized but have been kept in the same Hanok style. This is an original area. Just remember before you go mooching around that these are peoples homes and some have very big dogs so beware! About 20 min leisurely walk from the metro, shops and restaurants along the way. If you want to hire traditional Hanbok dress for male and female there are plenty of shops around the area to help you walk around like you were back in the day. You will see lots of people walking around in the traditional dress with the vibrant colours."
Touristy but still worth a visit,"My family took subway (Dark Blue line1) from Seoul station for 3 stops to Jongno 3(sam)-ga and transfer to Orange line 3 for 1 stop to Anguk station. Exit 3 and walk towards Constitution Court of Korea, and carry on walking for another 5 mins up slope and you should be able to see the entrance to the conservatory Bukchon Village. For those who has plans to try out their traditional hanbok costumes, one can try renting them in Anguk station or shops around the station. One advise is to go early so one would have the widest choices of prettiest and best hanbok available to choose from. Cost wise is normally 10,000won for 2 hrs, 20,000 for 4hrs. "
A village frozen in time...,"It's amazing that this traditional Korean village even existed in the middle of the modern metropolitan city of Seoul. Start at the Bukchon tourist information centre, get hold of a walking map and follow the recommended walking paths, which will lead you through numerous residential alleys - uphill, downhill and through stone stairways. You will be feted with picturesque views all round, from prettily preserved traditional houses to scenic views of the surrounding hills and palace rooftops. Oh, since this is an actual residential area, be respectful to the residents living there."
Very pretty,"We didn't find it at first, but when we did the picturesque village was worth a look. Be awarw that there are quite a lot of tourists (like yourself) that are in the way of that perfect picture. "
Korea traditional villages ,Very unique place. This is the traditional place to take picture. You can find many place to rent a traditional hanbok
Beautiful Village,"Enjoyed the walk up the hill and taking photos of the beautiful houses along the way. When you get to the top of the hill, you can see a great view of the city all the way across the N Tower. Great place to just take a walk and enjoy the neighborhood."
Picturesque historic neighborhood,"We enjoyed taking the walking tour through Bukchon. The walk goes up into the hills a bit and can be steep in some places (kind of uncomfortable in hot weather!) but you will wander along some beautiful and photogenic streets and see gorgeous hanoks. The lower level areas are more commercial with restaurants, coffee houses, ice cream places and nice shops."
explore Korean culture in the center of the city,"Warning: Bad English! Bukchon is the perfect area to explore real Korean culture in the city center. Though this area is very touristy but still a quick way to observe the real Korean while enjoying shopping and eating.Go to the tourist information center and grab a map to guide your way through. Without the map it is pretty easy to get lost as all houses seem to look the same! There are 8 photo spots where you can get the best photos of Bukchon, especially number 5 and 6 on Gahoe-dong alley are the most popular spots (and of course most crowded). Actually number 5 and 6 are the same spot but one is from the upward view and the others is downward. Bukchon is surrounded by souvenir shops, cloth shops, restaurants, tea houses and hanbok (traditional Korean dress) rental shops. In every minute I saw women in hanbok walking around and take selfies, that's cute. Be quiet and respect the locals since this is a residential area. There are signs telling you not to disturb the locals. Just a few hundred meters north of Bukchon, it's Samcheongdong-gil road where there are heaps of nice restaurants. And if you walk further, you can find Gyeongbokgung palace, Changdeokgung palace and Jongmyo shrine. So come in the early morning to complete this walking route. It's an easy and joyful whole day trip. I visited Bukchon in mid April and I saw some cherry blossoms. I think if you wish to see them in full bloom, you need to come in early April."
Climb and walk and climb and walk,"Road very steep at some point, gorgeous architecture. Lots of tourist, beautiful scenery at the higher point. A must visit when in Korea. "
Traditional village!,It's an old traditional Korean village. Some/most parts are private. It's a long stretch and will take an hour walk to finish. A lot of stores you can see along the way too. Wear comfy shoes and clothes! 
Stepping into a quieter time,"This area of traditional hanok houses - and new ones being built - is full of arty crafty workshops and tourists dressed in hanbok having their photos taken. It's a pleasure to wander round the lanes imagining a less frantic way of life, if you manage to go at a quieter time. You can get a map at the visitor centre showing where a lot of the workshops are. We visited a gold leaf workshop where a lovely man took great pleasure in explaining his work and showing examples to us with no expectation of selling anything. There are also quite a few residential buildings with notices outside telling you to be quiet - not much chance of that!"
A Trip to Old Seoul,"Picturesque, charming, hilly, rustic, stone and earth dwellings. A look backward to the traditional homes of the elite. Also, museums, galleries, cafes, traditional Hanok houses. If you make it to the top, I have been told, the view is spectacular. My bum knee kept me from making it that far. Sigh."
Must See Korean Traditional Houses!,"Hanok is a term used to describe Korean traditional houses. Beautiful place to stroll around. Authentic Korean houses with a lot of nice souvenir shops, coffee shops and also restaurants. You can rent hanbok here and you can also enter some of the houses for free."
Good place to be if you have some time,"I got time to visit this place. It is a culture hub and intend to share it with those that visit the place. While all the houses are privately owned, some owners opens the place and share the unique Korean culture, art and crafts. There are also several homestays for tourist that wanted more in-depth look at Korean culture."
Free walking tour of Bukchon village,I went on a free walking trip to Bukchon village on June 18 . It was luckily a small group of 6 and we had 2 guides Ms Jua and Ms Diam. The tour started on time at second exit of Anguk Station and lasted about 2 hours. It was informative and interesting and very enjoyable if it was on very sunny hot Seoul day. 
"Must see, but does not require much time","Really cool, small, historic houses in the middle of modern Seoul. Definitely worth stopping by for some great pics."
Better to visit in cold weather,"I'm a big fan of Korean dramas, so this place is gold for me. My friends and I found joy in just walking around in very cold weather (less than 10 degree Celsius), we stopped for photos every 5 minutes because every corner of this village look great in photos."
Neat place to see,Neat little village to see and experience. Very nice and clean place. Quietly located on the East coast of South Korea. 
History!,This area is beautiful. Seoul is one of the most interesting cities because of its ability to mix new and old architecture. The village is very fun to have a walk in.
Old school Korea,"We had a fairly difficult time finding the actual village proper, because after getting off at the right subway, you need to walk a long, long way to see any tourists. We definitely had different expectations upon arriving. What we assumed was a museum-like town turned out to be an actual residential district! People actually live in this part of town, and what makes it a ""hanok"" village is that all of their homes resemble the old ""hanok"" of Korea's past dynasties. Unless you get a walking tour with a group, you won't have any commentary at all. But if you go here yourself, you can find a hanbok rental store and wear their traditional costume around the village for 1-2 hours! I think it's a great deal and is worth the Won because the experience of wearing their costume freely around an old-school style village is priceless. It's like you're living the life of a traditional Korean princess! Besides that, there isn't much to see or do. "
Bukchon Hanok Village,"This lovely, traditional district is sandwiched between the two main palaces in north Seoul and so makes an excellent place for any visitor to stay. The district is full of good restaurants, interesting workshops, some specialising in silver and ceramics. The old Hanoks.are central to the charm with lots of interesting architectural detail. It is a quiet area and delightful for an evening wander and a delicious meal of Jeju black pork. "
"Interesting enough to see, but not much else.","This is a neighborhood with traditional Korean houses, many of which have been converted to shops and museums when the residents were bothered by the tourists. Strict laws require that the traditional architecture be maintained. Due to the destruction of the Korean war, this area provides an uncommon view into the old style homes of Koreans, and is therefore worth the visit. In our case we included it in a private tour we arranged with Sweetrips, an excellent tour company which is the subject of another review."
pleasant walk,"nice walk around traditional homes - you need to keep quiet because it is a residential area. for an added flavour, rent some traditional clothes to wear on your walk. great photo opportunity if there weren't so many tourists."
Elusive,"We walked the main street as per the map, & although not sure what we were looking for, we didn't find it!! With some help in translating, we asked some police officers, they couldn't tell us where the village was either!It's an older area, & well maintained, although we didn't find anything ""traditional""."
Traditional Korean culture,"You are surrounded by houses built in the traditional Korean style. There are places where you can rent Hanbok, traditional dress, and it's lovely to see people walking around wearing them, taking photos! We found a nice tea house where you can enjoy some authentic Korean tea and snacks!! A place you must visit!!"
"Walk among Hanoks, look around galleries","One of my American friend wanted to visit Bukchon, so we took a trip here on sunny sunday. It was a good choice. If you visit Bukchon, walk along ""북촌팔경(8 views of Bukchon) and see the city's skyline from the top of hill. There are signs pointing it everywhere, so it's easy to find the way. Also, there are plenty of free galleries around this village. Their sizes are humble but pieces in them are quite good and modern. Most of the exhibitions are held in Hanok houses, so you can actually get into the houses to see them. For rooftop view, there's a good spot at Old Bath House building. Now it is changed into eyeglasses shop(""Gentle Monster"") and its rooftop on 3rd floor is opened to public."
Old Korea,"Near by historical museums can be found, lots of shopping, food and you can see also tourist wearing Hanbok; old architecture of their houses can be seen here."
Must See In Seoul,"A great area to visit. Wonderful traditional Korean homes with very interesting architecture. A nice walk from the city if you leave somewhere around City Hall, Soedemum or Myeongdong areas. A nice choice of restaurants and specialty stores in the Bukchon area."
Quaint village next to large palace,This village makes for an easy duo with the large palace beside it. But please be quiet and courteous to the residents!
Traditional old street,"Nice area for a walk. Hanging around the traditional style house and street is making it really nice.Enjoy the architecture style, the wall, the door. Every step is a bit different.Just get yourself lost in there and don't follow the crowd.There is as well an observatory which is just a 5th floor flat that gives a view over some roof top. "
So many tourists,"Bukchon is a small village which full of ancient architectures. It's not only a tourist spot, local people are truly live inside! So we have to keep our voice down when walking through the village. It was nice visit here. "
Nice to see,"It took a while for me to find this place, because it isn't easy to find. We ended up following a tour group to find it. We walked from the palace to this place, probably 15 minutes walk, but we got lost several times, so it actually took 1 hr. The surrounding area between the palace and this village is very hip, so lots of shopping and eating. The village itself is small, aside from photo-op, not really much to do."
Only a few parts are traditionally a Hanok village,"if you don't have the time , then this place is worth a short visit of about 2 hours . The place is big and you might not see the real Bukchon Hanok village. here is a tip -Get a map from the tourist office at Insadong . They are really helpful and will point out which streets to go to. only a few streets are worth seeing. The rest are just too modern. but if you really have time and want to see a real Hanok village then take a day trip to Yongin , ( south of Seoul) or go to Andong Folk village. They are really two Hanok of differing eras. Yongin is reflective of earlier Joseon whilst Andong Folk village is more a later Joseon. Whilst Bukchon is more like a 20th century version of a Hanok village. Korean drams use Yongin and Andong as film locations for Saguek dramas.Here is a tip, go to the visitkorea website and join a free walking tour with a guide you will learn so much more of the Bukchon area. Lin Lin"
Awesome!,This village preserves traditional houses and buildings. The design is amazingly beautiful. Wanna come back again someday!
Classic Korean village,Super nice and pretty village. There are still people living here so tourists are told to be quiet at all time. It is better to follow the suggested path to walk so you won't get lost. Worth visiting!
Narrow Streets and Traditional Houses,We took the walk ourselves and in the evening. It was lovely to see the narrow streets and traditional houses with traditional roofs. There were many cultural experience places but were closed because we went in the evening. It's a walk up hill and at one spot we could see all the way to Namsan Tower.
beautiful,"walk around this neighborhood is so great.surrounded by mountain and the house in this neighborhood actually very traditional.and yes people do live here, its not just an attraction of empty traditional house.just take ur time and get lost in this area.wonderful"
A blend of modernity and tradition,"Beautiful neighborhood in the northern part of the city.Surrounded by beautiful mountains, it is peaceful and traditional, but you can still find shoppibg and nice cafe"
Great visit,"Great visit to Bukchon Hanok Village. There two places you can go around. from the National museum, you can cross the road and go straight along the streets. you can wander around the but you need to careful because there are people living there. There are signage that tells you to ""shhhhhhhh"". You can take a pictures here and there and also you can see the view of Seoul from here too.Aside from the architecture, nothing much you can do here. To go there : you need a courage to climb up the stairs. Prepare some water along your way."
Scenic view walk of the old versus new,Take your time to admire the architecture and some home allow you to walk into it to see it. Wear comfortable shoes as it really take time to admire us sering the city skyline. There are foodies and souvenirs. Do not discard waste after eating & drinking it plus no loud voice so as not to disrupt the home owners. Enjoy it with patience. 
Old style neighbourhood still lived in today,"This area of the old style houses is very interesting.It's still lived in so there are the ""Shhhhhh...."" signs which is a nice touch.The small streets & architecture of the old style Hanok Houses is very interesting.Recommended viewing if in Seoul. "
Not Exciting,"I visited other traditional villages in South Korea that were much more interesting. I believe a couple craft shops were open, but aside from architecture, there really wasn't much that interested me."
Bukchon hanok village,One of best... area we visited. We love to go back and stay more time. Great place to see the old house... Great place to take photos. 
Old Seoul,Another place you have to experience -its a total contrast to the modern skyscraper Seoul and thankfully it have not been bulldozed down....
A very interesting place,We visited this village in the morning. It is nestled behind commercial shops and restaurants so we had a hard time looking for it. We saw ancient and traditional houses which were given to the nobility during the past. Hanbok rental are available for authentic feel during those times. I got to wear one. Amazing! 
Traditional housing area,Is good for picture taking. Otherwise nothing special at there.Nearby Gyeongbukgong palace. Beside that there is few souvenir shop around. 
Nice area,"Visit if you like architecture and also buying/looking at handicraft items. A lot of the traditional houses (with proper signage) are actually open for visits (free) and you can pick up a map from these locations that have a route planned out for you. At the end of the route, you will end up along Yulgok-ro 3 gil which is a very trendy and lively street with shops and nice modern/traditional blended houses. This street is connected to Insadong"
Beautiful ,Another great spot in Seoul. Im jealous of the people who get to live here. The architecture is beautiful and there are an infinite amount of spots to take great pictures. There are also plenty of stops to eat and have a beer. Definitely worth a few hours of your time. 
Just some houses ,"Title says it all, this is just a collection of 'traditional' houses. Nothing really special as the houses have a very modern feel about them. Lots of toerists in traditional Korean dress which about sums up the authenticity of this place. Skip."
A urban village with ancient walls,This place is very good is you would like to see how the houses look like in the ancient times. It has the unique looks of the past and closet to Gyeongbokgung Palace. You may want to plan your itinerary to visit this two places together if you are keen on both attractions.
I walked along the past,A place where you can see the distinction of old to modern houses. They preserved the legacy of the past. Enjoy walking and you can feel the tranquility of the village especially If most of the visitors know how to show respect by not too noisy. Most of the houses are privately owned and they need privacy. Visitors should take that into consideration. We should be thankful because they open their village and they allow peoiple to step along their historical place.
Nice to see but no must see,"Currently there are some constructions going on and the whole place feels very touristy. Expensive shops around and a lot of Asian tourists in hanboks trying to take ""traditional"" pictures. Everybody is just pretty much hunting that one picture.I feel sorry for the residents as there are various signs to keep quiet."
Worth to visit this beautiful place when you are in Seoul,"Really amazed of the beautiful Old Korean House and the beautiful cherry blossoms that surrounds the village. It`s very near Myeongdong, and just get off at Chungmuro Station exit 3 then just 2 minutes walking and you will see this beautiful Korean Village. There`s a lot of activities you can try to. I was amazed of the cherry blossoms there."
A Walk To Remember,"This quaint and charming neighborhood situated in the center of Seoul is truly a sight to behold. With 600 years of history, and architecture and culture not found elsewhere in the capital, this is indeed a ""must-see"" on your Korean Itinerary."
Just beautiful ,Please remember these homes are all occupied and it is a residential neighborhood. The homes are just spectacular and the area is wonderful. It's located in between the two palaces so I highly suggest you make a day out of it and visit all three sites. If you're up for some fun rent traditional Korean dress and go to the village and palaces. The outfits are beautiful and the rental places do your head to toe look. There are great local coffee places and we both enjoyed sipping on coffee while admiring the traditional architecture. 
"Nice to say we did it, but....","We went there, but only because every SK guide book we owned told us too! It was beautiful and if you like the historic scene then give it a whirl; I personally found it boring and intrusive to the people that lived in the area. There's not a lot to see or do there; however good shopping, coffee shops etc in the lower levels and Parallel to the Hanoks! Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't have made an effort to find it!!"
Heritage walk,this is a must visit place while you are in Seoul.. stacks of korean style home and few shops along the way.. has a view of the neighborhood... rent an hanbok and take a picture of yourself in one of the studios. there were many boutiques where you can pretty stuffs .. 
Great Neighborhood,This is definitely one of the places to visit in Seoul. The traditional Korean houses are a sight to behold. 
A gen,Walking thru the village took us into the past...quite a contrast with the modern buildings in the background. 
Village Charm,"Lovely historic buildings and houses make this an interesting place to visit. I was not able to locate the tourist information office that was marked on my map so I was really unsure of where to start. There are some maps up that show the premier spots. I was a bit concerned for the people who live here as floods of people are loudly trekking through their neighborhood, taking pictures of their property and sometimes even entering their homes as their were many signs up identifying private property. "
Traditional district with old style houses,Lovely place to explore. Old and traditional architecture and a few cool shops located there. Not a place for shopping but gives you an idea on how housing districts were like 50 years ago. 
Worth a visit,You will see how Seoul looked befaore the civil war and can sea the dramatical changes from traditional to modern western city
Always love this place,Always love the houses here. Only setback is there are also many people taking photos of this place. So quite difficult to get a good shot.
Traditional Korean houses which are still in use today..,"This place gives you a good insight into how Korean people lived in the past. Luckily, people still live there today and you will come across a open house for you to explore.You have to remember to be quiet when you are waling around, people still live here and go about their daily lives.Great for photography. So many alleys and streets to explore with some little hidden gems to discover. I think a review is useful to highlight what this place is all about, but I really do not want to spoil it for you. Put this on your list of must see places in Seoul. You will not be disappointed."
Walking around in hanbok!,"I rented a hanbok from a shop in the village and walked around. The hanbok rental shop opens at 10am and it costs 15,000 KRW for a 2 hour rental! It was a very fun experience and I took many photos at the hanok village. There is a museum there where you can actually walk in and see the interior of a hanok. There are also many shops there where you can engage in some craft works, like embroidery or knot tying. However, these workshops can be a little pricey. "
A well preserved old section of the city,"There are only a few sections of the village that are worthwhile. Otherwise, it is too modernized (people actually live in those houses). I guess I expected a isolated neighbourhood frozen in time. Bring a map with an itinerary so that you dont wander needlessly."
You can't miss it.,"This is a very pleasant neighborhood to visit, with lots of little shops, restaurants and tea houses. It gives you the opportunity to feel like you have left Seoul to enter a small village. Lots of tourists in the main streets, so you might want to go through the side streets. That is what we did and we were often alone."
Some very nice parts - and some less exciting,"Not far from the Gyeongbokgung Palace you'll find this interesting neighborhood. I couldn't stop comparing it to the absolutely lovely ""Sannenzaka Ninenzaka"" in Kyoto. And that was probably a mistake....because Kyoto wins big-time.But on its own it is actually a nice part of town. Unlike Kyoto, where the area is filled with lots of shops, restaurants and tearooms, this area here is filled with actual houses where people live in.There are the occasional shops and a few tearooms, but for the most part is consists of residental buildings. And these are very pretty, authentic, traditional Korean houses....the Hanoks, hence the name of this area.At times it is quite a maze of narrow streets, some quite amazing, some a bit less interesting. If possible, pick up a road map from the tourist guides. They wander around this area.Some parts have really stunning views, check some of my pics for that. It is also nice to see people wander around in traditional clothes (Hanbok)....even though mostly rented (free access to all palaces if dressed like that). The combination of the Hanoks and the old-school dressed pedestrians give this area a lovely charm.Since people do live here, be a bit respectful. There are signs everywhere with a few ground rules. Even though many tourists completely ignore these, especially when it comes to the noise. Too bad.So, it's not as great as Sannenzaka Ninenzaka in Kyoto. But a lovely part of Seoul nonetheless. And in walking distance from the palace. Be sure to visit both.Wanna know more about me and my trips? Check my profile."
Beautiful and peaceful,Me and some friends rented Korean outfit and walked the streets for about 2 hours. I highly recommend doing this. We had a lot of fun.
Nice Walk! But be Quiet Inside!,I enjoyed walking around here. the walk has an inclined pathway and it was difficult for me since I went here at the end of my DIY trip for the day! Best to go here in themorning when you ahve full of energy. But everything is worth it. Very Korean at all aspect. These are actual private residences so always keep quiet while touring around.
A village near the palaces ,"A part of Seoul with old houses. As these houses are private, you can't enter them.Beware of the art shop in the beginning of this village - they try to rip-off you.And also beware of a private observatory on the top of the hill. You can see signs to this private observatory which leads you the wrong way. Better to go up to a long street where many free lookouts are available."
Cool Village,"One of the places that is a must go if you are in Seoul. Coming from a place where there are no more villages, this is very interesting to see how the houses are uphill and stacked next to each other. Recommended"
Great place,"You can really have the feeling of old Korean here. I love the atmosphere. But, it will be great shall there are more information about the area. No tourist information there. "
Be prepared for uphill walking,"15 mins walk from Anguk station Exit 2. It's actually a residential area so you can't go inside the houses to see. It was hot when we went so the fruit flavoured soft ice cream was a wonderful treat. Love the grape flavour best, tastes just like grape bubble gum! It's uphill walking so wear comfortable walking shoes. We dropped in to a traditional Korean tea house for a drink and to rest. The cold drinks served were really refreshing. Quite pricey though. "
Old streets in modern city,If you want to see old houses in modern city yoy have to visit this kind of skanzen we call it. But houses here are living ones.
Great FREE thing to do,"I just loved walking around this place, its a little slice of old world Korea stuck inside a concrete jungle, LOVED IT EVEN THOUGH IT RAINED ALL DAY - just a good excuse to stop and sit in a cafe for an hour"
Beautiful and unique ,Step back into time when you visit Bukchon hanok village. Very nice place to see easy to get to. It's about a 10 minute walk from the subway. 
Well worth a visit.,Took me back to bygone days.Do visit the information centre first.Volunteers give free tour.Pick up a very useful map to help walking round the area.
Historic Traditional KoreanAlley,"Very pretty little alley. They said it has been there for 600 years. Don't forget to dress up before you get into the alley. The shop just around the corner, and they are renting Hanbok. You will get the best experience walking in the Alley"
Must see ,"I had one free day during my business trip in Seoul and decided that I wanted to see the traditional Hanok village and I was happy I decided to go there after the visit at the Palace. It was a lovely neighborhood to take a leisure walk, cute little coffee shops and local noodle shop there. "
Just OK,"We enjoyed seeing the old neighborhood, but not sure it was worth the walk up the hill to do it. Lots of posting about ""Private Residences"". Combination of residential and small shops."
Lost in the city,I love the fact that seoul still preserve the traditional houses quite well. Tourists still able to stroll sround the neighborhood and enjoy the scenery while being lost in the trace of Jeoseon. Sometimes I feel like I'm time travelling.Be reminded that real people live in the area as it's a real neighborhood. So please be mind of your voice while strolling around.
Hanok Village,Visited Hanok Village. It's a nice 1 hour stop over to visit traditional Korean houses and take some great photos. Theres one house towards the beginning of the street where you can walk around inside. Make sure to grab some photos at the top overlooking the village with the city back drop. 
Great historic place to visit during spring cherry blossoms or fall foliage,"This is a cool place to see some historic Korean residences, tea houses, and shops. It is an especially photogenic place during the spring cherry blossoms bloom time and during the fall to see autumn colors. I would recommend bringing a camera and simply enjoying a stroll around the many streets of the village. You could also rent Korean Hanbok costumes to wear at one of many shops in the village, if you want to have a fun and experience part of the culture."
Take the map and you wont get lost,It has much photogenic spot inside so i suggest you to take the mapAnd it has some store that sell clothes with cheap price..What a surprise
Guided walking tour,"Good thing that we booked for the free local guided walk otherwise we might not appreciate as much the history and culture of this place other than seeing the type of traditional Korean house. Started at Unhyeongung understanding the history of this palace, the differences in the gender affecting the housing and decor before walking to see the high school where Winter Sonata was filmed. Followed by the hanok village itself where the guide also brought us to see the Kokdu museum and sharing with us which houses were used by which k drama with which popular Korean actors/actresses. Recommend to go for this guided tour rather than walking by yourself plus it is Free!! "
Love this Quaint Village,"Quaint place to go..Anguk Subway Line. Be prepared for a long walk and absorbed in the atmosphere. Here one can see many of the young & tourists will dressed up in Hanbok (National custume) and walk around here. A very lively pleasant scene...and they do look very good in them. Took us half a day here, Absorbed in their culture, there are people still living in the Hanok Village, thus one need to be aware and try not to disturb the neighborhood peace & serenity.There are also some nice shops here too...quaint local restaurants too..Seeing the Hanboks I get the feel of being drifted into their period dramas...One get free entry into the Gyeongbokung Palace. This is the original Palace , the other Changdeokung Palace is the UNESCO site. Both palaces situated around Bukchon Hanok Village...but rather far away from one another...Once you are around here, one can get to Insadong as well.Thus one need a full day of energy to do the whole area outside Anguk Subway!"
Close to Insadong,It's nice to see where locals live although there are so many tourists that many locals are moving out. There are lots of signs asking people to speak quietly. Walls are thin in Korea. The old architecture is a great photo op. 
"Traditional houses, and that's it","Nothing much in the area except to see the traditional houses. There is a famous lookout spot for you to overlook Korea, but the view is not great. Headed to the palaces shortly after."
More than the main street,The stroll their is definitely a great one. You ahloud definitely go in the high streets that are in the north part for more original buildings. 
Good way to experience old korean architecture,"I've been there on a transit tour by Incheon airport.It's a nice area with an old houses. Most of them are residences, so you need to be quite"
This place has to be seen,This Village was nearly wiped off the map during the occupation period in Korea's history but the residents set about rebuilding the Village in the same manner as was previously on the site and they did a great job a unique wander around 'a historic village' albeit reconstructed some 50 years ago. A great job done
Beautiful ,I was in Insadong and just followed a crowd to see where they were going and ended up here in the beautiful village area. The houses are well kept and mixes in with new coffe shops along the streets. I was amazed by all the cozy coffee shops and would love to have more time to just sit here and relax and people watch. The streets have something old and something new and ha a very artistic expression. I will spend more time here on my next trip to Seoul for sure. There were also a lot of people walking around in traditional costumes that you can rent on an hourly basis. 
A pleasant stroll,This is definitely a highlight if you are in the area and seeing the palaces either side of it. You won't spend long here since there is only a couple of streets that actually contain the old houses but they are very photogenic. 
여유롭게 둘러 봤다면 더 좋았을...,"관광객이 너무 많아 천천히 돌아보지 못 한 것이 너무 아깝습니다만, 너무 큰 기대를 하지 않고 아기자기하게 펼쳐진 골목길을 둘러 보고 현대식 건물들 사이에 남아 있는 옛 모습들을 즐긴다면 더 좋았을 것 같습니다. 단, 음식점들이 너무 고가인 관계로 잘 조사한 후에 적절한 식당을 미리 알아 가는 것이 좋겠습니다.It was a big island surrounded by modern buildings. It is good to walk slowly through back alleys. I would like to recommend to wear Han-Bok (Korean traditional costume. there are many rental shops) and take some pictures in front of traditional houses."
hanok village,"quiet and beautiful village, remind you and give you a picture of an old Korean people's villages, beautiful experience within this village,there are places to buy souvenirs"
Well preserved traditional houses,"Bukchon originally was just a small residential village and due to the exposure of the K-dramas and became a tourist spot. The village preserved the traditional house structure and design of Korea. It's actually nice to walk around the area. There're nice cafe and restaurant around that offers traditional teas and dishes.And you can see staff walking area with a ""quiet"" sign, cause Bukchon is still a resident place."
Nice area to walk around,"The Bukchon area spreads around Anguk Station. The area is quite large, so it may be a good idea to plan in advance based on what you would like to see. I chose the area where you can see the palace and traditional houses, since I had a limited time in the afternoon. If you have more time, you could walk more and see more. I found a free map/area guide along the way from Anguk station, and it was quite informative as well. People live in those traditional houses, you'd better not to disturb them."
Beautiful traditional houses ,I visited Bukchon hanok village with my friend. I like those beautiful traditional houses. Eventhough they were old but those owner maintained them very well. Unfortunately we cannot enter those because they are private residence. 
a place to wander,"Next to the Gyeongbokgung palace, this village has great cafes, restaurants, art galleries and shopping. As a tourist destination it is promoted as streets of older style Korean houses, so all the delightful shops and art work was a bonus. Loved the Interesting murals on the walls of the village. I would enjoy going back there again for a longer time."
Hanok houses worth seeing,It's worth seeing the Hanok village but (honestly) it's a pleasant hours walk nothing more - you'd struggle spending a whole day there...
Beautiful palace !,Cant be here for long coz this is a private house for some peoples. And please be quite here if you dont want to makes the 'ajumma' with a board angry ;))Better you take a pic here with using hanbok !!
Authentic traditional Korean houses which are not made for tourists,"This is a real residential area which are not specially made for tourists.The owners of the houses are still staying in the house. Therefore, tourists are always being reminded to be silent.A must go in Seoul to experience the old seoul culture. Quite a bit of up hill and down hill walk but definitely worth the visit."
Just waste my time,"The village was not far from Anguk subway station, around 20 minutes on foot up to a small hill, but to be honest, there was nothing much to see or to enjoy. The old houses in traditional and typical Korean style were there but they were modern with luxury cars and so on. Tourists flooded it with hanbok and camera to take their selfie pictures just to show off on social networks. We don't recommend this to those who look for a real culture of local Korean without being frustrated by the tourist flood."
Not impress,basically im not impress with bukchon hanok village. it waste my time for 1hour. it walking distance to gyeongbokgung palace & national folk museum. 
Rows of Old Korean Houses,This is a private area wherein you can see old Korean houses. A bit steep for walking and lots of tourist. Good to go to see the traditional houses in Seoul. 
Touring Cyclists ,"It was great to see the five different houses in one place. English interpretation is proved, both on the signs and in the pamphlet. You can view all the rooms and there contents, unobstructed , but not access then."
Wandering old Seoul,"Make sure to spend time wandering the streets of Bukchon while in Seoul. There are guides and a route, that takes you up some lively streets with cute little shops and artist galleries, and also quieter neighborhood streets. We very much recommend trying to do the whole loop, as it is a great way to see the beautiful old Hanoks and neighborhoods. Make sure to leave time to pop in and out of places that intrigue you, and if you have an extra hour to try your hand at learning some traditional Korean arts from the many workshops tucked into the streets."
Picturesque glimpse into the past,See the traditional style of houses which are still lived in today. Many have been converted into shops & studios but plenty are still lived in. There are some nice views over the city from the top of the hill. 
Me and my boyfriend trip,We went there and walk around the village. There have many couple weared the traditional korean dress and took a photos and The best thing is Bulmakgol hahaha that is a delicious big cow ribs I ever had.
just an area of old buildings,Did not really sure what to do here. Too crowded to take a decent pic. Lots of cafe and art gallery. A maze of old buildings.
A nice walk in the park...,"This is a great activity to pass a couple of hours in Seoul. It's a beautiful little walk, and interesting to see the replica houses on the grounds. An excellent choice for families with younger kids! "
Serene,Beautiful gardens and a lovely place to spend an hour or two just strolling through the gardens and the traditional buildings. 
Nice picturesque area,"Nice area on a hill, and very touristy, with small shops, some restaurants. Surprisingly many new buildings inbetween old ones (or old looking ones)."
Ok at best,Not sure if i missed this hype completely but the area is a blast from the past and a proliferation of independent stalls. Certainly can use an hour or two here. 
Excellent Way to Spend Half a Day,Old town Seoul. Lots of shops and restaurants. Many pedestrian walking streets. This is where the palaces are. Good way to get a sense of Seouls history and pleasant area to spend half or a full day. Make sure to visit one of the palaces.
"Walk, Walk & Walk !!!",Can see the original house of how they stay way back till now maintaining the same structure.Be sure you are quite cos they are actually stay inside the houses
Ancient Korean Village ,Decided to visit this part of Seoul as it appeared in some Korean drama before . These traditional Korean houses are actually with residents inside so the tourists have to keep their voices down as not to disturb them . Great for photo shooting especially with Hanbok ( Korean traditional attire)which you can rent from a few shops around. Can see some couples have their wedding photos taken here. Leisure strolls along the narrow alleys while admiring this historical architectures is fun & relaxing.Worth a visit if you want to learn about the ancient culture of Korea!
a little bit tricky to find this exact area,"nice place to take photos, especially if you already renting the hanbok and wearing them before going to this place. the perfect itinerary was going to rent hanbok around the palace, going to palace and strolling around and after that you can go to this village with that hanbok (because usually the renting time was just 2hrs or 4hrs). "
What A Nice Village,"You get to see how the traditional/ older houses were and you can enter some. It would be interesting to live here. These houses are actually lived in, so be conscious of where you step and keeping the noise levels down."
Lovely architecture,"We decided to rent a 'Hanbok' (traditional Korean attire) to take photos. The photos are cute, be warned the outfit is quite layered and there are a lot of steep walking. We were pretty hot and sweaty, but the time we were done but it was a perfect opportunity to sit in one of the many cafes or homes that offered drinks."
Pretty Vilage,"You have to hike to explore Bukchon Hanok village , The house is pretty some house have beautiful garden inside. There are craft shop and hanbok rental shop around Bukchon Hanok Village."
Ancient Korean Residences ,"This is actually not a tourist area but private residences! People stay in these homes. Try to stay quiet and respectful while exploring the area. The village has many old Korean houses. Little shops and eateries line along the streets of the exits, and you can rent a hanbok to walk in all day at a rental shop nearby. "
Crowded but still worth visiting,I do feel sorry for the residents in the area. The crowd were just ignorant to the fact that they are really noisy even though there are signs everywhere asking them to keep the noise down.I still think it is still worth visiting the village. The hanoks are pretty and the area is safe and pleasant place for easy stroll. Try to avoid the crowd and come early in the morning.
Walk down the nice and traditional neighbourhood,Beautiful place to take a walk along the traditional Korean houses which there is people staying there. Will see alot of silence sign on the door. Still a good place to walk and take picture. 
Time stops in Bukchon Hanok Village,"The alleys brings you back to the past. The beautiful architecture of the structures there are affidavits of the history. Bukchon Hanok Village preserves South Korea's traditional art by offering activities with trainers to everyone. In the small room, one could feel the passion of the trainers with the intricacy of the handicrafts made. It was a wonderful experience for a first timer with clumsy limbs. "
Soothing Cultural Walk,"It was raining but still fun to be walking along the ancient alley.By passed some shaggy old gift-shops & fragrant house that leads to a hilly pebble route to the hilltop. The view is fogged by pollution from China so the post-card view is not there, still there are old architecture and natural landscape that's worth the walk.TO enhance on photography & free entry, rent traditional Hanbok from Insadong  for 4hrs 10,000Krw which will definitely bring memory and joy looking at them years later. ALSO, Hanbok-wearer has free admission to UNESCO sites: Gyeongbukkong, Museum, Village... etc"
Lovely place for a visit in spring,We were lucky to enjoy the beauty of the cherry blossoms while we were strolling the area which has many little shops offering interesting finds.Nice place to spend your day in a relaxed atmosphere.
Travel,"There are a lot of things to visit, you will see the traditional korean's house and very friendly people at that village."
Cultural,"There really was nothing much to do here but take pictures and some stroll around it, so overall it was simply okay."
time slip,I walked on old street. There are many old korean style houses around the area. Tourists are wearing traditional clothes and enjoying like TV drama stars who act as girls in old palace. There are many rental costume shop. I wanna try someday.
Picture perfect houses and streets,"A nice area to walk for a couple of hours. Lots of places to have coffee, tea and food. Interesting little stores scattered among winding narrow streets. Lots of other tourist but lots of locals too!"
Prettiest little district in town,Must visit! And take lots and lots of pictures.Every spots are picture spots. Don't ever miss coming here.Period.
45 degree angle,"If you're a fan of treadmills and you've been doing the climb and these streets are all yours. The scenery is beautiful and the cultural heritage is surely there. This is not a museum nor a public place, these are people homes and they live inside there. There's a lot of warning not to be noisy and appreciate the neighborhood but seems like the local teens are the one that so noisy, all the tourists from abroad. At least when we were there, are all paying respect and keep their voices down. Many girls wearing gorgeous hanbok took pictures here and there's a delicious delicacies like octopus, taebokki. And i love the perfumery there too. A must visit for sure. on the top of the road there's like a temple, but walking there is a bit tough, do use walking shoes. "
Bukchon Hanok Village Day Tour,"On 10th April, I, Chiu Yong Yong and my friend Low Soh Lar had the chance to meet tour guide Mr Lee Nam Su on this trip. The trip was very interesting. And the guide was very illuminating. The guide was not pushy and was very attentive and helpful. "
A walk along traditional village,"We came to this place by subway, stop in anguk station (orange line) and walk by 700 meter.This village is beautiful, there are some traditional houses, shops, small but cozy cafe, alleys with unforgettable memories.In some shops you can borrow hanbok, traditional dress with many color. Local people and tourist like to spend their time here.One fine day, we stroll along the village, this village also residential area, so we have to keep silent.If hungry, there're a lot of snack seller. I tried toppoki (traditional snack), strawberry mochi and enjoy them so much."
Great traditional experience ,"Loved the vibe of this place. Great picture opportunity and a few places to rent Hanbok. This area has lots of small cafes with nice earthy feel to them. We spent about two hours clicking some memorable pics in this beautiful part of the city. Please keep about 20 USD for renting a hanbok , locker and other accessories. Do visit early as it can get crowded with visitors who are here mostly for pictures in the traditional outfits."
Nice view,At least half day tour. Must try Hanbok at only 5000 won rental. Many shop. Wonderful scenery. Also have a lot of restaurants. Free enter.
Bukchon Hanok Village,This is a beautiful and interesting part of Seoul with the old-style architecture faithfully preserved and renovated. Many great photo opportunities as you walk around. There are a number of nice shops in restaurants as well. Arrive early to avoid the hordes of tourists in period costume.
a taste of old Seoul,"An awesome place to walk around and feel the old Seoul, with gorgeous traditional houses.Great place for photography. the streets are narrow, downhill and uphill. Wear good walking shoes."
A small village worth visiting ,Came here after reading reviews. Managed to find after following the instructions on the street map. Walked around for nearly an hour 
Beautiful Cultural place,This is an awesome cultural place with beautiful architecture. Very nice walk with many old traditional houses. You will run to many visitors in Korean traditional hanbok. Such a wonderful place to visit in Seoul.Surrounding this village is a number of small and cute boutiques.
Quaint old houses and nice cafes,"Strolling along the quaint old houses of Bukchon village was relaxing. It is a residential area so one needs to take note not to be too rowdy. The residents seem to be used to living in a tourist attraction and a few of them even sold drinks like barley tea.There is also a row of cafes along a main road beside the village. I had a green tea latte at Osulloc and I'm still missing it. The cafes are beautifully renovated and nice to walk along them. If you are in a group, you could also try cafe hopping."
Traditional yet designger,The traditional houses in the hanok is very well an inspiration for building designer bunglows in today's era!! I liked it very much.
A great afternoon! ☀️,"After visiting the main large palace, we found ourselves discovering Bukchon Hanok village. It was that far away. Great neighbour full of beautiful shops. Lots of people walking around. A wonderful atmosphere. Stop at a traditional Korean tea house! Shoes off. Sit on the floor. Beautiful tea! "
Cultural and architectural,I love the look of the buildings. The architectural and colors are very captivating. A good place for photography and you can also rent the hanbok (culture wear) and take photos around there. A lot of nice buildings. Good for half day tour. 
Cultural..awesome architecture!,"Hign on a hill, many steps to climb but well worth the visit. From the highest point you can see the roofs of these homes and also their open courtyards in the middle of most homes, a unique architectural point. One word of advice: please enjoy it in silence or talk softly since it is the residence of many people. Please do not litter. The residents are nice enough to allow us to traverse in front of their homes to take a peak into their historical culture so please do be respectful. "
Great Place for Photo worthy pictures.,"The first time we set foot at Bukcheon Hanok Village, we fl in love with the old traditional houses with a modern twist. Fast forward today, we went back to the same place to have our wedding photos taken. Highly recommend anyone to visit this place of interest and to take time for a slow stroll to absorb the beauty in it."
Interesting korean Village,Walking along the street with nice architecture seen @village. Lovely place with a typical touch of Korean culture.
Where the present meets tradition!,"Lived here for 6 months! WOW! Quintessential traditional Korean! Beautiful traditional buildings and you can rent out Hanbok costumes (traditional Korean attire) to complete the feeling. A part of all tourist stops when visiting Seoul, and just to the right of the Royal Palace and the Blue House. Some superb gastronomic cubby holes .... eating is Seoul is overall cheap and an unforgettable experience - after a total of 18 months ... a complete convert!"
Beautiful ,"Walking through the streets is so nice, seeing the old style hanok homes, also before going into the hanok streets there's a lot of cool shop for souvenirs or for food too."
Wonderful old houses,Beautiful old houses here really nice to walk around almost car free. Lots of people wear traditional dress while hoing around
Intersting Site,Historic Japanese homes from the early 1900s preserved and restored to look as they did originally. People still live here so there are signs all over asking for quiet as loads of people wander the narrow streets and paths up and down. Interesting to see but not a whole lot you can really do here..
Very lovely place. Typical part of Korean history,"This small village really takes you back to the Emperial era in Seoul, with its traditional homes and the nearby residential areas."
Very cool area in Seoul,This was a neat little area of town with some great houses. Cool old neighborhood. Great restaurants near there also. Hiked to the top and checked out a lot of the houses. Definitely recommend seeing this area.
Average,Alight at Anguk stn exit 1/2. Pretty much a distance(to me) from the station. There are maps nearby to facilitate the search. U can take pictures but be silent pls. There are a few convenience stores on the way.
Tradition meets modern,"Loved walking around here. The main street is all modern, shops and restaurants. Up the side streets you find traditional homes and residential areas. Some hills are steep. Really great to see the contrast. Many Chinese tourists hire hanboks and pose for photos here! Funny to watch. I think this is a must visit place. "
Very historical,Loved walking through this historical area. Many young people were walking around in Native Korean attire who were glad to be photographed with us. 
We LOVED our time here,"Bukchon Hanok Village was #1 on my list of things I was excited to see in South Korea. We stayed at a wonderful Hanok Guesthouse (check out Raon Guesthouse) and were able to explore the area with our host as a guide. Honestly wish we had spent the majority of our time in this area of South Korea, and less time in the more city areas in the city-proper. Take your time exploring the quaint shops and restaurants here and being part of the village's authentic lifestyle."
A blast from the past,Stroll through this area to see the traditional hanok homes/buildings. Some have been restored and are much more modern looking. I enjoyed chatting with a local shopkeeper that invited me to stay and enjoy a baked sweet potato with her. This was another favorite area of Seoul
charming neighbour!,"pros:- charming neighbour with traditional korean house (please low down your voice theres residence within the house)- you should come here early morning to get a good picture. during day there are so many tourist walking around.- good place for photography and sight seeing- its free to walk aroundcons:- very small areas. you can finish less than 1 hour- not many store, cafe and restaurant within the areas. mostly just residence house- you need to walk around hilly areas.- not a good place to visit during rainy day- i dont see any public toilet around the areas"
Pretty Neighborhood,"I just love walking around Bukchon Village, its so pretty, so many cheap boutique, hidden instragamable cafe. Just pretty.."
Boring,Unless you're into olden days architecture there is nothing much for you to do or see here. It is like walking around outside of people's houses and taking pictures as if we (or they) are aliens. I don't understand the hype about wandering in a housing area. 
Be prepared to walk uphill,Nice little cultural village with traditional houses. Have good walking shoes if you're going there. There are a few good souvenirs stores as well as nice small restaurants and snack stalls. We were there on a beautiful sunny Saturday so it was quite packed.
The Modern World Is Creeping into The Past,"You can get a sense of days gone by when you stroll around Bukchon Hanok Village - A Hanok is the name for a traditional Korean house and there are some 800 of them in and around Bukchon. You have to hunt for scenes where there are no electricity lines, tourists or other modern paraphernalia for your perfect photo. You do get a sense that many of the properties have be restored with modern materials and the area seems gentrified with trendy art and food outlets in and around the village to cater for the tourists."
Nice area.,"Nice area to walk. Old Korean houses, smaller streets, souvenir shops. Nice place to escape from cosmopolitan Seoul."
Charming!,"A dream come through to visit this village. It was a lovely walk around the many streets of the village and taking pics at the famous spots no.5 and 6. I even located the hanok used in the kdrama ""Personal Taste"". Best to go early to avoid big tour groups. I got there before 9:30am on a Sunday and it was not crowded yet. It would be great to stay in a hanok style accommodation for my next visit to Seoul!"
Hanok Village,"There are a lot of Hanok Style homestay around this area. Besides sightseeing , there are some food stall and local made craft around this area as well. Generally it is a residential area ."
Great traditional quarter,"Similar to the better known Insa-dong, Bukchon consists of many small winding alleys with the typical Korean buidlings. Although it is very crowded it is great walking through the streets and enjoying the atmosphere"
Love this village!!,"If it's your first time visiting Seoul, this village is the perfect area to go right after Gyeongbokgung Palace. It's just right next to the palace, you just need to walk a bit.In the village there are a couple of guides walking around in uniforms. You can ask them where to start, where to walk, they'll guide you happily and give you a map. There are a few cute cafes to hangout, they look cozy. We did a good one round of the village in around 45 minutes included stopping for ice cream. "
Chic - nice,"Must visit!Located very close to the palaces and Insadong, i recommend to spend one day in these environment, plus the contemporary museum.End your day in this particular area to experience the nice upscale street stalls..dining was great."
An interesting area to walk around,"This place is filled with young men and women in traditional Hanbok costumes walking around the small streets which gives it an even more magical feel.I spent several hours browsing and observing, taking photos, having coffee and lunch here. It is a good place to rail on a lovely day. "
Family with young children.,Very traditional & unique..its gd tat such a heritage still exist. Explore around with my family till the top..Amazing scenaries with those many mountains.took pics with those whos wearing traditional hanok costumes. Lots of tourists n definately will come again..
Visit if you have time,It was ok but not really great. If you have extra time or have exited angkuk station; why not. The walk from the Angkuk station was quite long so you're legs will be a little sore when you actually get there. The alleys were ok but not thay great for me because they didn't look that old and there were signs of modern living like plumbing and electricity
Unique pretty village in the cetre of Seoul,"Stay between 2 biggest palaces in Seoul, Bukchon Hanok village is so awesome pretty with all traditional architect designs. You should borrow Hanbok and walk around to visit Bukchon and take many many colorful phótos. The air's so cool and fresh to enjoy your day here. Tips: 1. Borrowing Hanbok in Insadong street ( oposite the way to come in Bukchon) with 15.000 won/ 4 hours. I checked some other places, the price is more expensive than in Insadong.2. You can also visit 2 palaces beside at the same time when wearing Hanbok and you will got a FREE TICKET "
A taste of old Seoul,"We visited on a sunny afternoon in late-March, after going to Changdeokgung palace in the morning. It's a nice walk through narrow streets lined with old-style houses, some of which are coffee shops. There were lots of tourists but everyone respected the privacy of the local people and kept their voices quiet. The views from the top of the hill were great and we enjoyed wandering around for a few hours. "
A walk in the past,"In a top 10 ""must see"" list, I know to visit Bukchon in the palace district. It was a pleasant surprise to be in a cultural preservation section in the middle of downtown Seoul. My only mistake was not to plan to eat there. There're many little restaurants along the alleys, which I vow I will go back next time I visit. Although not many people speak English, the vendors graciously point seemingly lost tourist like myself in the right direction. Definitely bring a good camera, if you love taking photo. I wish I have mine, but I have to content with my camera phone. Enjoy the exhibit at the visiting center; and read the history of the village at the front. Seeing modern shops w/in the well-preserved traditional structures was simply incredible. The pride of the community is hard to miss. You won't be disappointed."
Too many tourists,"I visited the area with the free walking tour provided. Our guide, Miss Kim, was a funny and charming old lady. Unfortunately the area was crowded with tourists. So it was impossible to get a good picture. Moreover they were very noisy so there was no serenity there. I felt pity to the residents who live there. I enjoyed the visit to Dr. Baek In Je's beautiful historical house, which is located in the area. It was less touristy too."
"Traditional, charming and quaint village in Seoul!!!!","Sandwiched between the 2 main palace complexes in Seoul, this village is quintessential example of a traditional Korean village. It has numerous streets (uphill/downhill sometimes) and they run through traditional houses and quaint estates. It has great photo opportunity and best time is to visit during dusk. Please keep in mind that is primarily a residential area.Must visit in Seoul!!!!"
Traditional Korean Houses,"A good place to go to visit an actual residential area of Traditional Korean Houses. You just need to keep quiet though as posted on the signs within Bukchon Hanok Village. Not an easy place to pinpoint though, I wandered around a bit before I was able to find the place."
Bukchon Wanderings,"We took the subway Line 3 to Anguk Station. At first we wandered around aimlessly until we walked into the Seoul Hanok Center where the helpful staff not only showed us around the whole place but also gave us a map titled ""Bukchon Wanderings"".She told us that we can continue our walk following the yellow line on the map which is a big loop around Bukchon covering all the attractions, view points etc. We're pleased to say that we covered the whole route in 2+ hours of leisurely strolling, stopping at the various view points to take pictures or o get a better knowledge of the attraction. We even stopped for a cup of coffee at a private observatory that not only gave us a place to rest our feet but also a good view of the surrounding area. One can go into the many museums, galleries, workshops as one fancy. Of course there are shops, restaurants & cafes along the way. Enjoyed our morning walk thoroughly."
The wonderful village at Seoul,"The wonderful village at Seoul, many houses with the original style and traditional things.We can wearing hanok and walking around for taking the pictures here."
Lovely traditional houses and village,The area is very picturesque and unique with lots of character. There are interesting shops and museums to visit in the village but the sharp inclines and windy lanes can make it tiring for some.
Village frozen in time,"Great to spend an afternoon walking around. It'll take about two hours to go round the neighborhood where you can see the old houses, do some shopping or sit and watch couples/girls in their traditional costumes ""Hanbok"" walking around. They have maintained this residential area making it a very pleasant place to hangout. "
Beautiful walk between the traditional house,"If I come here again, might try to stay in one of the guest house here. Like many old town in the world, it fill with modern shop, coffee house, sunny and relax.Like some local student, I rent the traditional dress and took some photos, loving it."
HOuses!,"This place just like another dimension, the architecture and design was astonishing! i mean people still living there! who doesn't want to live in a beautiful place like that? the environment was really great! also this place was really close to gweongbokgung palace. By wearing the hanbok you can get a very great picture with this place! but yeah most this place you need to have stamina! climb uphill and downhill.."
Beautiful village,We went there at night so it was very quiet and very few people. You can see the N-tower from one area. We really enjoyed the HanOk style homes! Nice place to visit and take photos.
Traditional Houses,Felt like it was in the past walking through the traditional houses. There is also one house which was open to view for free.
Place for Tourist,"Bukchon Hanok Village is not really touching about traditional that much some of hanoks are renovated, new building designed to be the original but i did not disappoint it"
The other side of Korea,The place is sandwiched by 2 palaces and clearly shows how traditional houses were and there people still residing in those places. Only miss was we were unable to go in and visit the houses. 
Authentic Korea,Must place to visit. Just be aware that this is residential area and must observe silence everywhere. 
Nice,"A little flashback to how Seoul used to be before the sky scraper jungle.Nice houses there and nice walk. Shame that some tourists were very loud although many signs ""please be quite"" are scatterd in the area. After all it's still a residential area."
Overated,came here as it is recommended by a few friends but i dont think its worth visiting unless you really interested to snap a few photo like me..
Traditional Korean housing,"This district is packed with over 900 hanoks, traditional Korean houses. It retains the city's old appearance. It has bceom a popular filming location for movies and TV dramas. As it is still a residential area, so please respect the residents there. They do hanbok rental, traditional Korean clothing. So you can wear the hanbok and take pictures in front of these traditional Korean housing. Many retail shops selling survivors. A little bit pricey since it is tourist attraction place."
perfect for tourist,really very nice place.. although a very long walk..it features real houses in the middle of the city that reflects the early culture of korea.. alot of young people even rent Hanok and walk up the hill to take pictures.. scenery was scenic but it was really a long walk and because we went in winter.. the walk doesn't end up in sweats.. :D
A must visit place,It was so memorable to take picture there. This place is located near Gyeongbukgong so I can go there by walking.
Photogenic Spot in Seoul,"Bring your camera as there is a lot of photogenic spot here. Yes, it's a very touristy place so you might want to go early in the morning to avoid the crowd. This place located 10 minutes walk from Anguk station."
Fantastic!,Its amazing that this traditional village is still kept the way it was for more than a hundred years. Walking through this place is a really cool and refreshing way to feel..but be prepared to walk - up pretty steep hills. You'll find cool cafes and design stores in the area if you need a moment of relax. Cool area.
Put your walking shoes on!,"After you put on your walking shoes, go visit the Bukchon Traditional Cultural Centre near Anguk subway station first for an overview and don't forget to get a Bukchon Village Folding Map.Follow the routes suggested or wander leisurely on your own, there are plenty of coffee shops, tea houses, restaurants, shops around, more on the Samcheong-dong side. This could very well be made into a full-day event, especially if you throw in a visit to the art museum or art gallery in the area. Don't expect this to be a mini ancient city area where everything looks like it was from the Joseon Dynasty but along the routes suggested, the buildings and walls have been well preserved and taken care of. It's quite an amazing experience and it could be one of the best days you spent in Seoul!"
Cultural Visit and Worth It to Go,"If you want a cultural experience into the olden days of Korea, definitely check out the Bukchon village area out! There are a lot of cute side streets to go into, as well as areas where you can attend and take part in workshops. We went to an area where we were able to learn a lot about the actual etching on Korean traditional clothing and it was awesome to just get a better understanding of everything. Really cute homes designed with how it was back in the older days in Korea!"
ordinary tourist area,nothing much to see here except hiking up this small residential arealots of tourists sometimesthere are also info guides in the area
Many traditional korean house,Very crowded and many traditional korean house. You can enter old house for tea ceremony but not free.
Traditional village,"A good place to explore the traditional Korean architect, peaceful and tidy. My suggestion is to visit during summer - autumn, maybe too cold to walk around during winter time."
A short walk away from the palace,Its good to see the architecture of the traditional homes. You can even take pics of yourself in a hanok traditional wear) in some stores. I wish i could've spent a night in a traditional home but they are quite expensive! Would love to go back to see it during the winter covered partially in snow
Taste of traditional Korea,"Bukchon is a place that you must visit while in Seoul. It's a neighborhood where you can see several traditional Korean houses. It is a residential area, so be respectful and try not make too much noise. I went early in the morning, around 9 and there were very few people there. It was great to take admire and take amazing pictures. From there you can see N Seoul Tower and it is amazing to see the contrast of the city around it.To reach the neighborhood stop at Anguk station, exit 6. Stop at the visitor center where you can get more information and map to explore the area and go to the top of the hill to see the cluster of houses. There are some houses that offer stay and tea ceremonies I did not participate."
Transit to the past,"I love this place. I love culture and traditional houses in Korea. Walking around, there's a combination of modern and traditional buildings. It really reminds me how important for us, not to forget our roots. "
Wonderful buildings,Mind blowing buildings. Very old and interesting layout. Free access. You need to pay money to enter old house for tea ceremony. Had higher expectations some sort of old market and stall. People still live in the houses. Perhaps thats why nothing much to do there. 
Korean traditional house,"Come there must be silence, its beauty and amazing view there... you may try to rent at homestay there to try experience living korea traditional houses"
Rather interesting with many shops and eateries. Abit difficult on a cold day. ,"It was quite a cold winter day when we explored this area. It's all outdoors so it can be difficult in the cold. But there's some shops or eateries to pop into if you must. We walked around many of the old houses and also went into some which were open for viewing, such as the tourism heritage house. Got a good feel of how the people lived in olden days. Quite a nice experience. Most of the eateries were closed from 2:30 to 5pm, so we didn't manage to get a tea time snack and hide from the cold even though we wanted to. It's just a nice place to wonder about and admire architecture and some old crafts too. The slopes can be quite steep, so people with weak knees may find it tough. Also, many houses here are still inhabited, so tourists must keep quiet and respect their privacy and take care of the environment. "
Takes you back in time...,"If you have a prolific imagination , you can imagine yourself back in time as you walk through the road ... the old houses... well kept...timeless"
Stroll at your own pace and explore traditional Korean housing,"Seeing the Bukchon village is a good thing to do on a nice afternoon. Be prepared to walk for about an hour through pedestrian-friendly streets, but keep in mind there are some hills. If you're visiting when it's really hot, you won't want to do it during the heat of the day. Because people live in these houses there are many signs asking for quiet and respect of private property. In the busier and more contemporary area, you'll find lots of restaurants, shops and treats. Another highlight is seeing all the tourists dressed in traditional Hanboks - great for photos.Enjoy the walk and the nice architecture."
Local culture preserved,"Quite uphill so be ready to walk, plenty of souvenier shops around and coffee shops for breaks and rest."
A chance to see a different side of Seoul,These are residential streets made up of the original types of houses. It's on a hillside so there are also a number of good viewpoints of the city and you get old/new contrasts. Some of the streets are steep.
Old traditional neighborhood between 2 palaces,"Bukchon Hanok village is an old neighborhood in Seoul located between the two royal palaces. This is a great walking area of town, with narrow, winding streets and traditional architecture. Mind the people holding the ""Shhhh"" signs :-) You really are walking through a residential neighborhood. At the top of the hill, on the east side of the walking tour part of the neighborhood, is wonderful, small ""souvenir"" shop, barely large enough for the proprietor and two patrons. The Korean shop keeper was so nice, able to communicate in English enough to help me buy a couple of gifts for my family. Within the village are some great traditional Korean restaurants too!"
"""Up & down"" wanderings :)","The experience was one of ""uniquely fun"" walking along these narrow streets flanked on both sides by traditional-styled houses or lovely compound walls (with roofs above as is the style unique to Japan & Korea) while pretty frequently having to negotiate the upward & downward slopes along the way (""steeper slopes"" on the left side than on the right side of the main street Bukchon-ro that divides the Village into two parts). And while some might just do a simple walk-around, I suggest checking out some 'workshops' which are on the right side of the Village (got to my first workshop after walking up for about 10 minutes to the right from the main street, followed by three more workshops including one for embroidery called The Han Sang Soo Embroidery Workshop and one for calligraphy or designs), and do keep in mind that they're not museums but places where people are actually doing stuff and where tourists can ""partake in"" their activities (not sure if you need like a prior booking for such though); and on the left side of the Village, be sure to go all the way to the far end where there's like a terrace with a railing from which there are great views of the mountains (not too far) and the city's skyline (somewhat distant).Coming by subway, Anguk Station (on Line 3) is where to get off, and the best exit is Exit 2 with just about a 5-minute walk straight ahead on the main street Bukchon-ro after coming out of the exit and you'll be right at the area where a right turn or a left turn will lead you up to the corresponding part of the Village (so yes, the right side for the 'workshops' and the left side for the lookout terrace at the far end as mentioned above; and my suggestion is to do the right side of the Village first, then cross the main street to the left side, then come back down from the far end on that side where you'll get to like a ""shopping street"" below that kind of intersects the main street after a few minutes' walk bringing you conveniently back to near Anguk Station for leaving the Village)."
just after the Palace Gyeongbokgung,perfect to do on the same day: the Palace Gyeongbokgung; Hanok Bukchon and the Buddhist temple. I really enjoy because it's like an outdoor architecture museum but actually people still leaving there.
Good place for take a walk,I used to take a walk from Myeongdong through Insa-dong and Samcheong Dong to reach here.Actually not very far but you can find the Korean’s life along this walk.
Worth the visit,"We went to the Bukchon Hanok Village. Be prepared to walk. The roads are very narrow and steep but it's worth the visit. However, it can get a bit crowded. It was very nice to walk along the houses. There were Street food along the way."
lovely village with boutique stores and shops ,"we walked around the area, lots of boutique stores along with the traditional housing architech. Nice area to spend about 3-4 hours wondering around but keep in mind its a tourist spot! "
traditional houses in a wonderful village that offers a lot,"Bukchon Hanok Village is home to many traditional houses, called hanok, that date back to the Joseon Dynasty. The name Bukchon translates to ""northern village"" Today many of these hanoks operate as cultural centers, guesthouses, restaurants and tea houses, etc. that give you an opportunity to immerse yourself into the traditional Korean culture. It's lovely to wander around here and take lots of photos. The doors and entrances are very photogenic.Let a cab take you up here and then walk mostly downhill."
It's a small traditional village,"A steep walk up to the nice view point of Bukchon Hanok Village. As it was winter, it's rather cold and energy do get depleted quickly. We rested and had traditional rice drink and ginseng tea in one of tea houses there. We got ourselves warmed and enjoyed the quiet feel about the village. Unfortunately we had a short disturbance by a bunch of rather loud tourists who came by looking to use the toilet. Be forewarned, this is pretty much a residential area with only a few tea houses in it. So it will be difficult to find rest rooms around here. It's good to be prepared or you will end up like the rowdy tourists group we met. In the end, they were refused and turned away as they have no intention to buy any drinks from the tea house. "
Historic buildings and great cafes and eateries,Great to walk round the old buildings. Interesting shops cool cafes and eateries. Sometimes a bit up hill but great to visit. 
Dainty 😍,"As cute as it sounds, this place does not have a main entrance that says 'Bukchon Hanok Village'. You just get to Samcheongdong and get up at any small hills that you see. The area around this place is somewhat magical and hard to believe. It was cold when I was there, leaving slippery icy roads to conquer. Lots of people with large cameras and hanbok. You will find coffee shops and perfume houses along the way. It was only a 15 walk up and down depending on how long you spend your time in the hills."
Samcheong dong,"Bukchon Hanok village - the place with the remained of traditional Hanok houses in the alleyway, where there are different upward & downward landscape scenery to see. Also, around Samcheong area, not to miss the art galleries & museums. Nearby is Gyeongbokgung."
Traditional buldings,Nothing much to mention about the area but one thing is worth mentioning was the samgyetang chicken we had before exploring bukchon village. food was great at affordable price
Picturesque but beware the hills!,"This is such a beautiful area where people actually still reside in. The area is hilly so be sure to wear comfortable shoes. On a day where I walked a lot, scaling the hills was a bit of a challenge. The architecture and the doors are so very beautiful."
Bukchon,"Nice traditional houses, interesting to look at. Some spots are great for photo taking. To view the inside of a house, you can get into one that has ongoing activities to have quick look and a few pictures - leave shamelessly if you are not keen to pay for joining, which we did. :P Does not need very long to finish the whole area, they look quite the same after 30mins."
Interesting,"Here there are some beautiful traditional houses, with many people walk around in the traditional clothes. Be aware it can get a little crowded! "
Nice place to go,There aren't that many cultural sights in Seoul. You find a lot of shopping culture but if you want something old school. This is a pleasant neighborhood to stroll around. 
Nice area,Dont forget to try hanbokI believe there is a lot hanbok rental hereI endedup going to place that I cant used it to far from the rental area
lots of streets to wonder round,"This is not a place to rush. Plan to be around for an hour or even more. Eat from the street stalls or from a local restaurant, then explore the streets and alleys with your camera at the ready. The tour buses mainly unload here in the afternoon, so try get here in the mornings."
Walk of immersion in old Korean culture,The Bukchon Hanok Village is a testament to the old Korean culture and history as hanok or traditional Korean houses were preserved. We joined a free walking tour offered by the Seoul Tourism Organization wherein we learned more of the history of Bukchon Hanok Village through their volunteer tour guides. This is a valuable and enriching experience for tourists.
Unique place for photo shooting,There are 8 tourist spots to take beautiful photos in this area. Just make sure u ask the cute guys in red who are from the tourist information centre where are the spots and you will get to take spectacular photos in the alleys between the houses. There are also shops offering hanbook experience where u can rent the Korean traditional clothes and walk around taking photos. These will be a good destination for bridal photo shooting. 
"Great walk around to see ""Old"" Korea","This is a great culturally-preserved area. It's nice to walk around and explore the different houses built and preserved. Gives you a feel what the ""Old"" Korea looked like in the days of past."
Traditional looking village that once inhabited only by the nobles.,I visited this charming little village with the Korea airport free tour. The village that once only inhabited by the nobles are all about narrow alleys and traditional houses with typical roofing.
A Must Visit,"It was packed full of tourists, but understandably so. Some of the most charming streets I've ever walked. Beautiful, intricate architecture on every corner of these homes (private residences actually) make for lovely stroll and great photo ops. What I found particularly striking was as you walk down these streets that sort of take you back in time, you look up and see the modern skyline as a backdrop. The Samcheongdong area is also a must visit. It is small, but very historic and the mountains in the background are so beautiful."
love the architecture seen in Bukchon,"This is a walking trip. You just wander around the streets of Bukchon appreciating the traditional korean style architecture of the houses here. People actually live in these houses so there are a whole lot of signs asking you to keep quiet, which ruins the look in my opinion but I can see how the locals might get annoyed with all the tourists walking around everyday here. It's a great photo spot to say you are in korea. There are lots of side streets and we took random turns and headed towards samcheondong to eat lunch. "
Beautiful and traditional Korean houses,"I highly recommend a stroll through Bukchon. It is very quaint peaceful, at least when we went (late afternoon after it stopped raining). Thee traditional Korean houses are very beautiful. If possible, go with a local who can point out interesting tidbits about the area (if you watch K-dramas some of them were filmed here, and certain celebrities also live here). Make sure you respect the residents there by remaining quiet and do not trespass onto their property by going off the streets."
Walk and meander around,"A great place to walk around and discover different activities and shops. It's an actual area where people live so be mindful of the residents. Come before 5 to experience the handiworks and the hands-on activities. We came too late for it, but it is still a picturesque area to meander. "
Native and traditional Korean atmosphere right at the center of the city,Very ancient mixed with modern ambiance which is very fascinating as you walk along the streets and corridor the village. Perfect to reminisce what does korea looks like way back those old times. Very impressive how they keep this attraction in a clean and modernized environment.
Bukchon Hanok Village Overrated,Bit of a letdown this traditional village. Place looks deserted except if you admire traditional korean architecture. Its a bit like a hilly walk behind back alleys. Nothing much to see.
The old and the new in harmony,"The Bukchon Hanok Village is a great place to stroll around to see the Hanoks of Seoul - I wish I had stayed in a Hanok Guest House, maybe next time - but unfortunately it is visible the process of less old houses and more of the new ones. "
Beautiful but Tiring place to visit,"This place is filled with lanes and lanes of traditional Korean houses. Like my friends said, this place is totally Instagram worthy and we took at least 3 hours walking around the neighborhood taking tons and tons of photo. You can easily rent traditional Korean Hanboks at only 10,000 Won for 2 hours just outside the neighborhood.1 thing to note is that, the neighborhood is filled with steep slopes, so it might get abit tiring after awhile as you have to constantly climb the slopes."
Essential part of a visit to Seoul,"Traditional houses, well maintained, and a lovely place to walk around in good weather. Good photo opportunities as well."
Not many old houses left ,"The old houses all seem to have ugly store fronts. There are a couple of old residences, but there are more houses with new construction using the old style - lovely wood but new. "
Beautiful traditional house!,Traditional house area to walk around. Surrounded by busy traffic and modern buildings yet the premise is quaint and picturesque. Modern meets traditional architecture is amazing too.This is residential area so quiet is a must in order not to disturb the people living here. Some slopes very steep and it’s all about walking up and down. Worth a visit!
My favorite place in Korea,It's a great place to see traditional style of Korean houses. Local people live in the house so it's not too touristy place. It's quite close to Samcheong dong with cool shops and restaurants and many Korean people hang out there.
Nice place for visit,Ancient village in the city. There are many nice shop near this village. Don't miss to visit here. This place is far from subway.
Traditional houses ! ,"The street is lined up with traditional Korean architecture. Good for photo taking. There is hanbok rental shop nearby $18000w per person for a couple of hours. Lots of tourists, can't take a photo without people in it. "
A hilly hike to see old houses,"We nearly got lost finding this area if it wasn't for the help of those 3 policemen. Located between Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung Palaces, this street lined with old houses is a great place to visit for those interested in old korean architectures. Please note that visiting this place involves a bit of an uphill climb."
"Cute village for walking around, pretty views",We spent an hour or so walking around and taking pictures before we got too cold to continue and had to go inside for mulled wine. You can go to the bukchon culture center and get a map that suggests a walking route and where to take the best pictures. There are also museums with art activities like making bracelets or kites or weaving but it seemed like you needed to have booked them in advance
chillin with your date,i've been there to discover more of korean traditional architecture but i actually think it's a nice place to walk and have a coffee with your boyfriend/girlfriend. Atmosphere is really calm.
Gross commercialisation now,"In its heyday, I'm sure Bukchon Hanok (Village) must be quaint and nice. Since it's becoming one of the main attractions of Seoul, and that tour companies have made this into one of their compulsory stops, you can imagine the hordes of tourists that are been thrown into the neighbourhood. Roads here are built hotch potch and they zig zag all over the place. I'm sure that occupants of houses along the main route would be annoyed with lots and lots of people overstepping their boundaries and taking selfie pictures of themselves in front of houses with any kinds of architectural merits. Most of the signs that I witnessed are more or less around the same theme: keep it quiet, don't step on our stairs, keep away. What does that tell you - not welcoming indeed. There are also user friendly signs all along the path to ensure that you are not swayed from your original path. In other words, some occupants are affected more than others. The vista of Seoul has changed over the years and so does Bukchon. Trendy boutique shops such as Gentle Monster (glass frame that's opted by K-Pop stars) and other designer shops have also set up their stores here. Therefore, historical village feel is gradually been interspersed with clean line edgy shops that you get to see at Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. Whatever it is, this is Bukchon now, and no longer the endearing Hanok. It's worth your while to visit but don't keep your hope high. Come out from Gate 3 of Angguk Metro Station."
A not so old village.,"Bukchon village is sold to tourist as the typical Korean Style Housing area. However, it is actually not really a old korean bulding style. "
Preserved Heritage ,"Traditional houses in the center of capital city. Need to be a little bit fit to climb the road, but worth it."
Traditional houses,Well preserved traditional houses. Good for photo taking. There's a lot of walking so be prepared. Very nice ambiance as the places are pretty quiet (other than a lot of students walking up and down as there are universities around that area)
Heritage neighborhood with traditional Korean houses,Nice locality for one who loves photography and taking pictures of heritage residences and shops. Interesting neighborhood with specialty shops selling Uniquely Korean souvenirs and food stuff. A little walking required to explore this serene neighborhood and it is well worth that little effort. :)
Traditional Korean Village with Fantastic Scenic Views,So the concept of the Buckhon Traditional Village is to showcase the Korean tradition and architecture and preserve it by means of creating a residential place around that concept. There are people actually staying in the houses and there are tours organised for visiting the place and looking at how the homes used to be constructed. However we had less time in hand and did not go for detailed exploration. Still even the outside view and walk around this place itself is enough to give you an idea of what a beauty it is!!! The culture is reflected through this place. Best Views and Scenic Place for photography. . . get your cameras out!!!
Should be in your itinerary,"This area is really near the Gyeongbokgung Palace area and it should definitely be in your itinerary for visit as the houses really are traditional and worth visiting. There are plenty of cafes and small houses operating as restaurants serving traditional Korean dishes, cafes serving coffee and cakes, and there were also an area for shopping. I particularly liked a shop which sold traditional Korean clothes though it would be weird for me to be wearing them out of Korea so i decided not to buy them."
Nice for pictures,"The whole area is basically a residential area with an traditional kind of architecture. It's nice to spend some time and have a slow walk around these houses. There're some stores selling things too. Things that are sold here are usually a bit pricy than outside. However, we should lower our voice while walking around as its a residential area. It's worth going to take some pictures and to know more about Korea. :)"
Interesting Architecture,"Very interesting architecture, brings you back to the old Korea. Do be prepared for steep climbs as the terrain is hilly. Also, the area is a housing area, as in people literally are staying at the houses you see, so do keep the volumes down. "
good walk,"still largely a residential neighborhood, not particularly interesting to walk around on your own. not very large, perhaps 15 minutes was all I needed see most. but could always add samcheongdong which is close enough."
Bit Sold Out,"The expectation of Bukchon was that it was literally a village that has remained in traditional Korean lifestyle despite its proximity to the city. Realistically though it is old buildings and a bunch of touristy sideshows. Expected to be here for a long time, stayed for probably ten minutes. Venture out of Seoul if you're looking for traditional. Bukchon Observatory is worth a look if you decide to visit (and if you can find it)!"
must visit,"This is a great place to see the real Korean village. it is a steep climb as some of the streets the branch off the main street are usaually up hill. There are traditional houses, shops, cafes... f you go high enough up you will have nice views looking over Seoulthere is also a small Korean temple that I ran across. it is pretty small and you have to go upstairs. This is a great place to walk around and get lost. sometimes the people that live there will have their doors open and you can see in. don't go up to the door but just look as you are passing by. great architecture"
A must in Seoul!,"My favourite area in Seoul! Down the hill is a lot of cozy streets filled with trendy shops and cafeterias! While coming up the hill you'll find yourself within streets among old traditional houses! Don't forget to look back while walking up, some streets boost amazing views over the city center! "
Nice to walk around,Cute replica of old Seoul. Some houses are inhabitat by locals or foreigners.Reminds of Disneyland but everything in Korea looks like that nowdays
Quaint village,"Not much to see when we were there, just the houses. But it gives you a glimpse of old Korean culture. "
A beautiful corner of Seoul,"On the advice of local friends I visited very early in the morning and walked up from Anguk Station. Although not too busy with visitors, there were already other people arriving so I can only imagine how crowded it gets. The houses are beautifully preserved and give a good insight into how Seoul may have looked during the Joseon Dynasty. I loved just wandering along the alleys noticing the roof details, intricate doorways and courtyards.Although Bukchon is a preserved village rather than a reproduction tourist attraction it is, not surprisingly, commercial, with many of the houses converted into galleries, guest houses and tea rooms but you can look beyond it and just appreciate the history.I visited very early in the morning and was able to wander around at my own pace and not feel too intrusive. Be prepared for a lot of walking up sloping streets!"
Bukchon Hanok Village,"These are the traditional type houses and contrast to the more modern dwellings in other parts of the city. There are hills and steps so it is a physical activity. Local shops are also a high;light with some nice craft stores along with the usual cheaper socks, etc shops"
Lovely,"I considered Bukchon as one of Seoul's historical sight seeing place to go. You can still enjoy the old Korean Village vibe through the houses architecture and narrow streets. I took the train and stop at Anguk Station, it's a walkable distance.If you happened to visit during fall -winter, I recommend getting there in the morning where the streets is still empty (some stores might as well). But it's the perfect time for you to actually look and enjoy the environment. The area is loaded with food, crafts, coffee & tea shops (Ossuloc Tea!). It's a huge area, so bear with the walk. If you're tired, take a stop at the nearest shops if you wish. There's a great Coldnoodle & dumpling restaurant near the road entrance (closest to Anguk St). It's in the narrow street. If you have problems with wanting a clean bathroom there's one in the Museum (near the bicycle parking area. A bit of a walk if you're around the north area. Might as well spend the whole day walking around if you love a good walk as much as I do.  "
Traditional house,"In this street you can see the traditional house of South Korea, be quiet in this street because of private area"
Korea Traditional,"It is said that Mandarines in pre-modern days dwelled here. Surprised to know that traditional dwelling were still kept in the area that is very close to the center of Seoul.Location is convenient,only taking subway for 5-10 minutes from the City Hall or Seoul Station, even though transtion of subway is required.Area in itself is not so big. had little steep ways.There had Constitutional Tribunal besides the area.Some shops held splashy signs before the facade, which broke atomosphere.When I went, other visitors are not so many, so I was able to walk around with keeping my pace.One house that seemed to have got renovation for exhibiting for visitors,where I entered and walked around inside, saw many traditional Korean daily items, which I did not know how to say, as pots for Kimchi cooking and traditional Korean style heater."
A Nice time to try Hanbok,Fully immerse yourself with the preserved houses by dressing up with a hanbok. Just be sure to be quiet and to not knock on the houses as they are privately owned as well
Walk Through History,"Walking the narrow winding streets flowing up and down the hills is like being in a time machine. It's not a museum, people do still like in there. You can visit some of the homes or check out local shops and restaurants. Great vistas from the streets in both daylight and night time. While in Seoul, If you can visit the Bukchon area!"
Really pretty but nothing exceptional,"The Bukchon village is really pretty. However I wouldn't get carried away. It's a small area, it's a very organized tourist experience and everything there is expensive."
A must visit!,"It is a village with traditional Korean homes, or known as HANOK. There are 8 photo spots to look for. However you can still take photos anywhere and everywhere. To go here take a subway to Anguk Station (Line 3) and go out from Exit No 2."
K-drama feels,"If you're a fan of K-dramas, you will definitely feel like one of the characters here. It's one of those scene where they climb up the hill going home or something like that (Haha!) You'll be able to go into one of the houses and see what it looks like on the inside. You'll also see people wearing the traditional Hanbok."
Just a few streets to look at,"Unlike some entire cities that you visit (think Rome or maybe Krakow) that are filled from pavement to the sky with historical sights, you'll get at best a few streets to visit. So not really immersive nor impressive. And because there's not much to see, you'll be sharing it with hundreds of selfies sticks, like medieval standards, waving through the air. It's primarily a residential with a few shops and you'll see some nice house frontage and cobbled roofs - a couple of streets are nice photo ops. "
Cultural Experience,"Great place to observe the palace from behind the walls. Its a long walk/trail about 60 minutes to complete the different observable areas or landmarks. A few up slopes and down slopes. The place also houses museums, hands-on workshops. On top of that, quaint souvenir shops and cafes and eating outlets. You can get the map from the tourist information centre in the area. The observant point is quite breathtaking.Be sure to be quiet as you walk with your friends or families as it is a residential area. You won't want to disturb the residences there. "
Lovely houses to view.,"This area was amazing to me in America we don't have whole neighborhoods that are 500 years old. I didn't feel bad because there are many signs telling you to be quite people love here, so don't take your LOUD friends. ;) "
Quaint and traditional,Worth the time exploring this quaint and serene village. The houses were unique and the scenics were picturesque. Plenty of tourists as you would expect but there are enough spaces to take the perfect photo. A must-go if you are in Seoul!
Nice morning walk in a traditional village,"We spent about 2 hours exploring the Bukchon village. As there are residents staying inside, we have to keep our noise level to a minimum. There are quite a few streets that are more traditional than the rest. I just hope that the new building are not invading the old style buiding structure further, else this village is not going to retain its tradtional images."
My favorite place from our trip,"I love the architecture, and what's more fascinating is that there are people still living there! There are a couple houses that are set up for tourists and you can pay to go in for some special activities. I also saw a house that is available for homestay."
Explore the Hanok,Exploring the Korean traditional houses up the hill. It's an easy walk with interesting views at all angle.Try the fried tteokbokki too.
Good experience ,An hour walk in this area is sufficient. You can enjoy the beautiful architecture of houses. Will definitely stay in one of the guest houses here in my next visit to Seoul. 
Quaint!,"Love the old traditional houses and tiny alley ways. And with little quaint shops peppered all over with good cafes and eateries, it is indeed time well spent on a cold afternoon. "
Worth to visit ,There are quite a few of traditional Hanok spread across the streets. All are very unique and quite well maintained.Quite a pleasant walk along these streets even in cold weather.
Bukchon village,If you are going to this place just to take photos. I will advise you to find the actual locations of the spot that you planned to have your photos taken. I went to this place twice in my trip and I spent hours running up nad down to find the 'right' spot.Please be prepare to trek the uphills
Tranquil and classy,"We stayed on one of these traditional houses that was converted into a hotel/homestay. Really lovely experience to be in such a cosy home. The owner was very helpful and upgraded us to a room that had an adjoining toilet. My family of five slept comfortably in the two rooms even though they were kind of small. The village or area itself is quiet and is a great place with quaint little shops selling souvenirs, clothes, Jewellery. They aren't tacky shops but are shops that sell affordable local brands. Most of the shops are located along two main roads but you won't find it as busy or crowded as Myeongdong which is another experience of its own. So while most tourists spend an afternoon walking and looking and the old houses, this was actually a nice refuge and charming place to spend a a couple of days at. We really enjoyed the cafes and interesting shops that we could take our time with and not be hassled by crowds. From here we could venture to Insadong which was nearby."
Not really,Actually this village wasn't what I expected. I didn't see anything really exciting about this place. I do not recommend 
"Well preserved historic neighbourhood, great place for a stroll",A rare example of historic Hanok house architecture in Seoul. It's a great area to stroll around. What's great about the area as well is that it's not completely overrun by tourists - there is still a real neighbourhood feel to the place.
Houses with lots of characteristics,"We strolled Bukchon and saw many houses with characters. Some are shops and some are residences. We went inside a few shops partly for souvenir and partly to just look at those houses.Due to the high volume of tourists, there were often local people held up signs to ask tourists to be quiet. "
Traditional Korean village,"Really worthwhile to visit and to combine with other visits to local palaces and the Insadong shopping area. You can start with this village and continue to the palaces on walking distance, then end at Insadong."
A residential area with a taste of old Korea,"Bukchon is just a residential area with a taste of old Korea and most of the houses were locked and closed when we visited there. Need to walk for 20-30 mins along the wall of Gyeongbukgung palace before reaching Buckhon. Do take bus or other transport to reach Bukchon. Honestly, nothing much in Buckhon and should be able to complete the area by 1 hour."
Old neighborhood,"There is a good amount of exercise involved- narrow alleyways, very steep slope and stairs. A good time to go would be in the afternoon. At the bottom there are a few shops and boutique stores. Dolls wearing traditional Korean dresses also found here."
Beautiful old Korea,"This district is very nice if you know where you're going, or if you have time to explore. It's not huge, but you might be disappointed. There is a famous street there, though, so make sure you see that one at least. The street goes uphill/downhill depending on where you are. Sometimes there are so many tourists there, so it might get a bit annoying. Bukchon is a walking distance from Gyeongbokgung palace (did I spell that right?). Also, sometimes people offer to let you inside one of their old houses there and give you a tour for a price. In my opinion, Bukchon is a must-see in Seoul. Not overwhelmingly fun, but just beautiful."
A little overrated but worth the visit.,"The road below the Bukchon Hanok Village had clusters of private galleries, cafes and shops which makes it fun to explore and just have a cuppa in. To get to the village - follow the brown signs and be prepared to climb up a steep flight of stairs. Once there - just walk freely and you will eventually come across the popular slope where people like to take photos in. There are free maps along the roads so just grab one and explore on. "
Terrific Small cottages full of history,I absolutely loved wandering the winding ways around this neighborhood. Quaint and delightful. Fun to walk about exploring. Caution to be quiet and respectful--this is someone' home!
Beautiful area to walk around,"This area has rows and rows of houses that are in traditional Korean style. There are signs that post recommended paths to walk through. It is residential area with people who still live in the houses, so being quiet is a must. Very nice views from the higher streets. Many of the streets are fairly steep, but it's not extremely strenuous once you get to the top area and walk back down. There are a few smaller boutique style stores near the bottom area, some small eateries, and some small souvenir shops. There are also some cultural buildings that are open to walk around in and some paid activities to do, such as wearing era appropriate costumes or making little trinkets to take home. Nice way to spend some time walking around. Beautiful views from the top and great architecture you won't find anywhere else."
Worth seeing and walking around,"These houses are being built in the middle ages and they are still in use. Beautiful. Nice boutiques and restaurants, little corner shops."
Nice walking area,"This is a nice area with some old style korean houses, with lots of caffes, small resturants, souvenirs and art. On the start in the tourist center take a map with the route to follow, helps not to get lost. It is quite a walk and you go high up with some stipe areas, to make the full round. Ideal for nice sunny weather. You can combine it with a visit to one of the two main palaces as you start / end close to them.Overall cc 1-2 hour is enough for attraction."
Beautifuel quaint village inside a modern metropolis,Loved the houses and how simply they are constructed. Felt like a trip back in time. Quiet in inhabited and so respect the neighborhood
Local house,Good place for photoshoot... but sometimes theres alot of visitor and its hard to take a good photo...
Great walk!,Nice walking around a traditional village with fantastic views over the city. Found many places you can rent the traditional clothing if you was with your wife so I would recommend this. Just respect locals by keeping the noise down as it is a residential area :)
A place for those interested in the past,A very beautiful place that presents the old architecture. Don't miss the artist-name difficult to remember- who has wonderful collection of his paintings-the swans and horses ; a few to remember.The people who live there even now get the credit of maintaining the past so meticulously. A wonderful place.
Be prepared to walk ,"Lots of walking here. It is actually a residential area and do keep silence around the houses. If you have the time, you can stop by the cafes or stay a night in the guest houses, which is pretty expensive as told by our guide. But it would be nice to experience living in hanbok. "
Old school Seoul - but too crowded with tourists,Love this place and its old school houses and the quaint of the surrounding. Good for a late afternoon walk which I did - but suggest for you to go early in the morning if you prefer quieter moment with less of a crowd and people appearing in your pictures from time to time. If you don't mind people appearing in your pictures then you can go anytime. But just 1-2 hours in this place should suffice. It's quite a small area I feel. :)
2nd best place to visit in Seoul!,"Bukchon is the ""old town"" of Seoul. It has preserved much of olden day Korea. From the nameless streets, to the grand doors and the old school Korean houses this neighborhood is legit. "
Traditional Korean houses,A charming place to visit and experience walking through traditional Korean houses in the neighbourhood but also very touristy. Do take note that this is a residential area so keep your volume down!
An area of old houses,"I would probably put this area near the middle or bottom of your list for places in Seoul. Yes, there are some nice old houses in a residential area lined with very narrow streets. The houses are on a hill so there are some nice views available, but it may require that you have a prerequisite good health to walk the hills. And because it is a residential area, there are numerous signs and people (dressed in traditional Korean garb) standing with signs asking tourists to keep their voices down.There are also some restaurants and shops on the outskirts which provide some shopping opportunities.However, the area really doesn't warrant a must-see status..."
A walk through time.,"The Bukchon neighborhood is a preservation of an old traditional Korean village. Bukchon is located in the north side between Cheonggyecheon and Jongmyo, hence the name Bukchon, which means the north village. You walk through alleyways that have these beautiful homes. I stopped at each house and looked at the beautiful architecture of the roof tops and the intricate carvings on the doors and walls. While we were walking we came across a home where a lovely young lady was waiting outside, eager to show us the house from the inside. The owners were away and allowed for their house to be shown. We gladly took the opportunity and paid her the 15,000 Korean Won ($12) per person for the tour. This was our chance to look at a traditional home from the inside. The huge door opened into a serene garden with bonsai trees and a little pond. Inside the house there was very little furniture but tranquility filled each room. I was thinking that clutter is what causes us so much stress but here there was none in this beautiful, serene, home. Note to self, get rid of clutter! At the end of the tour we were offered some homemade plum tea which we sipped while we gazed at the garden outside. Rejuvenated, we wandered about through the lanes and admired more houses from the outside. The Bukchon area is a ""must see"" and the bonus is that it it is within walking distance of the Gyeongbokgung Palace and the most famous shopping area of Insadong. The trick is to go to the tourist information center and get a good walking map because it is a bit tricky to find Bukchon. The area is also home to many small restaurants and coffee shops.  "
nice place nice people,"i went to this place with my friends at summer holiday, we waste some times to find this place because it is not very easy to find, so i suggest people should find some information from internet. I think the view is good and those building is special. There are so many stores which can rent some korea traditional clothing for people to take photo, but you should decide it carefuly, because some of it is expensive. We can feel the korea culture and the history at this place. We chage our clothes to korea traditional clothing and take a lot of photos at this place, the korea traditional clothing are very match with that environment. we feel like we are back in the korea old time, the feeling is interesting."
Little streets of heritage houses,"Bukchon Village is still a residential area and despite signs asking people to be quiet, many inconsiderate tourists still natter on at the top of their voices. Otherwise a quaint area with many houses still boasting the wooden beams and eaves that mark the architecture of a past era. A little bit of a hike through the hilly streets. Good to start with this before heading to Insadong"
หมู่บ้านวัฒนธรรม The cultural village,เป็นหมู่บ้านวัฒนธรรม ที่ยังคงรักษาสภาพอาคาร บ้านเรือน ในแบบดั้งเดิมไว้ได้อย่างดี สวยงาม มีจุดถ่ายภาพมากมาย เดินไกลนิด เหนื่อยหน่อย แต่ก็คุ้มThis is the cultural village that remain old style and beautiful. Although it's a long way for walking but valuable for photographer and most visitor.
Get a good pair of shoes!,"Yes, I found the place after walking around trying to find a road that went all the way up to the top of a hill. If you embark on this trail, you've better get a good pair of shoes, since this area is sort of hilly. The rooftops are as seen in many postcards. You can have a glance of the rooftops by visiting one of the houses that offer ""a good view"" for a drink, as I did since it was a drizzly day. The decorated doors are gorgeous. Many locals wearing traditional costumes also visit this area. "
Really Charming Korean Traditional Village,"Absolutely love it! A must place to go. As an architect, I really appreciate the traditional style of buildings which were built to perfection."
Good stroll to see the historic homes and neighborhood layout,Definitely pick up a map before you start that identifies the walking route. It's worth it. My highlight was when I stepped into the doll maker's house and was worth it to see her craft. I even bought three of her dolls since they were very reasonably priced. Every piece was unique. 
a unique enclave of Korean tradition 북촌한옥마을,"A top-10 must visit in Seoul, we visited it just after exploring nearby Insadong. Not quite a “Village” per sey, more a neighbhood area which houses 900 plus Hanoks or traditionally houses. Bukchon means 'northern village"", and some of these residence blocks are actually centuries-old of the Joseon Dynasty!Surrounded by a few very busy traffic streets the premise is quaint and picturesque, and surprisingly well integrated with its neighnourhood. It is modern meets traditional houses-architecture! Some of the Hanoks are still resident occupied while others were converted into chic galleries, restaurants, cafés and accessory shops. There are signs that remind all that being a residential area, one should not make excessive din. This area is visited by many tourists and you can see plenty of people donning the traditional costumes walking around taking photos (you can rent them ..). We stopped by the Bukchon Tourist Centre to check out more details of the area. There is also the Traditional Craft Experience Centre where host aa variety of cultural programs and activities. A rare opportunity for one to experience and immerse in Korean traditional culture indeed.We read from a blogger that there are actually “8 photo spots” where you can take the best pictures with the most picturesque background. We tried and found 3!! You should also. We thoroughly enjoy the meandering walk through Bukchon Hanok many small alleys and streets. Just note that it is on a slight hill so could be taxing for some. Remember to also walk to the top of the hill and take a stunning view of Seoul too.Throw away your maps and get literally “lost” in the charms of traditional hanok. Thoroughly enjoyable and experiential trip for me & wifey. We spent close to 3 hours before leaving via Line 3 Anguk Station."
Only place in Seoul to see traditional Korean housing,"This is a must see area to get a feel for how beautiful the Korean housing was in the era before then concrete and steel apartment building. It is easy to get to, is very walkable (although hilly) and has nice local shops with crafts and food. It has become popular with Chinese tour groups so best to go during the week vs, weekends."
"Charming Bukchon, old city neighborhood in Seoul, South Korea","The visit to this neighborhood was suggested by the visitor center. It has several small streets, old houses, and shops. It quite touristy and well kept. There are many food and souvenirs shopping options.There are a few employees of the visitor center who are in one of the streets and speak a little English. They will be able to give you information and directions. We needed to go to the shrine and they helped suggesting the quickest route to it."
Korean cultural village,Requires lots of walking up hills and downhills. Not suitable for elderly or children. The view is not bad. Visitors should wear proper shoes for this attraction. Sports shoes is highly recommended.
Short walks around Buchon,Walks here from my Hotel (Ibis Ambassador Insadong) only 15minutes. Went to information and asked about the location n maps around. Really like the old houses and salutes for korean that they still keep it and do the good maintenances to every houses. Wish to stay in one of the guest houses or hanok stay. Met some cute cafes along the alley and good pasta restaurant too can't took a good pic around the hanok since i went there in day time and so many people around. Recommended to come early in the morning to get a good pic
Quick Stop for photo-ops,"This is Just an alley to take good photos of the traditional Hanok village in Korea. Hanbok rental are also available for 10,000 krw. This is a beautiful place to Visit, You just have to be quiet because this is a residential area. Bukchon is 5-10 minutes walk to anguk station. Visit this place at Around 8-9AM because Group/bus of tourists usually arrives after this hour which makes it a little bit crowded."
Tasty fried pork and shrimp mundu,"A small restaurant located on a narrow side street of Insadong and one of our favorite place for lunch. Seemed like the dumplings, especially the shrimp dumpling, shrunk in size since our last 2 visits but they were still crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Beside the dumplings, the next best tasting dish was their kimchee. It was fresh tasting, not extremely spicy, and the saltiness of the cabbage was perfect to the taste. There were others eating cold and hot noodles which I would like to try on our next visit."
So nice,"We went there by accident and found out that it's one of attractions once we've been there.Amazing architecture, tiny, steep streets, beautiful roofing, wooden gates and little walls surrounding each house.We found one house open to a public free of charge. You really need to see this."
Low key and small,Very subdued old neighborhood where you can still see what Seoul used to look like before modernization. Takes about an hour to walk through it. It's nothing spectacular but a convenient location to add to your list of sightseeing if you're visiting the palaces nearby.
A great place to visit within residential area,"It is a great place to stroll if you want to know the Korean house that is actually with people living inside. It has a lot of walkings to do and the area is flooded with tourists in rented hanbok, so it makes you difficult to take some good photos as every corner you will bump into people."
don't skip the hanok museum,whatever your time constraint is please do not skip the hanok museum because it is as close as you can get to see how it looks like on the inside. unless you have the budget to book a hanok during your stay in seoul that is. otherwise this museum gives you a great detailed explainations of the hanok. the restaurants nearby here are good too.
Between ancient and modern korea,the hundreds year old houses nicely retained and still inhabitant. make sure be quiet and be polite while taking photo. Of cause surrounded by souvenir shops and cafe for tourists. 
Hanok experience,"Rented hanok & walk around the village. Makes you felt like a Korean. Hanok give us an impression it is heavy but after experiencing, weighted much more lighter than expected. Mistaken as Korean & had some pictures taken with other tourists. "
Nice stroll through restored hanok houses,Walking through Bukchon Village is a great experience. You will get to see many different Hanok houses that have been restored as well as getting stunning views of both the Gyeongbokgung and Changdeokgung palaces. End the visit climbing down the stone staircase into Samcheong dong.
"Beautiful, Worth of walk","Visit Bukchon, Hanok village require a lot of walk, but the old style houses are very beautiful, you must come walk a afternoon when you visit Seoul!"
Very nice little village,Absolutely enjoyed the walk in this small village.. there were a lot of people and we were lucky enough that it was hanbok festival so there were plenty of people in hanbok.. This is a must visit and i recommend that you try to go on the hanbok festival..
Interesting Village,We had a wonderful time exploring this village! Quaint & insightful. Highly recommended. Will come back again!
Great neighbourhood to walk round!,"I took the metro to Anguk and took exit 2. Heading up the road there are some quaint side streets and coffee shops/cafes that align the road. I managed to pick up a free guide of the area from a stand that had a useful map and a basic route that allows you to circle round the area going up hill area to the main area where the streets are lined with traditional Hanok houses.It's good to take your time and enjoy the area generally. The walk up the hill isn't too onerous and there are plenty of opportunities to take photos. There are quite a lot of people wandering around seeing the houses so be patient if you want to take photos as most people walk along the same route. As the houses are actual residences there are many signs asking people to not be too loud and be respectful. Some houses were open for visitors for a fee however I didn't take that option.The route down from the hill also presents itself with many opportunities for those who like to shop. There are also a large number of quaint and traditional looking tea houses plus the more modern coffee houses so take you time, wander the streets and sit down for a drink if you want to rest up!"
Fantastic area to visit and stay in Seoul,This area is fantastic to wander around in. The village is nice to see and there are many great little shops and quaint cafes.We stayed one night and liked it so much we changed our hotel booking to stay another night. Definitely try staying in a traditional hanok for the night!
Fantastic architectures..,"Very unique design of hanoks.. and there are also boutiques for sourv. And local foods to taste.. there are also ""points to see"" for good scenenaries of bukchon.."
Korean Traditional Village,Beautiful Korean traditional house. Walking distance from Insadong. Uphill location so be prepared to walk. Must see place.
"Interesting but for us, it wasn't as interesting as we expected","It is fun to stroll through the narrow streets and see the numerous old hanok houses. It was fairly crowded with tourists, both Korean and others. We especially enjoyed seeing the many local people dressed in traditional Korean clothing who come here to be photographed. "
Nice architectural ,It's eye opener to walk along the bukchon street. Basically it's a mix of commercial and residential. The architecture of the houses are very unique. There were even guest houses in this area. Very interesting place. 
A taste of Korean Lifestyle and House,Walking through the streets of Bukchon will give one an insights into the culture of Koreans. The traditional houses and streets that are still homes to Koreans makes it an interesting experience for tourist. 
Traditional Korean houses,The area used to be a quiet residential area with traditional Korean houses but then became a main tourist attraction that was always overcrowded with visitors. It was full of people when we went there in late afternoon. Some men holding signs that reminded tourists to keep quiet were found in various spots where most people gathered and took pictures. We followed the crowd to walk uphill for about 20 minutes and found a side street where most Korean houses were located. Warning was found on the main door of some houses stating that no pictures were allowed. I felt sorry for the residents there but it was really the best place to see the real traditional Korean houses.
interesting and good views,perched in the hills this area is quieter than insadong but more intersting cafes ( traditional style)
Nice,"It's a very nice place especially if you wanted to see some filming locations, and old houses. We went in here for a morning walk and it was great, there were also travel guide posts during that time which helped us find our way"
Good for a couple of hours stroll,"A nice place to take a stroll and view the traditional Korean houses. The area is much smaller than expected, but do be prepared for a lot China tourists with cameras.You can get an area map from the Tourist Information Booth along the main road."
Quaint streets with pretty hanoks,Very pretty street with loads of quaint cafes and shops along the way. A must visit when you are in Seoul! 
Must go to for the Historical feel,"I was amazed by the beautiful old Korean houses in this small village. This is a famous tourist attraction so there were a lot of people. This is an uphill location so prepare yourself in walking with some effort going up and down. Don't worry if you get hungry, there are food places located in the village or you can go to, just a few blocks away, Insadong, another famous tourist shopping destination."
Disappointed,"This part/place was recommended by friends, but when we went there it was truly underwhelming at best. The two different areas are lined with traditional houses (Hanoak), but the area is not well marked, and many of these ""homes"" are commercial B&B/AirBB, tea house, etc. Still, it's a worth a visit just to walk around and take some pictures. "
Nice little village,It's a bit of an uphill walk coming from samcheongdong. It's a very small village with hanok style houses. A bit of Korean culture in the metropolis.
Very nice place but please keep the Volumes down.,Very nice houses around. Many handicraft shops and cafe around. Very relaxing place. There will be people there to make sure tourist to keep the volumes down as not to disturb the people staying there. Very nice experience and culture exposure. Very traditional place.
Bukchon is a must! ,Very nice and quaint area in Seoul. You will see locals walking around in their national costume. It's filled with unique shops which offer Korean products. Great places to eat or just to have dessert. 
Wandering aimlessly & delightfully,A bit overloaded with tourists-nonetheless quaint! It really doesn't photograph well-not sure why! Lots of coffee shops(coffee v expensive in Korea & weekly American!) to laze in-often with no nibbles! And craft shops & workshops where you can drop in for an hour and play
Awesome Area,"I recently visited Seoul with my husband and 4 month old baby. We stayed in a traditional hanok in the Bukchon area on our first night and loved it so much we cancelled our accommodation closer to town and stayed on in an airbnb. Loved the area, great cafes, restaurants, galleries and shops. Easy to walk to streets, easy access to the palaces and also the subway for anywhere else. Would highly recommend. "
Lovely place,Beautiful old buildings not far away from the big scyscrapers quite unusual combination. You can stroll on and quietly admire the old Seoul not paying for it. Its very close to the two biggest palaces so it may be an idea to combine these 3 things together in one day trip.
Nothing interesting,"The place is a residential area. Nothing new and interesting to see. Going up the street is very tiring because it's hilly and you won't see anything extra ordinary at all. However, the shops along the street, going to Bukchon, is pretty nice. That's where we bought and sent postcards for ourselves back home. =)"
Nice traditional scaled neighbourhood,"I did a self-guided walk, having picked up a may fro the local TI storefront. It was an enjoyable afternoon and was a nice reprieve from the hustle and bustle of central Seoul."
Please be quiet when you are there,It's a nice quaint place. Lots of walking. Uphill and downhill. Wear something comfy. Please be quiet as it is a residential place. Too many tourists who are quite rowdy and loud. Feel sorry for the residence there.
Absolutely lovely architecture in a quaint neighborhood,"Once you get to this area, just start following the signs and climb the stairs to get to the beautiful traditional Korean homes. This is a neighborhood of many private homes admidst modern day Seoul. There is one particular spot where you can take a pic of the traditional homes in the foreground and the skyscrapers and the N Seoul tower in the background.Tip: on the weekend, many Koreans dress in traditional garb and use this area as a backdrop for their pictures. So, you get a bonus having them in your own pictures!!"
Piece of the past in the modern city,Nice area in historical part of the city with old fashion/traditional style Korean houses. There is suppose to be several highlighted view points but streets looks very similar and i am still not sure if we actually found the right spots. Can be crowded with tourist (in this case just check the parallel streets). Anyway it is worth to see it once you are next to the palaces. Btw it is not a museum and people are still leaving there.
Pretty but too crowded,"Tons of tourists rent hanboks and run around taking their photos. So it was full of Chinese tourists who were eager for their photo ops. They didn't care too much if you were standing around waiting for them to move on, so you need to be a bit assertive if you want your own picture. Nonetheless it was nice that they did have some businesses opened to teach you about their culture and crafts. It was also awesome that the red uniform friendly welcome team were nearby to give directions. It saved me from walking straight up the hill to nowhere. Although the climb was steep, to finally walk down on the other side into Samcheong Dong, it was rewarding to find tons of cute cafes and churros stores at the bottom of the hill. The churro/ice cream was welcoming. I'd go again, not in 30 degrees weather, and hopefully not during Korea Fest month (open mad tourist season)."
Disappointed,"The houses are now residences so tourists are advised to stay silent while walking through the village. There's nothing to see but old wooden doors and walls. We cant even see what a typical old house looked like inside. There were some quaint artshops and cafes but other than that, nothing special. They had lots of volunteer tour guides who will help you find your way."
