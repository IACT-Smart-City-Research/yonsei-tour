An interesting experience to Goyang Aqua Planet,"One of the largest convergence aquarium in South Korea. There are 3 levels in Aqua Planet which consists of sea creatures such as jellyfish, and zoo animals such as sand tiger sharks, beavers, otters and penguins. Visitors can enjoy marine ecosystem and learn the importance of ecosystem preservation. Suitable for family (with children), friends and those who enjoy viewing marine mammals."
Lovely Aquarium,"Well decorated aquarium. I love the jellyfish section!I'm surprised because it has walrus. I watched the walrus show entirely and it amazed me. Fun fact : In Korean, it is called Sea Elephant considering the similarity between two and the size."
Bring earplugs!,"Because i was staying a full week in Seoul i decided to spent a few hours in a aquarium and/or zoo. The place has some very nice exhibits. Especially the jellyfish section is beautiful. Though the place has also animals with too small exhibits. The exhibit for the sand tiger sharks, green sea turtle, walrus's and jaguar for example are far too small. They also try to make the exhibits look natural. At some parts they did a very good job. At other places they just totally failed. For example... close to the penguin exhibit you are explained about plastic getting into the water and the ocean. It is a bad thing. We probably all agree. Then after the penguin exhibits are some aquarium tanks with fishes and plastic Playmobil crap. Not natural, not beautiful and plastic. Then another thing. Bring earplugs! Might sounds funny but i am dead serious about this. This place if filled up with schoolclasses of non-behaving children and non-behaving teachers. All screaming loud, banging on the windows and pushing you aside. Together with some places they have presentations and/or shows the noise is just too much and i left the place with a beeping sound in my ear. I noticed at some places the animals as well were stressed out by the noise. The otters where stressed as well as the amazone parrots. My critics besides; The aquarium and zoo is not really bad and does needs improvement on parts but you will enjoy it."
Very large aquarium in Korea that is nor far from Seoul,"Hanwha Aqua Planet Ilsan is a very large aquarium in Korea that is nor far from Seoul. You can visit by subway easily. There are 3 zone, eg. aquarium, forest, and sky zoo. If you walk for 3 mins, you can reach Onemount Snow Park & Water Park which is located nearby ... another building."
Aquarium,"Nice tourist attraction. The aquarium has the most beautiful creatures from jelly fish, to penguins, to even the walrus waving!"
Great visit,"From Myeongdong area going to ilsan took sometime in the train but the journey was worth it. I've always been a huge aquarium person and we had some time to spare before leaving Seoul and this aquarium really wrapped up a fantastic Seoul journey! It's obvious that the surrounding area is still under development so it's still new and shiny, and not as busy when we went. There's 3 levels to explore consisting not only marine life but also wild life like jaguars, lemurs, rabbits etc. I hear there's also a section where you can find a little farm upstairs but we didn't end up going since we were already tired. Do keep in mind a lot of information is in Korean (the info about different animals are in both KOR and ENG which was very useful, rather things like which direction to go and construction notices etc are all in Korean) and being an aquarium, there are a lot of kids. "
Wonders of the sea,"Aqua Planet Ilsan is a relatively new aquarium. Initially, we thought that since this is just another aquarium, we would not be spending too much time in it. How wrong were we! Even while walking ""fast"", we took two hours just to cover the whole aquarium.We saw numerous sea creatures which were unique and interesting like the garden eel but the most exciting part of the exhibits were the various kinds of jellyfish, most of which we have never seen before. It was simply mesmerising.There was an open air mini zoo which you could feed animals such as lambs and rabbits. The feed is sold via a vending machine.Other animals that you could view include sand tiger shark, beavers, otters and penguins. There are also jaguars in the Jungle section.We got there via a Jumbo Taxi which could accomodate 7 of us. We got the Seoul Tourist Information to book the taxi for us for the trip to Ilsan. From Itaewon (where we were staying) to Ilsan, the fare was about 60k won. Alternatively, you could also reach there via the subway.All in all, whether you are a child or an adult, you would definitely enjoy a visit to the Aqua Planet Ilsan."
