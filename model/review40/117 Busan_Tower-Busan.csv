Great views but dirty windows,It has great views from the top but the windows are very dirty so basically you can’t take any photos 
Amazing views ,"Went up here during the night time and was overwhelmed by the view. You have the view of the harbour bridge which looks amazing at night and after your done with the view, you take the elevator to level 4 and you enter rooms that are fun to take pictures in. "
Visit at night,"Went here at night and glad we did. There was a lovely light show on the tower building which we watched from below before going up. There are escalators and steps to reach the tower, then a lift inside. Views were good but a really fun event is after you leave the lift at the bottom. You wander through an art show with a difference! Go visit."
Observation Deck,Great observation deck to observe the landscape below the deck. Observing is easily done from the deck. 
Good view but nothing spectacular,"You get an entire view of Busan which is great but it's quite a small space and the gift shop takes up most of the area. There is only one elevator going up and one going down. There was a large school group which delayed everything.The Twosome coffee shop nearby is worth a visit. Large, relaxing, and comfortable area."
Nothing outstanding,"Having been to many towers around the world this one was fairly average. Nice views across Busan but nothing particularly memorable or special. Best part were the photo opportunities on the way out where you can sit on a sign of Busan, among sky scrapers or even in the moon!"
Great View,"The Busan Tower offers a great view over the city, both to the sea and the mountains. There’s multiple ways to access the tower. The best way is from the city from the shopping street. Take the escalators up which are covered in case of rain or heat. "
Cool Neighborhood,"Busan tower is in a nice plaza at the top of some stairs. Depending on your access point the stairway might be electric or not. We arrived around sunset and were able to enjoy the video projection showed on the Busan Tower façade twice (same repertoire without variation).There were love padlocks (same concept as Seoul tower, but on a lower scale).The restaurants around the area cater to tourists as the inflated prices show.Nevertheless, I enjoyed this neighborhood with its artificial waterfalls and the tower stands-out at night."
Nice views,"Make your way from BIFF square heading towards Lotte Mall and you will come across escalators heading up to Yongdusan park where the tower is located. On our visit, there weren't too many people so it was straight up. There is the usual tourist trap of photo taken at the entrance and then tying to get you to buy. Tip: at the bottom of the tower on your exit there are plenty of photo ops including a ""Busan tower"" shot! Another tip is: don't head down the steps/escalators the way you came up. Instead head towards the west exit where you will come out very close to a temple. It's a nice peaceful respite away from the chaos of the shopping precinct. "
Touring South Korea,"Touring of Busan Tower and surroundings are a must see if you are in the area. It’s worth the the challenge of the staircases (looks like stairway to heaven), but not to worry there are escalators as well. It was good that we have just finished a very filling lunch at the famous fish market, because we got to burn off the extra calories. We walked by the famous Busan film festival location in the town center, as well as and other attractions on the grounds of the Tower. The view was spectacular, and there were periods pieces of furniture and miniature replicas of Busan of the pass inside the Tower. We had a fun time posing for keepsake pictures in the designated locations and our guide Grace took many group pictures for us. I reallly really loved Busan and its rich history. You will love too. See some pics below. "
Wow,"Fabulous!!!!!!Loved Busan, polite people, easy to get around by yourself. Highly recommend anyone who loves Asia to give it a try."
Lots of Surprises! ,"Initially we do not have much expectation when visiting this attraction. After the visit, we will so happy that we did it. The garden at the entrance was majestic, the view from the top was epic and the Instagram worthy backdrops were totally fun and amazing. "
"Busan Tower, highly recommended !!","A visit to the Nampo-dong and Gwangbok districts is not complete without climbing the only 69-meter-high Busan Tower, which, however, reaches up to 120 meters above sea level through the hill on which it is built. The pedestrian access is at the Gwangbok-ro, where a number of roller / and regular staircases take visitors through various shops to the ticket counters. The entrance is Won 8000 per adult person, after which a lift gives access to the top observatory deck with its beautiful view. A staircase then leads down to the lower observatory deck, from where a lift takes the visitor down to the exit route, which is unexpected and surprising for young and old."
Iconic Tower,You can see it from many places in Busan. Went there because of it just behind our hotel. there's a hanbok shop there and you can take some pictures around the park
Great place to see Busan from up high,"This is a really cool place to visit, it is a paradise away from the city below, the view is stunning and very clean. "
Breathtaking view on a sunny day,"Definitely visit! But on a sunny day. The view is astounding. You can do Busan Tower, Busan Modern History Museum, Gukje Market and Jagalchi Market all in one day. "
Good views (as you would expect),Good way to see Busan from a high place. No waiting for the elevator up or down. Not too crowded. Small viewing area with no seating. Reasonable entry price. 
great sight,"a little bit expensive but great sightseen, 360° angle the visit of the tower top can be done within 30 minutes"
360 view ,Lovely place to get a nice 360 degree view of Busan. It is not too expensive. There is nice activities to do after the visite. Really worth it
360 views of the city,"It is a close walk from the Nampo subway stop. From exit take your first right and walk straight ahead, you will see a covered escalator that takes you up the hill to the Busan Tower. The Tower is located in a park. The entrance fee is reasonable, and lines are not too long. The elevator takes you up, and to take the elevator back down you must walk down one level. There is a gift shop at the top as well as at the entrance. Bilingual and friendly staff."
Spectacular Views at Busan Tower,"Head up to Busan tower if you’re interested in seeing spectacular 360 views of the city. The tower sits on top of a large park, and the cost to ride to the top is the equivalent of $10 USD. Busan is HUGE, and you can really get a good idea of just how far it spreads throughout the mountains from the top. If you’re prone to motion sickness, close your eyes, or avoid the screen on the ceiling of the elevator on the ride up. It’s a short, fast ride, and might make a small percentage of the population woozy. Once you’re at the top, you have stunning views of the city, a few photo ops to sit on the edge of the window, and a small gift shop at the top. Once you’re ready, take the elevator down, and there’s a fun surprise on our way out!"
"Great perspective, bummer weather!","This is a great location to see all of Busan, just make sure the weather is working for you! We were with a tour group and had to go on a rainy day. While we still enjoyed it, make sure it’s a nice clear day."
It’s so so,"It’s a small tower with old structures. Its good to take a quick stop, fresh atmosphere. nothing is so special "
Adorable,"I love the view I could get on the top of tower. Kind people working there, nice english, easy to get there."
Surprise at exit,Was expecting the panoramic views of course but was surprised on exiting lift at base that a few more photo ops were afforded.We walked up the long way unwittingly. Actually the easiest way up is by escalators on the main Gwangbokdong Shoppin street.
Where people gather!,"When we visited Busan Tower in the afternoon, there was a martial art show and performance. Great views of Busan city from the Tower. "
Great views,The tower is situated in a park. Pay for your ticket and get whizzed up in the lift to the viewing platform. The views are great. It wasn’t too busy. There’s a shop up there (also one outside the main entrance). Do the game which requires you to pose - we got a free beer and also a free ticket to Seoul Tower! The experience was really good.
highland city view,"unforgettable scenery , there are general statue , busan tower , flower clock and joging track and giant bell "
Not really a must-see actually,You don't have to go for the view actually. There are a lot of other places where you can see it in Busan. The colored buildings are nice though. You can have a photoshoot and buy it for 10k. That was nice
Worth it for the views,We really enjoyed spending time in the park and decided to go to the top of the tower for the views. We enjoyed the extras on the way down. Worth the money.
Nice view on the city,"The tower looks tiny compared to many of the other buildings in the city, so we didn't expect much of it. But the view was actually quite nice. The sky was clear so we could see pretty far. When you take the elevator down there is a kind of exposition right when you leave the elevator, and I think that was the nicest part of the Busan Tower visit."
Unique Tower,Busan Tower is definitely the city’s major landmark located in .Yongdusan Park .The park’s history dates back to the Korean War when many Koreans took refuge in Busan. Great area to relax and enjoy 
"Bird,s eye view","Reached by a long series of escalators from the shopping area, (over 200 steps to go back down), the tower, set in a pleasant park provides an orientation of the city. Not spectacular on a cloudy day, but worth an hour of your time.The gift shop has the usual souvenirs plus some nice handmade cards.Only grumble, it didn't open until 10am."
Pretty expensive view,"I would say it was for us the only tourist trap on our 10 days visit. Indeed, the view is good but not worth to take an extra trip to it. The little digital surprise at the end was more interesting than going up."
"A 360degree of the great city, Busan",Hardly anyone was there so going up took less than 10mins. Every corner had view marks to let tourists know what they are seeing from down below and from a distance. The tower's location is also nice as you can go straight to shopping at Nampodong after seeing Busan from hundreds of meters high up.
Great views but lacked information ,"Yes, the 360 degree views are great but why did the designers fail to provide more information about what one could see in each direction. And the too narrow stairs down to the down elevator were uncomfortable, and how are people supposed to carry a baby walker?"
Fantastic views,"Really liked the views from the Tower, fantastic way to see sunset and see all the city lights turn on and it get dark. Must see"
120 meters,360 view observetoryreally nice at night timeafter the tower expect a little digital surprise :]there's an option to buy tickets with a meal popcorn and it's close to a shopping street ^^
Great view of Busan,"In contrast to Seoul, the tower itself in Busan wasn't particularly amazing. However, Busan's mountains and coastline makes for a more interesting vista. It isn't particularly expensive either (even without some free tickets we got visiting the sister tower in Seoul), so it's worth a visit."
Great way to view BUSAN,Another weird thing that I was obsessed doing was going up towers in Korea. LOL. I went for the Busan Tower to catch a glimpse of the city from a bird’s point of view. They have this all mirrored walls before exiting the place. Pretty cool for funky pictures!
Average but historical,"Once you reach the top level of the tower, you could view the whole city below in 360 degrees. As you walk from one end to the other (it's a circle), different scenes and picture backdrops of digitally-programmed lights are reflected and played out on the walls, very interesting... "
Overlook almost all of Busan,"What else is there to say about a tower visit? It offers almost an entire panoramic view of Busan, with markers on the window to indicate where the attractions are in Busan, as well as short descriptions about said places. Going at night would probably be better than in the daytime, but to each his own. There are also love locks to place, and a little game connected to N Seoul Tower."
Fun family activity ,"We enjoyed the Busan Tower very much. We started with dinner at the burger restaurant then got our tickets and popcorn package. The views of the city at night were great. Our little guy enjoyed the other rooms as you go down that are full of mirrors, projectors, and black light glow rooms. It’s a fun stop and close to other areas like the Busan Christmas tree festival in Nampo-dong. "
Go for night views ,"The night skyline over Busan was most interesting. The illuminated city was a colourful and vibrant sight to behold. Also the nearby Yongdusan park was closed, so it appeared to be more reasonable choice as a night attraction. "
Great view over Busan.,At over 100m Busan Tower provides a great 360˙ view of Busan city. The plaza in front of the tower is also quite scenic with the occasional street parade commencing from here. For those looking for souvenirs there is quite a good (albeit pricey) souvenir shop in the same location.
Good views,"Not as cool and nice as the Seoul Tower, but it is good to see Busan from a certain height. There is a souvenirshop inside."
Great views!,"The views are really good and there are nice souvenirs. I just wish there was wifi, so we can instantly share our experience."
Great View,You climb up to the base of the tower via escalators from street level and then a stroll through a lovely park. The price is very reasonable at 8000 won. I was there in the early afternoon on the weekend and there was no line I went straight to the top. Great 360 degree views across the broad expanse of Busan. 
Great views,"As many others have noted, this is a great place to get a very good view of the city. Enjoyed the view from outside too as it sits on a hillside. There are other things to see around it. If you are doing the tourist thing, you should make this part of your visit."
Visit if you have time,The entrance price was not expensive. The observation deck was quite small but the view was nice enough. It was fine for a quick visit if you have time.
Impressive,"It is one of the highest position in Busan. The sightseeing is very nice in the autumn. Fantastic sea view, mountain view and city view."
Better than N Soul tower,"Busan tower was fantastic. The views were great, the glass clean and the gardens that surround the tower were lovely. I also enjoyed the escalator trip up to the gardens"
I recommend going during the day.,I love Busan and went up Busan Tower for the second time last week but I prefer the view much more during the day than at night. Was able to get a lot of great photos. Panoramic is your friend! It wasn't very busy on this beautiful Saturday afternoon.
You have to do this,"Up you go, the view is fantastic, the tack photo is cute lol. Friendly people, well worth a trip up to see what around you."
One of a Must place,"The first place that we visit once we reached busan. Before come here, prepare your legs / your self with a lot of exercises if you plan to cover attraction places with your own. If you plan to visit Busan tower you can choose to not visit seoul tower. great view and we have a great time here. From here we stroll the nampo dong street and reach jagalchi market for dinner. We love nampo dong but its just we dont have any spare time to come back here before heading to seoul. Hope others will have a great time here as much as we do. "
Great view for a great price,"Like any observation towers, Busan Tower is the flagship observation tower of the city, offering a 360 degrees view of Busan and the surround area. To get here, you only have to walk from Nampo metro station, take an escalator from Gwangbok-dong street and through Yongdusan park.Unlike other observation towers however, Busan Tower's entrance price is relatively cheap at 8,000 won. You can also get combo packages like a burger and drinks with your ticket for a slightly higher price, but there are many food places nearby so it's not really needed.Loved the view from the tower as you get to see the city, sea and mountains. Quite relaxing to just walk around, relax and enjoy the view. You can also spend as long as you like in the tower. There is also a coffee place near the tower and they also have quirky photograph opportunities at the exit of the tower.Do play the game at the observation deck too (it's a a machine that you need to pose for pictures), where you can win discount for the coffee place or Seoul Tower entrance tickets!A relaxing activity that I would highly recommend."
Incredible Busan view ,"The tower is located near Busan Station , you can walk 15 minutes , there is a big escalator and you go up using it , it is free , open public , when you reach the top of the garden you will see Busan Tower , there is a convenience store and a shopping center just near the tower . You can buy some drink and you sit near the convenience store and overlook to the city , it is incredible. The entrance fee 8 thousands won for per person (adult). You reach the top by elevator. In the top of the tower ,you can see the city and you can take some profile pictures for your SNS account , you can see Pacific ocean , and most part of the city . On the way back, when you go down the tower, you can take some amazing photos in the corridors , there are some illustrative attractions."
You will not regret the visit!,"Went there in a Sunday, July 08, no queue at all, it was the end of a looong day visiting Busan, kids were pretty tired, but this visit to Busan Tower revigorated them.They were very excited by everything, the park, the tower itself, the screens on the roof of the elevator, the view, everything.There was also the possibility to connect to Seoul Tower, we didn’t manage to, but we did manage to take some pictures and send them directly to our email box, through the app there. It’s pretty easy, so give it a try!They will also take a picture of you before going up the tower and if you want it printed, you will receive it after going up at the reception, 1 picture 10.000 wons, 2 pictures 20.000 (one of them plastic framed, with some hearts or stars floating in some liquid). Nice!The view is amazing, although the tower is not very tall. We saw from there a lot of other places we want to visit next time when in Busan.There are also several interesting souvenirs.After going down, you will find yourself passing through some interesting rooms, with mirror& lights, with some very nice fireworks, drawings....prepare your camera, the kids enjoyed it a lot.There is also a Museum of Movies in the neighbourhood, you will see the signs. We didn’t go because it was rather late, we left it for another time. I thinkthe Trickeye Museum is there too. It appeared on our map as being close by, but we didn’t have the time to look for it.To sum up, you should put this tower on your list when visiting Busan."
Landmark building in Busan,"The Busan Tower is located in Yongdusan Park, for a fee a visitor can have 360 uninterrupted views over Busan and out to sea, our family did not have the need to visit as we were on a car journey around Busan and its coastline. Access to Yongdusan park can be reached via an escalator from downtown or a boardwalk with stairs up from the street below and a nearby paid car-park."
Busan Tower Views,"Great views of the City of Busan from a top the tower. You see the surrounding mountains, Taejongdae Resort, Namhangdaegyo Bridge, Jungang Park, Biff Square and more. Quite cheap to enter compared to what you would pay elsewhere in the world. There is also a souvenir shop as well but unfortunately it seems to be mostly fridge magnets and nothing else. (No pin badges) High recommend that you only go on a clear sunny day or at night. I think there is a fireworks festival in Busan which would probably be great to see from the tower."
