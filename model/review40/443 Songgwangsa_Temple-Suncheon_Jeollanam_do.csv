Must Visit,Great scenary. Big temple.Superb place. Nice stream. Overall a must visit location in South Korea...
Forest Bath,Took more than an hr local bus ride from suncheon station. The ride is worthy for a glimpse of village life. The path to the temple complex is full of pine trees. It was refreshing. The signs are very obvious. The architecture is very unique. There are eateries outside the temple where the bus terminal is at. We had very good meal of local cuisine. 
Important temple but little to see,"The temple is of high significance historically and religiously, but has limited touristic value. The journey out by bus is 80 to 90 minutes one way from Suncheon, and a longish walk up to the temple, but then a lot of the temple is off-limits and many halls are locked. The museum also seems to be closed mostly, I have visited 3 times over a decade and it was never open. So, there may be great treasures but they are not publically accessable. The bridge and the Gate of the Heavenly Guardians are very photogenic, and the hike across Chogyesan is great, but the temple itself is a dissappointment. There are better temples to be visited, espcially the other two 'treasures' Tongdo-sa and Haein-sa."
Very pleasant mountain surrounding ,"First of all, transportation advice for those coming from Gwangju - buy intercity bus tickets from U Square, 7,500 won one way, the journey takes about 1 hour 40 mins. The counter at U Square either doesn't sell return tickets or they don't understand we want to buy return tickets. Don't worry, you can buy return tickets from the convenient shop at the destination. Unfortunately not many buses in a day, we left Gwangju @ 10.45am, the return bus left Songgwangsa either @ 1pm (impossible) or 5.40pm (the last).Many cheap eateries at the bus and private car parking ground at the destination. From there it's a 5 mins walk to the temple's entrance gate to buy tickets (3,000 won), then a very pleasant 15-20 min leisure stroll to the temple. The walking path is by the river and surrounded by many tall trees, many of them are of course pine trees.The temple comprises of many nice timber buildings but only around 1/3 are accessible to public.We've visited many many temples in Asia so we don't think there is anything really special or unique about Songgwangsa, although the temple ground is very pleasant because of the surrounding mountains and very well maintained landscape. Due to new construction, the museum is not yet ready for visit, which is disappointig. Overall, a nice day trip from Gwangju."
One of three most famous temples in Korea,"Historically, Hapcheon Haeinsa, Yangsan Tongdosa and Suncheon Songgwangsa have been three most famous temples in Korea.Even to non-Buddhists, it'll be a good visit to watch and experience this place.- About 60~80 min by bus from city center of Suncheon and it's the last stop. The stop before last destination is Songgwangsa Entrance. But, it's just before the front gate and it's a lot of walk from there.- Second gate is the ticket office after passing the bus stop, park lot and souvenir shops. And it's lots of walk from there, too. Better be enjoying trails.- There's a museum with rare national treasures. Good to enter with enough time.- Twin alpine juniper tree is one of treasures of Songgwangsa. But, it's locating quite far. Not a walkable distance for common tourists.- Just like most other temples of Korea, it'll be nicer to visit around Buddha's Day."
Magestic but friendly,"Songgwangsa Temple was one of four Temple Stays that I visited when I was in Korea. All of the Temple Stays were fantastic, but this one had a more intimate feeling of great age and history as one walks through the lanes. . The people at the Temple Stay visit area were friendly and had more English than at other temples. You can google search the incredible buildings and painted ceilings, as well as the 3:00 a.m. awakening to see the gong player and the fish clakker, music that resonates into the mountains to bring adherents to Buddhism from the spirit world. I would definitely return to Songgwangsa on another trip. By the way. you can stay here for several days or even rent your own room for a month if you need to sort out your life. That is what many Koreans do, go into refuge, and deal with their issues. There are some areas that are off limit, since this is an institution of learning for the many categoroes of monks, but the complex spread of ancient buildings are quite freely available to entering for meditation."
Be prepared for a long walk,"Since we went during the summer, the hot weather made the walk towards the temple felt much longer. When we reached the temple, we strolled around for about 20 minutes and we're done. Perhaps a guided tour would have made it more interesting."
Very Beautiful,"With the temple of the seoraksan national park the most beautiful temples of korea. We were there in August and there was nobody else visiting, so it is very quiet an you can relax watching those beautiful buildings and all the details on them.A must see, if you like temples."
A quiet and serene place to rest your mind,"From Suncheon train station, take bus #111, it is long ride 80mins. Frequency of bus is 50mins. You can check the bus schedule time on the bus stop, or from the tourist information kiosk outside the train station. From my experience, the staffs didn't speak English or Chinese. She called another person through phone and that person explained to me. Notice on the bus #111, not every bus is going to Songgwangsa. Confirm with the driver when you board the bus. During my visit, some of the structures were undergoing maintenance. Some areas within the temple is opened for visit during certain day or special occasion."
"A very old temple with lots of history, and you can even experience the temple life","The reason I'm giving this a 3, is partly because of my subjective preferences (I do not really enjoy temples despite being a Buddhist), because I didn't feel so much enlightened or what, and also because I didn't experience the temple lifestyle for the weekend (no thank you). Main advice would be to get someone who speaks Korean with you, or learn some Korean before coming here.Getting there:I was staying at Guesthouse Nreem and there was this bus station that had Bus no. 111 (cmiiw) which has Songgwangsa Temple as its last stop. I think each bus comes each 40 mins or so, but you can check on the bus website to check where the bus is. I used the city's free WiFi, looked at my bus station's name in Hangul characters, and looked for it in the timetable. Refresh the page to get the most up to date bus location.There's also some info on transportation if you Google around, but I recommend taking the bus. It's only 1200-1500 Won per person one way, and if you take a taxi I don't know how much. It's undoubtedly expensive though.Atmosphere & overall experience:You can stay at the temple during weekends if I remember correctly. Pay KRW 50k and experience life in the temple. No thanks, but if you're interested, why not try?The temple is quiet, and roads are not too steep. Just remember the Hangul characters for Songgwangsa or just follow people if there are other people around you, and you won't get lost. Beautiful surroundings, but not really to my tastes.I really suggest you get a guided tour here, since people in small cities don't speak English that well. There's a museum that houses some National Treasures (in which you can't take photos), a temple where you can pray on, and I don't know if any other temple was accessible. I didn't take guided tour since my mom went there for a spiritual trip-- she brought her praying book and prayed there. I guess we could care less about history and exploring around this time; next time my mom would probably get a guided tour to learn stuff about the temple other than from stone monuments with English translations ^_^;Waiting for your friend because you only accompany someone here?While not many of you are probably like me, who just came here for the sake of accompanying someone, I think some of you would be.There are no places that you could sit at and rest with your back leaned on except probably the staircases (it was raining when I was there so that option was crossed out for my situation), so if you're like me, you are just accompanying someone, and if that someone wants to take longer time there (i.e. praying or just exploring), you'd be better off waiting at the cafe near the ticket booth or at a tea shop which is quite near the temple entrance.I was sitting just outside the temple doors and purposefully not having my back towards the Buddha statues (I think it's considered impolite/disrespectful) and suddenly this woman came up to me and said something in Korean, which, of course I have no idea about. But from the gestures she was telling me to move. Mom then told me I could write at the table, but as I got to the table, I got reprimanded again and bad mood intensified.Anyways continue--Food:There's a mini market at the parking lot, and the store owner has the bus schedule in a large whiteboard.Oh the restaurants near the parking lot serve good food! I had a bibimbap and it was amazing. It is far from the actual temple though, so I wouldn't say it's food around the temple. There's a tea shop near the temple, though I don't know what food they serve, and also a nice cafe that sells tea, souvenir and drinks near the ticket booth.Admission:I accidentally said this attraction was free when you had to buy tickets in the quick survey lol I'm sorry TripAdvisor, but luckily before this review, I remembered. Probably 3000 Won or sth, but it's not expensive at all, and worth the visit.Length of stay in attraction:I say 2 hours or so because there's a lot of walking, and you don't want to be hurried. You should at least be ready to spend half a day here, with the travel time back and forth +/- 2 hours, and then staying and exploring around at least 2 hours."
Beautiful,"This was one of the nicest temples I've been to in Korea. The surrounding areas where equally as beautiful. We went by car and I think it might be hard to get to otherwise, but worth the visit if you can.Also dog friendly."
"Beautiful Temple, excellent atmosphere and wonderful staff","I am not sure which Songgwangsa the previous reviewer was talking about but I discover there were 2 Songgwangsa. This one is in Jeollanam do, Suncheon si and is one of the distinguished three jewel temples in Korea. I hiked 6.5km through Jogyesan from Seonamsa to here. Took me 4hours with my entire baggage (backpack).The temple is beautiful especially the Daeungbojeon which houses the Buddha of the past, present and future. I simply can stay there all day and not get tired of looking at it. I joined the templestay for 50000won but as i was the only person, there was no fixed programme. I am free to walk around or join in the ceremonies and meals. At 3.30am, the dharma drum starts off the morning ceremony and it is truly amazing to hear and feel it. Morning ceremony at Daeungbojeon starts at 4am and to my surprise, there are a few civilians there joining in too.The temple lodgings were fantastic with warm floor and ensuite bathroom. And the templestay staff is an excellent guy, Mr Kim, he is friendly and helpful and even walked me to Bulil-am, a famous hermitage in the mountain and drove me to catch the bus at the bus stop outside Songgwangsa."
Weird vibes in the dark and the cold,"Myself and my girlfriend booked accommodation here and were told we'd be sharing a room. When we arrived we quickly realized that the temple was almost entirely empty with the exception of a few skeleton staff. They didn't have anyone on site to direct us to where to go so we spent the first half an hour just wandering around. When the organizer arrived she informed us that unfortunately we couldn't share a room which was fine, but they did mislead us there. The problem was that the few monks who were there were very cold towards us. We met one friendly monk who got into a car and drove off, but the rest either ignored us, or have menacing scowling looks at us. The rooms are exceedingly cold with no floor heating I could feel, and the food was expectantly vegetarian but lovely, with a few things on the buffet exceedingly salty. To get to the temple is rather confusing unless you have a Korean person with you. The address on this app is actually wrong it's 569-2, Daeheung-ri, Soyang-myeon, Wanju-gun, Jeollabuk-dWe actually cut our stay short. The venue itself is beautiful, and I imagine if there are more staff, and a few socialable people it would be pleasant for walks and such. The venue has some lovely statues and the buildings are very traditional, so my suggestion is that you go at the right time of the year. Ps, at night there are very few lights so bring a torch."
