Beautiful architecture,"It has a beautiful campus and unusual architecture. This time I visited their museum near the entrance. Many tourists come here to take photos, mostly with the far end (hill-top) as background. It is also breath-taking going up to the far end and then look back towards the city."
Big and Nice Uni,"The young girl student here are freedonly wear their outfit to Uni. Around the Uni, there is alot cosmetic shop, cloth, cafe and etcBe alert and bring enough cash and card as here is the cheapest shopping palace ever."
Fascinating architecture,Really great architecture. fell upon it by chance as we were walking through Seoul. The buildings and architectural layout were fascinating.
Great area,"Spectacular architecture and clean, also the surrounding area is great for shopping on a budget. We had some coffee and toffee grapes."
Ewha Womans University,"This place is worth to visit. The campus is beautiful and the architecture design is special. Besides, there are many photo spots around here. After that, we went to shop at Ewha shopping street."
Nice,"this university is huge and breath taking...education all under one room, they even have a chapel, surrounding area is serene"
Beautiful campus,"We went to the university expecting seeing a beautiful campus. We found it worth going. We visited the University Archives and learnt much about the history of the University and some prominent graduates, this made the visit much more meaningful. "
Such a beautiful place worth a visit!,This place is so beautiful! The buildings reminded me of Hogwarts in Harry Potter. Instagram worthy!
Beautiful Place,"Stairs and more stairs every other part of this beautiful place. Very beautiful buildings and structures around. Cheap, hip and fashionable ladies clothing sold nearby. You will spend..spend..spend if you are not careful.."
Worth visiting!,Finally had a chance to check out Ewha Woman's University. Worth a visit! Beautiful architecture and yummy food too!
Nice place to take photos!,"I came here on Chuseok Holidays so not much people except tourist who busy taking photos on a hot day! We can only hang out at the spots to take photos but how I wish I can go in the school to see the class, student cafe etc. Other than this, just along the Ehwa subway have whole stretch of shops selling clothing, cafes, fast food and mart."
Beautiful architecture for amazing pictures!,"Visited the campus for half a day, many good spots for taking photos! Just outside the campus were stretches of shopping streets mainly for cosmetics and stationaries."
Place to take picture,"In here usually lots of people take pictures with the interior of this university. However, there are so many stores and restaurant that you can explore nearby the ewha womans university. In the nearby area, they also provide some Halal foods for the muslims. So don't worry"
Beautiful and vibrant ,The university for women only has a humble beginning. Today it is one of the most beautiful and prestigious university in South Korea. Academically it excel and becomes an icon here. The surrounding area becomes a very vibrant shopping and dining heavens with very affordable price. 
I get why this is so popular,"I mean... the architecture was incredible. Out of this world. I know I haven't been to Europe so I can't compare this to anything else but we were quite mesmerized but the overall vibe of this area. Funny story: My sister and I sneaked in to the cafeteria area (which prolly for students only since you need access card to get in) surrounding the infamous stairs. I really wanted to go there since they have Baskin Robbins Ice cream VENDING MACHINE. We managed to enter the area and guess what happened next: I tried to pay using my travle card and lost it in the machine. The cafeteria lady tried to help us by saying ""Maybe you should call this number"" but we only have wifi, not local mobile number. So I had to buy another travel card to be able to go home.Anyway, we walked around for a bit and found shopping street and bought some cheap tshirts. Overall nice experience, and someday I will go get my ice cream there!"
So pretty,"A beautiful university campus with lots of fashion streets around it, can visit if you are interested and walkable to Sichon"
Unique and iconic building,"It's amazing, a university has turned into a tourist place. The buildings in Ewha are very unique, you won't regret going to this place. After visiting Ewha, you can shop at the nearby shopping area."
must go in my opinion,"Must go, to visit the incredible architecture of ewha womans university and to shop - especially if you’re female. The stuff they’re selling are one of the better price points. There are some shops catering to male, or unisex. Many simple fakes (shirt with supreme, patagonia, champion logo) costing KRW 5,000. there are also shops selling food and drinks around"
Great shopping!,"Since its targeted at university students, things sold here are much more affordable compared to Hongdae and Myeongdong areas. Managed to get a good deal for shoes at the ABC mart, which are not found elsewhere. Not as crowded compared to popular touristy areas and shops tend to close slightly earlier around 8-9 pm. So would be good to go earlier. Located conveniently near the subway station and would recommend girls to visit this place for good deals :) There is a also a cosmetic wholesale area here that provides below market prices for certain brands."
You need only come here to shop in Seoul if you're a girl! ,"The shopping here is really cheap around 5k or 10k won at the min. and the designs are all trendy. You can't try the clothing and they're largely all free sized. For girls who can't find clothing in other areas such as gangnam bcos the general Korean free sizes are too small, this is the best area!Dont really bother with hongdae (not that cheap) or myeongdong (expensive) "
Popular Shopping Area,"My daughters came here for their clothes shopping versus actually touring the university. There were a large number of shops selling young, trendy clothing at quite reasonable starting prices (i.e. W5000 for a shirt). Many of the stores were full of young women shoppers. Be sure you know your shirt size as the stores would not let our daughters try on any shirts but they were more accomodating for pants and skirts for some reason. There was also a number of small restaurants to satisfy our hunger after spending awhile shopping."
Amazing Shopping,The shopping center is amazing. Must visit. Its located in a good location and has good cafes around. The shops are good and inexpensive. Must visit for shopping. They have a lot of shops for clothes and cosmetics
Beautiful Campus,My mother in law went to this school so we wanted to check it out. It's such a beautiful campus. Shops around there were so much cheaper than most. My daughter bought some clothes and they were so reasonable.
Very beautiful landscape. The architecture is awesome.,We went here on an early morning on a holiday because it is walking distance from our guest house. I will definitely go back to this place should I have another chance in the future.
English Speakers,"When we got off the bus, it was a bit daunting since the campus is so big. We were trying to get to Ehwa's shopping district. However, as we got on campus, there were many English speakers who pointed out the way and we stopped to take pictures of the buildings on campus as well as the walkway. It was a pretty campus."
I love to studying here (if I was a student..LoL),"This university is really beautiful !! The park is nice, the building design is the combination of europe style with modern architecture in some area. Very quite and relaxing. I'm surely the student can study very well here. Near this university, there are a lot of shopping store."
Beautiful picturesque place.,The Ehwa Womens university is easily accessible via the train.There are plenty of shops for visitors to visit along the way before reaching the university. Great place for photo taking. 
Beautiful place for every season,"I came here during winter, autumn and spring. It such a beautiful place to visit during any season. Every place worth to explore and good on picture"
Very Comfort to walk around the park,There have a garden around the campuss very cozy to walk around and enjoy the cold air on early april 2019.. keep your steps on the walk path.. dont mess it..
Instagrammable buildings,A huge university with instagrammable buildings and nearby bargain shops and affordable restaurants nearby. 
Must visit in Seoul,It is a very beautiful campus and it is tourist place. We went on public holiday and we saw so many tourist there. Good for photostop and shopping. There are many cosmetic shops and cheap bags and clothes. 
cheap shopping place,"this place is very beautiful even for tourists who don't like to shop like me, the store is neatly arranged and the lights are beautiful at night, looks like in a movie"
loved it!,"such a beautiful campus! walking amidst the students really made me want to study here as well, even bought many souvenirs!"
Interesting place for teenagers,"Teenagers will like this place for shopping and in trend stuff. The waffles ice cream was so good. Must try.My boy done his first hair colour at Juno Hair salon, the service was great !"
Lovely Environment,"Beautiful University. Was here some years back, came again as this is one of the place I will revisit. Nice relax ambience, nice shopping street, much less crowd so u could enjoy your walk & shopping more leisurely... simple & good food. Tried spicy pork rice burger, so tasty!The campus is nice to take photo. After Ehwa, walk down the street keep walking straight, u will find Sinchon station, another university street."
Beautiful University in natural beauty place!,"This is an amazing Woman's University, I don't know actually the internal education system but I can say that the outdoor environment and structure may create good education, motivative along with innovative learning environment."
Beautiful & Wonderful Campus,"Ewha is most popular university to visit due to its beautiful architecture. The place is huge and so beautiful during Autumn. Its free to visit, I have visited here twice and both time so amaze with the modern building underground. The architecture is so lovely. Never seen a university looks like this and never expected its looks like a park and became a tourist attraction as well."
Beautiful and unique,"The unique architectural mix of the traditional buildings and the more modern Ewha Campus Complex is what probably draws most tourist to visit this school. Completed with beautiful greenery in its grounds, its a perfect sanctuary in the midst of the bustling city. Albeit, it is steps away from the Ewha shopping district, which is also not to be missed."
Nice place to take photo,Suggest to come at night if you want to take nice photo when all the lightings are switch on. There's a shopping street just opposite Ehwa Womans University. Goods sold here tend to be cheaper than what you can find in Meyongdong.
"Autum foliage, old beautiful brick buildings and modern campus complex in one place","If you are visiting in Autumn and looking for beautiful foliage near the City center then visit Ehwa Womans University. It has all the colors of Fall, a great history, plus the campus complex that is able to blend the modern architecture with the old brick buildings and the beautifully landscaped gardens."
"Spacious, Beautiful Campus Especially in Autumn","A must visit attraction during autumn. The campus is lined with beautifully landscaped gardens and trees (along with yellow, fiery red and orange leaves( that is a sight to behold. The campus is basically a hive of activity with the tourists and students walking around this large and spacious campus.It is not necessary to walk the entire campus. It's good enough to capture the beauty of the campus just being hanging around the southern entrance of the campus.If you have time, the museum is a good place for a walk given that the exhibits also have explanations in English. We got quite a few nice little souvenirs as well from the museum gift shop for our friends."
Beautiful buildings and people,"It is one of my favorites in Seoul. It has a beautiful campus with historical buildings and innovative architecture.There are tourists all year round. In autumn, the campus is decorated by autumn leaves, whereas in spring it has beautiful cherry blossoms."
Nice Scenic Location,Ewha Womans University is a must visit location. The university is very nice and very big campus. This place is rich in history.
All Womens University!,"Ewha is a university that you can feel you woman side. Lol! I'm just kidding. Kidding aside, the architecture and the place was very unique and tourist friendly. "
It's so pretty,I wish I could study in this University. The architecture is amazing and there's a lot of place to hangout around the campus and in the campus itself. The scenery is also amazing. Would love to study here if I could. LOL
Beautiful architecture & plenty of photo ops!,"Ewha is famous for its beautiful architecture! Gorgeous campus with the autumn leaves surrounding it. Very nice for photo taking. After that, walk around the streets surrounding it for some shopping & eating!"
Shopping,"Great place to go shopping, the prices are great! I would reccomend going here first befire heading to the other areas.The university is spectacular."
Great architecture for photo ops,"The main sight is the steel building, looks very modern and instaworthy. aside from that, the nearby building is colonial style church-like hall. overall, if you like architecture design do visit this university, it's worth the short walk. "
Good looking University!,"The university has an amazing architecture and landscape. Since this is a university, you will see students going in and out of their classes. Good thing they didn't mind us taking pictures inside the university. Probably they are already used to tourists and even locals having photoshoots. Overall, enjoyed our visit here."
beautiful university,"everytime i went to Seoul, i took a walk into this university, nice and comfortable place, during March and April, cherry blossom inside the university attracted many visitors to take photos"
Beautifully Old and Modern,The Ewha Woman’s University was a pleasant surprise. It has a nice quiet campus with old European styled buildings next to an architecturally interesting underground building somewhat hidden in the hillside. We spent a pleasant hour or so strolling and taking pictures.
"It is a university, not a park.","Ewha is one of the oldest universities in Korea. It has a beautiful campus. But remember, this is a university, not a park. Please respect students and keep silent. Avoid taking photos of students. (You can really get in trouble)"
beautiful university,I read the reviews before going and it did not disappoint. Walking the grounds of this beautiful campus and reading about its amazing history was inspiring. 
Worth a Visit,"This is a real campus like most other university does, but the building and overall surrounding does look very beautiful and pleasant, the student is so lucky.The slope path way in between two campus complex is really brilliant architecture design. Everyone is having fun walking around and having Instagram session,Don't forget there is actually few more sights you can explore inside the campus & outside of the campus as well, we found some of our Seoul best deal at the shops outside campus."
beautiful campus,"Very beautiful campus, especially the front gate.Or I can't say it is 'gate', because there is no gate!Very wide and open front!And the steps are astonishing also.Very worth to see and visit inside the campus.非常漂亮的校園，尤其是正門，或許我不該說這是正門，因為這面根本沒有門。校園前方非常廣且寬闊！且校園裡面的階梯也非常壯觀。非常值得一去！"
Beautiful campus-a must visit for architecture lovers,This place is justifiably popular to visit due to its beautiful architecture. Most people ignore the museum which is small but has a good collection of art and historical artifacts and is free to visit. I have never seen a university that looks like this one.
Incredible architecture,"You feel like you're in old Europe and a 21st century futuristic location all at the same time. Enjoyable to stroll around, no entry charge. Lots of studently priced shops and eateries nearby"
Beautiful,We walked around the sculptured park and took many photos. The park area is very wide and suitable for families. 
Beautiful University,Wonderful campus worth a lot of pictures. Caffeteria is quite decent. A lot of walking and steps but worth the trip.Outside the main gate is a lot of shopping (Target audience is female university students) and food.
Beautiful University,"I really love the scenery, and the university in korea is open to everyone, ehwa university is known as women university, but what's it special is the building and the scenery itself. it is kind of well-mix between some modern design, and old design. i suggest you while shopping at the nearest street, take a look at the university."
Nice view,I think this is great during Autumn bc of the view. Great for walking also because there are also many shop for clothes and shoes.
More than a university,"what a surprise when we actually see in our own eyes the real magnificent arcitecture, amazing with great histiry... must visit."
I love the environment there,"I proudly say that this is the best open university concept among the universities I visited so far. I love how convenient it is for students to buy shoes, apparel even foods. The environment is so warm with great facilities. I am so in love with this university. "
A beautiful university,The university is surrounded by beautiful garden with a twist of modern and historical buildings. It's nearby the metro station hence I would recommend to visit this place.
I wish I had the energy to go on top!,"There were a lot of people when I came, students and tourists alike. I wish I went to school here. Looks really nice. The garden is nice as well, but I got really tired going up and going up the stairs to. after a few snaps, I just went around Ewha. But really, it's a nice place. The structure and everything about the school looks rad."
Quite a nice stroll during end winter time,This is one of the place that i stumbled upon accidentally. Parts of the school premises are opened to public and it actually pretty romantic place to be with your partner. 
Beautiful,It's architecture is so beautiful and got the somewhat nostalgic atmosphere 10 mins walk to the University you'll find a Line characters toy shop with huuuuge Line bear take a time to drop in during your visit to the University....btw its sometimes very crowded with tourists
an university disturbed by visitors,"Its beautiful landscape, scenery and a fashion street (famous of 10,000 won bags and 1,000 won socks) at the entrance attract thousands of visitors. I agree the students are to some extent, are disturbed by visitors, especially the tourists from all over the world. I would suggest visitors just touring the outside of the buildings and have a walk around the area near their famous library."
Nice architecture,This university campus has become a popular tourist attraction and the university has put up signs warning against nuisance caused by visitors. Some nice buildings are worth seeing especially its sunken library building with steps up to roof top. The campus layout is attractive but not as magnificient as Yonsei University.
Check out Dominique Perrault's architecture,"I went to visit a few years ago mainly to check out the building designed by Dominique Perrault. The campus is nice to stroll around. There is also a museum which is worth a visit. The university gift shop stocks up some nice items, in case you are interested. I went this time to get some gifts for a friend/family. There are cheap eats at the food court, and also some nice cafes. This time, I noticed there is an arthouse cinema too. Well worth a visit if you are in Seoul."
Back to School,You can have a lot of beautiful picture surrounding the University. There are many food stalls and cafes where you can just sit and enjoy a book for whole afternoon!
Every lady will love this street,Lovely street for shopping either for clothes or make-up. Ladies must visit this place and you will definitely fall in love with this place. Street food also available along the way and you can fill your tummy while shopping around the street. 
Simply beautiful,"Each time I visited Seoul, my itinerary would include the university as it had a beautiful setting, with youthful students. The campus has beautiful cherry blossoms in late early April and golden Ginkgo leaves in early Oct. As usual there are many tourists particularly in the afternoons."
Beautiful!,Very beautiful campus. The scenery and the architecture was wonderful. Beautiful to take several photos. 
Made me want to study again!,"The university was such a nice place. Definitely a must visit! Once your done exploring the uni, you can go out and go shopping! Loved this area!"
A beautiful place with stunning architecture,"Well worth a walk through the university grounds, looking at the amazing glass and concrete section, with beautiful gardens at the top. Go to the information centre and you get a free talk by a student on the history, which is actually very inspiring. "
Visit if have spare time,"One of the spots for modern architecture tour. Ewha has its sunken campus by French Architect Dominique Perrault. Don't miss out Sun Tower by American Architect, Morphosis, which is just along the road outside the campus at the west.The campus is a pleasant place for a leisure walk. Recommend not to spend too much time especially this is in fact a campus where tourists cause disturbance.The district is small. The shops around Ewha are those not of prime quality but prices are competitive. It is nice idea to try a haircut in Korean style especially for girls."
its just an university,trust meits just an university and its parkits not a place for tourist and travellingbut if u want to see the university u can come here
Ewha Womans Uni Station,Alighted at Ewha Womans University Station. Another marked on station that one must alight for. Walking to the university and it was totally a picturesque view. No regrets coming to this place even just for some photos. Walking down the streets of Ewha is also another recommended place for shoppers. Real good deals you can get from here too.Beautiful scenic accompanies the trail. Do remember to compare prices from different shops selling the same items if you wanna save furthermore.CheersJazlyn
Beautiful Architecture,"It is a famous women's university. The architecture of building is very interesting and beautiful views. The surrounding area The tree is not only shade, but also a very beautiful. In front of University close to the shopping street. It is similar to Myeongdong. It is a clothing store, shoes and bags in the alleyways. The clothes are not even a lot but that is cheaper."
Great architecture with a variety of shops close by,"EWHA university has a very interesting architectural design, it was done in collaboration with a French Architect which tried to give it a nice elegant and modern finish. The surrounding areas is quite charming, with many small streets and shops where you can get lost in as you explore the city"
Beautiful grounds,Worth a visit if in the area. Nice landscaped spaces to walk about with views of the city. There's a visitor's center that can provide information.
Shopping at Ewha,"After visiting the shopping centres at Dongdaemun, shopping for clothes at Ewha doesn’t have much appeal. Designs are not as good and the prices are much more expensive. There are many restaurants and cafes catered to young people. I found Belif Cosmetics shop there which I didn’t find anywhere else. I bought more stuff from shop carts and the MRT shops near there than any of the regular shops. If you are a bargain shopper for clothes like me Dongdaemun may be more suitable. We didn’t visit the university itself. "
Beautiful university,I was in awe of this University. It is very pretty and a lot of pictures can be taken. The area around the university is also nice and touristy with all sorts of amenities. It's a must visit if you wanna see some nice architecture (the uni building).
Impressive,The university was very huge. Architecture was great as well. Didn't see much on the day of visit as it was too windy.
Wonderful campus,Beautiful campus with museums and attractions free for visitors. A great place to sightsee and the shopping areas around the campus are very affordable for students as well as travellers on a budget.
Great place to shop and beautify,"Agreed that it a nice place to shop. However, i particularly like to visit the hair salon here. I find that it is cheaper than those at Hongdae and its much quieter too. Huge campus but too bad my attention was drawn to the many little retail shops rather than the campus itself."
Good campus!,Really a huge campus! The view is so great! It feels like you aren't in the campus xD Many tourists come here. Good place!
Impressive campus,This is the oldest women's university of Korea. The campus is impressive and the central addmin building is mainly underground done by a French architect. A welcome center gives you the history--founded by Americans. Downside--very hilly. 
Cheap shopping,Plenty of cheap shopping to be done and it was very convenient to come here via metro...It is also safe and opens till late evening.
Great to shop,"Things cheaper there due to cater for University students, easy to navigate and plenty of shops and restaurants there"
Wonderful Architecture,The University grounds were very pleasant to stroll about in but we did not venture into the buildings itself as it is a learning institute afterall. We went into the gift shop and browsed around in the shops in the surrounding areas. A pleasant and relaxing way to spend a few hours in this area.
IT`S NOT FOR TOURISTS!,"This place is a University, not a Zoo or something. You should not go inside, unless you gonna do gentle. Please be quiet and just walk around outside of buildings. That`s all you can do. This place is not a place for tourists."
A Hogworts in Seoul,"Great place to take pictures with many Hogworts-esque type buildings dotting the landscape. Not surprising since the school was founded by Mary Scranton back in 1886. The shopping streets around the campus offer lots of merchandise, but if you venture inside the campus, you'll find even better bargains because some of the stuff sold outside (like face masks) are actually available at student prices."
Lovely area to walk and shop,"Visited the Ewha Women's University to check out the architecture (which was really nice) but was also pleasantly surprised by the whole area! Lots of shops, cafe, restaurants around the area which you can go to and spend your day there. Particulary enjoyed the shopping as they had many interesting stuff which I didn't see at other parts of the city.This has got to be one of my most favourite spots to hang out in Seoul!"
Good place for photo taking,Beautiful place for photo taking. A lot of street foods and shopping around. Must visit this place if you like to take photos.
Autumn in Seoul,Very nice view... The shopping center near the university is not expensive. The near restaurant served delicious food.
Architecture at its best,Appreciate both the modern architecture and past. University canteen is open to the public. Outside you'll see food cards and a lot of shopping stalls.Good to visit in autumn. Drop by the University museum as well.
Gorgeous campus!,Visiting this university during autumn can make you decide that it is not a bad idea to pursue your education here because the really beautiful campus is such a conducive place to study! The entire campus can give you such happiness that I can't describe in words. Must visit!
Beautiful campus with history and architectural pleasure,"This university is the first women's university established in Korea. When you take a walk around campus you will find a very interesting architecture going underground, but also find old buildings with its own charms as well. Make sure to stop by their souvenir shop as they have pretty and cute nick nacks that girls and foreigners will like."
Beautiful autumn leaves ar Ewha University,"Beautiful early American style buildings are hallmarks of this university ... full autumn leaves colors in well landscaped gardens add to a romantic feel that make the university feels like a park than a place of higher learning. With the young girls (woman university) patronizing the many small retails shops selling fashion accessories, clothings, shoes and food stalls immediately off the gates of the university, the whole atmosphere is one of youth, vibrancy and innocence.. a must visit place when visiting Seoul"
Fun place to shop and eat!,"We had a really fun time at this place! Don't bother eating before coming, there are plenty of interesting cafes and street stalls here. You could easily eat your way up and down the streets and around the university. The shopping is mostly for young people's things like fashion bags / clothes and stuff. Take the train to Ewha Women's University station and there will be signs on where to exit. We came from exit 7 and ate our way down to the university and back. Despite being a sunday, it was not crowded and there were no street performances. But for us, we were looking for a chill time so it kinda fit our mood anyways. Good to go if you have the time :)"
We love the shopping atmosphere and small snacks here,Good shopping place. Vibrant and price is lower for clothes compared to other places. Most likely cathered to students. Like the little eating places around where you can get sweet treats. We went on a Sunday afternoon seems abit queit as lots of cafes not open fo biz. Maybe should explore on a weekday instead.
one of the must visit,Very beautiful and spacious campus. Perfect for photo taking and also a relax walk. Most of the clothing stores at the shopping streets caters to young adults. In my opinion the clothing are cheaper compared to other shopping streets.
If you have time to spare,"Not exactly a must see but if you have time to spare and are into youngish college age clothings, you might want to check it out, though the items are similar everywhere. We went there just to have a look at the university scenario. "
Best place to photoshoot,Going in autumn sure u will see the great sightseeing . Too many visitor in weekend better going in weekday if u want shoot the perfect picture 
Women university,"Many place for great picture. Shopping street around university. I've visited in sunny day, so lucky"
I want to study there,"I wish I could study in such a beautiful university like Ehwa. So nice, esp in Fall. It's a must-visit if you go to Seoul."
Very nice environment,"We took subway line 2 to Ehwa Womans University using exit 2 (exit 3 can also be used) at the station with the same name. This is the largest university for women in Korea. It was an easy 5-10mins walk to the university. There is a cafe at the entrance and the grounds are nice. We went on a rainy day and the drizzle limited our walk around. Nevertheless, it was a nice area to explore."
Not only uni...find the best price dress with affordable price here,"After strolling around to the famous shopping place listed at Seoul like Myeondong, Hongdae etc etc, well i can guaranteed in here you can find a dress, bag with super affordable price comparing to the famous shopping area.Mostly same design, but the sell it much more cheaper...so this area so damn recommended for ladies.The ewha uni building design also so interesting,gothic and modern building design you can see in here...such a lovely place....!!!!!!"
shopping!,"Another shopping paradise for youngsters and teenagers, conveniently located at Ewha Womans University Station (Subway Line 2) exit 2 / 3. Cécica Hair Salon which is more affordable is also located here (not sure if they have other outlets though)"
My Family Summer 2017,"Edae was on our list this year whereas we were here on 29 July 2017. So excited to be here, taking lot of pictures and many shops available here with cheap prices. The shops offer mostly for ladies and few for man. I loveee being here (a shopaholic just like me) where i bought cloths, bags, cosmetic etc Surely we wanna come back here again ^-^"
Good looking University,"Pretty funny that the 5th ranked university in Seoul gets top billing as an attraction. We visited and the campus is very pretty. The building structures offer both archaic and modern designs. The underpass is just amazing and you will know what I mean when you visit. Outside the campus is filled with stores, shops, cafes and eateries."
Best place for clothes shopping!,"The area is known for affordable and trendy clothing and it did not disappoint. If you are looking for Korean fashion, this is it! Prices start from as low as 5,000 won. Didn't have time to visit the university grounds but heard that it's worth it.Literally shopped till we dropped and was recommended a KBBQ place by a shop assistant. Best place for KBBQ! Cheap and good:) A pity that we did not take down the shop name (it was in Korean) but the place is somewhere right at the end of the shopping street and has a cute pig as its mascot (hope this helps?). There wasn't any tourists while we were eating there."
Ewha Woman's University area good for shopping,"Very similar to the shopping in the Hongik University area in Hongdae but a bit smaller. Depending what you are shopping for, you may find bargains there as well. It's worth a visit to compare the difference. Personally, I like the Hongdae area better."
Wonderland,"Words cannot express how much i enjoyed the walk from subway station to Ehwa University, with all beautiful trees. Lots of cosmetic shops and food stall, along the street. Very friendly people. Love this place to bits."
Everything what ladies need,"Near Eawha Womens University, there are so many interesting shops, which have what ladies needs, including fashion, accessories, shoes, + delicious foods. Variety of design items. Worth visiting! Despite hot weather so many people on the street near the university."
Marvelous!!,"That long pathway is a refreshing sight! It's a picture perfect place so not having that selfie and jumpshot would be a pity! And the food at the canteen inside one of those glass walls are superb, yummy and cheap! Go try them out! "
women's shopping heaven indeed !,"Bags made in korea - good quality and cheap ! 10,000won only !! women can spend whole day shopping ! remember to bring your own shopping bag !!! lots of cafes here to rest your legs as well. most of the things sold here are made in korea. have a tour into the university campus as well, very huge !! there are some push carts outside the university, they are cheaper than those shops. i bought a couple of t-shirts from there at 7000 won only !"
New Architect and Old Buildings all at the same place,"An interesting place to visit; whereby one can see the modern building with glass panel at the entrance,with a very big garden compound and further away, the old school buildings and church buildings. I would like to study there if I have the chance. There were shopping streets outside the University, but you really need to have strong legs muscle to move around the areas as there are uphills, and down slopes. Many different food outlets around the area too; like Japanese, Chinese besides Korean food, so one will have no problem looking for their favorite bites."
Beautiful uni,"Nice buildings, lots of places for pictures, big shopping area nearby.Feel the youth vibe of Korea here."
University town,"Although it is called university it actually provides education from kindergarten up to college level, there is even a dormitory for foreign students. The university compound is very big, it's like a small town. All students and the teachers must be very healthy from all the walking exercise in the compound."
Beautiful campus with good shopping nearby,"Located next to Ewha shopping street, this university campus is a nice place to take a break, relax and appreciate the architecture."
Great for photos and shopping,The main attraction is definitely the huge walls/hallway in the middle of the university. Nice place for photos and probably great to just stroll around in spring or fall (we went during summer).Right beside the university is a shopping district which girls would love. Definitely a place to visit at least once.
If you love architecture ,I do so I thought the design was marvellous and made some great photographs. A massive escarpment beautifully lined. Within a 5 minute walk from the metro station of the same name. Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.
Shopping Good,A good place to buy inexpensive clothes. One of the places you can find clothes at 5000 won. We went other areas and same clothes cost more. Also lots of eateries and coffee joints
Beautiful university with good shopping,"It s a lovely university with a surprising underground lecture room and class room. The revolutionary new architecture is complimented by the old buildings , left from the period when it was a missionary school and college. The university is only a short distance from the Ehwa metro station. but along the way there is a lot of shops which cater to the university's students ( mainly young women). so it s a great combination of shopping , visiting a tourist site and then eating an inexpensive meal. ( the main target audience for the restaurants are university students ). another surprising thing you will see is the number of food deliveries when you visit the campus. we saw on average about 10 motor bikes for food delivery in the 45 mins we were on the campus ground. "
Fun place for shopping ,"This is a fun place to shop as there are many clothing stores selling cheap clothings at 5000 won or 10000 won. Besides cheap clothing stores, there are some that are more expensive clothing stores too. If you are not into shopping, you can still pop in to this place as there are many yummy eateries selling waffles, cake, coquettes and restaurant. Can spend 1-2 hours at least walking about here. "
Beautiful campus - great picnic spot,"If you come in late May, make sure you pick up a cold drink as you walk through the campus. It's gorgeous and the main plaza won an architecture award, great photo spot. You can get some inexpensive hair appointment right outside the campus. My local friend recommended the puff cream pastry at the campus bakery."
Amazing Buildings,"Ewha Womens University was crowned with tourists who took lots of photos there. Its nice buildings and environment make it is famous for the tourists to visit. Especially teenagers who watched Korean drama series, Ewha Womens University was the places for many series scenes. Ewha Womens University is surrounded by lots of shopping stores and coffee shop. I recommend everyone who visit Seoul to go there once in your trip. "
This is where the cheap shopping is! ,"Nice shopping streets in this area, clothes, fashion and skincare. Honestly, the prices here are much cheaper than in Myeongdong. I managed to get a pair of leggings at KRW5,000 here and in Myeongdong they quoted me like KRW15,000.People here are friendly and street food is yummy too. "
nice campus and spot to hangout,"We spend 1 hour here due to our impression of the buildings and flowers plus the weather is so nice. This university is called as edae. These areas very nice spot to hangout with friends and a lot of shops along the way from edae to sinchon area. Just walk around and mostly you will find the price is much more cheaper then Myeongdong. If you really want to buy schoolbags, please buy here (around edae). Mostly cost 10,000won instead of Myeondong (35,000won)Mostly, all women clothing here. The price range is 5,000 - 10,000. However, you cannot try all these cloth."
"hangout spot, nice campus","we stayed in Jongno gu, so we took Line 2 at Eurijo 3 ga to Ehwa station (only 10-15mins). we have spent 1hr in the univ campus, mostly due to the impression of the unique buildings. then we wandered around for shopping and trying the local street food. This area is famous as a hangout spot, dynamic atmosphere and youthful culture. Lot of shops surrounding the univ, you could spend all day there if you are shopaholic. The price seems cheaper than other shopping area like Myeungdong or Insadong."
Clothes shopping street,"Mins walk from Ewha Woman Univ. subway, Exit 1. The whole street mostly filled up by coffee house, boutique, selling casual wear. I targeted on casual wear and the pricing between KRW 5,000 to KRW 10,000. However, there is no trying on these casual wear and mostly are T-shirts, blouses, short pants/dress. I was able to grab some to be my souvenir and happy with the purchased."
Stand out campus,Unique view of education is portrayed by this highly reputable university in the heart of Mapo gu. Filled with beautiful landscapes and complemented by the beautiful students. It is a stand out institution. You can simple walk in and marvel at the blend of life on offer.
"Started out for students, but slowly gaining popular among foreigners.","What meant for students has started to gain popularity among foreigners. It was meant for students as they have little spending power but due to good products and reasonable price, it become popular with foreigners and now has been a tourist worthy visit place."
Nice campus ,Nice campus with beautiful surroundings. A lot of students walking around and they even have a souvenir gift shop for you to buy stuff and photo shoot places
Ewha,"Beautiful Campus. Fun walk. Surrounded by lots of Coffee Shops, some restaurants and even shopping.."
Good for sight seeing and architecture,The campus is huge and the famous underground classroom is a must see shot! You can spend around 30 mins to 1 hour here. There are shops and cafe inside the campus as well. 
Great shopping!,It is a great street to shop! There's also many food trucks along the way so you can shop and eat at the same time. 
Beautiful university,"Coincidentally pass by this uni when we walk around this area before check in hotel. We spend about half an hour here. We are here during spring season, but no chance to look for cherry blossom. And it's freezing cold when the day we at here. A lot of tourists visit to the campus.We only tour outside the campus. Take some landscape photos here. Many shops and cafeterias nearby the university. Good for shopping and eat."
Full of small shops for the young!,Has lots of small shops and roadside stalls. Had an interesting experience at the road side stall eating their twirled fish cake in a small soup bowl and their famous tteok-pokki. It was sure spicy till I cried and had runny nose!Stalls are indeed plentiful...spreading to 2 sides of the road leading to Ewha Womans Uni.Good for the ladies who love shopping. This is not a high end shopping area and there is so much to window shop if that's one of your past time.
Beautiful university campus,"Lots of photo opportunities in this university. Other than that, nothing much to do around this area. There are some street food nearby outside which sells the typical food, and some shopping too."
Nice Uni,Interesting mix of nature and old-school buildings. Looks quite different in the different seasons thanks to the trees and greenery.
University that amazed me every season I visit,"Ewha University will definitely amazed you in every season! My first visit was 5 year ago and it was summer. The weather was nice and warm, the trees are covered with green leaves and people are sitting on the grass enjoying the afternoon.And my second visit was last year winter. It was freezing cold. The leaves were gone and was covered with snows. It was amazing! It's the most beautiful university in Asia!Aside from the university, you may take an hour to stroll the area. There are many store, cafe and restaurants around."
Beautiful University,"A very beautiful university. Nice to wander around leisurely around the uni and also at the shopping street outside the uni.Close to Ewha Womans University subway station, just walking distance."
Very nice stroll around the campus.,"Visited this place cause it is a good option for early morning (since shops are still closed). Quite a nice stroll with a European feel. Convenient as it is near subway station and after the visit, the nearby shops are open so we can do some shopping as well."
Most amazing university ever.,The university is massive and have many unique buildings. Great place for photo taking. There is a garden in the middle for a great walk. Do take your time to climb the steps and have a great view at the university.
Good bargain of cosmetics,Most of cosmetics company that establish a cosmetic shop along the street near this university give a good bargain of cosmetics products. I prefer to shop cosmetics in this area rather than in Myeongdong. <3
Unique modern architecture for a university by Dominique Perrault,Check out the images on the internet and you will be amazed. Very serene surroundings. Just before reaching the university at a nearby ministop & am/pm store came across cherry blossoms too.
Nice area,Nice area to walk around in with many stores and places to eat. Quite easy to get to by the mrt or just by foot. 
Nice Architecture,This place had beautiful scenery & buildings. We had their Korean sushi inside the university. Walk around the place during autumn was really cooling & refreshing!!
Beautiful building!,"If you have a limited time schedule in Seoul,this is a place you can skip.It is a really beautiful University and a campus where filled with many curious tourists. "
Shopping Paradise,Clothes were super cheap and its superr nice!! Didn't get to shop much as I was left with little money. Would recommend to visit here first then myeongs=dong as my miney were all spent in myeongdong!
Great shopping district,Great spread of eateries of local delights.Shopping around the alleys with cute shops with its own taste of uniqueness and cuteness. Great spread of product varieties
Nice little university district,Impressive women college; grand building design and landscaping. Definitely a fun shopping area for women. I also tried a street food along the main Avenue. An egg muffin sort of breakfast; creatively served in a little cup. Only $1.
beautiful place,"beautiful university, combination of modern and contemporary building design and landscape. and not to forget affordable fashion district around the university. worth it!"
Lovely in Autumn,Beautiful school with lovely foliage scenery during our visit in November. Lots of street food and shops outside lining the streets leading to the entrance of EWHA.
Shopping around the university,"Many cheap and good shopping around the university. Also, many cafes and restaurant which are reasonably priced."
Beautiful campus,"It is a very gorgeous and elegant campus. The campus is close to subway station, short walking distance. On the way to the campus, many retail shops and street food vendors!!! Cheap & yummy snacks~When I arrived at the campus, I couldn't tell I was in Korea because the architecture of the building is so European to me. They have nice cafe & book store on campus too."
Gorgeous University!,"Aesthetically pleasing to visit! Lots of people around the area, the university is no different from a touristy landmark. The college buildings are amazing to look at. And the campus is close to lots of shops and brand name outlets. A one-stop center for all women needs, that is for sure. If you are looking for cosmetics, clothing and street food (not forget to mention a number of coffee shops with instagram-worthy design), this is the place. All said goods and services are priced from low- to high-ranged price. Definitely a safe place to visit as a female solo traveler - but of course, use your common senses no matter what. I went there as the winter is transitioning into spring - GORGEOUS. Visit, just visit! "
Honeymoon @ Ewha Womans University ,We were at the Ewha Womans Fashion Street so we walked a little to this University to take photos.We heard this is one of the top uni in Korea. Looks ancient.If you have a chance just pop by and have a look.
Very easy to get to and a good place for shopping and eating.,Ewha Womans University is easily reached via Seoul's metro/subway and the station is named accordingly so it is impossible to miss.The University itself is beautiful and has it's own visitor centre showcasing it's history.There are many retail shops and eateries in the vicinity and the products are majority catering to the ladies.The location is easily accessible by train and it is a great place to visit for both ladies and gentleman.
nice walk during shopping!,Ewha Woman University is right next to shopping area. The building and garden in the university entrance are nicely designed and you can enjoy different views in different seasons. It's a nice area to visit and take a few snapshots during the shopping with friends!
Shopping around Ehwa University area,"I used to visit Ehwa Univeristy to go shopping whenever I visited Seoul. This was my favorite place to hang out to buy clothes and accessories. However, I stopped going when it got popular with the tourists as it gets too crowded and the shops are not as unique as it used to be. The best years of my life shopping at Ehwa was the late 90's to early 2000's. I recently visited since my cousin attends school there and got to see how different it looks now. I guess times have changed and I moved on..."
Shopping place ,"It is a nice place to shop cosmetics and any skin products with lowest price compare to myeondong shopping street or else. But children won't like this place because mommies won't stay just for one or two hours in this place, a whole day won't be enough too"
Beautiful trees and maple leaves,"It's something u will never get to see in Singapore. It's a womans university but it looks like a tourist spot with so many ppl taking pictures outside. We did not venture in further, took pictures with the kids and left after 30 mins."
Modernized walkway going to the University entrance facade,"Great choice if you want to experience a youth type of activity as this is a place where there;s a need a long walk prior reaching the fascinating atmosphere of the university. Along the way you will bump in to different stores, street foods, coffee shops and mini attractions."
Cheap Shopping for the girls!,The shopping area around the area is considered relatively cheap as they cater mainly for the student crowds. There are also tons of eateries around and the prices are considered cheap.This is a place worth visiting!
Breezy and beautiful scenery!,"Beautiful architecture, breezy and traditional meets modern building. Picturesque and beautiful scenery. Many shops and great shopping nearby."
Shopping Time!!!,Ewha Womans University is a most beautiful university in Seoul. And there are many shop for shopping. There are cheap and very cheap.
What the fuss is all about,"Ehwa University is not too far away from Hongik University and they are served respectively by their own metro stations. Whilst Hongik is grungy and organic, Ehwa has a feel of stateliness about it. On top of the mound is the longstanding campus that's built by foreigners and it still proudly stands to these days, giving it a sense of tradition and history. In actual fact, Ehwa University is one of the most elite female university in South Korea. I truly wouldn't know how students there can concentrate in their studies noting that there are throngs of tourists that are taking selfies and wandering aimlessly around the campus the whole time. The key part of this University will be the Red Sea parting looking architecture designed by Dominic Perault. From afar, you look as if you are climbing the stairs that are flanked on both sides by rising waves. When you get closer, you start noticing that the rising waves happened to be window opening of university campus that's built in accordance with the gradient of the mount. It's cleverly done. Naturally, where there are tourists, there would be shops selling duty free stuff, cafes and restaurants and there are oodles of them nearby. Worth coming here for a look."
More than a common university in the city,"People talking Ewha in Seoul, it equates with a designated elite class of young ladies in S. Korea, with high academic standard, social status, and privileged status from the mass. Most parents spending most of their resources hopping to send their daughters into the university. Outsiders are not allowed going into the campus area, and just allowed to visit glance around the front park, buildings and a cafe at the reception park. But you might already be influenced by the ambience and surroundings, and pushed to take lots of photos. There are more than 30+ cafe just sitting outside the entrance of the university, and with several streets crowed with street hawkers. A good place to go in Seoul."
another shopping area,Just take a subway to Ewha Woman’s University Station (Line 2) Exit #2. There are shops everywhere along the busy road. You can also go into the university to have a look
A huge university,"Ewha Womans University is a huge university and is an ideal place for photograph. However, do check out the timetable there and avoid the students. Basically, it is just a university and nothing much different. There are only tourists without students if you go during the wrong timing. The Ewha Womans University Shopping Street outside is definitely better."
Ewha Womans University," In the three---month summer holiday, I take a visit to Seoul. And I also want to know more about the culture and study of different countries. The easiest way to know more about it is to get in the university to feel the atmosphere. So I take a visit to Ewha Womans University. We go there by subway. Actually, subway system is quite convenient for us to use. The surrounding of the university is also a commercial circle, like food stores, fashion shops and so on. I go shopping around the university with my friends firstly. The clothes are reasonable and fashion. You have a lot of choices. Then, we enter the university. The campus is really quite large. It also has many trees. This is what I enjoyed mostly. It is a nice place for people to take pictures. I advise those people who enjoy taking pictures need to have a schedule plan in order to arrange better time."
Great architecture!,"I recommend to visit this place at night. Search for the lit architecture and take a picture, it's definitely beautiful! Outside of this university is one great shopping area especially for women - a lot of cheap finds."
Beautiful campus - shopping paradise for girls/women,"The campus is beautiful! Great mixture of traditional european architecture with new, modern elements! Make sure to stroll around campus and just enjoy the view!Don't miss the art museum!! Right by the main entrance are a great number of stores, that will be every girls shopping dreams come true. Better hold on to your credit card ;)"
Will make you re-consider,A walk through the spacious campus can make you re-consider and think about getting a degree from here.You can feel the history and prestige in the air and everyone is very helpful around.The library looks great and is huge.
Nice walk round the campus,we walked outside the buildings and it was beautiful to take pictures. There is a kind of stately feel as you walked round the campus but it's not all buildings. There were trees and areas where you can sit around and enjoy the November cold. Good for photo-taking.
big and beautiful campus ,it's was my second visit.the campus is opened to public so long as visitors are well behaved. we were glad that it was not prohibited from visiting after there were incidents that students were affected during their lecture.everywhere in the campus is great spot for photo shooting. there's places for rest and relax as well.worth a visit!
"Stately, Pretty Buildings","Ewha Womans University has a beautiful campus that is fun to walk around. Possibly their main attraction is a ramp downstairs that leads to a huge stairwell back up. It is quite impressive, and fun to take photos around. I did not enter any of the buildings, aside from the shops lining the aforementioned ramp/steps. So I can not talk about the interiors, or classrooms. Oh- if you want to save the calorie burning, there is an elevator that takes you from the bottom of the ramp up to the top of the stairs area. The elevator is inside the glass building housing the shops!It was neat to walk around and see university students in another country. The surrounding area has well-priced clothing and make-up shops. Definitely worth checking out, as walking around is free. But if you miss it, don't beat yourself up."
Experienced the prestige ,A nice compound with spectacular views and architectural designs. Autumn colors added stories to the university and the prestige experience is worth a short visit if your time in Seoul permits
Beautiful University,"during autumn , this place is really beautiful...add that with the youth energy from the students, its a wonderful place to visit. The architecture is beautiful!"
Ewha Womans University walking street,"You will find the goods/foods at this area is much cheaper compare to Myeong Dong and Dongdaemum.you may spend a days to walk, shopping and site seeing at this area. "
Nice place to taste the street food,Ewha Womans University is easily accessible by subway train. There are plenty of street food to be savoured. Must try the Beansbins Coffee ice-cream waffle.
"A bit difficult to visit , as the signs ask you not to, if you're not a student",The signs ask you to politely refrain from visiting unless you are a student. So if you are a bit naughty you can still have a little bit of a wander to see the older buildings.
Not only an university,"Ewha Womans University is a good place to visit, not only the environment is good but also the shops around that area are great...Good quality and design shoes....Gd cafes...... and some small shops in those streets have good clothes."
Modern and classic university,"Ehwa University is definitely a worth going attraction in Seoul. The university distinguished itself with other universities by the uniqueness of most of the building inside, which you can see lots of lecture halls renovated from church. I visited this uni twice already and surely will bring my friends/family there during my next trip!  "
"Beautiful campus ground, cheap buys at nearby street and alleys",I doubt most people go to see the campus. Despite the heavy rain we still managed to get in to admire the beautiful landscapes and campus layout. The highlight however is the cheap clothing along the alleys and backstreet. Upon leaving the subway station you see the main street. Go to the backstreet running parallel to it and you'll find many shops selling clothing at bargain prices. Then use the savings to buy yourself coffee at one of the numerous cafes. 
Amazing structure,The under bridge idk what they call it was stunning. The gardens on the side as well. There are also shops outside the campus. It's a very wide campus and good scenery. A must visit for tourists.
Beautiful building!,"The pyramid looking building is as stunning as the pictures..which is the main reason people visit the University afterall. The surrounding area is small but charming, with a short little drag selling your usual cosmetics, clothes and some street food. There's also some cut cafes and restaurants down the slope infront of the Uni. There's this particular cosmetics store down there that sells goods for at least 40% cheaper than all the branded stores..DON't buy anything from there. It only welcomes tourists and for good reason! They either sell imitation Chinese products or stolen goods ;)"
Beautiful Campus,"The campus is simply beautiful as it was designed by French architect, Dominique Perrault. You can take many amazing photographs here. The shopping street is also great and you can get good buys, even for men. It is also accessible via metro (alight at Ehwa Women's University)"
Feels like in Europe,"This campus has unique, modern and amazing architecture. Really love this place! I would be very diligent if i were one of this campus student"
"Unique, beautiful university",This university's design is very unique. The area is very beautiful. Love the feeling of Autumn at this place. 
Dominique Perrault architecture,"We were here for the campus centre by French architect, Dominique Perrault. Such a beautiful and brilliant design. Definitely worth visit!"
Interesting and scenic,"Went there on a weekday in the afternoon, so it was not crowded. Nice setting with interesting architecture. Even on a weekday there were many overseas visitors. It was a sunny afternoon so it was ideal for taking photos. One could walk around quite freely except for restricted areas. The central V-shaped walkway was the centre piece of the university and it looked great in the late afternoon when the sun was setting."
Nice place,It's one of the most old university in South Korea they say. It's known as woman university but don't worry cause man can go in there too. It's open for public and they have strict open time.
Shopping area,"This university is faamous not only for the enviroment, it is also the surrounding area has lots of restaurant and cafes as well as shops. Don't miss out all the shops... just can't stop crzay shopping. "
Shopping,We probably did most of our shopping here. There are so many stores along the Ewha Womans University street. The deals are amazing as well! 
Baroc biuldings!,A very beautiful uni built on a hill so you need to go up lots of stairs if you want to see all the buildings. The street leading to it are full of shops that sell cheap clothes and shoes. lots of things to eat. a small park where you can rest and refresh.
As an university its amazing but...,The campus of this university is amazing and its worth a visit. But remember its a university. You get to take a stroll through the campus which is amazing. It also got some nice looking buildings.
Good place to go around,Ewha university has few nice places where you can take nice photos. A plenty of restaurants and shops available for shopping / dinning. A good place to visit during your Seoul stay.
Korea's first women's university,Large campus with modern design for some parts. You will also find a lot of shopping Streets very crowded in the afternoon. 
"For shopping, eating & taking pictures","Edae is a must-see place in Seoul. You can check out the Artbox (stationery/cute goods store) right outside the station. As you walk towards the university, there are also lots of shops along the main road and stores with cheap, trendy clothes if you walk into the streets (mostly for women). This is a great place to photograph. I went in the beginning of May so the flowers had just bloomed. There are lots of restaurants and coffee shops around to choose from. I ate at an awesome shabu shabu restaurant hidden up the hills. & there's an Auntie Anne's nearby! (I love pretzels.)"
Beautiful university!,"I gonna say their campus is so beautiful, a great place to take photo. we went in and had lunch at their food hall. there are shops in the campus as well. Be sure to check out the shopping area located right outside the uni."
Many restaurants and shops in the area,You'll find some great restaurants and many shops in the area. It's a nice place to visit. Especially try to find Italian restaurants.
Beautiful University Campus,This is an oldest woman's university in S. Korea. The campus of this university is worth to visit especially in autumn time. The buildings here are in classic style. Many tourist come here. Recommend to visit during weekday.
"Little ""England""",Was amazed that so many tourist flocked to visit Ewha Woman's University the whole's largest female uni & one of the most prestigious uni in South Korea. It is located in a small town very much like in England. Spend some time to the University Museum - it's free entry.
Stunning campus and shopping area,Spend an hour or two in the campus walking around and end up shopping at the shopping street before having a cup of coffee nearby.
Worth a walk!,I always saw this campus through Korea shows and wanted to come for a look. Glad that I came because the buildings are so interesting. I didn't get to walk around for a long time because it rained when I got there. Definitely come with someone so they can help you take some good pictures! 
An architecture documentary made me come,"Honestly I had seen a documentary on the newest part of Ewha campus and I was interested, so I naturally visited. The newest part built by Dominique Perrault Architecture is impressive and enchanting. It somehow beckons you to come and explore more of the university grounds. If you love architecture and want to see how an addition to an old campus works wonderfully - visit. Even if you aren't that interested around Ewha are wonderful shops and places to get a great outfit."
A stunning campus,"The campus is, in a word, stunning, and close to the famous Ewha Women's Shopping Street. It is a good place for a stroll to appreciate the architecture on display. Green and well maintained. The terrain is quite hilly so be prepared."
"Best shopping area for women, stunning campus!","I walked outside the area of the library and the main church. the campus is huge but very clean and impressive with the little green areas. The entrance of the library makes a great place for pictures. When you visit this area, you will notice the the shopping area nearby. And this is an absolute must place to visit for those women who love shopping for bargains and deals. Most of the items vary between 5.000-15.000 WON. I literally spend an entire 8 hours here with my friend shopping around. "
Really nice uni,"Well, I was there for a conference so we got to walk around the area and use facilities indoors. Area is lovely designed, and architecture is really awesome. Peaceful, clean and nice outing "
Nice architecture,"The architects have done a good job with this place. The main attraction is definitely the 'valley' which curves under and up again. The campus buildings are of note too - if you have time, do walk around. Head to the university streets for affordable goods thereafter."
Women's Education is important ,"I am pleased that Korean women were able to get an education due to Lulu E Frey. I enjoyed the history, architectural and culture element today. There are a few good pieces in the Museum and the one on filial piety caught my eyes. The renovations of the university grounds took a long while. The modern lines complimented the old building very well. "
Worth a visit,The architecture is great with a mix of old and modern. It's nice for a quick walk around and there is a small free museum at the entrance with a nice sample of Korean art and wood furniture (and air conditioning of you just want to wonder around and cool off for 15 mins)
Designed buliding,"If you love to visit a good place and good-designed building, you should go here! Not only take photos but along the street you can shop and eat a good stuff and food. For women you will love here you will find the cheap and nice clothes and skincare product all day and night."
Cheap shopping,The shopping street area is not big so can just spend some time here before moving on to those underground malls with equally cheap clothings. Came here just to check out the Uni..
fine architecture game,"it's super interesting to see the main building, with the famous downhill staircase, and the surrounding nature."
Love the street outside the university,"there are many stores selling beauty products, tibits, shoes, bags, and accessories. There are also cheap eats along the road. A few reasonably priced restaurants around the corner as well."
Beautiful university campus and museum,"This is a resubmission with changes. ID#: 378445951Take Subway Line 2 to Ewha Womans University station, exit 2 and walk a few minutes towards the campus. Stop at the Visitor Center on your right and learn about the history of the university and visit the gift shop where they have a very nice selection of items. Walk around the campus complex designed by the French architect that did the Pompidou Center in Paris. Make sure to stop at the Museum where you will find Korean paintings, ceramics, metal items and sometimes special displays. It is a museum where you can get a good view of Korean art in a pleasant atmosphere and in a short period of time. Outside the Museum there is now a trendy coffee shop. If you have time, walk on the streets outside the campus and you can find MANY cosmetic stores, clothing shops (note that they do not let you try on the clothes), shoe stores and the best bargain in Korea: socks for $1/pair (they make great gifts). In addition there are many inexpensive eating places--my favorite is Albab Restaurant (2nd street from the campus on the way to the subway), it has bibimbap for $4-$5 and many other dishes.If you go at night, the area is bustling with young people. The stores and eateries are opened well into the evening hours. This is a fun place to visit."
"Love the Campus, love the street","I visited this campus in April. Campus is so 'Europe' and love the environment so much. You can see 'Li hwa' everywhere ( this is the name where it come from, I think). Cheap clothes and accessories for woman when you walk down from the street. Prices lower than myeodong. There are some stalls located along the street and nice try. Be a one day student when you visit this spot!"
luxury university,"it must be a good thing to do learn in this campus, with complete facility and luxury place, very clean, quiet "
Cheap fashionable clothes and delicious street food,"A university area that's vibrant and full of people. There are food carts lined up and scattered all over, with cheap but delicious food. The clothing stores tend to sell similar items. Some store owners are friendly and will let you haggle down the prices. Most of the clothing are of one size though but there are stores which cater to tourists and sell larger sizes. You can get the trendiest clothing from here for a very good price! Stores do not stay open until late because it's a student area!"
One of the most popular University in Korea,"I had a assistant professor gave me the tour of the school. It was surprisingly large campus with lots of characteristics from contemporary to modern buildings, flowers are all over the campus which was so nice.I can see Starbucks to McDonald right outside of the campus, most chain stores are there."
Beautiful Campus but it only tood me 15 minutes to finish it all,"Visited this famous campus and while it is no doubt, one of the most beautiful campus, the area is just too small for me to make an effort to come here just to visit. Spend more time around the campus if you're into woman's fashion, sweet shop ... basically, everything woman related"
Beauty Products and Fashion Galore,"As the female university is in the area, there are many stores selling beauty products, clothes, shoes, bags, and accessories. There are also cheap eats along the road."
A tourist spot for youngsters and the like,I did not expect that this is an attraction aside from the market near the university. I suppose that it's not only students who come here often but also those who want to buy in the market and those who want to see the aesthetic beauty of this university.
interesting architecture,"Spent about 30 minutes inside the campus to admire the architecture, which is beautiful. It has a nicely manicured garden great for pictures. Huge number of clothing, shoes and accessories shops outside the campus. Lots of street food and cafes in the area too."
"Nice Campus, nice view of Seoul's night view","We had some time to kill so we decided to visit this women only school. The school was founded by the missionaries in 1889 (?). Very nice job of landscaping here.. so beautiful. Buildings were all sitting on the hills, so there's some hiking to do get there. Once you are on the top of the hill (where ladies dormitory buildings are), you have a wonderful view of Seoul's night lights, as well as the view of the Namsan Tower. "
Great shopping street,"We went there by cab and stop right in front of the university. Pity we did not explore the campus though but the area was good for shopping and more so if you are on a Budget. You can find some street kiosk selling food and some cafes here and there. Of course, not to mention Korea cosmetic stores that you can practically see it everywhere you go."
this campus is sooo pretty!,"go walk around Ewha Womans University, its really prettyy. go walk around the Ewha shopping street just outside the university, affordable clothes! "
Ewha Uni landscape of beauty,Ewha Womans University is a private women's university in Seoul founded in 1886 by the American Methodist Episcopal. It is the world's largest female educational institute. Ewha Womans University is one of the prestigious universities in South Korea.We visited the place because its such an awesome campus.
A university which is also a tourist attraction,"This university is specially catered to girls and women. It is open to public and there is a beautiful garden (not sure it is as it does looks like one to me) at the centre of the compound where you can take a walk around, taking pictures etc. Along the way to the campus, there are rows of shops that sell fashion apparels, bags, accessories, cosmetics and street food too. The things there are relatively cheap maybe it is near the school. Good place to shop around (though area not big) if you are looking for fashionable stuff."
Great shopping area!,Love the shopping here. Most shops are selling from 5000-10000 won clothes!!! Some street foods along the road. Did not go into the university to check it out.
incredible campus,"incredible campus to walk around or play games in the grass, recommend walking up and down the street just in front of the uni for food, snacks, bubble tea, and cool little clothing shops."
Very beautiful and unique architecture,The architecture design of this building was unique and the landscape of the surrounding was very beautiful especially during spring which will be so colourfully.
Unique building structure,The campus is large and hilly. It has interesting building structures that one can browse around. It is about 5-10 mins walk from the subway station
"Ladies shopping, minus crazy crowd","A good spot in Seoul for ladies shopping if you cannot stand crazy tourist crowds. There are quite a selection of street food too. Do expect to see many ladies on the street, not a problem at all but quite fascinating."
Shopping,"I happen to visit Ewha University when I was shopping around the area. OMG, ladies this is the best place to come shopping for clothes if you're on a budget. Most of the shops here sell their items less then other locations on the exact item plus you can negotiate too. Sellers can speak decent english and they're all very nice. Ewha University is very beautiful too. There were a lot of tourist visiting here."
Beautiful place,"I was in awe of the beauty of this place. Also jealous of the students who get to study in this beautiful place! Best to come during winter, where the sky is blue and you can take nice photos. You can shop and checking out the fashion street, with plenty of selections for clothes, cosmetics and dessert cafe. We are not sure why majority of the tourist would not visit here, but it's definitely a must & highly recommended for me, at least in my opinion!"
Amazing library,Nice place to take lot of photo or just relax with your take away coffee at library stairs.It's one of tourist attraction.
Good place to shop arround,"I stayed in a hostel less than 3 minutes away from Ewha Woman University main gate, and it is a great place to stay. There are a lot of clothes shops arround the streets, and a lot of delicious food. The university is also really pretty, but there is nothing much to see if you are not a fan of arquitecture"
Grand university,Beautiful university conpound. Another good choice for shopaholics n food hunters. Surrounding environment is peaceful. Worth to visit!
A place of history and significance,A long history of looking down at women ended here and freedom and significance sprang out. Buildings are nice and the new library is beautiful. Take time to walk around and learn the background and history of the place. Worth the time if you are interested in a deep insight into Korea and it's history 
Mind Blown,"It was completely the biggest and I'm so jealous of the students studying in such a prestigious university, I'm so in love with its vast architecture and the long wide staircase at the front, not to mention the varsity jackets are smashing! "
Interesting place to walk around,"This place is huge and filled with students. The surrounding areas are worth a walk around, especially up the slope to the church. There are plenty of eating and shopping places around too. "
Shop till you drop!,"It's a great place to shop for clothes, bags and accessories! I find that the clothes here are sold a reasonable cheaper price than those at Dongdaemun and Myeongdong for similar or same designs (Please don't buy clothes at Myeongdong as they will rip you off - the only thing you should buy there is cosmetics) However, I suppose the clothes here will be more suitable for girls of 18-25 years old - if you are going for the Korean girl college look! There are also several shops which sells handmade bags at around 10000 KRW. It's really affordable to shop here! "
Just an ordinary university campus,"There are a few pretty buildings and the campus ground is well maintained. Nothing stunning, just a small university."
Uhmm...,"If you're fan of K-reality show so yes, otherwise, see know reason to visit, feel free to skip this spot & head straight to Hongik statio, where definitely more fun & happenings."
Delightful Gardens,Beautiful place to see the cherry blossoms as well as all the flowers that bloom there month after month in the spring. There is also a soccer field if you're craving sports and have a soccer ball. It's a great place to walk around when you're on a date. Then again so is Yonsei University campus...
"If u r already in this area, its worth it to visit.","Its nice to look for maybe half an hour around this beautiful university and visit the small museum there, but only if u r in this are anyway."
For young people and nice environment ,"This place mostly the stuffs are for youngsters. However, if you want to just take photos, this is also a place for you to look around and take pictures too. "
Shopping Galore,"I went here because I read that it was a great place to shop. We taxied here and didn't visit the actual woman's university (though I hear it is lovely), but instead shopped and ate around the university. Because we were next to a college, the prices were definitely lower than we saw elsewhere in South Korea. There were also tons of clothes and shoes and beauty stores. Since I'm a plus-size gal, I wasn't able to buy any clothes as the sizes probably went up to a Medium/Large max (US size). However, there were tons of a food stalls and restaurants so we ate a lot (there's a little old lady who made really delicious takoyaki). The whole shopping area is maybe 3x3 blocks. However, it is very steep. So I highly recommend starting at the top and work your way down. My mother had a hard time walking at some point and had to take a break. "
Shopping time,We go there for haircut. Always want to do different thing. Heard that that area has many hair saloon. So go there for haircut. Never expect to see many shopping. They sell things cheaply!! 
Beautiful uni for photos,"It is the most beautiful uni i have seen. Great to chill out, take some pictures and have some good memories over school days. "
Nice for a walk or a family Sunday,"Very nice place and archtecture, a mix of modern and classical style, with a lot of green. Recommend the place for taking pictures and family walk with kids."
One of my favourite place!!,Very beautiful university.. For Ewha Street..Best ever!.. I bought a coat..very nice autumn coat at very reasonable price..so many clothing stores.. trendy fashion..suitable for teenagers and shopaholic too..
beautiful church,The most attraction was the church just in the main entrance. beautiful views around. The shop there was cheap that i bought 2 bags of Chia seeds for around £3.
Very cool!,I took sooo many pictures.. The imensity and the architecture is breath-taking! What you have to do is to go to the park and from the top of the stairs take a picture of the whole building(library). I definitely recommend it! 
"Beautiful school, some cheap shops, and great street food","The campus itself is really pretty and a quiet reprieve from the noise of the city. The library is stunning and the surrounding area offers lots of cheap shops that cater to the college crowd (and their budgets). Not as touristy as Myeongdong and less crowded than Hongdae. If time is limited, I would suggest just Hongdae though since the surrounding area has more to offer in way of restaurants and shops."
Love the outer view of Church,"First women college in Korea. If you're a fan of running man, this is a must-visit-spot for you. Definitely worth a visit. All kind of foods available across the street as well. "
Cute Stationary stuff and young ladies of Seoul,"Lots of cute stationary stuff and of course, the young ladies of Seoul are everywhere. Mesmerizing architecture, East-meet-West and make sure you visit the famous Ewha University's terrace. Enjoy the sunbath especially in winter is surprising pleasing. A buzzing place to visit. "
Beautiful place to visit & shopping for ladies,"My family enjoyed strolling through the street foods as soon as we exit the station and walking towards Ewha Women's University Campus.There are lots of shops along, on your left and right side of the road. Shoes, hair saloon, clothes & some branded name retailers.We were amazed at the architecture of the Campus, with classic & modern design infused together.Lovely place to visit!Tips to the venue:- Go to Station Ewha Women Uni,exits # 2 & 3.- 5 mins walk."
Great Shopping,"We didn't actually go to the university, we just went for the shopping and the food! Originally we went there for the bagel place in the evening, which is conveniently also located next to Annie's Pretzels (delicious). We ended up coming back the next day because we liked the area so much and wanted to shop more. The clothes and accessories are cute and the shopkeepers are not as pushy as other, more popular shopping places. You can't haggle at all places (usually the bigger stores) but the prices were generally quite cheap. After shopping I retired to Angelinus cafe which was very comfortable and had a nice view of the street. Overall my favourite shopping experience in Seoul."
Pretty university ground for photo taking,"This university has many beautiful grounds for photo shoots. I'm especially attracted to the stairsway and I think our whole family can spend half a day here. Other than that, the best part of visiting here is the food and shopping area just right outside the university. Pretty good for a campus life. "
best street food and good shopping,Visited in winter again and went there at least 3 days during my entire trip. The street food were the best my friend and I have eaten during this trip that we found ourselves going back there just to eat. Shopping was good and cheap too. The university campus itself is also beautiful. My friend and I had a good time taking photos there.
Is a good place to shop and eat,"When here after Hong dae and like this place better, although there is not so much performance but the shopping and food is nicer and cheaper... "
Best of the unis,"I'm slightly biased, having worked here back in the day, but the Edae campus is positively gorgeous in the spring and autumn, rivaling Kyunghee University in its foliage. The impressive 'Gash"" carved through what used to be the Lover's Hill in the middle of the campus is definitely to be seen. In the nearby Edae/Shinchon area is the usual gamut of cosmetic/ coffee/ café shops you'd expect wherever young women congregate."
Excellent Place to laze about with family,Lovely place to spend the morning and/or afternoon on a cool Dec winter. Lots of shops to put into practise your bargaining skills!.Always found it enjoyable to walk the streets & lanes with the kids while wifey goes around searching for a good bargain. Had a nice toast & coffee with both my son & daughter at Isaac's Toast which lies smack in the middle near to where the area selling shoes are located. Strongly recommend this place whenever you're in Seoul ...
Lovely University! while there are many good things to shop!,"The University is so attractive that i wish i could study there.There are lots of coffee shops, restaurants and little shops.The shops are very good price compare to other areas and the quality is better than in Dongdaemun. I will definitely go back there to shopss till i drop again!!"
Pleasant trip,Very cheap food and cheap clothing and shoes. Juno hair was also their and three of our family member had our hair cut. Very professional hair stylist and the saloon was very big with many hair stylists.
Lovely college and great surroundings to explore,"This is my 2nd visit to this lovely area. We were blessed with beautiful autumn leaves this trip. We love this place because it has such a youthful atmosphere where shops and restaurants caters mainly for young adults. Ladies would love this place as fashion houses sells mainly ladies clothings and reasonably priced. The university's grounds is worth a visit and good photo shots can be captured. Before you leave, it is worth having a meal in one of the many restaurants here. The food is tasty and cheap.Recommended place to visit."
Women college , unfortunately if your not a student you are not allowed to walk on the premise of this college. It is conveniently close to the subway and there are good restaurants nearby.
Good school for girls,This universiity is well know for the elite Korean women. Nearby this place is good for shopping too.
Beautiful University and wonderful neighborhood to wander around,"The architecture of the campus is amazing. So many beautiful buildings. A hidden gem indeed. Nice place to visit and walk around (I went in the morning during classes, I did not stay too long to avoid bothering students, teachers and people studying and working there).Also during Autumn the landscapes were even more enchanting. They have nice shops inside, where you can buy nice stuff from the University.Also the surrounding area is nice to visit, good restaurants and good shops."
Beautiful university,"A very nice place to take photo , love the architect building ,shops and eateries nearby. Easily accessible by subway"
an iconic uni in Seoul,"This is one of the first women uiniversity in Seoul opens specifically for womens to further studies. there's a shopping alley near the uni that sells stuffs women loves (shirts, shoes, makeups etc) and the price is comparatively cheaper here than Myeongdong. This place also full with cafes, restaurants and street food vendors. "
One of the best public places to See Autumn,"This University resides along a very trendy street. It is opened to public and we spent the time enjoying the scene and taking pictures around the campus. You will see may tourist who came especially to visit this place.My parents enjoy the view very much. out of the campus, you will see a lots of small shops along the street. There are lots of trendy accessories, clothes, shoes and bags for the ladies."
Sight and Shop,"I've been here twice, spring and autumn. And I would say, it's one of the must attraction in Seoul. After a round at the university grounds, shopping area is just a stone throw away. Got hungry? No problem! Lots of restaurants to choose from."
Beautiful campus,"Gorgeous campus regardless of which season it is. Probably one of the best places in town to see autumn foliage. Would be great if visitors observe good manners and do not cause excessive disruption to the students as it is, after all, an educational institution."
Nice shopping Street near this uni!,"Love the shopping street here and all the cafes, Prices for shopping here is good too as compared to shopping at Myeongdong shopping area and also it is less crowded here. If you visit this area, go and try this fantastic eatery which serves very goooood unique bimbimbab, ""Alchon Flying Fish Roe Bimbimbab"".... it is damn good and cheap at KRW 3600/bowl! "
Make this a destination ,"This is an easy walk from the subway, the surrounding open market for food and clothing items is interesting, and the campus is really excellent. The architecture of the central building is unique; we also toured the excellent museum which had an historic ceremonial gown exhibit as well as Joseon Dynasty porcelains. The English descriptions were highly informative. In November, when we were there, the Fall colors were still on the campus trees. We truly enjoyed walking around the campus enjoying the varied architecture and charming paths."
Autumn and Winter - Cold but Beautiful Campus,"Designed smartly, this campus is one of the most unique I've ever seen. During autumn and winter, tree leaves get red and yellow, making it perfect for shots. Around it, you may find lots of coffee shops, clothing * cosmetic shops for girls. Recommend for young couples."
Beautiful campus,"Due the fact that our daughter is studying in that particular university we spent hours walking up and down in the campus area having once a birthday party outside. We found campus to be a peaceful place with old and modern architecture, places for picnic etc. Happy to having been able to see this historically special university."
$10 (U.S.) Handbags and Backpacks,"There's shopping around this university that's famous for selling designer's copies of handbags and backpacks for around $10 U.S. There's also clothes and shoes, and highly discounted cosmetic products that is as fake as the bags (I was told). You get what you paid for..."
1 of the most beautiful campus,I loved this campus. It's very beautiful. We spent quite some time just walking around and enjoying this very spacious and beautiful campus. They also had their own museum and church which anyone can visit for free. 
"Beautiful autumn leaves, shopping & cathedral","A great spot for photography and capturing the alluring beauty of red autumn leaves just before winter beckons. The cathedral, long flight of stairs, spacious grounds is a good change after some shopping."
Modern and beautiful university,"I didn't realise that the university would feel so modern! The university has different kind of architectures, which can be interesting to see. There's a lot of green areas at the campus, so it doesn't feel like you're in the middle of Seoul."
Impressive architecture,This campus close to a bustling area of Seoul is impressive as far as its architecture is concerned. A high building with all student facilities is kind of burried on the ground. Have a look from Pera's Café.
Absolutely beautiful in August,I've read and heard how interesting this place is in terms of its architecture and grounds. My family visited in autumn and the place was breath-taking. Colorful Autumn leaves enhances the beauty of the architecture of the university. We spent about 2 hours in this place. My mum is in her eighties and we pushed her round on a wheelchair. I was very happy to note that the place is wheelchair friendly. Do pop into the University to check out their extensive gym and facilities. There's lots of cafes nearby to enjoy a relaxing day after walking the grounds.
Please visit the school during the weekend,"I would advise tourists to visit during weekends as the university is in operation and it is for students, definitely NOT for tourists.It is sad to see the school has turned into a tourists' selfie ground."
Bustling university town,"Plenty of things to do in this university town- awesome shopping for clothes, shoes etc. There are also cafes to chill out and lots of street food! Highly recommended to spend an afternoon here especially for girls who want to shop for clothes. "
Interesting place,For a university this sure is a happening place... lots of shops and eateries at decent prices... had fun here exploring the nooks and crannies 
Place For Your Portraits,Take some time to take some profile photos with unique background buildings & scenery. Very beautify during the autumn time. Best is to bring a long a mug of coffee or tea and relax on the bench in the campus garden. 
Lovely view,This place is in my to go list when in Seoul. Amazing view and surprisingly quite peaceful eventho it is near to the shopping street. 
Very romantic place to go,The university is totally different and very beautiful. At night it is very romantic. Lots of street food.
Modern university with historical buildings as well,"This is just across the street from the shopping area, and it's worth dropping by for photos of the scenery and architecture. Lots of cafes and cosmetic shops around (Olive Young, Watsons, Holika Holika, etc) since it is a women's uni, after all, and food carts as well that sell everything from waffles, fried chicken with sauce, skewered kebabs to Korean snacks. There is a croquette shop that I frequent whenever I drop by. Also, there are ATMs around if you need to cash for shopping! "
Beautiful architecture,"This was my first time to visit this uni, but was excited to see it because of all the pictures I've seen. I love how huge and clean the campus is, the architecture made of glass is perfect for a photoshoot. The buildings are like those in Europe, it made my heart leaped and just tried to take it all in. It was definitely an eye candy.I couldn't imagine how it's like to be a student there, I would love to hang out on those steps while studying or just roam around and sit on the wooden benches. Perfect also was the weather when we went there.BUt I noticed there were a lot of tourists roaming around taking pictures so I dont know If some students/classed were disrupted because of this.Shopping is also perfect for tourists after roaming the campus. They said Ewha is already cheap when it comes to shopping but I find the coats still expensive but designs were really nice. It's soo confusing what to get because they really have a great selection. Truly Koreans are very fashionable.There are also restaurants in the street.better spend the morning in the campus cause not much tourists then shop afterwards."
Beautiful Campus,The university campus is large and beautiful. Can find good bargains and pretty cheap clothings from surrounded shopping street areas. 
Beautiful University and don't forget to shop at the street!,"University is open for public to visit, it's so beautiful i hope i could study there :)There's some nice food nearby too. Try Nene Chicken Ewha branch and you won't regret it! Their snowing chicken is the best. Cosmetics and apparels can also be found around Ewha university at a cheaper price compared to Myeongdong. A must visit place especially for girls!"
around this area,you can shopping around this area. Architecture this university is very unique. i hope i can studying in here :(
Gorgeous Campus,Beautiful campus and well cared for. Everyone was polite and helpful. The architecture is stunning and worth the visit to experience the campus.
Nice walk around the campus,"My friend spent a semester studying here so I crashed her lectures one day--and i fell in love with the campus. it's really nice to walk around the campus, chatting up with the local students"
Pleasant place to walk around,"Don't really have anything specific to expect for a university. It turned out a nice place to walk around and enjoy the atmosphere and environment there. The famous wall at the entrance is good for photography. The design of the garden at the front entrance is nice. If time is right (for cherry blossom or red leaves), it should be a good place to visit again."
Historical Woman's University - Worth a Visit if you have time,Ewha Womans University's campus is a pleasure to walk. The modern architecture of the newer buildings was impressive. Walking the streets around campus was fun.
Spending an afternoon around Ewha Womans University,Interesting university area surrounding Ewha. Many stand alone boutiques and shops as well as the whole plethora of familiar korean skincare stores.The haircuts here are also slight less pricey than an average salon in Seoul city centre. Lots of sidewalk food stalls to eat from.
Awesome Architecture,"Beautiful university! Don't forget to do some shopping around the area, there are several streets with clothes, cosmetics, etc. One of the good place to shop!"
Interesting designs,"The university is beautiful with its unique architecture. Didn't really walk into the university. Do take note that they don't want visitors to disturb their students, so do follow their rules when you are there. There are also shops opposite the university. Do walk around this area and enjoy the view."
Beautiful University - Awesome Architecture,Nice architecture of the buildings and has a good atmosphere for studying. It was a huge area and nice view and really relaxing to walk around.
the shops opposite ewha university,"best, best, best and awesome place to be with.. around the area, so many street shops to go and super duper cheap."
Nothing much,"My expectation is very high after reading the reviews. But, I'm quite disappointed as it doesn't seem anything special about the university. But, the stairs which are built between the classes is such a nice view and excellent idea of architecture!"
Place of intellectural beauties,"The first time I visited in sunny weather. What a spacious old college style, with precious woods and glamorous buildings. I took a relaxing walk under sunshine. Advise to go in early morning with fewer or even no visitors. The only thing that made me feel unpleasant is the signage at main entrance appealing the Mainland China visitors not to photo on the students, and I opine it is discriminating to Chinese travelers for all."
Academic ambience and window shopping indulgence,"I came from Singapore but none of our universities (be it National University of Singapore or Nanyang Technological University) are located within very close proximity from a shoppers' paradise but both Hongik University and Ewha Womans University in Seoul are surprisingly and amazingly within the radius and close proximity of a modern shopping belt. Probably, there are research studies that revealed that undergraduates perform better when they are able to relieve their exam stress and anxiety through window shopping. While in Seoul, I stayed at BoA guesthouse; Hongik University and Ewha Womans University were within walking distance from the guesthouse. I took about 40 mins to walk to Ewha Womans University. I had read that Ewha Womans University is one of the top most prestigious universities in South Korea and the world's largest women educational institute. The university was built in 1886 by an American female Methodist missionary who named it `Ewha' which means `pears in blossom' after noticing a number of pear trees at the campus site. Among the many graduands were Former First Lady of South Korean Presidents. I took a walk around the campus and found the `American colonial' architectural style of the campus buildings amazing. The `foreign flavor' of the campus setting gave an impression that the university is located in America . The garden landscape around the campus was well manicured and beautiful. The environment was peaceful and tranquil and very conducive for learning. The sculpture of the female American Methodist missionary was also erected near the entrance building. I have great respect for such a lady whose contribution had benefited millions of women in South Korea. South Korea inherited Confucianism from Ancient China and the doctrine of this philosopher demonstrated little respect for the advancement of women's education in feudal society. The Sage equates the status of women to that of the `mean Man' whom he had difficulties in handling them. It was surprising that the South Korean authority permitted the founder to open such a private higher institute of learning solely for women in the 19th century when Confucianism still enjoyed great status in South Korea. Today South Korea, even the President is a lady. South Korean women now enjoys equal status as men. The emancipation movement for woman would not have achieved the intended results without the great contribution of people like this founder of Ewha Womans University, Mary F Scranton, who champions for the right of women to attain and achieve higher academic excellence. The area around the university is a great place to shop and Ewha Womans University is a great University!"
great place for shopping,I really love Korean fashion so I loved here more than dongdaimoon. It is very modern and there is many sales. I would recommend you go.
No Reason to Visit,"It is a university for the women, and although it was constructed back in the day, but I personally cannot find any reason to visit this place. It's not beautiful. Just plain university."
Nice Architecture.,"Thrilled to find out how open this university to everyone that it became a tourist attraction by itself. Loved how the classic western buildings complement with the modern style landscaping, especially the sunken stairs."
Great night out,Students put on small restaurants as part of a university event. Plenty of food and Soju.... a great way to start the evening!
Pretty,Its so pretty there. Would love to go to school there. I bet theres a lot to explore but i went on such a hot day i just couldnt do it... This place also had other things to offer like shopping and cafés
University near Sinchon,"This is 2 stops away from Hongik University. The University itself is ok, there is some good architecture, but around it the food is mainly bad cheap student food, unlike at Hongik. If you want really great food go one subway stop away to Sinchon."
Enjoy the neighborhood,"Ewha university is a great artistic architecture and a fantastic campus, worth visiting and also the shopping street around with great deals and alive environment. This all plus a wide range of cafes and restaurants.You can find lots of trendy female clothes. enjoy the area."
Great shopping area for females,Good shopping area for the females. Would always visit this area when i am in Seoul with my partner. Be sure to try out the Flying Fish Roe Bibimbap at Albab.
Nice busy shopping place,Good place to visit with lots of little food stalls along the streets. Lots of shops and cheap cosmetic shops.
Love the architecture,"The architecture here is just beautiful, and also just next to this place is known to be a shopping area so perhaps shoppers would love this place."
Lovely place for a wander,I wandered around on a hot day. There was a nice museum at the entrance. I enjoyed the old buildings. You don't get many in a European style in Korea. 
Excellent museum,"Quite apart from the unusual external staircases, the university has an excellent museum which concentrates on Korean culture and history. Well worth taking the time to visit if you have exhausted yourself with all the palaces and temples!"
Best i ever had,"here is the most beautiful place i ever had, i used to study there for 3 month and i got a very good experience there good teacher good friend ^^ . Further these university is very beautiful with perfect design and lovely cherry blossom in Spring ^^ . Once i have a chance to go to Korea these place is the must to go !"
Beautifully landscaped and in the heart of downtown.,"Surrounded by the most popular boutiques, restaurants and pubs in the city. Proximity to three local universities makes it a great environment for young people on a budget but is the height of modern Korean fashion."
Good shopping place,Idea to shop in this place. There are many things to see and the cafe around here serve good coffee.
"shopping, food, dessert, everything!","the best ever for me, the university is very beautiful landmark! near to the university have different cosmetic shop, if you dont like myeongdong, you can come to ewha, plenty of the coffee shop also right here. "
Ewha Womans University,"I'm not sure why anyone other than prospective students would come here. The surrounding area is no different than any other college campus neighborhood. There are some nice shops and some decent restaurants so if you're in Seoul long term then the area is nice to hang out. If you're visiting for a short trip, There's nothing really special here. If you're here to gawk at college girls then you're probably a perv and I've nothing to say to you. (IMO, they're not any more attractive than college girls anywhere else in Seoul)"
A breath of fresh creativity and artistic culture,"We spent a morning visiting the campus of Ewha Women's University, mainly in and around the magnificent Dominique Perrault building which has become an icon of the campus, and at the University Art Museum.The Perrault building is a marvel of ingenious conception and design. It is stunning from the outside and has some fun surprises on the inside. The public can enter the building through doors 3 and 4 and explore the floor housing various dining facilities, the bookstore, the theater and other student services. You still get a good sense of the interior, even through you are only on one of its many floors.The art museum was exhibiting a special collection of porcelain as well as the regular collection. The docent, a junior at Ewha, spoke excellent English and was very helpful; she was a credit to her school. We enjoyed the welcoming atmosphere and the interesting collection.After our visit we walked around the fashion streets just outside the campus. This had the fun feel of a vibrant design scene."
Awesome Campus,"Beautiful and easily accessible campus. A combination of old and modern buildings. Vey clean. Awesome. Shopping district is just outside the campus. Plenty of choices from food, apparels, facial products etc. Highly recommend to visitors. Visited this place twice during our 1-week visit."
Champions in women,"Women's right have been quite strong and reputable in this university. Many students eho have joined this cause are women which bring pride and ego to the university.  This university also hold a large park and occupy and large area in Seoul. Located near a station, it has also a shopping district which strikes the eyes of the shoppers."
"Youthful place, lots of shopping!",There were so many alleys of shops! Very youthful district as many teenagers frequent the place. Prices of clothes were very cheap and nice variety!
Awesome view and a lot of things to see!,This is truly one of the most interesting campuses in Korea. The buildings the surroundings are very nice!
"Good for shopping ( young fashion, girls stuff) and coffee, juice or some or to just watch and grab a bite","It was a lovely area, lively, packed with young people...A relaxed area with trees, which I guess you won't notice if you are a girl and a sopping addict :-) You can pack up on cheap young fashion, make-up and accessories, or just explore and have a cup of coffee or grab a bit. I recommend just to see what the young generation enjoys."
Affordable Shopping Experiance in the University street,"Fashion outfit from head to toe,you can find it in this women street.Cosmetic,bags,shoes,socks,hair accessories and etc are all here.Normally tourists will get more free sample if you purchase from the skincare/cosmetic shop.Promoters here can speak several language so you have no worry to communicate. You can get some local snack food around the street or you can even dine in,the price of meal isn't too expensive because it mainly served the campus ladies here. It is better to shop in evening time because the weather is cooler ^^ Daytime is hot and you will prefer to shop in the mall."
