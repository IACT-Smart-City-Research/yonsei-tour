Look Forward for the Mini Trolley Tunnel Ride!,"When in Yanggu, a visit to the 4th Tunnel shouldn't be missed! It's educational because you are going to learn history about North and South Korea. Before going inside the tunnel, we wore a protective helmet. We walked for five minutes to get to the ride stop. Since there were a number of people when we visited, we had to queue in for the trolley ride. With this ride, we were able to get to the inner part of the tunnel. Unfortunately, we were not allowed to take photos. After the ride, we went back outside and had a chit-chat with the soldiers since they know English well."
Great experience to learn history of North and South Korea.,"This is a great experience to see what lengths North Korea went to to try and tunnel through to south Korea.First you HAVE to go to ""Eulji Observatory.The 4th Tunnel Ticket office.I have placed a screenshot of the location.There you will show your Passport and fill out a form with car registration also .They will give you 3 pieces of paper.One for guard at the gate before the tunnel.One with guard at the tunnel and one for guard at the observatory.If you don't get these before you get to the tunnel you will not get through.They say you have an hour at the tunnel and an hour at the Observation.At the tunnel you will see ashort doco on the war.Then the guard will tell you no photos inside the tunnel.You will walk 100 meters to a small train.Then you will have a 100 meter ride,stop and return backwards.Its noisy but save.Then you return to the outside and head for the Observatory.Once in the Observatory the lady will tell you a little history.You look through a large window at North Korea.No photography allowed.inside.You then return via the guards at the gate.If you have a car you must use LOW gear on the way back.Very steep long road.The entries are all FREE."
Korean Conflict at your fingertips,"Going into the tunnel and seeing the efforts that the North Koreans have gone through in an effort to be ready to attack the South is remarkable. This is the DMZ in your face, at your fingertips. No photos are permitted, but when you see the tunnel and imagine that something like 10,000 soldiers per hour could have gotten through, it is shocking. The minefields (with live munitions) are just yards away. This, more than anything, reminds you that the Koreans play for all of the marbles, all of the time."
Fascinating historical significance. ,"It is quite the experience to visit this place, put on a hard hat and walk the several hundred metres to the end. But it's not for the unfit or those with a heart condition...the tunnel is a steep descent and a very tiring climb back to the top awaits!The good news is that a mining style railway exists and is used to transport visitors to the bottom who are not keen to walk.You'll be asked to store your cameras in lockers at the top, as photos inside the tunnel are prohibited. If you're out touring the DMZ then tunnel 4 is a must."
"Remote, but intriguing","This location is pretty remote, but to experience it firsthand gives you an uneasy sense of ongoing ""state of war"" that exists and that overshadows what is a pretty peaceful area. It's pretty incredible to see first hand the work the North Koreans did was by hand. The views above looking over the DMZ is also beautiful and eerie. If the business of Panmunjom doesn't appeal to you, then this is a place worth checking out. "
