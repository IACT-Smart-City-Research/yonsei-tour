Nice and clean,This cinema is located on the top floor of AK Plaza. The prices are reasonable for military. The food combos are cheap and taste good. They have assigned/reserved seating. The cleanliness was on point as well. 
"Good Location, Good Prices, Easy to Find","I frequently go to this movie theater in the Pyeongtaek City Hall area. The tickets aren't expensive and the combo meals are reasonably priced. One thing to note is that the parking situation isn't very good. There is a basement parking lot you can use but it's very cramped and Koreans like to park ANYWHERE which can make entering/exiting a bit of a pain. I would suggest parking in the City Hall area (it's free on the weekends) and then walking over to the movie theater. Finally, military gets a 45% discount!"
Best theater in the area,This is a real modern theater in a nice department store. If you have never seen a 4D movie or ate crazy popcorn then you need to check it out!
Very Covenicent acess from the parking lot to Cinema house,Easy to access to the Cinema House from the parking lot after drive into the building~~. Not much crowded~~^^
Movie night.,One of the best theaters I have ever attended. The seats are oversized and extremely comfortable. Our seats came with an ottoman. Everything about this theater screams comfort during this commentating adventure. Watch a movie here and I'll Promis you that you'll at least be immeasurable comfy!!!
Great comfy theater,"American movies with Korean subtitles. About a 10 min cab ride from the Osan air base. A single ticket is about 8 dollars US. About 10k won. The snack bar has a better variety of snacks and drinks including beer. It's also cheaper than typical stateside prices. Some of the theaters also have 3D and 4D. 4D is where the seat moves, get shoots of water splashed on you, etc depending on the movie. Place is clean and nice. "
