Beutiful 100 years aged high school in Bukchon,"A beutiful 100 years aged high school in Bukchon. It's not far from main road. My friend and I visited the place on Saturday, so there were no actual students. It was quite peaceful. Even though it's not catholic school or something like that, still the school's main building boasts delicate decorations and picturesque yard. Take a visit if you go to Bukchon."
Nice building,"Free entrance. Near the hanok village, the school has a picture-worthy building and front area. I just wish the restroom is more maintained. Outside its gates, numerous merchandise are being sold."
Interesting architecture,Interesting western architecture in the heart of Seoul. Walking distance from world heritage sites of Changdeokgung. You will be walking uphill through streets of interesting shops. 
Nice,I really like the building and the school is so big and i met some nice friends there. I walked around this school with my friend and it was so nice and the cafeteria's food is good too and the kids are nice
European structure,Chance upon this cathedral looking structure without knowing what this place was. Can only view the building and din not go inside
