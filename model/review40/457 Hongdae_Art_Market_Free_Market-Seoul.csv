Worth a side trip... Maybe.,"It is a really small flea market selling crafts and other knick-knacks. Luckily, it is located in an area which is waaaaaay more interesting.I really do not have much to talk about this place really. I guess if you are within the vicinity, you can drop by for a quick visit."
Smaller than expected,The market was smaller than we expected with only around 20 -25 stalls on the day we visited. It’s in a very lively area with lots of shops and drinking places. Probably not worth a special trip but if you’re in the area...
Hip and Happening street and shops,"First time here on a Chuseok holidays, I thought will be quiet but surprisingly NOT! The place is hip and happening with street performance about 5 different type to watch and support and you may tip them for some cash :) walk along the streets with so many ladies clothes, sports shops and also for guys. There's also street food as well. I am still feeling hungry, luckily there's a mall in Hongdae has Halal Guys for me to dine :P"
Not sure what I was looking for ...,"I came to the location after 1 PM that’s when the information said that it “opened” - but found ... a regular street of shops and stalls, and a few “buskers,” but certainly nothing that wasn’t open an hour before. I wandered pretty extensively, so I’m confident I was in the right place, but unimpressed for an “art market.” Fun to wander, but not as an art market."
Worth visiting ,"Lots of things happening here - plenty of atmosphere- buskers, great shops food stalls and even nicer cafes (where you can actually sit!) Good prices here as it is in a university area and caters for kids with not a lot of money."
More Great Shopping.,Another gem provided by our driver. We met an artist who did wonderful oil paint reproductions of actual photographs for an very low cost. We visited the market in the afternoon and paintings of our three grandkids and two of my favorite airplanes were delivered to our hotel by seven in gathering evening. Lots of neat Korean art items.
Artsy Stuff All-Around,"Every time we visit Seoul, we always schedule a weekend to go to Hongdae Art Free Market. It is an open area where artists get the chance to showcase their talents thru stuff like jewelries, potteries, leather goods, clothes, postcards, paintings, etc. All designs are handmade. You can even have your portraits made while waiting. My 2 girls and I enjoyed walking around and appreciating the talents of the artists who participated in the free market. We bought quite a handful of products and we loved them. Some stalls even accept credit cards. Try and visit this place when you are in Seoul."
Hip and Youthful ambience ,"A place for youngsters and teens. Lots of apparel shops, cafes etc. There were teens performing K pop dance and songs. We went on a Monday so it was not really crowded. A must go place for the young and young at heart. "
Lively place,Lots of food and apparels store. The place is livelier with the younger generations vibes. It is a must not miss place to go visit when in seoul.
So much street food to try,Is totally different with Myeong Dong walking street. Selling different range of stuff and food. Must pay a visit when in Seoul. 
Market,You can find anything here and at reasonable prices! This area it's always packed! Been here so many times
Amazing place for youngsters,"Highly recommended for youngsters who enjoy music and dance.. we went there on Saturday, quite packs with people.. those who got plenty of time can just sit back and enjoy the street performance and dance.. if ur lucky enough u may encounter guerilla date with kpop idol there"
nice place,"For college going crowd. they buy stuff like tops, purse, wallet, mobile covers, suitcases from here plus a few restaurants. May be more lively in evenings."
Shopping street!,"A great place for shopping and enjoy street food there, cater more to younger generations thou, overall worth visits."
Fun Shopping & Food,"I enjoyed my visit to Hongdae, shopping was nice but i enjoyed the street food very much ! Bought lots of face masks and some blouses.. There's magic & singing performances as well along the road. Will be coming back when I have the chance.."
"Small, not many vendors, everyone selling almost the same things/concept applied to different textiles or objects","I was expecting much more diversity in goods and designs when I read that there was an application to sell at the free market. When I went, most were selling jewelry, some were selling leather goods, some textiles, some paper goods with original art. some portrait drawing stalls. No food stalls inside the actual free market. There was one performer when I went. No one actually stood nor sat in front of him to listen to him play. I thought it was awkward that everyone was sitting on the brick ledges behind him. Maybe move the performance area so that the performer has his back to the vendors and is facing people listening and set up some stools. (I had been looking forward to visiting the free market but it had rained the previous Saturday so I decided to wait for the sun. i am glad I did not go on a rainy day because it would not have been worth it for me. The Hongdae area itself is worth a visit, just not only for this.  People that reviewed this seemed confused as to what the free market actually is. The free market is held Saturday afternoons(1-6) at the small park near Honggik Uni. People called it the children’s park, but it seemed too small for a children’s park and there was nothing for children to play on... most people that reviewed this were reviewing the Hongdae area, not the free market itself."
Chill shopping and eating area,"This place had really good stores for shopping - cosmetics, clothes, shoes, bags, and everything else. As for food, there are many good restaurants too, and some icecream places that sell really long swirl ice creams. It's a must visit. I visited this place at least thrice, within my week-long stay in Seoul."
Must-do for Cheap Finds,"Very vibrant and lots of young people around. Lots of street shops selling affordable ladies clothings, cosmetics and socks. Better than Myeongdong in my opinion. If you have time to only visit Myeongdong or Hongdae, I will say visit Hongdae! "
Street performers on sat & sun ,"It was full of younger crowds during the weekend , came here during Sunday evening , saw tourist information people standing and they taught me from the map given by them to walk to a street nearby for shopping which was korea boutique selling trendy clothes , the Main Street were full of performers dancing , singing . "
Great Shopping Area,"Lots of great stores here, clothing and skin care come to mind, oh and shoes. Didn't see an Art Market, though saw many signs of art on the street. Street perfomers, good bars and restaurants and street performers, what more could you want!"
Went to Shopping Street,"Daebakkk!! you know if i had a lot of money i'd definety visit every store. there's like a lot of stores, clothing, skincare, some souvenirs, also odeng (fish cake) and tteopokki. watch busking here too!! there's a lot of talented people perform here :)"
Shopping Street,"The free market doesn’t operate in Dec. Instead I went to the shopping street in Hongdae.What a vibe! Youngsters are everyone and all the stalls are playing fun music. Makes me feel like dancing to the beat. Some shoppers even brought exotic pets (raccoons?) and attracted a small crowd.We visited a small shop where you can try your luck “fishing” out a toy from the machine. Lots of people carried off their prizes (soft toys) and we thought it would be easy. Sorry, no luck. Will try again next time."
"Young people's street, performances.....","This place stands out as a place for the young people. Lots of shops, cafes & restaurants catering to this group of people.Many aspiring K-Poppers (either dancing or singing) perform in the open walkways. Hoping to get lucky to catch the eye of scouts.But be careful- there was a news report from Korea yesterday about some aggressive performers pulling the audiences' hairs ( see picture). Other than this, it is about the same as any other shopping streets in Seoul. Just come walk around if you have time to kill or has never come here before. Or if you would like to watch the potential K-Poppers performances."
Come here just for street performance ,"Not sure if the performances are good or not, but it’s something I’d recommend every to experience.There’re also tons of restaurants along the way."
nothing much to see,Fast foodsBrands u can see everywhere around the cityNothing much reallyBut if u r bored u should come here n get sandwiched by the youngsters and foreigners 
Disappointing,"Even if the area is young and active, the art free market is quite small with nothing really artistic out of the ordinary crafts"
Cool nightlife for youngsters!,"Very happening. Full with cafes, shops, and restaurants. The price are moderate. Very easy to access because near with subway station."
Nice Shopping Spot,A very hit hot shopping areas for young people. Sport shoes and trendy fashions you can found here. Also many nice restaurants around. The coffee shops here are very special and stylist. Worth to come during night time experience the big crowd shopping fun.
"Place with good vibe, good food and shopping!",A lot of shops and restaurants in the area. There are a lot of street performers too so you can stop by and watch the local teens dance/singing performances. There are also a lot of bars so might encounter some drunk people at night.
Good shopping place,"5 to 10mins walk from Hongaik MRT station exit 9. I prefer Hongdae than Dongdaemun. Its a shopping paradise with cafés, KTV and restaurants. There's even Kpop singing at one of the street. It's definitely worth the trip."
Shopper Paradise for young people,"There are many shops selling clothes, caps and mobile cases. Besides, there are also several coffee shops and juice shops so people can buy some drinks and snacks when they do shopping. There will be lots of people in the evening."
Bustling,The place is bustling with people of all nationalities and walks of life. Many fun seeking students and opened shops even late into the night. Most fascinating is the lighting and security; it seems like day light even at night. Are you craving for fun? Then stop over at this Mapo gu hotspot and mingle.
Fantastic Day out - soak up the atmosphere,"While this is the domain of the young don't let it put you off. Heaps of street food, students entertaining dance, music and acrobatics, interesting fashion particularly mobile phone accessories, it's a great day out to really feel the Seoul atmosphere. It's easy to get to as 3 metro lines service the precinct and anyway as they are mostly students English is easily understood. To me after going to the tourist populated Namdaemun and similar markets this is a great and better alternative."
The best place in Seoul for a night out,"If you travel to Seoul, make sure you visited Hongdae!During the evening the street performers come alive, food stalls send amazing smells across the streets enticing you to reach for your pocket and locals shop for bargains.This place is busy, be warned! The atmosphere however is amazing. Every time that I have been I have noticed how friendly everyone is and stall owners try there best to converse with you in English. Along the sides you will find Korean versions of pubs, numerous restaurants and shops that will meet any price range that you are looking for.Head out early, around 6pm. Gives you a chance to gather your bearings and in a way, plan what you want to do. I ended up buying a few beers from a local shop and spent most of the evening listening to music and watching street performers."
cool vibe at night,"lots of street performances, shops, restaurants, a great district for me! wish i could spend more time checking out more shops."
Hustle and bustle .,"Lots of things to do and shop. Mainly more stalls selling fashion items, bits and pieces. Young and trendy place with a.Uni nearby. Like Myeongdong without the beauty stuff."
Great area,"Vibrant and lovely place filled with cafes, restaurants and shops. Prices are moderate and affordable and you'll find some Korean specialities and goods as well as international store. It's close to the public transport and it's a great way to be a part of the city and all of its energy."
Where,"Should have done research. Went there Monday noon time. Nothing going on, at all. Area around has little shops selling clothes mostly."
Nice place to shopping and find something to eat,"Actually i stayed at hostel in Hongdae so Hongdae is really nice place i walked to market every day to shopping and had dinner there, a lot of young people also every weekend you will see young people show dancing, singing, rap etc. it gave a good energy there"
The hip place ,One of the places where you need to visit when you're in Seoul. It has very nice atmosphere. Lots of youths are around this area. There were street performances by various groups of youth - from dance to singing. Lots of things to see!
Nice live adea,"The area is full of small shops , small restaurants and bars .. very active and a live . U will find so many singers in middle playing guitars and singing in English or Korean . Very nice "
Honeymoon @ Hongdae Street,"It was snowing when we were here. Lots of young people.As it was snowing and lots of people, it wasn't very conducive to shop. Very cumbersome if you want to buy clothes as you have to take off your winter wear etc...There are many restaurants, cafes, street food and fashion outlets. It should be a nice place to shop if it is not snowing or over-crowding."
Crowded and happening place,This place is full of young people because of Hongik University. There are a lot of trendy clothes along the streets. Nice to walk around. 
Very exciting and happening market street,"A street lined with restaurants and shops, what's there not to like. We went on a Friday night, hence it was a good crowd. Plenty of food and shopping choices. Also, there's a 3 storey arcade, with claw machines on the ground level. Good fun!"
Shopping and eating ,"A very ""happening"" place filled with young people. There are lots of stuff to shop and eat also. The food street has very wide range of restaurant, cafe and food street stall that we can feast. "
As good as Myeongdong and Ihwa,"Hongdae Free Market is as good as Myeongdong and Ihwa or even better than these two areas. The visitors are mostly teens and students that studying in Hongik University. Many things to buy and foods are great after all. Of course, souvenirs are available as well."
Crowded and interesting streets ,"I knew this place will be crowded but was pleasantly surprised to see so many locals at weekend. Teens and youngsters that comb the street. There must be a sale for limited edition LIne bear going on. I saw lots of people carrying that item. Highly recommend to come and walk the street and spent at least 3 hours here. Mapo has the best BBQ beef in local Korean style. cafe hopping, amusement stores, fashion shops and ice creams. "
Love the free market and the buzz ,"This Saturday free market brings together the crafts of designers young and old and i enjoyed my time just strolling and checking out the stuff available. It is quite a small market so not much time has to be dedicated . As this is right in the midst of the hongdae shopping district, you can just hop over after the free market and continue the shopping. "
Nice evening walk,"Well, it is a street market with some atmosphere, but I wouldn't say there is something extraordinary there. "
Trendy fun place ,"Trendy fun place to chill and walk around. Crowded with hipsters and tourists, it's a nice cool place to munch on the delicious night market snacks and soak in the ambience around the area. "
Looks nice from the outside,Closed 2nd and 4th tues. so plan accordingly. Seems very big and interesting. We ended up eating at a food stall on the street that had great soup and dumplings.
Go here at night time,"Along with Myeongdong this place is a must visit at evenings.See how Korean youth are expressing themselves with music, dance and other acts. The area is packed with stores and restaurants and the streets are packed with young people enjoying themselves. This place should be a shining examples to other cities in the world on how to give youth a place to be and let them express themselves."
Entertainment at night - where the youngsters hangout,"I only visited at night and there were full of bars, pubs, cafe, restaurants, Karaoke, retails shops etc. The live performance was amazing and managed to get quite a good crowd. If you are after some places to hangout or some entertainment till late - you can always check out Hongdae."
Living Street,I would recommend this place for shopping at the same ranking as Myeongdong street. Whole street is living both day and night time.You can find every teenage stuff at this place and it is the best place to find sneakers in Seoul.
Hongdae,"Great to walk around. Lots of places to shop, some local street food as well. Close to Hongik University (party)"
Great for shopping and walking around,"We visited twice, both were during the night time. The shops stay open quite late, and there are street performances until the middle of the night. We left around 1 am, and there were still musicians performing and people hanging around. This was during summer time, though, so I don't know how it is in the colder months. The area is filled with young people since it's near the university. I had a blast and I really enjoyed the performances!"
Interesting artsy place ,"We had our individual caricature drawn here. The lady was really talented ! And she took only a mere 2-3 mins to complete it. Drawing it based on eye contact, she traces our faces on a sheet of clear plastic placed in front of us on an easel. She's so popular that it formed a long queue. Waiting in the hot summer certainly wasn't a good choice but hey paying only 3,000 won and getting a good picture was worth it. "
Just a very nice Market,"I loved it there. A lot of stores, little shops and restaurants. I even found a few Vintage Stores which was really nice. Absolutely a Market to check out."
Great place!!,Really nice place to visit on weekend!! A lot of people here. Many many shop for shopping. Nice place to meet. Must to go to there!
Full of activities!,"We went there after visited Ehwa University. The clothes there are slightly expensive than Ehwa, but we find a good bargain on shoes . The whole place is crowded. People performing on streets, food and we even come across an idol group is promoting there (we couldn't see who is it due to many people). "
Very lively and unique,Great place to visit on a weekend night as the atmosphere is very lively. Streets are lined with dancers and singers performing and there are more unique shops as compared to the other attractions in seoul which pretty much sell the same stuff. 
Small market for young girls,"Went there on a Sat. Take Hongik Univ subway (line 2) , exit 9, its opposite to the Hongik Univ. Its a relatively small market with 30 odd stores setup selling mostly accessory for girls age 16-25. I think most are hand made items. Nothing much interesting for male audience. In terms of food, there are plenty of choice around that area, you just need to explore a bit. Overall, since its an university area, its quite lively. Its worth spending 2-3 hours just to walk around and absorb the atmosphere"
"Trendy cheap clothes, young and energetic hangout place",Many trendy clothes along the walk. Some you can bargain with them but not over do it. Varities choices of cuisine. The restaurant located at the small street can be cheaper than the main street.
Really cool place for to hang out on a weekend ,"Went to Hongdae last weekend for the first time. Had a great time. The streets are alive like many other areas in Seoul. This place though has a different feel. There are students and others performing dances, singing, playing instruments and rapping all over. There are great places to eat cheaply and the air is electric. I see why many people have begun to migrate to this place. I highly recommend this location for fun. "
Superb,"I love Hongdae area! I love the free market and the vibe of this area. Spending my weekend in the end of April in Hongdae and come to the free market, it was such an amazing experience."
Love this place so much ,"Every time when I visit Seoul, this is one of the must-go places as we can found lots of interesting stuffs and restaurants there, also many artists like singing and acting here which made this place more energetic and young. "
Chilly but full of energy,"Coming from Hanoi, I was definitely cold so I could not wait to go find a thick jacket of some sort while shopping in Hongdae. They had great accessories like hats for 5,000 won and much street food galore. The fashion was up to date, some quirky, others super unique. But, I could not find a warm jacket, while many girls walked around in skirts...The fashion trends go by quickly so this place was already getting ready for the spring/summer scene.However, it had many young street performers during the night in the main shopping areas. The streets near the small park has the bustling bees. If you don't know where to head to shop, just follow the young crowd of shoppers heading in the same direction. Price was decent but I thought the gangam underground shopping center was much better with price, plus indoors is a plus.My friend and I took sticker photos and ate some sashimi at the ""Only Jesus restaurant"" It was delish."
Shopping Heaven!,"This place has EVERYTHING. Food,clothing,random items,etc. Anything you're looking for you can find here. Prices are reasonable and it's not too crowded if you get there before 5-6pm but after that...it's very packed.I would recommend this place. I can't wait to go back and visit."
One day is not enough,"If you are into shopping, one day seems not enough to see everything here. Most of the stalls show stylish apparel that are popular to millenials (since it is near Hongik Univ). Aside from the shops, there are also many places where you can have meals, snacks and desserts. Trick Eye and Love museums are also here. It seems common to see kpop idols in the vicinity. What I like most about Hongdae is the presence of Tourist Info Centers, with very helpful and informative staff (fluent at English too, very favorable for tourists)."
"Hongdae, a nice place for young people","Its not exactly cheap and the food variety are not as much as Myeongdong but for youngsters, this might be where they want to be during a trip to Seoul. New trendy clothes, students from nearby Honggik University performing and many good bites all around. Recommended for young couples."
Another cool street in Seoul,"If you are into shopping, then you might want to stick with Myeong Dong. If you want cheap souvenirs, go to Insa Dong but if you want to party and have some beers at clubs than come to Hongdae. During the day, it is calm and peaceful and you can grab a bite to eat and shop at some craft stores and souvenir shops but then the atmosphere changes completely at night and becomes a place where younger and more hipster looking folk come out to have a good time. It is not a sleazy area at all but definitely it’s a younger crowd just looking for some fun. I was looking for a massage place and they are plenty here but they are so dang expensive in Korea and comparable to American prices that I just passed on that. It’s worth a look in my opinion even if you don’t club and bar hop as I don’t but still had a good time people watching with my wife."
Amazing atmosphere,"This is such a nice street, not too long that you cannot get to the end of it but you can easily spend half a day there if you want, just because of how nice it is. It's a very artsy place with both high-end and low-end shops. The food is amazing, and the street food stalls will keep you full if you don't want to stop by a restaurant. The atmosphere was amazing, especially during night, which is really nice considerig how late the shops close. There were lots of street performers that locals and visitors both seem to enjoy and clap along to. Would definitely visit again, probably several times during the same visit in S. Korea."
Casual shopping and sightseeing,"Even though I'm a local, and I've been there so many times, when I go back to Korea I always make a trip to this street. There are a few vintage shops, mostly affordable street fashion of Seoul. Average cafes here and there - all the good small ones moved out in the last 5 years it seems. "
Walking through Hongdae on a Saturday night,We mainly stood along the sides of the crowded roads while artists sang or gave performances. Plenty of things to buy and eat here.
Below expectations,We visited the free market on Sat afternoon but it was rather dissapointing due to the small number of stalls. Some of the handcrafted items looked interesting but rather expensive. There are quite a few stalls doing caricature. You may want to just take a quick stroll if you are headed to spend the evening at hongdae. 
Feels like im in harajuku,"Hongdae,u ll find some fancy cafes n restaurants n another area lots of drinking n barbeques at night.Style nanda ,multibrand store wth 3ce makeup n clothes.To shop for funcky stuff wth higher retail price."
Different during the day and night,"During Saturday mornings, Hongdae Free Market offers (mostly) Korean self-made products, which comprise various trinklets and artsy-related items that you may not see in other markets around Seoul. At night though, it turns into a lovely avenue for creative talents to showcase their performance skills. There are also an array of choices food (and drinks), especially Korean BBQ."
Creative ,I'm a lover of arts and crafts and local people making and sharing their art. There are lots of handmade arts and crafts hear you're looking for a handbag or a necklace this is the place and it's reasonably priced. It's really great because family can come here and enjoy interesting Korean artwork.
The New Must Visit Place,"I'm not sure if I am the only one who felt this way, but Myeongdong didn't seem as happening as when I visited 3 years ago. The whole place seem to be swarming with foreign tourists, and for me if I go to another country, it would be nice to see more local people than foreign tourists. Recently, the shops in Myeongdong seemed more and more targeted towards the tourist population. In comparison, we stumbled upon Hongdae when we exited from Sangsu station looking for an ice-cream shop. Unlike Myeongdong, this district has many small local shops and were patronised by mainly local young people with much less foreigners. As another reviewer said, you can get the latest trendy clothes at a cheaper price. The buildings and shops also seem more colourful, modern and classy. In contrast Myeongdong seems more jaded compared with 3 years ago. Perhaps, this has to do with the fact that the University is nearby. We saw this as an up and coming shopping and clubbing place, and good option to visit because it gets overtaken by tourists like Myeongdong."
Young shopping district,Feels different from Mingdong as not much big chains retailers. Lots of local shops with a few young designer shop around. Nice street performance by local young people along the street and you can enjoy for free at the restaurant on both side.
