Great/Beautiful ,It was a great/beautiful walk down the stream i usually dont walk around but i appreciated this beautiful scene i embraced it and will do it again.
Great light festival,"Magificant light festival along the river, whenever you go to Seoul it’s akways worth checking what’s happening on the river. Lots of bars and restraints nearby"
Go at night,Great river walk. Went after dinner and everything was lit up. Every block had different art pieces. My favorite was the lantern section. Got a bit overcrowded in some areas and not as many stairs back up as I would of thought
Lantern show this year,"I went to this place a few times in the past. At night the waterfall was lit up beautifully. On the weekends there were many hawker stalls selling food, etc. This year there was a lantern show and the place was unusually crowded."
Peaceful,This was a very great use of space to add something natural but man made. It gives back to nature in a concrete world. 
Beautiful place,"Was brought by relatives to visit this beautiful place. Caught by great surprise with the amazing landscape along the stream. We happened to chance upon 2019 Seoul Lantern Festival in Nov. There were so many featured lanterns, each lantern has a story behind it which are very interesting for visitors to enjoy reading them while walking along the river. Took us about 20 to 30 mins as we were enjoying & strolling slowly with a toddler. And there’s also water laser show around 9pm which drawn a lot of tourists and local visitors too. During one part of the stream, you can opt to place a floating lantern with light costing krw 5000, saw many young couples and families doing this for fun as well as for goodwill blessings.I think this place is very romantic too as we can take many lovely pics in the evening with all lighted lanterns as backdrop. What’s more fun is you can step on the rocks in the river to cross over the other side. This is something really quite interesting. We walked from Jongno-5-ga all the way Euljiro-1-ga station back to our hotel. Definitely recommended for those first timers and returned visitors. Will be back again next time I visit Seoul again. Thumbs up!!"
Looks pretty lit up an night but not really a useful thoroughfare,I thought we would use the stream a lot to get from A to B and avoid the busy streets and traffic but turned out it is just that bot too far south of the main areas to be that useful. Looks pretty though.
Great in the day & at night,"We enjoyed walking along the paths by the stream, both in the day and at night. There are lots of interesting features (stepping stones, fountains, artworks, benches with sunshades, etc) that make it a lovely way to get between places or just stroll. It felt very safe at night, and at the western end especially there were lit up fountains & waterfalls, etc. The musical fountain light show was a surprise at 7.30pm & very good."
Exposing this underground river is a great idea.,"The stream is a good way to travel across the city, away from the heavy traffic and need to wait at pedestrian crossings. At places it is quite colourful and pretty at others it's a bit more neglected. It is a safe way to get around and features labels and access steps to the various roads it passes beneath. "
Great Stoll,"Located in the Centre of the metropolis, the walkway gives a sense of calmness from the fast paced city. No festivities while I was here but I’m sure events would be well decorated. "
Unique and relaxing,Such an interesting stream and atmosphere running through the city. Although the stream is in the heart of the city it is such a pleasant place to rest. You will see business people and tourist alike relaxing and enjoying the sounds and sights of nature...taking a break from their day. Love the green umbrella installation and also the spot where you throw the coins in. my kids loves running up and down and crossing over the water on the large rocks.
Pleasant stroll in the city,"Nice, cool, clear, and clean stream. Families would come with their children or dates. The place is very clean, well-maintained, a lot of small fish, to be enjoyed by all ages.There was a safety traffic event at the end by the waterfall / filter that we were able to join and enjoy. They say sunsets are nice here; I think so too.Tents were set-up by the time we left; around 3PM but given a choice, I would have stayed much longer."
Great walk,We walked here early evening and it was great. A few people but quiet. Art displays in some sections and a laser show as well. Up top were stalls selling street food. Walked about 3km.
Second visit after 5 years,"Was totally blown away with this ""new"" attraction when i chanced upon it 5 years ago.Its still nice, but i suspect the landscaping & other exhibits seems to have suffered from maintenance budget constraints.I did manage to visit the Cheongyecheon museum. Great place to spend an hour or two. A bit difficult to get to since there's no metro station nearby, but easy enough by taxi or bus. (Get your ""free"" costume picture taken at the photo machine near the entrance door on ground floor. They can even email the picture to you, though for some reason, it does not work for gmail. My friend got his photo on yahoo mail.)"
Beautiful,I walked a number of miles by the side of the stream and it really is a delight. As one is sunk below the road it's very quiet and allows one to take a breath and relax in a city that is constantly loud and moving. Even after dark I wandered here as there are groups sitting and chatting or couples wandering hand-in-hand. Worth a trot along even if briefly just to restore equilibrium
Good For an Evening Walk,"Nice place for an early evening walk. Set beneath street level, so on hot days it remains cool. Well laid out walking paths make it easy to navigate. If you staying in central Seoul worth taking a walk in the evening before or after diner."
Nice place,"Great view for refreshing , weather is good, water is cold, there is a fish .Some street singer is playing some korean songs."
Great place to hang out at night,Lightings and umbrella decorations are very unique about this place. You can scroll along the stream while enjoying the night view and try some street food stalls. Must visit place in Seoul.
"Beautiful in at daytime, very romantic at nighttime ","My recommendation is to devote a good few hours to walk through it from the starting point (The big blue & red shell statue. IDK the name, it was all in Korean )"
Nice canal boulevard ,It is a canal walkway below road level with running water in the middle. Pedestrians are evacuated when the water level upstream is too high and needs to be released into the canal thus flooding the canal and the pedestrian path on both sides of the canal. There are plenty of greenery as well as benches and nice theme sections at different sections of the canal. A good relaxation and exercise stretch when in the dongdaemun shopping area. Worth a visit.
Nice walk in the middle of busy CBD of Seoul,"Took a walking tour along the Chonggyecheon Stream. A nice peaceful walk starting from Gwanghwamun and ended at Dondaemun.Near Dondaemun you can have some lunch at the traditional Gwangjang market.If you want to have some peace from the busy CBD, you can find it walking along the Chonggyecheon stream."
Nice place to relax ,"This stream is a nice place to relax and take a walk in Seoul. Can sometimes get crowded on the weekends, but it's a nice natural space in the middle of the city. "
Relaxing but time to break out the pruners,Nice way to get from point A to B without the noise or stress of street traffic. I applaud the city for the effort undertaken to make this a nice place to walk but the landscaping/brush is now getting out of control. The out-of-control plants are distracting.
A good place to have a few good snapshots if you happen to be near it.,"The stream is nice but may not worth the effort to go to visit it. If you happen to be near it, go there and you will find you can take some nice photo there. We went to the part of it which is near the Dongdaemen Design Plaza. Not a bad idea to go if you have the time."
Stream restored,Must see! In middle of crazy shopping there is a great restored stream. Beautiful access and tranquil area. Worth stopping and seeing fish with a coffee!
Wonderful walk,"This stream in the middle of the city is just wonderful. With walking paths on both sides, and stepping stones to cross the water, it is perfect for a walk or run. We are staying at a hotel nearby, so we have taken several walks here, both during the day and in the evening. Highly recommended! "
Beautiful man make stream,"A stream right in the middle of the city , make the city so relaxing and beautiful, we spend about an hour just sitting by the river stream listening to the flow of water and taking photo "
Very nice for late afternoon or evening walk,This is a lovely part of town to get some atmosphere and have a short walk. Nice fountains and stepping stones along the way.
Relax pure in a busy city,"A 10 km stream in the city of Soul offers relax for everybody - healing stress, cooling area, reading, nature lovers - simply enjoy it."
Beautiful River Walk in the middle of the city,"In the middle of the city is the Chenggyecheon stream which is a river pathway that starts from the centre of Seoul and can take you beyond Dongdaemun Market and further east of the city. It is a pathway full of interesting natural and man-made features including many bridges, trees, hedgerows and more. The stream is also full of Art installations which catch the eye and at night time parts of the stream contain light shows that help keep the river area active during the night with revellers, tourists and even locals just looking for an area to relax or exercise. If you have a few hours to spare on your journey I recommend walking this riverpath to a location in the city like Dongdaemun Market or Insadong Shopping area."
"""Build it and they will come, restore it and they will come back!"" ",Great to final see this restoration in person. Great rewinding. Herons in the middle of a mega city! 
Nice ,"A fascinating place. I'm impressed by the effort and resources Seoul invests on city beautification, cultural and historic preservation projects. Who would have thought that this stream was once paved over and was a major road. Its actually really nice and I know it reaches all the way to Dongdaemun. If I had time, I'd walk further and enjoy the diversity and culture. Its a great place yo go at night. Great for social gatherings, dates and running. "
Excellent for jet-lag,"The stream walk was conveniently located near our hotel. We loved walking it, it truly helped with our jet-lag.The walk way is peaceful, there were people of all ages. Couples, lingering off to the side spending quality time together, walkers of all different levels. Cool and crisp in the evening (end of September)...just below the streets, you are not interrupted by cars/street lights."
Beautiful walk,Seoul created an oasis with their construction of this river walk.The section we visited was lovely and being enjoyed by many on a very warm day.
Overgrown shrubs in summer,"We walked past Cheonggyecheon stream to get to Gwangjang market and it seemed to be quite unkempt. Heard from my Korean friends that during winter there are lighting decorations, guess it’s the wrong season to visit."
Relax a little ,"Great idea in the middle of a big city. A shallow stream where you can sit, soak your feet and socialize with friends and family. "
Nice :D,"It's a very beautiful place. I recommend to go there. I have seen many people who were relaxing there. There are always many people. There is also a waterfall. It's very close to Gwanghamun. I went there twice. In autumn and in spring. But during my 2nd visit, the smell was weird there :/ But still it's worth to go there."
A Place rob see in korea,"A must see place in Korea, it is located in the middle of tall buildings but it’s amazing how they preserve the place. It is indeed so rich in culture. A huge place to visit. You need at least half a day to visit all the sites in the palace. When you wear the hanbok costume, the entrance is free."
Hot Relief..,"If you are searching for a place to chill in Seoul. this is the right place.Here you can relax, get your feet wet and enjoy the calm of this area.Have a walk through Seoul along the banks of this stream is a must-do activity. The stream is pretty long (about 11 km): we walk until the Dongdaemun Design Plaza.Perfect time, in my opinion, is late afternoon, before the sunset!"
Morning & night,"A narrow water stream, nice to walk next to it or chill for a bit. Its nice in the morning and night too."
"Believe they were in the center of Seoul Korea , Chunggaechun ","In the high rising buildings , you can find these kind of natures. Good to go and stay in downtown and walk by the river. "
A Stream runs through it...,"Cheonggyecheon Stream runs through the heart of the old city of Seoul, running almost East-West between a bit past the East Gate (Dongdaemun) to the West Gate (Soedaemun)...Its western end starts just a short way from the Gyeongbok Palace, while it's eastern end is very near and accessible to the Dongdaemun fashion district with its newest attraction, the Dongdaemun Design Plaza, by the late Architect, Zaha Hadid. The stream itself runs below the level of adjacent streets, so the experience focuses more on the nice landscape and waterscape treatment of the stream itself, which has evolved from being an underground sewer/canal roofed by a highway in the 1960s, until its current reincarnation as an interesting urban design element to modern day Seoul circa 2005...or sometime around then.A series of pedestrian and vehicular bridges cross over the stream. It's nicely lit at night so even an evening stroll is pleasant. However, during storms or periods of monsoon rains, the stream also functions as flood control infrastructure, so best to check first for warnings or alarms before descending.The stream is bounded by a variety of facilities, including hotels, restos and bars, as it traverses the Myeongdong, Jongno and Dongdaemun districts, so if your walk makes you hungry or thirsty, just get back up to street level for that snack, meal or drink."
Awesome,"This river is beautiful, at night and daytime. There are a lot of diffrent events around here which makes a visit more fun."
An oasis in a concrete city,Seoul does not have many green spaces in its center - so it is pleasant to descend from busy streets to the river promendade.
Great place on hot summer night ,It's a beautiful stream right in the middle of downtown Seoul. I've been there several times. Both day and night. During the day it's a great place to take a relaxing break while sightseeing in the downtown area. It's below street level which keeps down the street noise. You almost forget you're in the city. I especially like it after dark. It's a great place to sit and enjoy the peaceful atmosphere. It's lit with colored lights and images projected on the walls. There are many bars and restaurants in the nearby neighborhood so you can eat then take a relaxing walk along the stream or just sit and listen to the burbling water.
Love the trees,This stream was once clean or concrete however trees and shrubs have been allowed to grow with a noticeable change since I first came to Seoul in 2009.The stream has a walking path close to the stream with stairs coming down to stream level.I’ve been here before during the evening and it does attract a lot of locals walking along its course.Nice to see.
A place to chill,"The stream is a place where you can relax, especially on a warm day.Grab some drinks and food and then just chill. We were there on a Sunday when there were musicians and market stalls close by. The stream starts next to a very cool sculpture and rainbow coloured building - a good landmark to look for."
Stream that looks better in korean drama,"The famous stream was next to our hotel and of course having seen it in so many korean drama, we had to take a look. It was just a stream and on a hot summer day, many tourists were seen soaking their feet in the water. Nothing much to do here. "
One of those landmarks to look out,Go in the evening as we went in the afternoon in summer and it is too hot Would he a great place at night and cooler time
Urban River Restoration,"Cheonggyecheon Stream is an excellent example of urban restoration. The stream was underground, but now all the covers have been removed and the stream uncovered. Riverside paths have been built and a riverside park established, alongside engineered meanders and stepping stones. When we were there the riverside paths were closed due to potential flooding, but the stream is still visible from the roads above. There is a sculpture marking the spring at the start of the stream."
Forest/ stream in the middle of a modern city,".a cool lovely place to stop, rest, relax and take some pictures . pretty cute basically, not a must if you're in a hurry"
Center piece for various festivals,"The Cheonggyecheon Stream eventually finds its way to the Hahn River a major waterway that divides Seoul into north and south sectors. The stream is the back drop for many a festival. I've been there several times. The first time during the Christmas season and was there for a lantern festival that set up along the stream. Well worth the visit to enjoy the charm and ingenuity of the Korean people. I lived in Korea for seven years and love the Korean people and the Korean friends I made there, I hated to leave. Korea doesn't have a shortage for festivals. There is always a festival you can find. The Cheonggyecheon Stream is a short walk from the subway and again there are plenty of restaurants to eat and drink at nearby."
Stream in the city center.,"A peaceful place to rest after a long walk in Seoul or shopping. Quiet, cool. Moving east, you can walk to Dongdaemun shopping districts, a traditional market."
Refreshing Site,"It was so funny but memorable finding this place. We were at a shrine and we somehow can't direct where this stream is. An old Korean Lady guided us to this stream. It was just a 10 minute walk all along. When I saw the clear water with some fishes in it, you could tell that the water is clean. It sure love to dip your feet in it....I love this place. I would be glad to visit this again because it is an 11 km stream. "
Walk through Seoul along the banks of a once-hidden river.,This is a fascinating walk which allows you to see a very busy and built-up city through the eyes of the past and gives you time to reflect. A wonderful afternoon's walk which also makes sure you reach the 10000 steps needed per day and then some.
A Wonderful Evening,"Strolling along the stream in the evening was our favorite experience in Seoul! What a pleasant setting filled with people enjoying the city. It seems to go on for miles, so you can walk as long or as short as you would like. Until you take the steps down to the stream, you won't get a sense of the place, which is a refuge from the busy city surrounding it."
A quiet walkway in the city,Good place to take a rest after walking around the city. You can see some fishes and creative graffiti.Also there are so many bugs and mosquitoes.
"Beautiful place for a relaxing walk with friends, family or your significant other.","My Korean friends have told me that Cheonggyechon Strean is exclusively for couples, but is not the case, of course, you will see couples walking around and having a romantic moment but you can go check out the stream with friends and family too. The best thing is you can take off your shoes and dip your feet in the stream. Since is summer, many people go there and they bring their snacks and beer to have a relaxing moment. Here is where the lantern festival takes place in November, if you are in Korea around that time I highly recommend you to check it out. You won't get disappointed."
Such a relaxing walk,"Such a relaxing walk in the midde of the city, very peaceful with fish and storks, can walk from Gwanghwamun square to at least Dongdaemun. "
Best Foot Therapy,"Cheonggyecheon stream is an excellent experience. We dip our feet there and it was very relaxing. The water flow was pretty hard, so no one dared to cross the stream, even though it wasn't deep and was not a long way to cross. We threw some coin inside the well. My daughter successfully threw one inside. We stayed there for 30 minutes. It was the best foot therapy ever."
Romantic View,Nice place and weather. Lots of people enjoying summer time. feeding the fish and cycling along the river. will come back again during autumn
A quaint and quiet walkway in city center,"A quaint and quiet walkway in city center, especially near Eulgi-ro and Dongdaemun. My husband, daughter and I were relieved to stroll along this tiny stream after a hectic meal in the Gwangjang Market, where we ate the famous Bindaetuk and Kalguksu. Actually we bought some Yut, or korean taffy, at the market and ate them while walking. There was a street concert going on, but kind of 60s style."
Nature incorporated in CBD,Great example of incorporating nature in the city buildings. Great place to chill out and relax. Many local soak their feet in the crystal clear river water to cool themselves. Crane was spotted in the river fishing for food. River is not deep probably just ankle or knee deep water level. Very calming place to get away from the city buzz and just pass your evening away.
Ideal spot for everyone ,"It is a pretty cute area, where you can even dip in your feet in the water. Nice and wide sidewalks to stroll around, ideal for all kinds of travelers, specially at night when the sun is setting. "
Nice walk along the stream,"This is a 10 km long modern stream that runs through downtown Seoul. I walked a portion of the stream, from Gwangjang Market to Dongdaemun during a weekday afternoon. It was rather quiet, with a few locals sitting along the bank to relax and chill. I suppose it is livelier in the evening."
Stream - better view in the evening ,I didn't know what was the big deal when everyone told me I have to visit the steam. It's a very long walk until the end of the stream - you don't have to walk all the way. The view is better in the evening. Apparently it used to be road. And the government decide to make it a stream. I think that's a fantastic idea! I appreciate the stream even more
Great place to walk,Very nice to walk or have early morning jogging. Nicely and thoughtfully decorated. Highly recommend to have walk through.
Great walk,"This is one of the best walks in Seoul. You can follow yhe stream, make stops below or above ground to do a variety of things. Or you can find a spot relax, and get away from the city while being in the center of it."
Great spot to unwind with a beer and friends.,"Loved taking a leisurely stroll along this urban creek. Its highly developed and right in the middle of the city, plenty of performers and couples dot the shore well into the evening. Though access down to the shore could be easier, as there are specific points you can use, because it's below street level."
Great peaceful moment away from the busy shopping streets,"When shopping in Myeongdong, take 5 minutes to walk down the stream for a mindfulness moment (and great photo ops). I wouldn’t say it’s a must do when in Seoul but it is lovely."
Peaceful retreat,"When Seoul is hot and the traffic and confusion on the streets is too much to bear, just find the steps (or occasional elevator) which lead to the cool, quiet Cheonggyecheon Stream. You can wander from City Hall all the way to Dongdaemun Square and along the way enjoy the ceramics depicting ""King Jeongjo's Procession to the Royal Tomb."" And if you find yourself missing the noise and confusion, just take the next flight of steps back up to ground level."
Almost missed it,Was walking around Dongdaemun at night and almost missed this place cos you will think it is just a simple canal. Get closer and it is more than that. I know the history of this place and that it was once very polluted and unsightly. Amazed at its renewal. Wish I could see this place in the daytime but it was still well lighted with various water features at late evening. 
"A short walk, not a long one","Started from the start and walked about 4 kms. The first few hundred meters are excellent, after that there was the prominent smell of sewer gas. Nevertheless, better than walking on the street."
Fantastic place for a post dinner stroll ,This is an amazing urban renewal project turning an otherwise unsightly drain into a beautiful stream and park. The water looked shallow and clean. Both sides of the pedestrian walkway were well paved and landscaped.We approached Cheonggyecheon after exiting Dongdaemun metro station. It was close to midnight on a week night: there were some people sitting by the stream and a few joggers. Absolutely peaceful and such serenity compared to the noisy traffic above.A fantastic place for a leisurely stroll in the evening.
Seeing sunsets ,"I went there around 6.30 pm so that I had an hour walking along, and then saw the sky changed its colour "
Worth your time,Love the atmosphere. There are plenty of things to see. Would like to go back again if I have chance
Urban Renewal Project,So a concrete overhead highway was removed and the stream below restored to create this urban oasis in the heart of a busy city. What a tranquil respite to go for a walk along this water. It runs for several miles going under bridges and there's some neat artwork along the way. Good for a day or nighttime stroll.
The best place for a walk in Seoul,"The most beautiful spot in Seoul. Took the metro from Myeongdong to Dongdaemun History & Culture Park Station, exited at Exit #1; walked past the futuristic Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP) designed by Zaha Hadid; and crossed the street to the stream entrance. Immediately we were entranced by the greenery and quiet. There were only a few tourists, walkers, and locals starting their day. It was a refreshing contrast to the hustle and bustle of Myeongdong and all the other touristy areas we visited (e.g., N Seoul Tower). Total distance back to Namdaemun-ro and Myeongdong was less than 2.5 miles; under an hour."
Was ok,I was really looking forward to seeing this stream but when we got there was a bit disappointed. No art to be seen - just a few traffic cones! Glad we saw it though and still cool to have a stream in the middle of the city that is peaceful.
Enjoyed dipping our feet,"Man made, below street level stream. After a long, hot day of walking, it was nice to dip our feet in the cold stream to cool off. It could be better maintained in terms of trash and weed removal. It was cool to see a heron stalk and pluck a small fish out of the water and eat it whole. "
Good photo moments ,Our family visited this stream and enjoyed the photo moments. We enjoyed our stroll along the stream. It was a short and easy stroll for us. A worthy experience for my family. This stream is walking distance from the Lotte Department Store. It is easily accessible by public transport. There is also a mega Muji Shopping Mall near it. 
Nice by day and night,It's pretty picturesque during the day then at night with the lighting it gives it another just as picturesque side. Cool to just wander along with plenty to look at along the way. Also worth joining the Spooky Side of Seoul tour which takes in part of the stream and gives some interesting history if you're a lover of the macabre. 
Tranquil Respite on a Hot Summer Day,Love how they converted this stream into a nice park and place to rest and relax for the people and visitors to Seoul. I hope they maintain it as just a park and not be invaded by commerce. Its a much nicer stroll at night .
Love strolling along the stream,It is indeed a place worth visiting. We strolled along the stream and stopped to sit at the side to enjoy the breezy wind and get some sunlight during the spring season. Don't forget to bring some titbits and a bottle of hot tea with you at your next visit.
Very relaxing and peaceful,"We came here on an evening and the scenery was quite beautiful. The wind was blowing it was a bit cold, but nevertheless we had a pleasant time relaxing at the stream enjoying the murals and the flow of water across the stream. The kids enjoyed this stream so much as well. Truly recommend this spot to those who loves peace and tranquility."
Beautiful stream,"People like to strolling around the stream, especially on summer. You have to be careful on rainy days because the stream will be closed to prevent the floods."
"Its a long stream, relaxing and dating place","Its a very long stream stretch few KM. Along the stream you can find nicely placed stepping stone, nice and calm small water stream, underneath water fixture, and most importantly, its clean.. Lot of Koreans can be spotted having good and romantic time.. There are lot of entries to this place, may google for the suitable exit from metro station from your hotel. It is very impressive how korean people built this and make a small water stream as one of tourist spot just to have relaxing night. The idea very smart"
Nice place to take a walk,"We were here first at night, and everything was decorated with lanterns because of Buddha's birthday, so it looked really awesome. But also during the day, it's a nice place to take a walk."
Clear,What a great illustration of the talent and commitment of the korean people. Turning an old piece of infrastructure into this amazing public space. Could not believe how clean it was and how big the fish we saw in there were ~ 1 to 2 feet
Peaceful,It was a nice break from the hustle and bustle of the surrounding markets. There was a water fountain. 
Convenient landmark,"My hotel, the VenueG, fronted onto this restored stream. It was a convenient riverwalk type park that ran right into the heart of Seoul and within sight if the main square and the Palace.There were fish in the stream and it was quite a little oasis of quiet in an otherwise chaotic area.I found it very useful navigating in reference to it as it was conspicuous on the maps and easy to find by street. There was a very cool ornament at the downtown end and there was a large tourist centre as well."
Relaxing walk,This is a relief in the bustle of the town. A nice walk along a stream with waterfalls and many plants and trees. 
Canal turned street park...,If you’re out of things to do this a nice break from the commotion. It’s a peaceful area to walk in. With flowers and a stream. They turned an old canal in to a lovely walking park. 
Perfect get away,"Nice to escape to this perfect place and stroll the full length at whatever pace takes your fancy. Take in the atmosphere, people watch or track your pace and do it as a workout. There is something for everyone and I loved it."
A peaceful escape from the hustle,"Seoul is an absolutely fabulous city full of fun, excitement, beauty, culture, but it is hectic. This stream in the middle of it all is an amazing escape and peaceful oasis where you can walk, sit and people watch and just recharge."
Love the clear water of the river/stream,"This is one amazing work by the govt which converted and change this stream to clear water stream and odorless...with walkways and stage at certain part for performance.To see this in an ultra modern city which can provide calmness, relaxation for its citizen is really great...People were walking, jogging, cycling, pet walk without a worries as I saw there is security patrolling the area"
Oasis in the city,Lovely having this very pretty space right in the city - it's cool and quiet down there - very relaxing !
Successful urban enhancement ,These days it is hard to imagine how this space was before the previous road was demolished. It was worthwhile overcoming the various objections raised to thwart this project that has now clearly much improved the urban environment 
Nice view,"Nice view for photo and nice place to visit. Good to learn about the historical and community environment. In the past, this area was a railway. But in the present, this is a nice park in the central of Seoul."
perfect place for a city weekend morning walk,We stayed a bus ride away from the stream so we appreciated the nature amongst the bustling city when we arrived. The Stream is set lower than the streets surrounding it which separates the area a little better and as we walked down on a Saturday morning we were able to take a nice break before we headed out to busier parts of Seoul. It was a peaceful area and was nice to relax in.
Must see,This is special - very relaxing to walk along this little stream that flows through the heart of Seoul
Relaxing ,"A nice way to spend some time, walking along the stream. Very quiet and relaxing - with the busy city above"
Peaceful and wonder,"We got lost while looking for this place but every step we took was worth it. The place was quiet and beautiful. It was serene and you can just sit there and relax. The place was a little smelly though, I think it was from the water. But the place was clean and I see a lot of people just taking the scenery in. If you are in Korea, you must visit this place."
Amazing river walk,Such a pleasant way to spend an evening strolling along the river. There are murals and buskers along the way as well as a digital light show. Highly recommended for your visit to Seoul.
Enjoyed the scenery and sound of flowing water,"When to the section near Centermark Hotel. Although the weather was very chilly, and the path a bit slippery, it was greater and relaxing just hearing the flow of water. Different Scenery in different sections of the stream."
Artful: A Modern twist to nature,We walked from Gyeongbukgung palace and found ourselves resting by the stream. It was a soothing experience. We admired the fountain and had a look around the stalls set up near the shell statue called The Spring. 
Peaceful Break from the City,We decided to walk from Gwangjang Market to Dongdaemun Market (about 20 minutes) and it was such a peaceful walk. It felt like we stepped out of the city into another place. 
Have smell,Located in the center but not really clean stream. There is a bad smell from the water of this stream.Not worthy to visit 
Escape the noise and traffic by walking this gem,We talked the stream just after lunchtime on a sunny day in April. It was lovely. Exciting and relaxing at the same time. Everyone - from families having a picnic to the ubiquitious office workers on their cell phones - was out enjoying this lovely location. I see from the reviews that people who walked with stream in the winter were disappointed. So the season may make a big difference in visiting this lovely site.
Enjoy the breeze,Each season is different decorations. Very relaxing here a good place for couples to walk together get some breeze alongside the canal.
Art enhanced walkway ,"For art lovers , then you could stay here. We had our own photo taking . Nice place to stroll around. Watch out for announcement of festivals , it would a much better environment. "
Peaceful stream,"I’d suggest going early in the morning, and walking along this stream. No traffic lights here! Also in the evening, along some sections, there a small laser show. Actually quiet peaceful by this stream.Only negative, needs more signage, so you know where to exit from, or which street your at."
Really relaxing walk,"As an escape from the hustle and bustle of the city I’d really recommend taking a walk along this river. There’s plenty of notices to read regarding how the area was recovered and regenerated and the different styles along the walk are impressive. It’s nice that over the weekend it wasn’t too busy, and it’s kept really clean in keeping with the rest of the city. If only to admire the work behind the regeneration, but also to see another side of the city, I’d walk down here again."
Beautiful and Peaceful ,The stream right in the city was a welcome spot to relax and enjoy the environment. Across the street from my hotel was very easy to find. 
"Beginning of spring a bit sparce, but nice to stroll along anyway.",We were probably there at the wrong time. But we still enjoyed the walk and the environment. We actually walked almost the entire length of the stream. It was very cold (end of March) and the water was icy but the pathway and rock paths were lovely. 
A pleasant walk,We visited this in the day and it was just ok. At night time with the lights it would be a lot prettier a so I suggest you go then. 
"Clean stream, nice to take a walk","The stream was clear and clean. There’s nothing much to do there apart from taking photos of the scenery and yourself, as well as taking a walk by the pavement beside it. Although there’s not much to do, it’s still a must visit in Seoul."
Relaxing night stroll,"it was a cold night, therefore i guessed there were not so many people along the stream. the stream and walking paths are very clean,there were exits along the stream, so that you can stop anytime and find the nearest subway station."
Clean and beautiful,"The stream look very normal during day time, just normal stream, but is very clean. When comes to night time, there will be neon lights lighted up and you can see many people strolling along the sidewalks of the stream. Parents with kids, couples. Nice time to stroll."
"Amazing any time of the day, month or year","Fantastic water feature right in the center of the city. Made accessible and interesting, and thoroughly relaxing the busiest part of the city. Walk for 10 minutes or an hour, you will love the experience."
Very memorable walk,Saw this on TV how they demolished the elevated highway to revive the stream.It was a nice experience to see it up close. The colors after winter may not be that good but the crowd was fewer.
Nice,Nice place to walk through but nothing more than that its a romantic place for couples ( not my type ) 
Probably more interesting in summer,"Walked along this stream during our recent visit to Seoul. It was winter, so not much going on. It was just an interesting break to a busy city. We understand in spring/summer, there are lights and various activities along the stream, so definitely worth a look then."
Clean water that flows,"It's beneath the streets, beautiful and relaxing. If you want to avoid the busy roads and traffic, take this peaceful side walk."
Seoul searching on winter ,This place will relax your mind even during winter. Do not miss this stream few blocks away from Seoul plaza ang Gyeongbokgung Palace.
Unexpected ,"Just in the middle of the city there is this stream. Cool to walk a couple of blocks and relax. Easy to see as part of many attractions in historic city (palace, market). "
Clean and peaceful,We were there during winter. There were Christmas lightings and really beautiful. Good for jogging and brisk walks. It is very clean. Some part of the walls describe the history of this stream
Small steam in heart of Seoul. ,This stream run from North to South. You can take wal both side of stream if you like get a bit rid of bustle of city. During wal along of stream you ja spot wall some info about history of this area. 
Nice place to come and relax!,"I like to take a stroll here and watch the fish. There are some fishes in the water that you can just watch to kill time if you want. Also, you can book a free tour here too, very awesome. My tour guide told us that there are some koi fish in the water, and they go back to Han's river to lay eggs, and then they come back to the stream to visit. It was interesting how fish knows how to do that!! Well, this is a lovely place to come and see, read a book, take pictures, and have a bite."
WINTER LIGHT FESTIVAL,"We came here to see the winter light festival on Dec 24, 2018. We walked from our hotel at myeongdong to cheonggyecheon stream ( 20min ). We walked around the beautiful stream with so many people. "
A stream within the city,"Although the stream was unimpressive and small, its river bank has been spruced up and decorated with caricatures, paintings, plastic models and structures, which help livened up and made the riverside ""interesting and attractive"". Clean and uncluttered, the tagline then was ""I Seoul U""..... "
Yolanda Jones ,Interesting visit in the middle of the city with loads of skyscrapers around. Must be a lovely place to visit in summer
Romantic stroll along Cheonggyecheon Stream,"If you can spare a couple of hours, this stream is very accessible. However, experiences may vary as this stream is very long and not all portions are picturesque and scenic. It is unique as the stream traverses the city - some parts are so scenic that the hustle and bustle of the busy city can be overlooked. Best to look up the recommended train stations to alight at - there are several - and the walk from the train stations will be less that 10 to 15 minutes. Also, to enhance your experience, please take your strolls during the early morning or late afternoon/evening. Walking at noon NOT recommended especially in the blistering summer sun. We saw children/families having fun and even people trying to catch little fish, just enjoying little pockets of nature"
Bridging the North and South of the City,Neglected for many years this stream was restored and opened to public during 2005.This stream passes thru many Seoul’s many important landmarks. More than twenty bridges cross this stream which is about 8 km long flowing through the Seou’s downtown connecting northern and southern areas before joining the Han River.
Disappointing,"On Seoul official Instagram, I saw a gorgeous photo of the Cheonggyecheon Stream with beautiful lights decoration at night. So I decided to visit the stream. However, I couldn't find the beautiful lights decoration even though I walked for quite a distance. I searched for the lights at many parts of the stream - from Jongno to Dongdaemun. Couldn't find the lights so I gave up. Disappointed."
Mesmerisingly peaceful,"Went to the stream in the evening so as to see the beautiful Christmas and New Year's lights. Was not disappointed! The lights were beautiful! However, it can get a little crowded so taking pictures was a little difficult."
disappointed,"it was advertised that the schedule for autumn lantern display was until november 18, my mom and i went there on our last night on november 10 bearing with the chilly night weather, not a single lantern in sight, we also bumped into a few foreigners who are wondering saying aloud ""where are the lanterns?"" "
Great oasis,"This is a great oasis in a very busy city, and is perfect for a contemplative walk, a jog, or just to sit and soak up the atmosphere."
nice walking path in the city,"There's a nicely paved sidewalk on both sides of the stream here. The stream is pretty cute and clean. You can cross over to the other bank by walking across stones that have been placed in the stream. There are some nice plants, small waterfalls, etc."
More litter and garbage,"South Koreans don't like to pick up their litter. In an advanced country like this, everyone just throws their garbage everywhere. It's sad."
Beautiful walking path in seoul city,We visit this time in vor chritsmas time was very beautiful with many christmas deco a light a very crowded on weekend 
View at night...,Walking along the drain is usually nonsense....but here in Korea...you will fall in love with the drain that the Korean have done up perfectly for the tourist to see...The lights and design on the wall makes it so beautiful...There is no bad smell as you walk along the stream...worth the visit...
Must Visit here on December,"This place is transformed to be a very beautiful area during christmas season.. all the lighting and christmas tree make it amazing at night. If u go to seoul on December, its a must see.."
The stream you see in KDrama,Visited the real thing you see in KDramas. Exactly what I expected. Nice and pleasant walk along the stream. Easily accessible. Close to hotels and subway plus within walking distance of Myeong-dong and Insadong.
Worth spending an evening,"I'd read a lot about the river in Seoul that had been rejuvenated. On a long business visit to Seoul, I decided to see it for myself.I took a couple of trains that brought me to the stream. The stream is quite long and has a fair number of visitors but it never feels crowded and you can always find a spot to dip your feet and watch the world go by.The water is crystal clear and there are areas with fountains that make for a nice view. Towards evening, LED lights come up and make it an enchanting place.I would highly recommend visiting this venue. It's a lovely way to spend an evening in Seoul and an oasis of calm in a hustling metropolis. I wish more cities took the effort to create public places of this nature."
Nice Winter Festival,"The stream is decorated and lite for Christmas lantern around the week of Christmas. The stream was strung with overhead lanterns and yule-time lighted figures was setup throughout a length of stream. There was also some folk dancing and a setup where people could light lanterns and float them down the stream. Of course, there was the usual food booths. Fairly busy with lots of local people attending."
Beautiful Christmas lights,"Despite the freezing cold, the beautiful and colorful display of Christmas lights made our day. 2 thumbs up!"
Beautiful at Christmas time!,What an enjoyable stroll we had with lights and decorations! Our walk was delightful and we were able to stop and take pictures along the stream.
Lantern Festival,We were so lucky to see the Lantern Festival! This is a man made walkway with a stream of water that is under the traffic and is 5 miles long. It is a well planned space for a busy city. 
I'm in the middle of Seoul?!!!,"Yes, I've been here before in 2009. Still, I'm amazed at how the people have kept this stream clean. Hats off to you! See attached pictures and notice the clear water and wildlife. There are CCTV cameras along the stream, too."
Oasis in the City,"I really love how the city have transformed a once eye-sore into a beautiful and clean place for both locals and foreigners. Our visit on this place was made even special because of the Lantern Festival. Though we are a day late for the festival we are still greeted with meaningful and wonderful works of art. The displays showcased the things that make Korea - Korea, from the old day to the modern day. I love how peaceful the place is despite the busyness that's surrounding it. The place is landscaped beautifully. It's also a walking distance to Gyeongbukgong, Gwanghwamun Square, to King Sejong and Admiral Shin's monument."
Peaceful and Tranquil,"It's hard to believe your in the city. I really recommend not just walking along the stream but getting a nice pastry a great cup of coffee and enjoying a moment or 3.Check out the safety features as well, to be honest I have never seen such good emergency preparedness. "
Beautiful ,This place was renovated during president Lee and it’s beautifully done.I enjoyed walking down the stream. 
A clear water stream in downtown,"There is no way to miss it, although I would not go out of my way to see it. A path walkway along both sides of a small stream of water in the middle of a noisy city is where you can spend a few peaceful minutes. Some areas are wider and have granite like floor whereas; as you walk away form downtown you get a more bucolic feel."
Nature in the City,"We walked for about 1 mile along this stream, which features a narrow park-like setting on both sides, and found this space to provide a lovely respite from the city’s noise andhigh-rises. Part of a program to provide green areas in Seoul, the area opened in 2005 after the removal of an elevated highway and roads that hid what was left of a stream below. To keep it running now, water is pumped from elsewhere to maintain a steady flow. Cheonggye Plaza near Gwanghwamun Square in north-central Seoul marks the starting point, A tall modern sculpture by Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggeu signals the plaza. Titled “Spring,” the work displays alternate red and blue spirals and resembles a thin Christmas tree.We descended steps that lead to a walkway, where the immediate view is a wide waterfall to the right, which plunges into the stream. No vegetation appears in this section, but greenery, including trees, soon comes into view. Footbridges and stepping stones sometimes gave access to the opposite side of the stream. Flowers arranged in boxes and pots on walls brightened the area. Nature kept our attention, and we hardly noticed the tall buildings in adjoining neighborhoods. Only a few people wandered here on this Saturday morning, and we much appreciated the serenity."
tranquil escape in city,"this was an unusual find, a gentle stream running through modern skyscrapers on both banks. Good for a quick escape."
Nice Walk,We went to the Lantern festival and stayed along the stream. It is a very nice beautiful location. There were places to eat and shop as well. 
Relaxing ,This is a great little walk and at the moment it’s hosting the lantern festival and a good place to grab a drink or some food and sit in The Sun 
Walk below all the Traffic,"Cheonggyecheon Stream is a quiet peaceful path along a small river in the center of Seoul. As you are below street level car noise is much less.Crowded during the Seoul Lantern festival, but beautiful to see all the unique designs.I great way to walk away from traffic"
"The best place to think, enjoy fresh air, aaaand people watch","What a peaceful, yet lively place! If you're ever in Seoul, take a stroll along the stream and enjoy your time. If I loved closeby, I think I would want to walk there every morning.What I really liked was the mix of nature and art at the stream. As you walk down the path, you’ll come across murals, paintings, and even plaques that write about the history of the stream."
Beautiful clean stream at the heart of the city,"We came here late in the afternoon. We were able to walk along the stream and see how clean the water was before the sun went down. In the evening, the lanterns were lit and it was beautiful!It is easily accessible from the street and there were elevators in some parts."
Historical stream / river,Lost stream / river that sadly extinct but got revived by the technology. Beautiful at night with the light display
Festival of Lights,"From my hotel, it was a short walk to the Cheonggyecheon Stream. I went late in the afternoon and before I left, the lights were on in the lantern decorations in the stream. It is a peaceful place. The sound of the running water is soothing. The Festival of Lights was beautiful."
Lantern festival,Displays of lanterns along the stream. Nice place to chill out and enjoy the lovely lights after a day of shopping! 
Peaceful in the heart of the city,"If you want to escape the hustle of Seoul without even leaving it, his stream is the right place. You can walk for a long time in peace, watching fish swim along the stream. It is absolutely gorgeous on a sunny day and easily accessed via metro"
Worth a visit,Good chilly walk during the autumn. Happy to see the stream is well maintained and the water is clean in such hectic city. 
Pretty at nught,Nice place to stroll and take pictures. Pretty at night as the lights gives the area a nice atmosphere. 
Worth a look,"This is a good example of a worthy attempt to turn what was a stream that was extremely polluted and choked with sewerage and rubbish; cleaned out, exposed to air and light, restored and redesigned to turn it into city asset. It still smells a bit but it's worth seeing. "
Waterside stroll,"The views are nice with large fish in the river, the scene is very peaceful, with the city sounds easily muffled by the rushing waterRather than visit the stream for itself, the best way is to visit the many indoor and outside shopping malls along its 6 mile course and then walk a little of the stream's path to get from one market to another."
Nothing much at night ,Unless u are a couple which is food as it's dark. If not go in the morning between 9 to 12 PM as you will be able to see the change of guards. As night time unless there are some events if not . There are not much lights to see much of the beautiful history or this stream which survived wars
Just a stream with a lot of small flies flying around,Perhaps it would be better to come here at night with the lights on. I came here in the afternoon & there was so many small flies flying around! 
Great views,Lovely way to get away from the streets and still get where you need to go. The sound of the water and traditional music was a nice change from the cars when walking the busy streets. There was still a lot of greenery in October.
Great idea to implant a bit of nature within the mega city,"Yes, try to stroll a stretch along this stream. Really gives you a break from the city traffic and noises..."
Pleasant stroll through busy Seoul,We visited at night as everything started to light up. if you're after a pleasant and peaceful stroll along the river it's nice.
Relaxing place,"I love this stream. It’s very clean. Very serene, especially if you get to go there when it’s not busy with a lot of other tourists. Great place to relax and enjoy nature after walking to see palaces/museums/sights the whole day. Such a peaceful place to be especially in busy Seoul City. "
Seoul Stream,We arrived ard 8pm . Not really pack in a cold nite. A few couples dating n few foreigners... A good cold walk with kids... And beautiful light out there..Stream connecting City Hall to Myeongdong with a 10-15mins walk.Enjoy
"Nice stroll down the stream on a perfect, sunny October day","Having arrived from Europe after two long flights the day before I was in dire need of stretching my legs. I was pleasantly surprised that the Cheonggyecheon Stream starts quite close to the City Hall and my hotel. I threw my little rucksack onto my back and proceeded to walk downstream. I didn’t track how far I walked. It was just nice to relax in the sun, taking it nice and easy and stopping from time to time to take the odd photograph and ogle at the large carp swimming in the water. I liked the stepping stones placed strategically across the stream at numerous places. And underneath the bridges you could sit in the shade, read posters and signs and even enjoy a small art exhibition under one of them.At one point, way down stream, I climbed the stairs up to normal street level and discovered a large textile market. On the way back I walked at street level just to get the feel of the normal weekday hubbub. It was certainly an unusual experience to see such a peaceful stream running through the Centre of such a busy city with the normal traffic and hectic life continuing unabated at street level.Certainly a nice way to spend some down time. And I clocked up many more than my usual daily 10.000 steps making up for sitting around in planes the day before."
2nd walk down,"This is the 2nd time we've walked down the stream from City Hall. No regrets. Do spend about 30mins, especially if one is heading to Insadong and some areas along the stream are nicely done up"
 A very pleasant afternoon stroll in the city centre,"I saw this recommended in a travel guide and as it was not far from our hotel we spent an hour or so wandering along a section of the stream. What a pleasant surprise to discover this in the middle of the commercial district, a real oasis of peace and calm surrounded by trees and occasional artwork.Sadly we didn’t have the chance to return in the evening but it must be lovely when all the lanterns are lit up."
Beautiful place,"Not much to do around here, just walking and taking pictures.. but it indeed is a beautiful place, even more beautiful at night!"
strolling along the river in the center of town,Very relaxing walk.....It is possible to walk up to the Han river and there are some paintings along the walk You can always interrupt it as there are stairs or elevators in certain areas..
nice,"nice place to walk in the evening, when the lantarns are in the water arround the festival periods it is just perfect"
Worth a stroll at night time.,"During the day, the stream is just there amongst the hustle as it is close to the markets.At night, it comes alive with lights that give it a unique feel. There is a water fall with lights at one end and then you follow it down where there is displays of light here and there.There are stone steps across the steam if you want to cross over. I enjoyed walking below the street level with the stream next to me while you are surrounded by office towers."
Beautiful stream creation in the middle of Seoul,"A great place to visit if you want to escape the hustle and bustle of Seoul for a bit. I was able to relax and revive here. The path is well constructed and very pleasant to wander as much as you desire. The sound of the stream trickling past is relaxing. Some flowers adorn some of the side parts of the stream. Lit up at night, the stream has a different ambience again. Stepping stones along some parts of the stream create lots of fun for kids and adults alike to jump from one stone to another. The depth of the stream is not too deep, but keep a watch and hold your kid's hands to prevent an unwanted fall in the water. No cafes so bring your own water to drink.Many steps at various points to access the river, and occasional ramps provide good access. I loved it here!"
Some respite from the city ,"Wow. What a great place to go for a stroll in this noisy, big city. I lived in Korea many years ago and it’s hard to believe this river was under my feet. It’s a lovely place to walk and take a break. "
Worth visiting!,Cheonggyecheon Stream is a great spot to relax at as there are large stones under the bridge to sit on to get out of the sun or rain. There is a section lined with decorated tiles with drawings and writing on them which is a nice touch and it seems like the community got involved when cleaning up this beautiful walking route.
Good spot for a run,I decided to visit Cheonggyecheon Stream during a run in Seoul. It was perfect for just this - was not too busy and the terrain was faily OK and flat. When I visited they were just setting up the lanterns for the festival so they had not yet been switched on. I imagine the stream would be quite impressive when lit.
Interesting,Really just an outdoor park space to hang with. Maybe eat or drink while you are there. Interesting from a revitalization perspective but it really is just a quick walk. 
"Got lost, found this!","I planned to find this stream but I couldn’t work out the route on foot from where I was staying, then I went out for a wander and ended up here anyway! It was night so I didn’t get good pictures but I could see it and there were some lights too, it was a nice little bit of nature in the middle of a load of skyscraper buildings, worth a look if you’re in the area, and some cool stuff nearby too. "
Beautiful oasis,This is such a lovely place to visit in the hub of a busy city. We strolled along the stream in the evening and it was just lovely and peaceful.
P,"Perfect for a walk around, having a snack there, chilling. It is amazing how there is a river just in between the city. "
A lovely walk through the heart of the city. ,I visit Seoul often on business and I always walk the length of Cheongyecheon Stream. It's a lovely walk and takes you right through the heart of the city. I usually take a metro to the end and then walk all the way to City Hall. 
An oasis in the heart of the city,My son and I did enjoy our walk. It was great to be able to relax in this little sanctuary far away from the noise and the traffic. It's worth the walk. 
Beautiful for hanging out and for photos,I usually go to S.Korea in the winter time so there are always light installations at the stream. It's very nicely designed and perfect for photo ops! If you're in S.Korea I totally recommend this as a place to check out.
Lovely walk in middle of city,"Walked this a couple of times, and the bubbling waters provide a nice break from the surrounding city. Believe this used to be an actual road which has been converted. Plenty of fish in the water........but not one single duck to be seen."
Super romantic stroll,"Buy some street food and bring it here with a loved one or someone you're trying to woo. It will make them fall for you just like in K-dramas. Even better, if it's raining, make them share an umbrella with you."
Very nice area at night,"We were fortunate enough during pur visit because there was a Lantern Festival so this place looked so nice with all the lights and parades. A must watch festival, I should say also. "
I am so satisfied,"I am shocked by the fact this stream is so clear that you can see fishes. The water is so cold. Try putting your legs there. It's refreshing! And, don't forget to cross the river. After a long day, spending my time at this stream heals me a lot."
Tranquility in the heart of Seoul,"Our hotel was right next to the steam (New Kukje, stay there!), so we spent some time walking up and down to various places. Lovely place where many locals go to escape and relax. Beautiful at night. "
Cheongyecheon winter,Lovely for a walk day or night the area is very well lit. They also hold a lantern festival here around november time so definitely check it out well worth it and best part it's FREEEEEEE
Relaxing waterside walkway,"This is a lovely place to take a quiet stroll, and makes for a nice alternative to the sidewalks above. It's well lit at night as well."
Clean stream,"It is a stream in the city where some locals sit by, have a picnic and chat with friends. I didn’t find anything particularly special about it. "
Lovely place to take a stroll or sit and have a coffee,"Lovely little stream, the history behind it as well is also fascinating. Nice and cool with lots of shade on hot days, and not too busy either. "
Stream in the city,Just amazing walking during nighttime when light ambiance are perfect. Calming to stroll alongside the stream and look at some of the light show displayed on the wall side.
take a stroll and enjoy the atmosphere,"a nice respite away from the hustle and bustle.very peaceful.and since its underground, you dont need to worry about traffic."
Worth searching it’s history!,"The stream is a very pleasant alternative to walking along the normal path.The stream had been covered over but was discovered and brought back to its present condition- search the history.I walked along it a couple of times, the second had a heron in the middle. The plants are kept and replanted so it is very pretty too.Can be a bit noisy if events going on above, but generally a lovely bit of calm in the middle of the city. "
A beautiful escape from the city,This was a great location to get a small respite from the bustling city life. It was clean and beautiful. If you are looking for more than a walk along a stream you will be disappointed though. There were nice cool places to sit and take a break and I even put my feet in the water (although I am not sure this is permitted).
Nice on a hot day,When I was there this was a small oasis....nice cool running water to dip your toes in and chat with other overheated tourists :-)
"Great way to ""feel"" the city","Great way to stroll the city without traffic. Lighting at night makes you forget you are in a busy city. We used the canal to get from one area to another. Lots of people during the day enjoying lunch, too. We even saw a heron chasing a fish!"
Lighted up at night,"We started at the Cheonggye Plaza end to admire the fountains. When at the plaza facing the stream, there is a ramp to your right that leads down to stream-level. It was nice and cool in the evening, and there were a lot of people just relaxing on the steps, some with their feet in the stream. There were musicians playing, and it seemed that every tunnel or wall had its own theme. Would love to go the entire length of this stream someday."
Great for morning walk and stroll to work,I enjoy this peaceful river on my walk from Koreana Hotel to the office. In the morning it is quiet and peaceful. Sometimes in the day there are peaceful events for gathering. Traffic is not so busy as the main streets. I start at the spiral as the river begins and grows.
Lovely for a stroll away from the crowds,Grab a coffee from The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf then take youself for a relaxing stroll - nice escape from the hustle and bustle above
Nice stroll,This was a nice stroll and a break from the square. There is a before and after photo of this area. I found the historical image from Seoul Sky
Cool stream in the summer,"The famous Cheonggyecheon stream which pass through the Seoul city centre is beautifully cool, clear and clean. It really helps in the hot summer season. We can sit on the rock and relaxing our feet in the stream while watching some fishes swim around out feet."
Some Foul Smell,"I had high expectation of this place, after reading all the reviews. I do find it strange that no one seem to mention the foul smell along the river bank. I went there a few days ago, at last morning. Few people were walking along the riverbank and even though I totally agree that the area is so nicely done up, I didn't enjoy the stroll as there was a light stench, which I assume, was coming from the stream. I started the walk from Jongno 2-ga station. It was just about 5 min. from the stream. I left after a brief 10 min. walk."
A nice Park,"Offers light show, a good walk or place to dip your feet during summer. This park caters to all. A good walking distance from Myeongdong Shopping Street. "
The place is an oasis in the town.,It is near the city hall station and is very nice place to visit. There is not only the stream but also a nice fall.
Relaxing ,"This is about the most peaceful place in Seoul that I could possibly think of. Spring and fall are great times to visit, and the stream also plays host to the Lantern Festival in November. Usually a lot of space to relax, unwind, and contemplate."
Beautiful stream,"Amazed by the size and amount of fish in this stream, great place to cool your feet off in the heat, and Bang right in the middle of the city!"
Nice and clean ,"Good for jogging, walking or just yo sit and enjoy the sound of water. Try dipping your feet in the water and relax. "
good place to relax,good place to chill out. Can put your legs in the water. sourrounded by good eateries. across the road you can see few iconic places.
Amazing site on the city,We st err polled along the water on our way to eat out. The sides are nicely maintained for enjoying the water and wildlife. Very relaxing and unexpected for a city of this size.
Beautiful Stream To Rest,"Such a lovely and peaceful spot to rest during your busy sight seeing day. After spending quite a bit of time shopping and eating in Insadong and visiting the temple across the street, I continued walking to the subway and came upon this stream. I decided to hang out here a bit. There were lots of people sitting by the stream. People were reading or eating, taking photos. There were couples on dates here, kids playing around. There were some protestors walking around - one group anti abortion and another for it. There was a band performing. Basically there is a lot going on! But it's still possible to find a quiet section along the stream as it's long. Would definitely recommend this place."
Cooling down ,"A lovely way to get through the city, walking by the stream. There are little rocks that you can use to cross the stream and you can take shelter from the sun under the bridges, just like the locals. At the end is a waterfall with a wishing well. Along the wall is a mural depicting South Korea's history."
best place visited when spring festival,this stream is very coozy for couple to take date.when spring they have this kind of festival that you can enjoy for free.
Actually I went there with my mom,I love this place but too bad I always went there in the afternoon. Hope i could visit there at night later
middle of city,"Good way to relax in evening, very close to Gwanghwamun square. in evening with color full lighting it enhanced its beauty."
Lovely to see a clear stream with fish in the middle of the city,"The stream has delightful walking paths alongside. Whilst we walked we noticed little rapids, places to cross the stream as well as many fish.A nice place to forget you are in the middle of a big city."
Great place for a morning stroll,"We were staying at a nearby hotel and just outside was Cheonggyecheon Stream beside the Dongdaemun Shopping Center. My wife had reminded me that this is a favourite place for so many Korean soap opera shoots. The stream is really long, but we only descended to the strwam beside the Ogansugyo Bridge and then walked along side the stream just past the Beodeuldari Bridge. The great thing about this place is that there are many people walking and talking photos or just sitting and talking and relaxing.One side of the stream had lush vegetation while the other side was more of a wall and wide lane. There are large stepping stones every so often so that you can cross the stream safely, we saw an elderly couple manage it without problem, and the stream is actually full of fish, some quite large, which was really great for the kids to see.There are both steps and ramps (for wheelchairs) up to the street level so that anyone can walk beside the stream."
Breath of fresh air in the heart of Seoul,"Some years ago the city decided to tear up a road as there was a stream underneath it, and now it has been developed into a beautiful place to walk. There are fish in the stream, plants by the banks and a few sculptures. Walking along the paths, either side of the stream, a few meters below the surrounding area it is quite peaceful and many of the noises of the city cannot be heard. What a wonderful development."
Escape the city streets,"It is well worth seeking out a walk along the Cheonggyecheon Stream, we were fortunate to be staying one block away from the stream and had time for two walks, one in the morning and the other in the afternoon, both times it was wonderful to escape the busy Seoul streets. The stream is well used by locals getting out and about for a little fresh air and exercise, it was relatively peaceful even though up above are roads. Along the wall of the pathway are signs letting you know were you are in relation to the streets above, distances and some interesting art installations. We also loved to see large fish in the stream, hopefully a good sign of water quality, as it looked clear."
Refreshing walking route,"The stream is located in the center of Seoul City, near the Line 1 Subway Station from Dongdaemun Station to City Hall. It is really a nice place for walking or jogging through the autumn or spring. It is really freezing on winter so it is not recommended to go here but you can come here on summer to enjoy the fresh air. I’m not recommending you to go on jogging summer because Korean’s summer is really humid."
Peace in the middle of chaos,"This stream is honestly so peaceful and relaxing, that i would go back every time I had the opportunity to. The water is full of fishes, the side with chirping birds (and pigeons). We even saw an egret hunting for fish."
free of charge,This stream was once buried under and restored with help some of SK's big company. A nice place to a leisure stroll around and free of charge...yay. The KTO ofiice located near the Cheonggyecheon Stream.
Time for a walk,"Cheonggyecheon stream is almost 11km long. Was there in winter and it was freezing cold during the day. In the evening, it was worse. So go prepared with warm clothing with gloves and all as it is a lot of walking, unless u decided to abandon the walk midway. The stream is well decorated during festive seasons and attract lots of tourist and locals alike. You can get to Cheonggyecheon stream by Seoul Subway; Take Subway Line 5 to Gwanghwamun Station and Exit 5. Alternatively, take Seoul Subway Line 1 or 2 to City Hall Station and Exit 4. "
Nice place to people watch and relax,"The stream itself is nothing special to be honest, but it's a nice place to relax. There are lots of people around towards sunset and it had a great vibe. Bring some food and drinks - think that would be ideal. "
a marvelous water work in the center of Seoul,"Having a walk beside the stream in a hot summer afternoon, you feel cool, quite and relax. It is really a marvelous water work, turning a dirty sewage into a clear stream."
Sooo Nature!,"Its refreshing, in the middle of the road you cant believe that you can find a clean water and solemn park."
Local's hangout place,"This place comes alive at night. Night bazaars lighting up the place, and busking groups spread across the area.The area used to be a place of waste, but then it was rebuilt as public place with a stream flowing in the middle. Stairs are provided for people to sit down and spend times with loved ones. You can even dip your feet in the stream as it is very shallow.You can find friends, lovers, and sometimes family just sit beside the stream, chatting, eat, and drink beers.The place is near Gwanghwamun area, so you can also enjoy buildings and night lights."
Nothing much to see.,"Just landscaped, remodeled stream. It was a canal.Only visit if you happen to be in the area. There is an interesting secondhand market nearby."
Cheonggyecheon Stream,Cheonggyecheon Stream is in the middle of big city - Seoul. In summer it look like a small forest. It’s really good to walk there in the morning or evening. But you should be careful because there are lots of tine tiny mosquitoes. And you should be ready to make photo because you can see Asian bird. It’s nice place for walking.
Nature wonder inside the city,I'm a nature lover that's why i love this stream. Its sound and the cold water is sooo refreshing. A must go place after a tiring all day seoul touring. :)
The Stream,"The sight of Cheonggycheon Strem changes very frequently throughout the year, as all kinds of events are organized along it. My favourites were the lantern launching (sometime in November) and the Christmas decorations exhibited along the stream during winter time. It is worth walking along it and realizing how much this place has changed since the time it was just .....a stinky flow of water."
Refreshing sight in the middle of the city,"I came here in the middle of summer and I must say I had a good time by just sitting on the bank, watching the water flow. It was therapeutic in a way. I even played on big stones on the stream to get across the other side. It's also fun to see locals who would dip their feet on the stream to refresh them. Plus points for the location, upon exit from the subway station, I easily spotted the ""unicorn"" or the entrance of the stream. The subway exit is barely a minute away from the entrance of the stream.Will I come back? Definitely. And I will recommend this to anyone going to Seoul."
A charming evening walk,"The stream is a quiet respite from the busy streets above, popular with local couples and those desiring a peaceful moment. The stream is accented with lights and stepping stones, and we found it to be clean and pleasant. "
peaceful place to rest and unwind,the stream is a great place to rest after a whole day of walking went there around 5 pm rested before heading to dinner... you can see a lot of locals there as well and the place is clean. the stream is long so if you plan to visit better check with tourist information... we almost went to seoul station just to see the stream while we were in insadong but it crosses insadong as well so after asking tourist info we were directed to the stream
Cooling walk,"Enjoyed walking along the bank of the stream. Delightfully ‘landscaped ‘ to create a charming place to walk away from the road.Pretty development, can even sit and dangle feet in the water. Enjoyed watching local people taking a stroll at the weekend. "
Lovely area for a walk,This stream area is nice to walk and lively. At times they had tents set up with items for sale. Definitely worth checking out.
Cool,"Very cool manmade underground stream. Often there are concerts , markets or other events held at the beginning of the stream"
Excellent linear park,"Seoul has more than its fair share of linear parks, but this one takes the cake in terms of being useful and beautiful. There's stepping stones across the stream, there's sitting areas, there's painted ceramic tiles, waterfalls, trees and shade. There's directional signage to the nearest metro stop at each exit stair from the Stream. Not many garbage cans, not for bikes, more for walkers, no vending machines if you are thirsty. Occasionally, there were swarms of gnats. Water is so clean you can see variety of fishy inhabitants."
"Good at spring to early fall, best at lantern festival","Good time to visit are at spring, summer, and early fall, since the weather may get colder as time goes. best time to visit is at afternoon to evening, especially when there is lantern festival. there will be a lantern statue along the river."
Huge fish in some parts,"Its a narrow sream yet relaxing and very silent. When i first put my feet in the stream ,i never thought many big fish live here,take some bread with you and try feeding fish and after a moment you will be surprised!"
Peaceful ,Beautiful man made stream and love the rainbow lights. Landscaping along the stream are beautifully done. Must see 
Perfect resting place during mid day,"Its so refreshing and calming, listening to the flowing water.Nice place to take a rest when you get tired walking."
I. LOVE. IT. ,"Have a stroll down the stream with your loved ones, family, alone or a best friend. Super relaxing and the whole vibe is sure to get you in the mood to want to lay your mat and picnic somewhere cosy. If you’re lucky you might spot cute ducks waddling in the stream. Recommended, highly. If you love quiet places to spend quality time with your loved ones or alone."
As expected,"Ever since I watched the Korean drama, this place has always been flagged out as one of the filming site. I am intrigued to see a place right in the city, with stream and rock, you just feel that that is the perfect getaway after a long day of hard work. See it in the daytime and night time, the feel is different."
Romantic place in Seoul for couple!,The first time I have been here with my boyfriend. The place so beautiful and romantic. In here many many couples. I was happy there with my boyfriend. We were also eat something around ( street food) very delicious ☺️️
Original river,Understand that this is the original river which flows through the city. It was slabbed over by the previous city inhabitants and was uncovered in modern times. This is an open river which is set below the road level and can be accessed at various staircases along its length. The water is clean and locals seem to like to sit along the river and enjoy its beauty. There are also some buskers when we were there. Worth visiting. 
Not sure exactly which area to walk by the Stream,"We weren't sure which area exactly to walk by the stream. We were at DDP and decided to check out the Cheonggyecheon Stream. We walked down and crossed over the stone tiles. My kids were particularly happy and crossed over it many times. I was expecting more people to be hanging out by the stream, so I wasn't sure whether we were at the right spot or if there are better areas of the stream to explore. Overall, it was a nice leisurely relaxing walk by the stream and we enjoyed."
A Lovely Stream in the City,"Walked along a short stretch of the stream one evening. Interesting and lovely place, mostly for couples to stroll and spend time together below the city streets. The entire stream is quite long so we just had a short visit on the side nearer to Myeongdong."
Nice stroll but sewer smell,The stream is a little green oases in the city which makes it pleasant to stroll along at night but unfortunately it also smells like sewer at certain places.
Nice for a night walk,"I went there at night and it´s very interesting. It has different figures during the stream, some historic, some modern, artistic and so on. It is very long, so you can decide where you end it."
Lovely walk from JW Marriott,It was a good walk along the water from JW till the Gwanghwamun Square to go to the palace. Instead of walking on the streets with the pollution and the walking light stops - prefer walking along the water. The end of the stream near the Gwanghwamun square is the highlight of this place!
Rundown ,"I was here walking along the river years ago. At that time, it was very beautiful. At this time around, in year 2018, it was not well maintained. It does need refurbishment as there is still a potential."
Nice oasis in the city,A nice walkway cutting east to west through the city. Peaceful. A nice walk away from the traffic. A lot of people just strolling and sitting
Nice to take a break. ,"Even if it is surrounded by markets, buildings and roads, it is actually a nice place to take a break from the bustling of the city. "
Not a must visit attraction but good to check out,"I went there on an afternoon before the spring lantern festival started. It is very peaceful, you can take off your shoes and go down to the water, or just stroll, sit down, and relax. And take good photos. There were a bazaar happened as well, but the bazaar started at 6, and I think it was only temporary. Depending on when you visit, check out if festival or bazaar are happening, it'll be worth to visit."
You can skip this,If you at dongdaemun area just stroll the alley. Jangan kan tidak je. Dongdaemun gate - cheongyecheon stream - DDP + Dongdaemun History & Culture Park(LED white rose)All walking distance in same area.
Great little place to escape in the city,"Clearly a popular hangout. It is a beautiful spot, especially right now with the lanterns. Looks amazing all lite up at night. "
Hub of various events,"Every now and then some events are organised here.We went here many times: new year celebration, lantern festival etc."
Very pleasant stroll by the water,It’s great that Seoul was able to clean up this stream. Some fish up to about 2’ swimming as well as some other little ones. Pretty green area below street level thru the city with stepping stones at intervals to cross from one side to the other. We walked from near Jongmyo to the JW Marriott.
popular dating spot for couples and place of rich history,"it is a very serene and beautiful place at night. it is a place of rich history and also a popilar dating spot for couples. It is also very near Insadong so do check it out if you want a to go to a place that is less crowded, yet insta-worthy."
Amazing light show,"Go for a night time walk, do a few kilometres and look at the light show, fountains, art displays and people. Lovely place for a stroll, safe like all of Korea, great innovative art installations which change constantly."
Revisit on way back from Insadong,"The stream is supposed to be very lovely with loads of greenery and flowers in spring. But the weather was rather freaky when I was there in early April and even the locals I chatted with said it was too cold at -1 and 0 on some days. The stream was a good way to get back to Myeongdong with the help of google maps. However l, there wasn’t much to See when I was there. "
Stroll the romantic historic stream,"One way to get here is Subway line 5 - Exit 5 Gwanghwamun Station. Alternatively, if you have time, get off at City Hall Line 1 exit 1 and if you head down towards Sejong-daero you'll pass Deoksugung Doldam-gil (arguably, voted the best street in Seoul), and Deoksugung Palace. On the right, before you get to Gwanghwamun Square, is Cheonggye Plaza and the famous stream, landmarked by what looks like a purple, spiral Xmas tree. I went at dusk, and it was very pretty with the lights. Buskers (very good) were singing, and food stalls, which smelled delicious, were opening. There was also trinket stalls (different from the usual tourist stuff) - it was bustling with locals (couples on a romantic walk) so the atmosphere was lovely. A very nice way to spend an early evening. If you continue on to Gwanghwamun Square you'll see Gyeongbokgung Palaces main gates."
Nice view ,"It's close to Fraser place central Seoul about 15 to 20 minutes walk basically it's a stream and on the sides you can walk or sit to chat or eat, I read that at night there are activities, but unfortunately I didn't have the time to check it at night"
Nice walk,"Nice area to walk through. We went at sunset in the beginning of spring and it was pretty chilly when we went so we didn't stay for long.There are murals on the walls with plaques about the history of the area. There are also stepping stones across the stream, which is quite nice."
Interesting how they have beautified this stream,"Little fountains. waterfalls, lots of places to sit but it's all concrete. If you are walking by the area, you would enjoy it for 10 minutes"
A nice and romantic place!,"As can be seen in some K-dramas, this stream is famous for couples to sit around with some food and drinks in hand.If you are lucky, there will be lots of street food van selling along the road sides. I’m not sure the frequency of the food stalls open and I guess it might be on Fridays and Saturdays night only."
Crystal Clear,"Had to visit this stream in our tour, but before that you will pass Kyobo, which I think the biggest bookstore I've seen in my entire existence yet. And after there you'd see this stream which is a very nice place, but yeah nothing much to do here."
"It's like a very unique walking path, but nothing earth shattering.","It was a very nice park, a good backdrop to the surrounding urban area, very clean and filled with people. It's a good place to take a walk or sit and people watch but not really much else. Restaurants and shops line the edges so that helps too if you want to take a nice walk after dinner, but that's about it. Stop by if you're close or have the time in your itinerary."
Over hyped,"When reaching Seoul, we've been told this place is a must seen. All i can say, its a nice place, but over hyped. Recommend going there but without a lot of expectations. "
Tranquil Canal,"This canal has undergone refurbishing and beautifying works from what it once was to a place where people gather for a stroll and to just unwind. It's very clean and there is no foul smell. During festival seasons, this place will be decorated accordingly and will be much more impressive than on normal days."
Just a canal,"Maybe there isn't any festival going on, thus nothing special or no special lighting or whatsoever when I visited. Just a another canal that allows people to walk beside it and enjoy the serenity within a busy centralized city."
Nice place for a stroll,"If you want to walk through the city, without having to cross roads and deal with traffic then this is a perfect place to walk along.The stream and plants make it very pretty. It’s quiet in the morning but it’s a popular place for city workers to spend lunchtime, so gets much busier later in the day."
Just a stream.,"I was in Seoul in February (a side trip while visiting the Olympics). I walked by this stream a few times, but it did not appear to be anything special. Maybe it would be worth it if you needed to waste time and there was some sort of event happening (e.g. lantern festival), or maybe it would be nicer in warmer weather. But I would say it's not necessary for your trip to Seoul."
Not much to do in the morning,The place was a bit boring when I went there at around 10am... Just the stream... Altho there were only a few people if you want to take good photos of the stream. It would be good to come here if there is any festival or if there are lights at night. 
Amazing Canal,A small canal about 10 km in the center of Seoul. The canal has been rotten in the past. Now it is the public park and it has waterfalls in the big city center between many tall buildings. It make us relax.
Oasis in A City,Beautifully done & environmentally friendly way of showcasing the stream that runs though Seoul CBD. Incorporated into everyday life an option for locals & tourists alike to take a break from the hustle & bustle to watch & listen to the sound of flowing water. 
An unexpected quiet spot in the city,"When you have done a whole day of walking in the Dongdaemun area, this spot is idyllic for rest and people-watching. As with most of Seoul, this park is well-kept. There is ample room for people to sit and enjoy the scenery. We went here in different parts of the day and observed that it never gets too crowded. "
refreshing stroll,"despite going at night and not being able to see the fish, my 3YO still loved it - especially crossing the stream using the stepping stones. loved the stony paths, trees and pockets of flowers along the stream which made me feel like walking in the country side. wonderful place for picnics."
Nice view,We have reached the place by chanceAnd enjoyed itIt is a river like place were u can enjoy the momentThe only disadvantage is that you can not get down with a stroller you have to carry it along with your toddler/ baby
A river of life!,"So relaxing walk along the stream. Enjoy the scene of Clear water, bird flying, fish swimming in the stream. "
Beautiful stream.,Beautiful small stream in Downtown. The stream will more beautiful then usual one special event such as Christmas.
Nice after dinner walk,We started our walk from gwanghwamun.... It was a very nice stroll and relaxing. In between the walk you can choose to exit to street level attractions or night market or bars..... Really a nice walk and place to be after a heavy Korean dinner
Fresh atmosphere in the city,"After many activities of shopping and eating in Seoul, this river offers freshness and tranquility. You can just take a walk or run (if you want) along the river. It is FREE and refreshing! There is also a coin spot for you to make a wish in this river. Such a lovely place "
Nice scenic walk,"A nice way to move through the city, quiet and pretty. There are a few places you can scan with your phone and get translated information on the plaques/exhibits. "
Nothing special ,Imagined this place would be somewhat more special. Just a rather boring canal/stream. Decent if you want to go for a walk before heading to insadong 
A relax place to just rest n do nothing,"If u plan to shop in dongdeamum , i suggest u leave a few time to stay here, this re-new stream is a nice place to stay as a little break during ur shopping day . U can sit beside the stream n drink some coffee eat some donut or korean snacksn enjoy the sunlight in spring. U will love it."
Quiet place to jog or stroll off the main street.,Great place to stroll and jog in the morning. You will see many older couples or groups walking along this stream. It becomes quite dark once the evening sets in. This reclaimed stream is long with many access points to the surface streets via stairs and cuts across a few neighborhoods. Certain areas of the streams sometimes have stages set up for concerts/performances. A lantern festival is held here every year towards mid-November. 
Casual walk,"We decided to take a walk down to the Cheonggyecheon Stream whilst in Seoul, there was a festival of light on at the time with many different themes. Was very nice and also makes a nice walk especially after a dinner !!Its quite amazing not so long ago this was a very polluted stream, now all cleaned up and tourist attraction. Word of caution, if your there during winter and you walk the stream walk, make sure you have warm clothing on as it gets very cold next to the water. "
Pretty cool,"Walked along side this stream and enjoyed the walk. Also many restaurants and shops near by. towards the one end you will also find a food market, cloth market etc..."
Crazily Beautiful ,"Even though there aren't many attractions nearby, only fast food restaurants and the street with the statues of the most important people in Korean history (king Yi Do and general Yi Sun Shin), I highly recommend you to go see it. I was there at noon and I wasn't disappointed even though it wasn't night time when the lights are turned on and it's probably even more breathtaking. I will surely come back here if I'll be back in Seoul. P.s: it's a common place for dates in SK so I think it says a lot about this place greatness and popularity ;) "
Very cool,This is a very cool waterway that runs along the city with a pedestrian path and great photo opportunities. Was lucky enough to make it out on my last morning in Seoul to go for a run and came along this stream which was great and also had a few benches along the way.
Very Good Usage of Stream,The City of Seoul did a exceptional work to beautify this stream. It utilizes the stream as relax area for the busy city dweller. The decoration changes often. My visit was during X'mas time. There are plenty of special features along the stream. One should visit this place all the time........To relax and to see what new features they added.
Spring Day,It's a great place to go when it's not too hot outside. A mall & plenty of places to eat are nearby.
"Lovely, relaxing, beautiful","We really enjoyed the lovely river walk. It was winter, so probably not as pretty as it must be in the summer, but the sound of running water was very relaxing. Great lit up at night, and loved the mural of the royal processional with the music and sound of the horses."
December night,"We had been there in December, was decorated by a lot of light. We passed by during day time and it is not beautiful as night time."
"Nice, Peaceful Urban Park","The stream forms the centerpiece of the urban park, with pathways and plants all along the stream. The stream stretches from Gwanghwamun all the way to Yongdap area. We passed by the stream few times throughout our trip. There was one evening where we took a stroll along the stream from the starting point, Gwanghwamun. That cold winter walk was peaceful. We felt safe to walk along the stream even though not many people were there at that time. We walked all the way to Gwangjang Market to have some local snacks before continuing our walk to Dongdaemun Shopping area.It was impressive to see how the Koreans managed to rehabilitated the stream. A stream that was once being buried under the Koreans very own process of Industrialisation. It was the success of that same Industrialisation that help the stream resurfaced to see the light of day. Koreans Industrialisation success brought them to have better standard of living, thus rehabilitating more nature to be part of its urban landscape.Recommend to visit to enjoy a great urban green space."
Not Just a Stream,"one of the successful changes made by seoul government, turning the river that was dirty became one of the tourist spots that attract many tourists and locals to just relax and walk. in certain months there are festivals held around this place."
"Nice place to wander, especially during the Lantern Festival","We were lucky to visit when the Lantern Festival was on. My impression of what the Lanterns would be was a little off track, but it was really interesting and a pleasant and safe place to explore. It seems like they use it a lot showcase things such as the lantern festival, new year, art works etc."
Good for a thoughtful or romantic stroll,"Seoul is a multi-faceted city with aspects of historical relic, modern technology, and maintained nature (huge mountain as a neighbor). This stream offers a nice space for a casual walk/jog alone with occasional commissioned artwork or even installations in the water for a lantern festival (November). It is also makes for a good after dinner romantic stroll if you're into that kind of thing. "
New year,I have visited this place with my family in new year and it was amazing...all decorated with lights it's better to visited at night ...u can get great pictures. It's a nice walk that gets you to other neighberhood always crowded and alive where you can also get great street food and local goods.
Impressive.,"An unusual and invigorating walk along a beautifully planned and well executed stream through the heart of the old city, especially in February (11 degrees below zero!)."
Must visit place in Seoul,Learn the history about the stream and you will be amaze. Clear water with birds and fishes all over the stream. Take a walk closer to the water and you will notice arts on the wall belong the stream.
Nice place for couples!,Its better to go there at night. The river is beautiful with some of light decoration. Many people visited here especially couples. Many foodstans too.
good view,"I stayed at Venue G Hotel. my hotel located just next to it. In the morning, i always enjoy the view of cheonggyecheon stream. The water is very clear and clean."
Quiet in the winter,"This place is quite quiet during winter. Everything brown and lifeless. However, it's more worth to visit here other seasons. "
Lantern festival ,"Was fortunate to visit during the lantern festival that promoted the 2018 winter Olympic games. Fantastic experience, especially since I had assistance from really friendly locals to help put my lantern together to send it downstream "
Average,"We found the place just average. There are some benches next to the stream and pretty much that's it.We went at night and the streets were well lit with nice Christmas decorations. If short of time, just skip this place."
Great Walk,"This is a great stroll on a good weather day. Good for family, solo, or couple activities. Expect it to be crowded on a sunny day."
Must visit in night and daytime ,"This stream is a must visit place when you are in Seoul. It has a great view, not only at night but also at daytime. You can see the rainbow light under the bridge and the waterfall. "
special place,"this place some time have some special decoration, such as xmas and count down or other Korean special festival. this is the place easy to find and can take more nice photo. This place close to the main street."
Revived Stream,"This stream used to be dead but because of rehabilitation it has become a place where people can relax and do some recreation. I thought that if more and more cities can adapt this and rehabilitate their green spaces, then we'd have a better, cleaner space to live in."
Timing plays an important role,"Read some reviews about this place and this is my comment: Timing.We were there at night during the Christmas week and there were some human traffic about, but not overly heavy that we were not able to take pictures of the stream and the Christmas deco placed. However, the particular night we were there, it was pretty cold and it was 10ish so we did not complete the entire walk, just after some Santa Claus blow up dolls. For those intending to visit this place, some things to consider:-a) time of the dayb) season - maybe there are more things to see during certain seasonc) potential festivals - eg Christmas, Lantern Festival, New Years, etc"
for a stroll,passed by the stream many times but i only went down to take a walk this time round. many parts were still covered in snow.. (there was heavy snow abt 1-2 days before i reached). nice place for a stroll and taking photos but it can be cold and somewhat slippery depending on the weather. 
Good place to stroll after dinner,"We stay around myeongdong and we walk up to the stream. It is just around 15 mins walks. During the day , it will be more peaceful to take some pictures while night time you can enjoy the light up of the lantern and decoration. "
Super packed on Christmas Eve,"We went on Christmas Eve and it was so crowded! Despite the stream was beautifully lighted up, the crowd was too much to handle and hence we cut short our walk at the stream. If you wished to take some pictures without strangers in it, perhaps should come in the morning or not on a festive eve or day. Nonetheless, it was a fun walk tho short. "
Ok,"Not much to see, but if you are in the area I guess you could stop for a look. We passed the river over a bridge of stones, which was nice."
Nice Walk along the Cheonggyecheon Stream,"We walked a portion of this stream. Since it was during the Christmas holidays, it was decorated with holiday lights and Santa Claus. We went during the day. It was pretty quiet and peaceful. We enjoyed walking along this stream without having to worry about the car traffic."
A small stream located in the middle of Seoul City,This small stream is a very historical place. One of the former presidents renovated this place with nice decoration during his tenure as a mayor of Seoul City. you can have a pleasant walk along a stream.
Disappointing experience ,"I don't know if I visited it in a wrong time - light night - but it was almost empty and dead.I thought that it will be a lively area, but unfortunately, it was not."
The most beautiful place in Seoul,"I've been to Seoul many times and usually went straight to Gangnam ignoring the other side of Seoul (except Myeongdong). But Cheonggyechon is a must-see. The view from the bridges is fascinating and the location is very convenient. You walk along the stream from Myeongdong area to Insadong, enjoying the views all along. "
Cheonggyecheon Stream...The Walk,"We went to visit the place since it was listed under the top 10 places to visit in Seoul. Honestly speaking there was nothing much to see...it was almost winter season so it was very cold to walk along the stream. The walking path was nicely decorated, not many people were there when we visited the place. However, if you are looking for a romantic place to spend time with your loved ones then this place would fit nicely for you....quiet & peaceful walk in the autumn cum winter season. Get ready to cover yourself up ^_^"
Nice for walking,"The river is very long, nice for walking and relaxing. Location is close with the road and can be visitted by many access along the river. The river can be enjoyed by visitor at all season, especially at night time while we can enjoying the light with full color here."
Nice place to visit during X mas,"It is nice and romantic place to visit at night during X mas time. The weather is cold and a nice decoration of lighting. If you are a traveller, dont miss this place."
Another pleasant side track from Dongdaemun,"Located only 5min by foot from DDP, this renovated stream provides a pleasant walk and a break from bustling Dongdaemun whether you're walking up river or down river (east or west). There were several crossing points along the river where one can traverse the rocks that come above the water surface. Clean, clear water with fishes and plants, shouldered by several outdoor art pieces, this place is also good for kids."
Cheonggyecheon Stream Review,"Here is located in a very central place of Seoul. Along the river there is nice walking paths, with interesting decorations always. Running, walking, biking, resting are possible along this stream."
a nice pleasant way to quickly walk a busy city,"A flowing stream below street level that has been developed in recent years. If you're walking east - west (or vice versa) it is a good quick, or just very relaxing way to get around (for example Insadong to Dongsaedum) and avoid the heavy traffic above. Plenty of access points with excellent signage in both Korean and English, indicating locations. Locals jog and walk here, but lots of tourists use it as well. Has been developed quite well!"
Restored stream with walking paths,"Lovely to walk along this stream if you are near Insa-dong. During the day, the path is nice but at night, it's lit. Really pretty for the holidays!"
A river runs through it,"This stream existed a long time ago but had a highway built over during the country's rapid industrialization period after the Korean War. However, it was reopened in 2005 as part of the city's urban renewal. There are walkways on both sides of the stream but I'd advise you it any other time than winter because the walls on both sides act like a wind tunnel, so it was really really cold after just being inside for 10mins."
Hit or miss!!,"Please observe that depending on what time of the year you go here it can be completly desolate. (just a walking path next to the stream in the city) You have to check out Seoul tourist website to see if there is an even going on here or not. Depending on the even it can be amazing or quite meh. The lantern festival is usually great, the kimchi festival did next to nothing for me. Sometimes they have some art installations which were very nice."
Walking path,In a busy city of Seoul there is a walking stream path. While it isn't anything special the stream path was good to get away. There are lanterns that lights up at night time
Excellent redevelopment!,"This is definitely a site to see! No entrance fee, walkable from Myeongdong, 15 mins. It's amazing how the old unused canal has been converted into a nice green eco-rich area. You can stay here as long as you want, sit, read, eat. Beautiful place! "
Much improved ,"A great improvement from the overpass that was here when I was last in Seoul! Well lit at night, was a bit too cold for an evening walk though. "
Decent for night photography ,"Night photographers will enjoy the scene on an evening but not very mind blowing during the day. However, it’s a pleasant walk away from the traffic of Seoul and the hustle and bustle."
Make the side trip,It only takes a little detour from Dangdaemun or Myeongdong to see this. A most pleasant spot. Go down and take a short stroll - a great break in the middle of the huge city
Don’t go out of your way!,"It’s not really all that interesting to be honest. It’s cool that people can walk the stream that flows through the middle of a city, but I would not go out of my way to see it. "
Just a stream,"It just like usual stream.. but you can walk along the stream and see some statue and lantern.. It depends on what special event that was held there.. when i was there, there was lantern festival.."
A cool retreat from the heat,"I was in Seoul in July when the city government was issuing heat alerts and the stream was an amazing place to find a calm escape from the heat. Quiet and calm, you can find a shaded spot, dip your feet in the refreshing water and enjoy some wonderful people watching."
A serene oasis amidst the busy city ....,"This stream sits right in the middle of a busy business district with many tall commercial buildings & busy traffic. It is near Gwangjang market as well.However, because the stream is many feet down from road level, it is quite peaceful & is like a park. It is a long walk though & was pretty hot in the afternoon. The view above from below is quite nice, with all the tall buildings jutting out.Colorful lantern-like characters decorate the different sectors of the stream. It will be much nicer at night when it is lighted up.This is a good place to relax with a nice unhurried stroll."
Peaceful,Peacful place in the middle of the city. On warmer days I would definitely spend my time here eating food from Gwangjang market.
Lantern festival there,"Currently there is a lantern festival at the stream that makes it extremely beautiful. Even without it, it would be a very peaceful stroll but amazing time to go now to see the Winter Olympic decorations!"
A relaxing stroll day or night,"My family were here both day and night time in November since we were praying at KTO prayer room. Clean stream with Koi fishes... my father loved it a lot since he pet fishes back at home.There was Korean Lantern festival at night time during our trip so it was beautiful. Koreans were promoting Pyeongchang Olympics 2018 heavily here. There was also wishing lanterns at the price of KRW 1,000.The stream is strategically locates as it is situated in the middle between Dongdaemun, Myeongdong and King Sejong Statue place so you can either walk around or hop on the city bus."
Nice and clean canal.,สะอวด สวย เดินเล่นได้ แม้ว่าอากาศเย็นก็มีคนมาเดิน ออกกำลังกาย. ไม่อยากคิดเลยว่าจะมีบรรยากาศธรรมชาติที่สวยงาม สะอาด ท่ามกลางแห่งshopมากมายNice and clean canal. Let’s stop by for walk after shopping or conference.
People Spitting Everywhere,"Although this was a great idea by the city of Seoul the area nearest Dongdaemuen market is not an attraction of any sort. The part of the stream that we saw had a lot of litter, people were constantly spitting everywhere, and the bridge we walked over looked like a parking lot for motorbikes. We went because we saw the beautiful ads for the streams so it was a big disappointment -- the city has made such a big effort but has not taken care of it."
Lantern Festival,Make sure to visit during the lantern festival. The place is controlled on where to enter to exit. Tiring journey.
Overrated attraction,"We found the stream easily enough but after following it for the awhile, we still hadn’t encountered the “main attraction”. As a featured sight, it will help tourists if the exact point of the stream worth viewing is indicated. "
relaxing,Go here during the afternoon/sunset. Nice place to just sit down and hang out on a cold windy autumn day. 
Lantern festival along the stream,"We visited the annual November lantern festival along the stream. While it is a nice walk with the autumn breeze in the evening viewing the different lanterns, the long distance we travelled to visit it didn‘t seem worthwhile"
Lovely place to rest,"Walking along the stream is pleasant from the traffic above. Lots of people walk along here too, working adults, children, especially old people sitting and talking by the stream. I went there at night because my visit coincided with the latern festival and the stream was beautifully lit. A relaxing way to spend the time before heading to other parts of the city."
Cheonggecheon Stream,"This stream running centrally in Seoul, is innocuous by day, but in the evening is lit up with a plethora of lanterns and lights, and is most attractive."
nice,we went at night which also happened to coincide with the lantern festival. beautifully lit lanterns along the stream. jam-packed with people and there were people to direct the public to only move in a single direction. nice place...very lively atmostphere
Cheonggyecheon Stream,"Beautiful area for walking. I went here by myself (solo female traveller) and I felt completely safe. I was there just as the sun was setting and it was gorgeous. You can walk for ages! Lots of people walk along here (families, young people, etc)"
Truly an urban oasis.,"A vibrant 15m tall Claes Oldenburg sculpture in the shape of an upside down spiralling pointy mollusk shell marks the entrance to the stream. When you walk down into the stream at the elegantly designed entrance plaza, the urban noise is overcome by sounds of water, the stagnant air becomes refreshed with a breeze rustling the trees and the tall grass along this manmade stream. The further you walk down the stream towards Dongdaemun, you begin to see the fish getting bigger in the water. A crane is perched on one leg like in a 15th c. painting at the National Museum. Every 100 meters or so, you can cross the stream from one side to the other via a series of bridge follies. It is playful down here.The best part of the stream experience is that you can take the steps up and have a culinary experience at the world famous Gwangjang Market that is on every Youtubers visit to Seoul or go see Zaha Hadid's architectural marvel at Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP)."
Relaxing...,Nice stroll along the stream. Something about the sound of water can sometimes be so relaxing. It beats listening to all the hustle and bustle of the city. Worth a visit if you’re around the area. 
Nice walking area in the middle of Seoul,"From Sicheong(City Hall) to Dongdaemun, there's a good trail along Cheonggyecheon Stream. Nothing much to do. Just walking and relaxing. Getting into the water is banned.- Fishes, herons and some other birds.- During Lantern Festival in November, there are nice illuminations, too."
Lantern Festival Best Time to come,We happened to be in Seoul during the autumn lantern festival. The stream is festively decorated with a variety of lighted displays. It made the stream so festive with the full moon backdrop. So worth battling the crowds. 
Very long stream with dim lights ,"As our airbnb was along this stream at Jonggak station, it's almost a daily event for us to walk passed. I would definitely recommend walking along this stream to get to Myeongdong instead of taking the subway. It took us about 10 to 15 mins with a few traffic lights to Myeongdong shopping area. Like most tourists, our initial days were spent taking subways, climbing up and down the stairs just to change train at Seoul station. The stream needs maintenance. Too much wild plants growing on both sides. Lights at both sides were dim and not many street lights available on street level. Can be dangerous for a lady walking alone at night. There were many exits along the whole stretch so do note which exit you are going. "
Nice & Cosy Cheonggyecheon Stream,We love this cosy & nice breezy stream. Can take a lot of nice pictures here. There is also a wishing pond which you can toss a coin and make a wish. Can even sit down to rest and relax to chit chat or enjoy a cup of coffee in your hand. 
Oasis of calm,A contrast to the hustle & bustle of the city. You could be in the countryside. We wondered along here to get to a market. Well worth fitting into your days itinerary 
Nice escape,"This is a man-made stream within the city that also serves as a diversion of rain water during wet season. After a day's walk or work, it is quite relaxing to just sit down and enjoy the flow of the water."
Charming oasis,"A really pleasant escape from hustle and bustle of Seoul. A great walk in a green space with various places to sit, watch live music, play in the stream and generally soak up atmosphere and eat h people of Seoul relax and play"
Serene River,"This place is near from Gyeongbokgung. So If you go to GBG, spare your times to go here. Just take a walk at the path side of the river, see people dating, children playing around, and ahjussi & ahjumma soaked their feet. The water is so clear, you can see fishes there."
Relaxing,Just an absolute bliss to walk alongside the stream right in the middle of busy Seoul.Also a venue for Live Up to Your Name Dr. Heo drama series.
Light sculpture festival,Great place to attend to feel the mixture of modern life and nature. Beatiful view in any time -day or night and during any season.
Beautiful stream in the city,"This is a lovely beauty area in the middle of the city. It was restored over ten years ago – and is an environmentally great spot. There are many bridges that cross this stream. The Narae Bridge and the Gwanggyo Bridge are two of the notable bridges. The first represents a butterfly in flight – and the latter symbolizes the harmony of the past and the future. There are sculptures too.The stream navigates itself past the Seoul Plaza, Insadong Street, and the Changgyeonggung Palace to name a few. Cheonggye Plaza is at the starting point of the stream. It is a happening place and many people gather here for a bit of culture and refreshments. The stream is an ideal place to have a stroll. I would recommend it."
A surprisingly rural spot in the middle of Seoul!,"We visited when there was an art exhibition taking place, very interesting! Just be careful if you are not steady on your feet there are lots of uneven paving areas, but it was a great little bit of countryside!"
Amazing,"If you want a relaxing way of spending your time in Seoul, try strolling along Cheonggyecheon it’s really beautiful and picturesque. "
Great walk,Well worth doing the walk esp at night or during any festivals very creative how it was made would recommend worth the effort 
What a great idea,"Maybe considered an odd choice for an attraction, a stream in the middle of the city, but that's exactly the point - a ribbon of fast flowing water where a decade ago there had been a highway. Stroll for a few meters or walk the full 10 kilometres for some relaxtion away from the hustle of 10 million people. "
Relaxing place within the metro,"Nice place to sit back and relax with your best friend, family, or partner. You can sit anywhere you like, bring in some food and you'll have the best relaxing time of your life. The sound of the stream flowing relaxes you ;)"
Lovely place to stroll,"This is a lovely (and long) stretch of walk by the stream with plenty of points to pause, sit, skip along the stepping stones, admire the art around etc."
Quiet place in Seoul city center,"This place has been modernized some ten years ago and now it is favorite place for locals to have a walk in ther center of this huge city; especially at night when lights in various colours make this place very romantic you will see many young couples as well. We also used it to walk from our hotel to restaurants or shopping streets in the evening, far from noisy traffic."
Neat Area,This area is a good place to walk around and people watch or grab a bite to eat. There are lots of people and shops
A water stream in the heart of the city,Its a good place to take pictures. Easy to find and walking distance from our hostel. Good place for a joggers too
Lovely and unnexpected,"There used to be a raised road and a wide road under and it was all traffic and smoke and pollution. After the demolition and then the reconstruction of an original stream it has become a lovely place to walk, with a clean stream, plants and trees plus seasonal flowers. It's even possible to see a few butterflies. It is however not wheelchair accessible, having stairs down to the stream level from the road."
Fantastic Walk Day & Night,First did the walk along the river during the day. The river has Crystal clear water which is so rare to see in the middle of a city.The waters are full of fish and birds and plenty of greenery along the walk.During the night they have light shows and buskers along the walk. Lots of couples enjoying the Walk and just a stone throw away from night life.
Nice stroll in the middle of the city,"I arrived in the late afternoon and walked the stream fro the plaza all the way to Gwangjang Market. It is a nice place to take a stroll. From google street view, I thought it would be decorated alot more but I think those were only for special times of the year thus only. I stopped by the Plaza area later at night 8pm and it looked cooler lit up."
A peaceful walk in the big city,"A calm from the storm, if you want to walk and get off the normal city streets, this is the place you would like to go. Great for a run or bike ride. It really is a beautiful amenity that can easily be missed in the busyness that surrounds you."
Really nice place for a relaxing walk,"We walked along the river from the western edge over to Gwangjang Market and back again on a nice October afternoon. It's a lovely thing to do. It's a really relaxed place full of families and couples having a lovely chilled time. It's not stunning, but it's a lovely oasis in a hectic city."
Worth walk down the entire stream,"Today was an unusual quiet Sunday as most people have left the city for the October Golden Week holiday. The walk was very enjoyable without shoulder bumping shoulder or endless young children running. The serenity of the stream after Euljiro-3-ga is almost like a fairytale oasis. A lot more greens and wild flowers on both sides of the stream. There are also fish, birds and even stork. "
Hanging by the river,"I love hanging out in this area, it's giving me kind of peaceful feeling. It's surround by office building, and rows of tree. I believe it would be wonderful in the autumn. The water so clean, you can dip your feet into the stream. "
Romantic Place; Watch Where You Are Stepping,"This stream is a rejuvination of Seoul. Years back, an elevated highway buried the stream. It is easy to see how you can while away an hour or two of your time at this place. Watch out though where you are stepping, especially when getting a good shot of the waterfalls where the stream begins. My foot fell into a gap and got my shoe wet. Safety first! "
It was amazing place in the city ,"It was peaceful and cool next to stream it was good to relax , water was very clean and clear until u can see fishy in the water it was amazing place I love , "
Beautiful area,The river is decorated nicely and has many different themed decorations. It is quiet and peaceful and a good place to sit down take a rest and have a sip of coffee.
Nice Stroll,"Very cool usage of urban space. Not much to do there but walk around or stick your feet in the river. But if you have some time between sightseeing, I would recommend getting a bottle of soju, some food, and having a quick picnic by the stream. "
Best for the summer nights,"I like walking around along Cheonggyecheon Stream during the summer nights. I have some friends who work near there so we meet up somewhere in one of nearby restaurants and we take a walk afterwards and catch up with one another. Sometimes, there are some artists who sing there and some exhibitions that worth having a look. Often, couples walk arm in arm and everything seems very romantic. "
Place to Go for a Lovely Walk,"Right in central Seoul, this stream/river meanders and creates a wonderfully peaceful place for a stroll. Read about it and enjoy it. Take your camera with you."
West-east running stream in centre of Seoul,The stream running through Seoul was restored in 2005 after a process that took about two years. It greatly enhances the aesthetic value of Seoul.
Surprising peace in the middle of the city,"Lovely long peaceful walk, clean water with heaps of different fish, stepping stones, flowers. Great place for a jog, or a break from the city bustle."
Beautiful lights at night,Was there during Christmas and the lights along this stream was so beautiful! Nice walk (especially for couples) and for photo-taking. It feels peaceful despite being near traffic. Have not tried going during daytime.
See lanterns at night,The stream is good for visit both daytime and at night. It was a leisure stroll along the stream at daytime especially during weekends as parents like to bring their kids there for fun. There are many coffee shops along both side of the stream for rest after the walk. Evening visit is more interesting as the lantern lights floating on the stream are on. A good photo spot for evening scene.
A Pleasant Free Attraction,"If you're looking for a nice distraction from the bustling Seoul City, this is it. You can take a pleasant stroll below street level watching the stream flow sometimes peacefully and other times strong. Murals, historical plaques and other items line the length.If you're looking for exercise as well, then this also works but wear comfortable shoes. We walked about 5 miles and enjoyed it all. At night lights and additional fountains come on, unfortunately we didn't have chance to be there then. Best of all this is a free and enjoyable attraction."
Very Nice and Clean,"The Cheonggyecheon Stream is a very clean stream that is 11 miles long, it is famous and really known because a long time ago it was VERY polluted and it was SO dirty so they were about to close it but they tried t fix it and now it is SO clear and very clean but it is cold. And it is ok if you want to take of your shoes and put your feet in the water or you can just put your hands in the water. Very nice place"
Beautiful and Interesting ,U can walk above and below along this stream. Lots of little quirks to see along the way. Surrounded by coffee shops and restaurants. Well lit for early evening walks. We were there during the Arts Festival so there was heaps to see and do. Great for children.
Lovely stream in the centre of Seoul,Although we only walked a short distance across 2 blocks it was actually great and lovely journey. There are some similarity between Cheonggyecheon stream and regent canal in London and both are very relax and great experience.
Nice at night ,This lights up at night. Very nice to walk and see the nights and the busy atmosphere. Lots of coffee shops and restaurants nearby. Families walking. Wondeful. 
Nice cool down activity at night especially during lantern festival,This is also one of the spots in Seoul where you can get away from the chaos of the city. After a long day spent on a city tour this is one of the best places to go to chill before you go back to your place. Check the schedule of the lantern festival in November. We were able to catch it and it was really awesome!It can get a little crowded but still a good space to walk around with friends. You can also space out while staring at the stream if you are really tired. You can also chance upon a hot air balloon and a busker.I recommend doing this at night especially during the lantern festival!
Great place for a peaceful walk,"We ended up giving up on transportation and walked back to hotel or to the city alone that stream. So nice and relaxing, even when it's quite crowded it's still enjoyable. Thank you Seoul for cleaning up and opening this stream for people."
A taste of nature in Seoul,"I miss the old shopping area this creek replaced, but this stream is a fun escape from the hectic city surrounding it. "
Riverside walking just in the center,"The river has been covered earlier but reopened. Walkways on both sides of the stream, nice plantation. All just in the middle of Seoul."
Nice place,"Go in the late afternoon to see the difference between night and day. At night, there are lights. The stream is clean and you can even see fishes swimming and birds standing in the stream trying to catch the fishes. Around this area, there are many restaurants. It is a happening place. "
nice change of pace,"Nice little stream to walk next to in the middle of the city. it is long, clean and peaceful. The art on the walls with the explanations is also very nice. Little benches and rocks to stop and sit on. :)"
Fun city park,Kick off your shoes and enjoy being a kid. This is a welcome retreat from Seoul's busy streets. A must do on a visit to Seoul. 
Group Tour,"Perhaps one of the more surprising parts of downtown Seoul, this is a haven from the skyscrapers and traffic. Very popular with locals at lunchtimes and going home, it deserves a visit from anyone seeing Seoul."
Urban creek,Cheonggyecheon Stream is part of a contemporary recreational area in central Seoul. This is one of the best evidence of the modern urban renewal of the South Korean capital. Walking along the shores of this city creek is a relaxing and worthwhile visit.
Relaxing and worth visiting,"Stopped by this area after visiting the Gyongbeuk Palace. You can actually roll up your pants, remove your shoes, and soak up your feet in the cool water of the stream. The place is well lit up, and decorated really nice, and water is very clean. It is amazing that there is such a place in the middle of the city. There are even art exhibits and a light show on some parts"
Beautiful Walk,This is a beautiful walk at daytime or in the evening. It felt very safe. We would sit and listen to the street musicians or watch families.
방문,"From the ancient times, there was an inner stream that crossed the city center of Seoul. The area that was covered with garbage dirt in the surrounding environment was rebuilt from the Han River which was reapplied several years ago. It was restored from the city hall to Ganghwamun It is said that the temperature in the city of Seoul has fallen by 2-3 degrees due to the construction of the new city. In addition, the meeting with the young people has led to the fall of the plaza. As a result, It is now time to say that the ecosystem is alive with the fishes over the years, but it is unfortunate that the natural water is not flowing but the water is drawn up by the artificial pump.,예로부터 서울도심을 가로지르는 내천이있었다 주위환경으로 쓰레기오물로 더러워진 천을 복개공사로 덮여있던곳을 수년전에 다시 복개한곳을 재탄생 한강으로부터 인공펌플르이용하여 시청과광화문사이에서 마장동까지 재단장을 하여 새로탄생한 시내천이다 이공사로하여 서울시내온도가 2-3도 내려갔다고한다 또한 젊은이에 만남에광장 휴식터로 탈바쿰되였다 매년치루는 점등식도 개최하며 서울도심에 명소로도 한번가볼만한곳으로 추천한다 이제는 세월이지나 물고기들도 생태계가 살아나고있다한다 다만 자연물이흐르는게아니라 인공펌프로 물을 끌어올리는것이안타까움이있다"
good for a walk at night,I enjoy walking along the stream. Even better if you go with your love. at the end of the stream is a nice scene to watch and enjoy. 
Best area to eat some korean bbq,This hood is nice. I went for dinner quite a few times around this neighborhood. You can eat really good korean bbq or fried chicken in different spots around here. I would definitely go back to this area. It is also to nice to just go for a walk and buy ice cream.
quiet escape in the heart of the city,"I was surprised by how quiet and peaceful the Cheonggyecheon Stream (청계천) seemed as it is in the heart of Jung District of Seoul. I sat here for an hour, early in the morning, waiting for shops to open. It is a very clean and safe area and a great place to have a lunch outside or go for a walk."
Relaxing,Went here late in the afternoon after walking so much around Seoul. I soaked my feet on the stream and the cold water felt relaxing. 
 Nice escape from the city,The concept behind the stream is very investing... built where a failed bridge was. Path is very smooth with multiple was to access. We took the subway then walked rest of route on foot. You are able to see many bridges and can go down to stream front and even cross on skipping rocks. 
A transformed stream,The Cheonggyecheon Stream is actually 10.8km long and was transformed into an eco park after a restoration project. We walked here from our place of stay near Jogno 3 station after dinner just before it got dark. There were pathways beside the stream and many people were walking or jogging using these paths. The Seoul lantern festival is held here for two weeks in November but we were too early as we stayed in October. Quite a relaxing place for an after dinner walk when it is cool.
a country lane in building forest..,"C ( 17.09.15 ) There was a country lane in building area with small artificial shallow stream. There was good for walking, and had good light facility. There was nothing to special, but good place to had calm mind."
Nice river through the city,"Seoul being one of the most boring places in the world, this river seems very exciting. It goes through the city. You can walk alongside it or drown yourself if Seoul is boring you too much. Recommended if you cannot get drunk at the Charles H."
perfect place in seoul to relax,nature within the city. nice evening walks or early morning run. or just relax and watch people :) many insects when i visited but harmless once
Great area for a walk.nothing else though,"If you are near Dongdaemun, just go for a nice walk. Evenings are good and lightings would be there mostly. Very peaceful area even though it's in middle of the city.But there is nothing else amusing and don't make it as a destination for your Seoul trip."
Its free,"If your in the area you can't miss this little gem, 30mins walking along it fun, and there are heaps of artworks to look. It is fairly close to the centre and you can walk here from the centre."
Great walk,"In the middle of town is this small stream, but about 6 kilometers long.Very relaxing.Many possibilities to sit down and relax."
I threw a coin to pray at this stream.,"This stream is very long. Should go in the evening to experience the sparkling scene. Should throw a coin to pray, it is sacred"
"Worth seeing, but nothing at all special","Nothing much to see here.Good regeneration project but very plain, some small insects due to the stream and plants combination. Gets boring after 5 minutes. "
Nice place for a stroll but not much else to do,"My family (2 adults and 2 kids -6/7) went for a walk in a Sunday afternoon hoping to see some activities for kids but was a little disappointed by how little to do. The only things we did were soaking feet int the water and walking alongside the river/jumping across on the stepping stones... it was superbly designed with ecological considerations and great for city residents to walk around after dinner perhaps, but not for parents looking for a place to spend the kids' energy. If I were a biologist maybe I would have a blast educating my kids on all the diverse plants/animals you see alongside the river... I am considering visiting back during the lantern festival however after seeing other reviews - that might be a unique cultural experience."
Super breezy walk in the autumn,It was a good long walk from one end of the stream to the other end and it was cooling enough to walk the entire way on a September night in Seoul without breaking a sweat!Many people come here for dates and it's a good place to bring your partner for a romantic night out. Many food places around so you won't be left hungry.
Claiming back the space for people,I learned about this place in one of my urban development policy classes in Singapore. And to be here enjoying the waters and how this place was transformed from a road with a flyover to an accessible and ecologically friendly space accessible to people made me appreciate this place even more. 
Nice place,"Hard to believe this stream used to be polluted and bad environment. Look at this place today, it becomes a nice place that people can walk around. Thumbs up for the people who did this. They must have put big effort. "
Definitely Stroll Here on the Weekend,"Probably one of the most endearing parts of Seoul, this former sewer was recovered and turned into a well thought out walking park. We loved the crowds playing in the water on Sunday and the enormous mural of the funeral procession (actual numbers!). The next day, I travelled away from the giant corkscrew on the smaller, more rural side of the creek, which was just as fun. Made it all the way down to the Eastern gate - a lovely walk. "
Great walkway to cross the city,"We found this and used it every day to cross the city and get to sights. What a fantastic project to have a river walkway created right in the city. It's peaceful too, very few people around. Lots of insects though :-) Great for a relaxing walk."
Definitely see this.....,"The stream is below ground level and in a city of 10-million people, is a great place to walk and feel like you're in the countryside.I saw lots of fish in the stream too - most of which were over 18 inches long.You can cross from side to side using the stepping-stones which is also fun."
Calm ,"In Seoul, everything is fast and modernBut this stream brings back calm and less pollution to your bodyYou can run, bike, enjoy a walk, have a dateEverything is so peaceful next to that cute stream, especially on Lantern FestivalI recommend it :)"
Place of calm in the city,"Nice to find a place like this in the middle of an urban jungle! I think that hether or not you will appreciate it depends on the time that you visit. Visit early in the morning if you appreciate the calm and quiet -- there will barely be any people at this time (at most, maybe a handful jogging or exercising in the area). If you would like to see the place full of life, go in the late afternoon to evening (there are also usually bazaars by the stream at this time on weekends)."
Peaceful ,It is a peaceful place. There are many trees though main roads are beside this stream. Good for taking a walk. I ran 10 km along this stream one day. 
serenity,good for a nearby morning stroll and perhaps a nice soak of feet during summer LOL. would be good to check out for exhibition as the plain stream can look plain. LOL
A great place to run!,"This was less than a 1/2 mile from my hotel so I ran on it in the mornings I was there. Quiet, peaceful, no cars and not to many people out early walking."
Nice stroll for an hour or two,"I recommend anyone who like to stroll to visit the stream. There's no need to start from the end, just start somewhere and walk whichever way you want, you'll always end up somewhere close to a subway station.Along the way there's an electronic market that caught my interest, so I got out of the stream path for a quick check. Unless you have a very specific electronic components (not electrical appliances) you're looking for, doesn't waste your time."
Lovely walk by the river,"Went to korea fr the first time and we were lucky to have stayed nearby this river nearer to DDP. This place was walkable and even though its a looonngg stretch .. Make sure to note where you wanna go from the walk as you will be absorb by the walk and forget the correct exit to where you wanna go . I made a mistake by thinking it was a short river to enjoy that when i asked how to get to where im going, i was advice its 2 subway stops away and about a short walk.. Hahaha, Hubby and i are not athletic nor the fit type .. But we were continuously walking and only reach our location about 45-55minutes later .. But the walked there was beautiful with the cooling stream and fishes to distract us from the early summer heat. We particularly love crossing the river on the blocks of rocks thats place strategically to cross the river...However, if your lucky or have thought ahead.. it seems there are always something going on at the river head near dongdaemun on the weekends.. When were there , they had fashion show for the oldy mouldy's and young at heart adults and even a musical talent show. Either way check the place out... =)PS: this is very close to the famous "" Grilled Fish Street in Dongdaemun Market"" . A must visit i must say ...!!=)"
Beautiful,"Beautiful place if you look for some place for either romantic, but calm date or just want to walk alone.Little piece of calmness in fast and never sleeping Seoul~~"
Enjoy the stream then walk a block to great restaurant area!,"We ended a tiring shopping day with a walk along this stream right in the middle of the city. The people coming down to see the water were delighted to take their shoes off and sit on the steps that line the bank, dangling their feet in the cool water. There were couples there with little picnics, a high school tour group, a grandfather with his elementary aged granddaughter, senior citizens on an evening walk, and European tourists that walked by, crossed the stepping stones or put their feet in the water during the hour we were there. As it got darker, lights under the bridge came on and we realized it was all orange . I think the other bridges were different colors. Just north of this (1 block) is a temple and a whole lot of restaurants! Good food too!"
Nice walk through the busy CBD,The stream runs through the middle of the CBD and is a cool place to find refuge on hot days. The locals like it at lunch time. There is a tiled mural that runs a long way along the stream about the history of Korea which is interesting but there is really not much else.
delightful,"whether walking on a crowded Friday night to enjoy street food and friendship or a Sunday morning to have a respite from the world, it is a lovely place and a great walk."
A nice walk to discover Seoul,"This is a beautiful river with different activities through the different parts of the walk. You will pass through different sections of Seoul and lots of benches to sit. In summer, you can soak your feet in the river to cool down. Lots of street activities in the summer time along the river."
Night Life,"We went here at night and it was beautiful yet romantic for newly couple ^-^ So many couple here and with family. My daughter called it ""kampong ayer"" mean water village =P "
A stream within a city,Cheonggyecheon Stream is adorned with wall art with the nature like greens along the stream filled with rocks and small waterfalls that lights up in the night. One will not know the surrounding city and buildings until you look up. Quite an experience. Definitely take a stroll.
"Over 64,000 Visiters Per Day - They can't Be Wrong","The history (as explained by Young on the free walking tour from Seoul City Walking Tours) of the Cheonggyecheon and Seoul makes this walk a 'must do'. The area offers flood protection to the city and the floodgates are varied and unusual. The stream is shallow (1.5' - 2') and there are lots of picnickers, children playing and general fish-watchers. A great reprieve from the hustle and bustle of Seoul. After walking the stream (8K total distance), exploring and eating in the surrounding area, it was great to be able to soak my feet in the stream for a half hour. The water is clean and flows (after being pumped) from the Han River (30 miles away). The bridges and artwork along the walkway is a great example of Seoul history, and the power of restoration.Highly recommended - and definitely do the free tour. They won't even accept money when offered so it really is free. Try to get on the your led by Young. She's a great lady, knows her history and has a real passion for Seoul."
captivating at the time of seoul lantern festival,Come celebrate this stream around Buddhas Birthday in May. It is also especially captivating at the time of Seoul lantern festival. or just for a relaxing evening
A lovely little stream with many shaded spots to hang out and things to see,If you stay in Seoul I strongly recommend being near this stream. A great place to go and gather your thoughts. There are light and music displays at night and the area is teeming with dragonflies which is quite wanderous the first time you wander down there. The wall on the east side of the stream tells the history of a great parade that followed a similar route. A very pretty and interesting walk.
Interesting little stream,"We walked down to the stream and walked along a couple of kilometres of it. It's a very picturesque little stream with many stone crossings and platforms for sitting on and contemplating ! The history behind it is very interesting as well, particularly about the historic bridge and the history behind the stones used in its construction . Little man made oasis in the middle of Seoul! "
Good place to visit,"Went there to go to the KTO (Korean Tourist Office); in addition to, seeing the lantern festival exhibits. I visit this place every year to go to the KTO office o get info on special venues. This year was the first time we walked down along the stream (never knew how to get down there); as a local friend guided us there."
Something different ,walked along the Cheonggyecheon stream. Relaxing and calming. Many people and children sit along the streams. Something different instead of walking along the pavement.
Urban Redevelopment,"Happened by this during my morning stroll. Some areas seem more developed than others, but This area gives witness to the harmony the Koreans have with nature."
Calm walk,"I visited this place mid November when there's a light festival or something like that, where there's all kinds of display along the stream. From cartoon to cosmetic kind of display. Very beautiful to walk alone the stream at night."
upmarket area,"came accross this area by accident looks like its in bussiness area has a more western feel with wonderful pastry shops and cafes etc ,threw in a coin...has nice feel "
"Just follow the stream, it is a photographers paradise.","This stream is one of my favorites in Seoul. I have been there many times and photograph it a lot. If you like to photograph the fish in the stream, the birds, the flowers, the bridges, the combination of a stream and the city, the people, the entertainers and waterfalls you will be happy there.And on both sides of the stream are markets, old and new. I recommend going down the stream to Dongdaemun. There is a building there that is one of a kind and a remarkable design. Take your widest lens with you. And this stream and Dongdaemun is not only for daytime walk, but not less interesting at dusk and night when the lights turn on. How Seoul lights up at dusk is experience I have not had elsewhere. "
Good walk,"It is a good place to have a leisurely stroll or even for exercise. It is great to have a stream in the middle of the city. I enjoyed walking along this stream, almost half the total length."
Serene and lovely stream walk,"What a gem, by night or day a beautiful and serene stream lined walk under ancient bridges. Lots of restaurants nearby, wonderful for after meal stroll or with a cone of ice cream in hand:) Great for couples!"
Love the Cheonggyecheon Stream!,"I absolutely love visiting the Cheonggyecheon Stream! This is a place I could've visited every day during my week in Seoul and still enjoyed it. My first experience visiting the stream was on my second night in the city and this was during the Seoul Performing Arts Festival. We were dead tired when we arrived here, having spent most of the day at the Gyeongbokgung palace premise in the intense sun, but this place uplifted our spirits almost instantly! I never thought that I'd love a crowded place as much as I did, but this place just blew my mind away!"
Take a riverside stroll in the middle of the city,"The walkway was shut following two days of torrential rain. But even from the street above, it was a refreshing natural area with some landscape design and art work to liven up the vistas."
One of my favorite places in Soeul,"It is always a cozy, a convenient place in the center of Seoul city. I like to take a walk by myself, or to go with friends especially in summer! "
Shouldn't come here during summer,"We arrived here using Google maps direction.A lot of bushes at that area.After a walk downstream, found a scenic place.Can see big fishes and turtle.Don't forget to bring fish food to give them."
Nice place for a stroll,"After a visit to Gwangjang Market, we decided to take an evening stroll along the stream. It was a Friday night and quite a few people were out and about. At one point, there was a duo performing on one side of the stream with their audience seated in tiered seating on the other side of the stream."
A must on Seoul list,This is just a walking district with the stream beautiful street made around a simple stream that crosses the city. On both sides there is a sort of embarkment for walking people. In its begging few portals go down from the embankment upper area to walk by the stream. In the night it is nicely lighted with great ambiance around.
Small Stream,This stream cuts through the city but otherwise is pretty unimpressive if you come from a place with lots of natural water.
River walk,"This river in the heart of Seoul affords a pleasant stroll for singles, couples, and families. One suggested itinerary is to start in Insadong and walk south on Samil-daero past Tapgol Park (on the left as you walk south) to the river. At the river, turn westward (to the right), and follow its course towards the deeper heart of the city. You will get a nice perspective of natural beauty blended in with modern cityscape. Follow the river all the way to Sejong-daero at which point you can come up and either turn right towards the Gwanghwamun area or left towards the City Hall area. Feel free to sit on the river's edge and dangle your feet in the flowing stream, hop across it on the large rocks, sit in the shade under a bridge, appreciate the flora, eat a picnic, and snap some lovely photos. "
Lovely Walk,We spent a nice hour an half following the stream. Incredibly clean and well maintained saw some interesting birds and wild life. A very tranquil way to spend and hour or two in a big city
Nice little stream area in middle of the city. ,The Cheonggyecheon Stream used to be covered by roading but was dug up some years ago to reveal the stream. Nice place to have a wander particularly during a hot day. Many people sit with their legs in the water relaxing and cooling down. During the Lantern Festival the stream has many lanterns and displays and looks absolutely stunning. A nice little oasis in the middle of the city. 
Peaceful oasis,It is worth strolling along a little of this stream if you are in the area as it is a peaceful oasis hidden beneath the bustling metropolis of Seoul.
Cool place!!,"After a day's tiring tour of the city, we went here and dipped our tired feet in its cold water even if it was summer already. What a relief!! It was enough to recharge and to scour again its surroundings. I suggest you navigate the entire stretch especially at dusk and you will see how this place is teeming with activities. There's even an exhibit under the bridge and there was this cool sax player who played several songs to the delight of those sitting around with their dates. "
Worth a visit if you have watched Kdrama,Worth a visit just to see where Hello Monster and Lie to me was shot (and other dramas). You can sit down but nothing much to do but just walk and take pic.
It's OK,It is a large palace - lots of building. Enjoyed the walk around the palace grounds - best to follow the guide starting at building 1 and not the crowd. Very little display in the buildings except at the main hall.Interesting floor heating system in all the buildings.
Oasis in the city ,"This place is like an oasis in the city. After you walked all over the places like Changdokkung palace, Kanghwamun square, this place is good to take a seat , take off your shoes and put your feet in the water! The light breeze chased away the heat and we listened to music from the buskers...before we headed out to explore more places in Seoul.."
Very beautiful area in Soul's heart,"A very nice area right in the city center. Had to go twice there to see it at night time as well. At day time many musicians come there and add up to the beauty of this place, at night time it lights up with many colours, there are even some laser shows."
Stroll,"You will appreciate the pretty stream that runs through the city more if you understand the history. If you were living in Seoul before 2005, you would not have been able to see the stream because it was covered over with concrete and asphalt since the late 1960's. Many people and businesses had to be displaced when the stream was opened up. There was much opposition when the massive project was started by the government. Now, it is hard to imagine that this pretty space and the water that flows haven't seen daylight for close to 50 years."
Bit boring. ,Just a nice little river in the middle of the city but nothing to do. It's a pleasant place to go for a walk but will only take about 10 minutes!!
Icon of Seoul ,We stumbled upon Cheonggyecheon stream the first time while walking through Dongdaemun market district. Unfortunately there wasn't much going on at the time in terms of festivities. But it was a great decision to reopen this to the public as it can only be associated to Seoul. Would love to visit during traditional festive period. 
Relaxing place,The stream in middle of city. Very cooling and relaxing place. You could soak your feet inside the stream and could u self off. Well designed and modern stream. I love it here. Place u go with u partner or even solo. Kids will love it here
Beautifully landscaped Stream with big fishes ,"Was there with my family during our visit to Seoul back in June 2017. Cheonggyecheon Stream is apparently a man made stream that run across from Western to Eastern part of Seoul city north of Hanggang River. My initial impression was that since it was man-made, it would not have been nice... but i was wrong... the supposingly man-made natural landscaping blends surprisingly well into the surrounding and somehow manages to strike the right balance to introduce 'some green' back into Seoul city amid those otherwise high density skyscrappers surrounding. I must give the Korean Authority the thumbs-up for the effort. We even saw lots of big fishes swimming in the shallow but beautiful and fast flowing cool stream water!"
Lovely walk!,"Took a walk along the Cheonggyecheon stream after dinner and it was so lovely. It felt a little surreal to see the towering skyscrapers line the banks of the stream. There were different activities along the banks, such as light shows, musical performances and art exhibitions. It also seems like a popular place for dates as we saw many couples seated along the banks! A perfect place to stroll, relax and chill at night! "
Gem of the city,Peace and calm in the center of town. Waterfalls and Herons wading..truly an oasis of calm. If you need ot walk thr
interesting place to visit,Really did not think initially this place is a car park that was changed into an artificial river that divides in the middle of the office and shopping area so as to provide an entertainment
Love Area!,"This was lovely! Our hotel was very near and loved walk by the stream as we walked to the subway. Many people hanging out and one day we even stopped to put or feet in after a long hike in Bukhansan National Park. On Saturday there is a really fun market with lots of yummy food truck. I'm not sure if this is worth a visit if you are staying really far away, but if you are anywhere near it is great."
Tranquility ,"This stream is such an oasis of peace in the middle of a busy city. It has been designed well to allow a walk along both sides with rapids, fountains and waterfall. Night or day it is a beautiful place to enjoy a break. "
Clean water and a place to rest for a while,Anice place to sit and rest.Water very clean and quiet placeA lot of tourist goes there to take pictures
Calming,We liked this place so much that we actually went here twice. It is very calming and looks the best at night
Nice Walk through downtown Seoul,The Cheonggyecheon Steam is a great way to make one's way through part of downtown Seoul. Recommend starting by taking the metro to Jonggak on the blue line and going east along the stream from there to the city wall near DDP. Relatively shady in places.
Watch for closed portions,The stream was a nice oasis from the hustle and bustle of Seoul streets. Though portions being closed made going up and down a bit of a challenge.
visit Cheonggyecheon Stream,"We continue our journey from Gwanghwamun Park with Hanbok outfit.go straight ahead,and then you'll find traffic light,cross the street and ho ahead 100m and turn left.you must take along this street until you find the river in the middle.it called Cheonggyecheon Stream.at night it is awesome with lamps and the atmosphere is excotic one.you can take a pict over there,watch out dont make your outfit is wet..so i take a picts above the stream (from the bridge)There's a place to sit and watch the stream.you can enjoy with coffee,take a pict of the scenes,chat with someone,etc.if you're hungry uou can buy meal at 7Eleveen..not far from the stream."
Lanter festival was beautiful,We were lucky to have been in the area at the right time. They had lanterns all along the river route and it was so beautiful!!!
Unimpressive river with walking pathway.,"Interesting to note about that the river was cleaned and rebuilt as an attraction for Seoulites to enjoy strolling. However, there is really nothing impressive to see while strolling on the river banks. Just take photos from the top and it's enough. "
Beautiful for a walk,"A beautiful stream which is great for walking alongside. The waterfall is best place to start and an awesome location for taking photo's.Art alongside the walls, historic references and stepping stones to cross the stream. Above you can here the traffic of Seoul going about there business and in the evenings the surrounding buildings light up with colour. Some of the bridges have beautiful art underneath them.Take some bug spray if you are planning an evening stroll after a hot day.You have to visit the stream if you are in Seoul."
Love this place,"Love this place, been here in 2014 and again in 2017. Made good memories each time. Really good to just stroll with a friend or sit around and eat food or drink beer. "
Amazing piece of nature restoration in the middle of the city ,"My kids love Cheonggyecheon. The couple of times we have stayed in the Dongdaemun area they have looked forward to feeding the carp found in the stream and watching the cranes that feed there. It is a wonderful respite from the hustle and bustle of Seoul. It is also a great spot for people watching. Near the Dongdaemun main intersection, there is a runway and stage where the city holds cultural events such as concerts or fashion shows. The sunsets can be stunning and make up for great pics."
Evening Strool,"Start at the beginning of the waterfall in the evening.Great fun, beautiful under water lighting, romantic, enjoyable, nice highlight of trip to Seoul."
Great concept and a nice stroll,A stream through the the heart of this metropolis makes a great stroll and the walkways make it very easy and accessible for all. There are a few things to look at along the way. The stretch we strolled did not have much and mainly cut down shrub and grass.Perhaps other parts are better or another time of year?Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.
The city's river of life!,"The Cheonggyecheon Stream represents the city's river of life in more ways than one. This 10km stream not only revitalize the city centre with its innovative design, but provides the perfect relaxation to the people in the city, be it the stressed out office workers, hyperactive school kids, fitness-driven joggers, restless elderly folks or the weary tourists. I would recommend dipping your feet into the clear running water at the Gwanghwamun end of the stream (during the summer!). An almost heavenly feeling!"
Relaxing late afternoon walk,Best way to end your day in Seoul is to take a leisurely walk along the stream. Water is very clear and the sound of it running through the big rocks is very relaxing. Will try to walk to whole stretch next time we visit.
A moment near water,Start at the beginning of this canal. It's in central city near the big palace. It's a nice canal....cold and clean water....you can sit and have your tired feet in the water (summer time)....and just watch ppl and life going by in Seoul while you cool down and have ice coffee....i loved it....and love walking next the water...You should have a walk on this canal....its like a song for the soul. 
Nice place to grab food and just sit there!,"We went at the sunset so we can see the stream at the day but also at night. It's a very nice place to just walk along the stream, and eat there. There was a street food market when we went there which was really cool but unsure if its all the time like that."
Good at night!,This is good to visit at night. It can be very romantic because of the lights and of course the stream flowing. It's also a very long stretch. You can see some murals too.
It's nice to walk along if you have time,Nice river to walk along but that's about it. A place to talk rather than a place to enjoy the river.
Highlight of downtown Seoul,"This stream area runs for miles through downtown Seoul. It is a lovely, green area to stroll, sit, people watch, sketch, chat with a friend. It is also a great place to run as you are below streetlevel and out of reach of car exhaust! Just watch out for gnats and mosquitos in summer!"
Nice walk in Seoul,This was a very enjoyable walk through the city. Used it twice going to and from our hotel. It was very pretty with birds and murals. Signs explaining history in English.
Flies everywhere in summer,Banish your thoughts and hopes for a romantic evening stroll hand in hand with your loved ones! We were there in early June and we were bombarded with swarms of pesky little flies as we walked along the river. We had to take quick snaps and move on to the next photo location. The evening sunset in the background really made the walk romantic however the flies were really a let down. So put on your mossie repellant and make the visit snappy! 
What a Lovely Thing to Do,"I see this happening more and more. Daylighting a stream and opening it up as a break in the sea of asphalt and concrete is both the right thing to do and creates a place for humans to be.Seoul is an experience in concrete and steel and traffic, and it's a delight that the city has given up the street that used to be over this stream and created this oasis.A nice place to walk away from the noise and the cars."
A soothing spot.,Went to this location in a warm afternoon and this place is just off the subway. Take the stairs down to the stream and park yourself close to the water fountain. That starts at random and the mist can be pretty cooling. It's also a nice walk along the stream if you can be there before noon as the afternoon sun can be a bit hard in you.
Lovely respite from city walking ,"After lunch at Migabon, we started to head towards this stream and was in for a pleasant surprise we found it right in the middle of city scrappers. The sound of the water cool you down during hot weather and we even chanced upon a local produce market. Nice walk. "
Nice gathering place.,"A nice little walking canal. On the day we were there, a group of high school students was cleaning the canals. Very clean place."
A nice place to stroll along.,It was nice to visit this place at night. It's actually SEOUL Lantern Festival when we got here. One of the most famous sightseeing spots in Seoul.
Far more pleasurable way to traverse,"Walking along the river is a much nicer way to walk to where you want to be right in the middle of the city. Walking back however we wanted to stay out of the sun. The path on that side was narrow with walkers out during their lunch breaks, in groups, and not easy to walk around/past."
Beautiful stream in the bustling cuty,"This stream is fantastic, do look up on some brief history of the stream because Seoul actually demolished a highway to reveal this gem. We saw all kinds of fish along the stream including catfish! Spend a good amount of time here to truly appreciate the wildlife. The locals will be right there along with you admiring the streams beauty."
Cheonggyecheon Stream,nature set up right in the middle of the city. great place to get away from the hustle and bustle of Seoul without leaving the city. there is always something going on in and around the stream as well. very beautiful at night.
Great place for a morning stroll!,"Take the steps down to the Cheonggyecheon to listen to the relaxing sounds of the stream, sit by its banks, or just people watch. Beautiful hardscape and plants line its banks. Quiet in the morning especially the further away from the City Hall area that you walk. A lot of people sitting on the banks during lunch hour. Some beautiful planters made from recycled 2 liter plastic bottles hanging from the walls alongside added wonderful color to the concrete. Like most of the city well tended and clean. "
Unique nature in the middle of city ,It is quite a unique river having it located within all the high rising buildings. Very relaxing to walk around the river. 
For those who love walks,"We walked the entire stream from the city end until where the museum is. I think the entire stretch will take 2 hour stroll. Walking towards the city was more 'scenic', though not natural, as there were more things to see and better maintained. Walking to the museum we passed Dongdaemun area and see the remains of the highway that once covered the stream. "
Stream of Life,"Seldom in major cities does one find an oasis and respite from the concrete jungle. What seems to be possibly another concrete canal or drain, the authorities have done a good job to green the canal with well placed plants in about almost any form. Be like a child again to skip across the stream on flat stones and get lost in the little twists and turns. Been here before on a hot summer day and the sounds of rushing waters gives relief to the hard sounds of traffic and other concrete jungle sounds. Enjoy the change of pace in a straight path."
Super cool walk,"This walk can be made from and to many place. It is actually a walk on the river edge of Seoul. We did it from dongmyo to dongmaeum in the morning. Not many people, you can do it from one metro station to another or go on until the next. You can cross at anytime there are many rock bridge.To do for a romatic walk or for a run the morning"
relaxing walk near a stream,its hard to describe how relaxing this place is.it's amazing how the government put a peaceful and relaxing place at the heart of seoul and surrounded by offices and skyscrapers.just spent your afternoon here walking around and let the calmness of stream do the rest.wonderful
nature and urban coexistence,"Walked about 4 metro stations worth of distance. The stream is so clean there are fishes here! I didn't notice any garbage disposals available during the walk, but it's great that the population respects the environment and space. Good for all ages, there's families, elderly catching up with one another, friends, working people walking or sitting here enjoying the Sunday afternoon when I was here. Free and certainly a good break from the bustle of Seoul shopping or restaurants."
Chill out after shopping,This is a great example of how transform a city.This canal is situated in the city center and it brings peace and calm in the middle of the frenetic Seoul life.
Very relaxing - slow down and enjoy,"Strolling up and down the Cheonggyecheon Stream and the Cheonggye Plaza is a very relaxing thing to do.The whole area has a very calm, slow and relaxed feeling about it. When you take the few steps down to the stream you feel like you left Seoul. The water flows slowly down, past a lot of art to enjoy.People just sit around and enjoy the calm and quiet atmosphere here. There are a few tourists, but it's mostly locals or national tourists that flock here. Which I think is nice.There's a good numbers of restaurants, especially around the Cheonggye Plaza with the eye-catching Spring Sculpture. A really great thing to do. Seoul is quite walking-friendly. After this you could easily walk to the Palace and then to Insadong (which we did).Wanna know more about me and my trips? Check my profile."
Lovely stream with variety of activities during weekend,It is a nice leisure place to spend an afternoon. Many local residents taking off their shoes immersing their feet into the stream. There are performers busking along the stream adding colors to the place
Cheonggyecheon Stream,Please visit for having a break during a day. You will never be disappointed. Family friendly place.. You can sit down and put feet in. 
Nice on a hot day,Beautiful stream in the middle of Seoul. Nice to stroll around and seeing people enjoying themselves. There are some stalls that sell food and stuff and it's just refreshing on a hot day in the city. 
Tranquil Place for a Walk,"Nice place for a short walk. If you tire, get off and the Korean tourism agency is in of the buildings along the stream. Inside there are many activities to occupy a tourist, take pictures in hanbok (book via internet first), take pictures with Hallyu stars . medical tourism and food exhibits."
Peaceful walk !!!,It's a nice water stream with flower arrangements on both sides . Honestly I expected a bit more activity and fun around the steam but it was relatively quiet. One can take a nice long stroll along the stream which is nice and calm . 
Nice place to rest during the busy day,We've stopped here to sit and relax in the middle of hot and busy day. It is also very nice walking area for people. 
Lovely oasis of peace and quiet in the middle of a busy city,"This was the main stream /river which ran through old Seoul or Hanyang as it was called. it s a lovely park to relax in if you want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city. Progress came along and the stream was overlaid with a major road and a highway on top of the road as well. Due to one former President's foresight the highway and road was taken away amidst much political wrangling and the stream restored. Its is a nice and pleasant walk if you have a few hours to spare . walk from Gwanghwamun square , the start point to Dongdaemum Design plaza. when you pass an ancient bridge be aware of its poignant history. Its made of blocks of hard and large granite. These pieces came the second wife's cemetery of King Taejo. When king Taejo died , the normal succession was the first wife's sons to take over . but it was overruled and the second wife's son became king. But he died young and so the first wife son took over. His first act was to banish all Royal tombs from being in the city and thus had his stepmother's remains moved out and her tomb used for a commoner's bridge. It was to humiliate the stepmother and to quench some of his bitterness. The stream is beautifully decorated during major festivals like Buddha's birthday in May. there is also a night market which runs on Friday and saturday during the summer months by the stream ( nearer the start point- from Unjeonguk ro to Samil Daero) There s a lot of upmarket street food and gift stalls to entertain you. "
Take a walk here and feel the calming sound of the stream,"The sound of the stream has a calming effect, so it is nice if you want to spend time alone or with your special someone. I observed some students were quietly studying. Other people are enjoying their food and drinks. But, the stairs are somewhat disturbing especially if you have a knee problem."
Great place for a morning run in Seoul!,"Below the street, you lose much of the street noise and find yourself in a peaceful oasis with the stream running through and plants or murals along the walls. It's incredibly well maintained. I went back at night and it's well lit and very safe. At all times of day there are many people walking along the paths. I wish I lived near a place like this."
Excellent place for a stroll,"A wonderful testament to urban revitalization. Nature in the middle of the city. It seems as if nature is thriving in the stream. There were huge carp as well as little fish in the river. Also saw some herons fishing, as well as ducks. I am sure that is in large part by people throwing food in the water, but overall a nice relaxing place to walk (when the crowds are minimal)."
A long stream and a distance from the station ,"It was a long stream and would be nice for photo ops during daytime. During spring, the walls are decorated with different flowers that makes this attraction appealing."
escape you from city for a while,"I went there accidentially, it's easy to find, left the Admiral Yi Sun Shin behind and walk down to street then turn left at the second street. Its locates between line1(dark blue) and line2(green) You can go to Gwangjang Traditional Market where its likes a center of Korean traditional food. You would face to flying insects groups when you visit there so late afternoon!"
Nice hidden gem,A nice little oasis hidden amoungst the chaos of the city. A good walk to do the whole lot but also worth just going to do partial walks as there is subway stops every few hundred metres
City stream in the heart centre of Seoul,"this is one of the most visit spot in the heart centre of Seoul. near Gwanghwamun palace, Insadong, Myeungdong, so you could easily access on foot of those spots. walking along the stream brings us a fresh and peaceful moment. really enjoy walking here."
Korea is ❤️,"For me this place is special, we stayed here few hours, very scenic, clean, and just a few blocks away from our hostel. Very clean, you can stay here as long as you want, a public place but maintained well."
"It's just a stream, not a magic stream","They had a water parade when we arrived which was nice. However, it made it Super busy and difficult to walk alongside the stream. There's not really a lot to take in and it doesn't really take you anywhere. "
Enjoy a walk,You should not miss a walk along the stream at daytime and after dark. Look at the local people enjoying this atraction at the city center and admire the initiative
Lovely,A lovely stream six kilometers in the middle of yhe city that makes it a most impressive project built by the city for the people of the city. A must. 
Real urbanistic victory,"Real urbanistic victory! It is a real stream located in the downtown of Seoul and full of different nice spots to relax and enjoy the peaceful atmospere in the middle of busy city. Big fishes inside, herons walking in bushes, unbelievable! Surely worth a visit!, strongly recommended"
Peaceful stream in the middle of the city,The stream is located at the Dongdaemun area and many kids play around at the stream. It is a nice place to sit down and take a break after a long day of shopping at Dongdaemun!
A nice change of pace,"Similar to walking the high line in New York or strolling along the Canal side in London, this is a nice change of pace to walking the streets and being swept along with the hustle and bustle. Whilst still in and amongst the city, the greenery and gentle flow of water here give a sense of escape that was welcome on every occasion.We didn't really use it to get anywhere in particular but when the opportunity arose we always stepped down and enjoyed the surroundings."
Peaceful,It's a peaceful place if you just want to take a walk or sit around. Calming effect just by watching the stream flows. 
Wonderful place for a stroll,This is a perfect place to get away from the hustle and bustle of the city even though it is positioned right in the city! Very relaxing and some amazing artwork on some parts of the walls as well. Keep an eye out in the stream for wildlife! I spotted some very large fish and also turtle!
A lovely peaceful area in a busy city,"Our hotel was right near this stream and I enjoyed drinking coffee and looking out at the trees covered in white blossom that lined it at street level. People often stopped and looked from the bridges at the fast-flowing, clear water containing many fish. We also saw an ibis sheltering in the grass at the water's edge. It was a very relaxing and peaceful walk along the edge of the stream below the hustle at street level."
Night or day Stroll in Seoul,"Great spot if you want to walk in a calmer setting in the center of Seoul, some parts aregreen with trees and really beautiful."
Nice recreationak area in city,I was surprised to see recreatiinal.area like this in middle of city. Very nice and relaxing place during day.
Comfortable walk,"I just visited this past week as I wanted to see the famous paper lanterns on the stream in preparation for May 3rd's Buddha's Birthday. The walk by the stream is quite long which is nice; however, wgen I went it was really crowded by the main lantern areas so it was difficult to walk around. However, the mkre distant paets were not so crowded. The only issue I have is that the staircase to go up and down might be difficult for the elderly or those with knee problems such as myself. I was able to avoid the stairs on the way down taking a ramp close to the entrance but had to take stairs on the way out - or I would have to go all the way back to the entrance. I would like to give it 3.8/5."
Magical Highlight,Whilst I visited during the day time the lantern displays were quite stunning. The local atmosphere was quite a buzz. At night would imagine very special. 
Ideal place for a stroll,Excellent planning to create a cool and interesting place to walk. We had just missed Buddha's birthday so as well as coloured lanterns there were lots of other interesting statues and objects created on small islands in the stream.
Great Planning by the City,Amazing how many people gather at The Stream both day and night. Great to see so many families and young people getting together for a picnic or to talk.We walked a couple miles along the sidewalk and it was much cooler that at the street level.The statues at the beginning of The Stream light up at night and are interesting to look at.
Fun place to walk any time and also see various festivals throughout the year,"The stream is a great place to enjoy some exercise and view the city of Seoul from an interesting new angle. The Cheonggyecheon stream runs 7-10 miles through a busy part of the city. It feels very private because it is set down below the roadways. It is a fun place to visit on a nice day to enjoy a bit of nature in the middle of the city sprawl. There are also lots of wall murals, sculptures, and other interesting attractions along the stream at intervals. It is not often crowded, apart from festival days. Also, the stream is easily accessible by bus or subway."
Nice place to walk around ,"Walking area along a stream. Great at night with the lights, etc. Multiple places to get in and out. It's free. "
Great urban space. Enjoyed walking there a lot!,I have spent some quality time there walking along the stream. This is a perfect example of how urban space can be managed in the busy sity
Such a cool place,What was once covered over by a street has been reclaimed as a beautiful park and steam in the heart of Seoul. Well worth the visit if you are in the neighborhood.
Nice walk at night,This stream with its waterfall is within walking distance from Insadong. At night the stream and the waterfall are decorated with colourful lights. There are food stalls and other stalls located along the stream (they close at around 8 pm). One could walk down to the stream and go under the stone bridge. Nice place to spend half an hour or so.
Festival ,When my visit there is deakobbi festival... along the stream there is food truck selling various food from various countries.... other are selling souvenirs and hand craft... we are lucky we can experience such fastive season along the stream... 
Oasis in the city,"We enjoyed a wonderful stroll along the stream during the morning. Was amazed this stream use to be covered by roads. They uncovered it several years ago. Nice to see the fish and birds in the middle of a bustling city. Many local artists have painted murals along the ways. One of the things we noticed throughout South Korea, they add little extras every where, just to bring beauty into their lives. This definitely brings beauty in."
A lovely walk if the weathers good,"We walked it during the day for about an hour and a half. It's very popular with locals taking a break or eating lunch. Plenty of fish to observe in the stream, some good street art and other informative pieces"
A beautiful place for a Romantic Stroll,"Take a romantic stroll hand in hand with your loved one along the banks of the stream and enjoy their company amidst the cool night air, the gentle sounds of a babbling brook, beautiful night lights, interesting wall motifs/decorations and even a spot to make a wish. There is even live entertainment provided by bands or solo performances to set the mood and delight your ears.The beginning of the Cheonggyecheon stream houses a man made waterfall and not to far off from there, lies a spot for visitors to make wishes by tossing a coin in the stream.There is an interesting mosaic of a Historic Royal Procession documenting the visit by the royal king and his entourage. It stretches on for quite a bit and the plaques describe the different members of the entourage displayed.Test your eyes out and try to find the king.If plan to walk all the way to the end, please take note that the stream stretches on for a long distance,. However, there are many places for you to sit and rest along the way.Overall a nice romantic and relaxing place to visit especially recommended for couples."
清溪川,A nice river with fresh air and clear waterA nice pathway to walk from Dongmyo station to walk to Dongdaemunyou can save money and exercise at the same timeYou can breath in fresh air to purify your body and become restful.Suitable for those embrace the nature.
Go at night!,I started at Cheonggye Plaza near the spring sculpture (looks like a christmas tree). You can take Subway Line 5 to Gwanghwamun Station (Exit 5).and continue for 60 meters to the plaza on the left.I went at night (Saturday) and there were lots of food stalls and a market. I had a great time.
Oasis in the city?,We struck out in lunch hour and it was busy but such a calm from the hustle and bustle above. Take a pick nick and find a spot to enjoy. 
Discovered stream is urban planning success,This old stream was buried under roads for decades. It was recently 'daylighted' and is heavily used by people commuting to work or couples coming out at night. A huge win for Seoul.
a long stream indeed!! ,this stream begin near gyeongbokgung palace and i think the best view of this long stream was here at the beginning of the stream. there's a fortune coin holes where people throw their coin to the hole to make wish and luck.when i came here there's a festival going on at the street alongside the stream. many food and merchandise were sold. a good place to take photos and relaxing your feet after strolling around the big palaces
Beauty in the heart of Seoul,"We enjoyed taking a stroll by the stream, it was a beautiful day but not many people out. What a lovely idea to add this where a street used to be. We saw a lot of fish and many birds, flowers were blooming and it was a nice place to relax in the middle of city life."
Beautiful but We Didn't Get To See It at Night,Chanced upon the stream walking from our place in Myeongdong to Samcheongdong-gil road. Its very clean with pathways I could only imagine would be great for jogging at any time of the day.We passed it again coming back to our hotel and decided to stay and walk down as far as our already tired legs could. It was very calming and a nice place to just sit and relax in conversation or be alone.Shame we did not get to see it at night though.
Interesting stop,This is a nice place to at least stop for a few minutes and enjoy. A peaceful place to walk in the Centre of a bustling metropolis. 
A twist of ancient,"It was a river steam in the 20s, where womenfolk washes similar to our Dhoby Ghaut, Singapore.A must visit and great spot for photography. On Fri.there may be carnivals or events with pop singing and entertainments."
Nice,"There was really nothing much to do here, but it's a good place for photoshoot and for soul searching!"
"A Quiet, Nice Evening Stroll","It was nice to visit this place in the evening after sun set, as the weather was cool and the place, comparatively quiet as opposed to the ground level where you hear the sounds of the traffic. A nice way to end the evening, taking an evening stroll after a hearty dinner. I entered the stream from the Dongmyo entrance, a short walk from my hotel. It took just 10 minute walk to the Dongdaemun shopping area. There is ample information in English located at the entrance/exit of each part of the stream. Although there are walking paths on both sides of the stream for parts of the entire distance, I would suggest to take the more brightly lit, paved path of the stream as there seem to be more exit points on that side."
Nice walk next to the stream,Cheonggyecheon is man made stream. You can enjoy a nice walk durning the night and see some colorful lights under the bridge. It's a great place to visit but there isn't much to due there except to walk or watch the water flow down the stream.
A walk along the stream,"We came to this place by subway, green line and stop in sindang station. After that, walk about 250 meter.The stream located between highrise building in the middle of the city.The place is calm, local people used to come here just for relax, meet up with friends or family, have a little sport.There's a small waterfall in the end of the stream. The water that run through the stream is clean and clear.It's so refreshing, sound of the birds and the water accompany us enjoying this place. Some trees stretch in the edge of the stream, made beautiful scenery."
Cheongyecheon,This was a pretty little walk on a spring morning. I only wish we had arrived a few weeks later when the trees and flowers are in bloom. I would also leave time to walk the entire length. A nice option to walking at street level. 
Away from the hustle and bustle.,its a very nice place to go and relax. Sit by the stream and enjoy the calmness. good place for photography and people watching. the stream is 8km long. A great place for family and kids.
Nice place to take a stroll,"It's a nice long stroll that passes by many areas. I stayed in Hotel Nafore which is near jongno3 and often walked back using this stream. It is man made with some interesting lighting features and some parts with lots of plants growing to make it look like nature. I went at the beginning of spring where many plants haven't started blossoming but I can imagine if you went at the peak of spring or autumn, it should be quite beautiful. Walk at night and it is quite romantic. "
Serene & Beautiful,"Great for a tranquil long walk along a waterway in the middle of the city. There are often festivals along this waterway. When I was last here in November, they had a lantern festival here which was awesome."
Nicer in parts,Little stream running through Insadong area. Some parts are paved others just overgrown. Nice for a walk along at night to escape the busy streets around it. 
Tranquil in a bustling city,Done a great job of turning a potential boring waterway in to a tranquil area of a bustling city. Some intersting sculptures and nice lights at night.
Nice place to take a walk. Peaceful and serene,"Love to take a walk here, had a very long walk with wife and both of us enjoy the peaceful water flowing atmosphere, plus the coolness temperature (April). "
Great use of city centre steam,Pleasant to walk through the city on these pathways even in deep winter. Well maintained and interesting walk with regular opps to go go back up to street level. Busy in evenings so it felt safe. Suitable for strollers but toddlers will need closer supervision.
Just what every city needs,"It was amazing that they managed to went through this massive project and built a stream of about 10 km throughout downtown Seoul. Truly refreshing, makes you forget about the hustle and bustle of the city, and it made me envious and hope that my hometown had this kind of fresh surroundings. I went at evening and walked about 2-3 km from near Dongdaemun Plaza while my friends were shopping nearby. It was pretty relaxing, some showcases at night but never really crowded. People seemed very relax and calm around this area. The cleanliness was amazing. I walked alone and felt safe, though I was hoping to find more lights to capture the beautiful spots. Take a slow walk around this area and just enjoy watching the cities go about at night just above your head."
Catch the Lantern Festival in November,"This was a neglected stream that ran through the Jongno-Gu area until it was given a modern makeover in 2005 to make it a pleasant walkway. In November part of the waterway is the showcase of a spectacular lantern festival featuring historical scenes and animals, It attracts big crowds during the evenings so choose to go at dusk or later in the evening to avoid the busiest times."
Not what I was expecting,"From all the reviews and pictures I thought it was going to be like on the reviews. I was glad that it was not far from our hotel, so is about a 10 minutes to 15 minutes walk. It is actually a long river area under the city but only one part of it looks pretty. When we went to see it there was no lights or anything to see at all, I can not denied that it does make a very unique picture, but no decoration where happening during our visit. I guess is because it was still cold."
Great walk near the water in the middle of the city ,The path is great to escape the noise and the cars. You can enjoy a nice walk with some pieces of art and see some birdsYou can go out at every bridges although the numbering is not chronological be careful
Visited during the lantern festival,The area became very lively during that festival. Colourful lanterns were being displayed along the stream . We had an enjoyable walk that evening.
The water body of Dongdaemun.,Well it's a small stream running through Dongdaemun. Not very clean so I quickly abandoned the idea of a stroll along its bank. 
A good walk ,A good walk to walk.. quiet walk with good ambiance. . Recommended for a quiet walk..Overall simple canal.. nothing special. . But its very close to Myongdong so on the way u can have a look at it 
Glowing piece of calm in the middle of crazy Seoul,"Tranquil, beautiful. Gorgeous light architecture. Fun to go just to see the [demurely] romantic Seoul cool kids wandering hand-in-hand late at night. "
A romantic stretch in the middle of Seoul,"Built under the ground level in the heart of Seoul, the Cheonggyecheong Stream is a beautiful man-made 10km pathway running from west to east of Seoul. Took an late night walk here after exploring City Hall, this place is a romantic getaway from the hustle and bustle of the city where couples can sit by the stream, chatting, eating some snacks or take an endless walk till you stop.Coupled with lights and some historic decorations on the wall, it is an interesting experience and something I'll gladly do over and again when I'm back in Seoul.Very accessible with many metro stations along the stretch, so you can alight at any of them and reach this stream very conveniently if you happen to be near it."
Unfortunate unromantic walk,"There are few reasons for my review title: a) Regrettably I wasn't w/ a boyfriend [not on a date]; b) my feet hurt from walking all day; c) it was freezing cold temperature. Otherwise, it would have earned a pretty perfect score. I truly wished I was with a nice guy; enjoying a Spring or Summer night walk along the stream. That would be pleasantly romantic indeed."
Relaxing,"Nice, relaxing, and good for a walk in downtown Seoul (especially during the summer). Would recommend as a free outing or pitstop. "
Oasis in the middle of bustling Seoul,"The stream is a pleasant way to walk from one place to another in Seoul away from traffic and crowd. It offers good photo opportunities throughout its entire stretch. I usually like to go for s troll along the stream after having a meal at Gwangjang market. It can get pretty cold in winter right beside a huge body of water, so bundle up if you need to!"
Pretty and quiet,This is a perfect way to get a quick escape from the noise and crowd in Seoul. Looking at the flowing clear water with the ducks and fishes just relaxed my mind. It is amazing to know that this place was once very dirty.
Idyllic place that is in the centre of Seoul,We took the subway Line 5 to Gwanghwanun Station and steps away from the station is the Cheongye Plaza and the colourful blue & red Spring Sculpture that is the icon of the Cheongyecheon Stream restoration project. Just walking by the stream is so relaxing even though we're there in the afternoon. Not many people were around and we had a wonderful time taking lots of pictures. Just enjoyed the sound of the running water which is very clear. We walked for about half an hour and passing by many bridges.
Calming place,"I was surprised to see this calming stream of water gushing through the step rocks in the middle of the road in Seoul. The sound of gushing water sends shiver to my spine and it felt so relaxing. After a busy shopping day, we dropped by here again just to relax and take pictures."
Lovely walk in the evening to get away from the city buzz,"The stream makes for a lovely stroll in the evening, when it isn't so hot. The area is clean with plenty of spots to sit and people watch and take pictures. While it is situated in the middle of busy streets, that it is ""one storey"" below means you are still able to escape from the city buzz. There are also a few spots where you can hop onto the rocks from one bank to the other."
Nice walk,"Nice place to have a walk (evening is better). It's kind of calming. At the start it's much nicer, with lights and different stone arrangements.. further on it's still ""raw""... And it's longer than you expect."
Best to visit at night,"Was there in the morning. While it had a nice view and serene to walk through, I think it'll be better done at night to see the lights. There is nothing to see otherwise unless you do one of the Seoul walking tours which will provide you with some information along the way. "
Very nice place for an evening walk,"Such an charming place, waking from Dongdaemun to Myeongdong at the stream level was so peaceful, oblivious to the traffic just a street above. Ducks, cranes and fishes... It's like walking in a forest and yet, we were in the middle of town. "
Visited in March,A must do . Breaks the city with a peaceful relaxing stream and brings out smiles on peoples faces ~ excellent case model for other over crowded cities
"Must visit, this place was in dramas!","We went during Christmas, so it was packed! They only let you in from one area and out another. The line was soooo crazy long, but the place was decorated with many hearts and Merry Christmas sign. Fun atmosphere with a concert, street foods, with tons of people! Again, this was during Christmas so if you visit during another time of the year, maybe less people and chaos. "
Incredible!,"A small man-made river in the heart of the city, laced with seats and planters. Go down from flight of stairs from the main street and immediately feels like away from the hustle and bustle of city life! If you like to walk, or enjoy strolling casually, this is the place to go."
Charming stream,"This is a 10.84 km long stream flowing from Gwanghwamun to Dongdamum. It has transformed into a park. Perfect place to stroll down the walking path along the stream and enjoy the night view of the area.Not only a must see place for tourists but also the local people enjoy hanging out by the stream. At night, lots lighting along the stream, beautiful! Also, there is laser light show too."
Charming stroll,This is a nice little ((?) Not really--it's 10.8 k long) retreat in the middle of the city. Really nice to stroll along during a nice day. Clean & safe. 
Beautiful place!,It was winter when I went there but I have enjoyed snow fall there and it was so exciting. Glad to be there!
"BEAUTIFUL place (at night or day), and definitely worth the walk",Chenggyecheon is right by Gwanghamun (the area with King Sejong and the statue) - and so it's definitely worth checking out. I've gone during the day and during the night and both are GREAT times to walk the area. At night they light up the waterfall at the end of the stream and it's absolutely beautiful - such a nice treat in the urban setting of Seoul!
"Beautiful, clean",Came here during early winter and unable to dip my foot onto the river because it's just so cold lol. However it is magnificent how they maintain this stream. It is really clean & beautiful at night.
relaxing laid back stream,try to go at night to experience the lightsvery good place to walk around and you can immediately shop once you go up the streamvery near dongdaemun design plazaand near a dongdaemun train stopnear dongdaemun market
Delightful Treat in Urban Setting,"I visited the stream at night for a lantern festival in November, where the large lanterns (and works of art) were installed over the stream. I did not get to really ""see"" the stream and its features since it was dark, but it was lovely to walk along the stream and hear the rushing water and see the urban setting above the manmade stream banks. There are some spots, especially under the overpasses where the path is very rocky and slick, so visitors should be very careful."
Good stream,Located in middle of seoul near gwanghawmun square. Very clean stream and have historical story about this.
Great time to spend the evening people watching,I like to go and sit there during rush hour and people watch. Not recommended during a hot humid day
Urban renewal,Cheongaecheon Stream used to be highly polluted and buried under a highway but was restored starting about 12 years ago. The river is now a major attraction for locals and visitors alike. Although some of the water in the river is pumped from the main Han river - it also acts as a flood corridor in periods of high rainfall. The biodiversity has significantly increased in central Seoul as a result of the project and there are many cultural activities along the river.
Day-lighting experiment,"This is a very interesting project which got criticized a lot at the time, but is such an enchanted escape from the crowded city, in the middle of it!"
Beautiful place,"A historical place, one can walk along the stream and enjoy the nice breezy atmosphere during autumn."
Went here during Lantern Festival,It was quite a cooling night and the stream was full of visitors. Full of lanterns for us to take picture. There's hot air balloon too. I strongly believe that this is good place for couple to stroll together for bonding purpose. Lovely place and will definitely go again.
Nice stream to move by walk,"Cheongey-cheon is pretty much historical stream located along the middle of downtown Jongroe. The more you know, you can see more. To see the historical changes of this stream, I recommend to plan to visit this place including Cheongye-cheon museum together.If you plan to drop by Ming dong (Myung dong ?) for shoping or restaurant, it will be good to have a chance to walk along the stream...If your hotel is in the downtowm Seoul near this stream and want to take a walk in the morning or evening, absolutely this is good place to have. Also I recommend to seniors as well."
Interesting stream,"Cheonggyecheon stream is not famous for how it look, but it is famous how they made this canal happened. This is a symbol of success in escalating the normal canal into stream park where people hanging out."
The calm among the busy,This is actually a monsoon drain converted into a stream and decorated into a park. The stream is at a lower level thus you will not see the roads at the stream. Nice to go during theme festivals as they will put up lightings. 
Picnic time,"Suggest to come here around 2pm and above...the underbridge picnic was amazing, you may see some children playing with the fountain... it bring the childhood.. here near to pyeongnam mall if im not mistaken..there you get all cloths and some souvenirs at below market place...good place for bargaining."
Not many lights on normal day. More recommended during festive times like Xmas. ,"My bro went there over Xmas and he said there were lots of lights. But our family went during the lunar new year period and there weren't many lights. Only some rainbow lights at the beginning part of the stream. You can also throw coins into one section of the stream (try to aim into the center for good luck) and the coins would be donated to needy children. Quite a good cause, and a fun activity. All of us tried to aim for the center but it's not easy!We took a stroll down the stream (we just had a full dinner and needed a walk!) and there's some artwork along the sides. I think it would be nice to walk around here and play in some shallow parts of the water during summer time. You can also try to cross the stream by the rock placed. But we dare not try since it was a cold winter day and we didn't want to get wet!A fun outdoor activity with kids too. "
Calm within a storm,"A nice place to rest your tired legs after shopping or just sit, chill out and people watch. The art along the walls are also beautiful."
Oasis within the city,"The Cheonggyecheon Stream is a good place to go within the concrete jungle to somewhat get away from the bustle of the city. It is a soothing, relaxing place to take a slow stroll making us realize how beautiful nature is."
MUST SEE IN SEOUL,"This was one of my favorite stops in Seoul because you not only get to have a nice, relaxing walk next to a beautiful stream but also people watch some locals enjoying it as well. It cuts through the bustling city of Seoul in such a beautiful way and if you walk to where the water fountains with lights at night, it's even more beautiful! You can sit on rock along the stream, benches by the fountain, or anywhere really. Dip your feet in too if you'd like! It's very long and right by practically everything! Must must must do!"
Wonderful place,This is a small river in the heart of Seoul. It was fully renovated 15 years ago and it is a special place to walk on the walkway beside the river. The water is extremelly clean and lantern festival takes place there on autumn season. 
I like the part of the stream near Gwanghwamun Square,"I mostly come across Cheonggyecheon the part near Dongdaemun (JW Marriot Hotel), I would prefer the part of the stream near Gwanghwamun Square."
Nice place for summer,If you visit Seoul in summer then i suggest you visit here because the breeze will make you feel cozy and comfortable. 
Relaxing break at unique stream,It is pretty amazing to see that Cheonggyecheon Stream is in the middle of the city.It was crowded at the beginning of the stream but walking further down led to more space. It's a nice place to take a break from a long day of tourist exploring. It's a little artsy with some nice murals along the stream. While there may not be something to do here If you plan on visiting bring a snack and relax along the river as I saw many people do.
a wonderful stream in the heart of the city,"it was snowing as we got to see it and even then you can imagine how lovely it would be on a warm day when you could just sit there and listen to rushing water. It used to be a mostly covered and neglected water way that was uncovered and re-opened in 2005. this offers a lovely walk of about 11km's. The stream, 22 bridges span it, runs into the Hangang river."
Calm Stream in Seoul,"While I wouldn't say this is a ""can't miss"" attraction, it was certainly a nice find. While walking back to our hotel, we realized that we could take a route that provided us access to walk along the Cheonggyecheon Stream. The part we walked (and perhaps the entire thing) was below street level. This enabled us to avoid crosswalks, and the city above us entirely.The stream was very pretty, with art/murals at various intervals along the walls on side of the stream. There are plants, too. Walking was very comfortable. If you were in Seoul for a while, I imagine it would be nice to sit along the river at one of the many landings and just relax.It you see this, cool. If not, don't go out of your way."
Probably one of the best,"To call Cheonggyecheon Stream a stream is like calling Martin Luther King a minister or calling David Bowie a singer, it has such an influence and long lasting effects on the economic, social and environmental terms it should really be one of the world's wonder.Lovely place to restore serenity to the system and have a romantic stroll with your loved ones. Valentines day coming up, bring a bunch of roses!Up there with the Eiffel Tower and Central Park!"
Nature inside a city,"It's amazing how this stream makes me feel peaceful inside a busy city as Seoul. I would just sit there for hours and read my book. The wall decoration is nice culture art.If you wanna get some quiet time, go there."
Romantic place for couples ,It's very relaxing and romantic spot... I just loved it... walking around with a coupe of coffee following the stream of the river can make your day
A nice easy afternoon stroll,You can join the stream at various points along its way. I have walked the first sections (steps 1-7) and it was a pleasant stroll. They have added interesting little changes along its course so it is not just a straight through stream and there are some decorations on the walls. Even under one of the bridges was a photo exhibition.
Relaxing Night,"The best time to go here is at night because that's when all the lights are turned on. Cheoggyecheon is very long that it passes through a lot of famous tourist spot such as dongdaemun, myeongdong, and gwanghwamun. This place is good if you want to walk at night while seeing beautiful lights lit up the stream. You can also discover Korean history there because some of the walls are painted with Korean history. "
Looked at from above,"Got to the eastern part of this stream (going east-west and it's below the ground level) in late evening at about 8 pm but found the stairway locked so I wasn't able to go down; in any case, viewing from above, it did look pretty good with absolutely clean-looking water and a clean walkway along each of the the two sides (or just on one side in some places with trees on the other side) and also some stones placed in the water (to cross the stream from one side to the other at various points) all of which can be seen quite clearly after dark with all the lights on the wall alongside the walkway on each side of the stream as far as the eyes can see (I suppose it's brightly lit up like that for all of its approximately 11 km!).And just on the north side of the Stream at the part where I was is the Great East Gate (Heunginjimun) which is the biggest of all six city gates of Seoul (I got to three of them) and which is also beautifully lit up after dark; and after crossing back the Stream to its south side from the East Gate, I was really delighted to go through Dongdaemun Night Market with mobile kiosks spread out here & there along the sidewalk on one side of the big Jangchungdan-ro street all the way to its intersection with Eulji-ro street where there's the big Lotte Department Store (some other department stores as well in that night market area between the Stream to the north & the big intersection to the south).With proximity to I'm sure a number of metro stations along its ""great length"", the closest station to the part of the Stream near the East Gate (the part that I got to as mentioned above) is Dongdaemun History & Culture Park (on Lines 2, 4 & 5) from which it's just about a 10-minute walk north along Jangchungdan-ro where you'll go through Dongdaemun Night Market in the evening (as mentioned above) on the way to the Stream."
Urban attraction,Although it was very cold and we visited during night time I could see why this was an attraction. An urban stream placed in the middle of the city is quite beautiful in sight.
Very beautiful stream and even more exciting when there's a protest on,"This is a very beautiful place to visit. If you've seen it on TV, it's just like it. A must-go place."
Great stroll along the stream,"It was our second time to visit this stream. A very relaxing view of the clean stream in the middle of the busy city. It is best to stroll at night when there are wonderful lights reflecting on the watermake sure to grab a cup of hot coffee to keep you warm especially when the wind blows in winter. Lots of food stalls, market and shops nearby, 10-15 mins walk to Dongdaemun Design Plaza, City Hall, Bukchon, and other tourist attraction"
Beautiful stream in the middle of the city,Right in the middle of the city you can see this stream. We were there on 23rd January 2017 and it was still winter and there was snow. It was beautiful.
Beautiful and Calm,"Walking distance from Gyeongbokgung Palace, City Hall, Myeongdong and Changdeokgung Palace. Can easily reached by taking the metro and stop at City Hall station, Gwanghamun Station or Anguk Station. Prefer to visit in late evening as the scenery will be more outstanding. You can take a 10minutes walk to Myeongdong later for shopping and great street food."
Pretty!,Visit Cheonggyecheon when it is holiday season! They have pretty lights up so you can get a lot of pretty pictures along the stream. It can get crowded at times but it's not that busy. I've seen a lot of couples walking along the stream and families hanging out here so it's quite safe. Visit if you have spare time!
Great place,"Great to go for a walk in the evening. Go there walk a little, find a nice spot to sit and have a good time talking with your friends or your love. Very relaxing area... Super beautiful."
Nice and Good Decoration for Christmas,"The 2nd time I go this place, this time to me is the best view with Christmas decoration along the river, but cold wind make us can't go further to see the another view, this place are good for take a picture with all decorations."
A trip to the Lantern Festival,"Our family visited in November during the Seoul Lantern Festival. Larger than life paper lanterns glow in the night and reflect off the water, creating elaborate scenes to take in. A highly recommended outing if you happen to be in Seoul during November."
Nice and quiet,"When I went here, there were only a few people around so I was able to enjoy the silence. Really nice place to go and chill. Probably not recommended for winter, but still a nice open-space area to hang out at."
couple bird nest,"this place is surely nice , but if you went at night you will see a lot of couples there . what i did with my friend we went to the grocery store to get some snacks and some drinks and we picnic there . its a good place for it "
Delightful scenic walk.,"This stream was developed as a scenic and pleasant walkway through central Seoul a few years ago. The water is fresh, and since the stream and walkway is lower than the city streets, it removes you from the noise and congestion at street level. One can spend a couple of hours hiking this easy and pleasant walkway along a delightful stream."
Relaxing walk with the view of the mainstream,"A very clean and relaxing view of the mainstream right in the heart of the city. Everyone will enjoy a calm breeze specially during autumn and spring season, perfect for long walk and you will discover many great food stalls and shops along the way."
Near the subway,From the map it might seem like it is quite a walk away from the nearby subway but actually it is less than 10 mins walk from Dongdaemun Design Plaza. The place is quite picturesque and there's many locals as well as tourists enjoying their walks there.
Christmas in Seoul!,"There were lots of Christmas decorations all brightly lit up at night, and a great spot to stroll along."
Very nice revitalized area,Walking on the stream and seeing locals exercising and strolling was one memorable thing I did in Seoul.
Relaxing and clean!,Visited the lantern festival. Beautiful lanterns. Clean and well-maintained stream. A relaxing place in the middle of bustling city.
Centrally located,"We walked into this by accident. We did plan to go but we were just walking though and saw it. Its a nice little stream which you can get away from the street hustle and walk by the stream, which is a bit more peacful."
We missed out on the light up events!,"This stream on an average day is just a stream. Since it doesn't stink, I guess one would enjoy a leisurely stroll along the paved banks."
Serenity in Seoul,"Smack dab in the middle of bustling downtown Seoul is a stream below street grade where people walk, run, relax and just ""be."" It is well landscaped, well maintained and seemed very safe (at least during the day). The weather was not great so the walk was shortened but suspect you can go many miles on one side, and turn around and return on the other. Crossovers are frequent enough to make reversing not a problem. A gem in the city."
Lungs of the Seoul,"One can't underrate the magnificence of this Stream, of how one emboldened Mayor decided to transform a wasteland into such a majestic piece of work. In winter time, particularly during Christmas time, there's LED and lighting presentations, and it does transform the stream into a winter wonderland. In normal time, it's a wonderful place to reflect and to simply watch the world goes by whilst listening to the drones of the waterfall. After many visits to Seoul, this, to date, is still one of my favourite spots in Seoul. It simply is."
Nice place to chill.,It is a nice place to chill and koreans use it to have a break from the busy city. Nice walk along the stream.
Beautiful!,"We would often come here to eat lunch. There was a market near by and we would just eat and walk down the river. It was a busy place, but at the same time it was very peaceful."
Cheonggyecheon Stream,"Its a nice place to walk during the cool day. Can be very cold especially when the wind blows in winter. Walk slowly and you will reach Gwanjang Market from the City Hall station. If you have not been there, then you should make time to walk along the stream."
nice stroll through town,"I came across the stream while walking south from the palaces. I took the stairs down and turned right and just strolled along. when I first went down the stairs there were murals of horses and as you walk along they play the sounds of horses walking. I ended up walking t the end (or the beginning) there were water falls and when you go upstairs you are on a main street and you can look down and see the palace. there are many shopping and eating opportunities here. after a while I walked back down the stairs and went back the way I came from. There are little places that you can cross the stream with bricks... this place is crowded at the beginning with families, tourists... but once you walk along it thins out. I don't knowhow far the trail goes but I walked about 2 hours and never came to the other end. it started getting dark so I headed back. this place is very clean and very safe. A great place to go walking jogging, running... it is very peaceful NOTE that there are several places to enter and exit the stream so make sure you look to see where you entered so you can exit there. at nigh the stream lights up along the stream so it is very safe"
Beautiful stream,"I completely forgot about this area and I stumbled across it as I was heading to an office nearby. This month they have their winter decorations up. My little one and I took many pictures there. I had expected it to be more crowded, but there weren't many people at all. I went there 4 years ago and it was still as beautiful as I remembered. A great tourist spot so be ready with your camera. I wouldn't suggest letting your children run loose because there are no guards to protect from going in the stream. They have a walkway that they built that I don't remember being there before. Usually you can walk on the rocks to cross the stream. The Christmas decorations are so lovely, please go and enjoy. "
Relatively Peaceful Spot; See It If You're Nearby,"I remember the path of the Cheonggyecheon Stream as a raised motorway when I first visited Seoul over 20 years ago. I had heard much about how the stream has been cleaned and transformed, and was finally able to visit. If you're nearby Sejong-dero/City Hall or Dongdaemun, it's easy to stroll to the stream for a picture or two. You can walk the entire distance between these two tourist areas by following the stream. As a bonus, you won't have any traffic lights and you're a bit removed from the car exhaust.While it is picturesque, Cheonggyecheon Stream itself is not that impressive. While the stream is clean it is not natural at all. The water is pumped from somewhere else and the areas along the stream are very manicured. If you are nearby, walk over and stroll for a few blocks. If you make visiting the stream the focus of your day you will be disappointed."
Much Better at Night,"The stream is nice but honestly a bit 'meh' during the day. Just a stretch of water. Granted this is in winter and the trees were mostly dead and no snow to make it more exciting.However, we gave it another crack Boxing Day and stumbled across the Seoul Christmas Festival. Now this was worth seeing. Amazing lights and decorations reflecting on the water gave the place an amazing atmosphere. Combined with music, vendors and couples everywhere, it was excellent."
Stroll while you're at it,"I was walking south from Bukchon, passing through Insa-dong and came across this stream. It was during winter and Christmas decorations were everywhere. It was a good stroll at night towards the end where the man-made waterfall was.If this stream is along the way, it's good to visit and take a stroll. Grab a hot cup of coffee or egg-bun during cold winter, that would be fantastic. However, I don't recommend to come all the way to see the stream though unless you are passing through. I assume it's best to walk at night where the place starts to light up, even though I've not been there during daytime."
Nice place to stroll,Lovely place to stroll and chill on a cool day. Take the time to unwind and soak into the beautiful scenery surrounding this stream. 
Worth a look,"Running through the middle of the city, this stream is worth a look, but not worth going out of the way for. It's nice enough but nothing spectacular. That being said, I'm sure it's a much more worthwhile stop in the summer when it can provide some refreshment from the heat. But it winter it's definitely optional. "
must place to see in Seoul,Great place to walking for relax in the busy city. You'll see street performers and small exhibition under the stream.
Recollections of my 10 year stay in Seoul (2001-2012),"A delightful stop on a hot muggy day in downtown Seoul. This interesting attraction which was as part of a Restoration effort by Seoul City. The once hidden Stream is now resplendent, clean, well lit in the evening times, and accessible by several Subway Stops...a great local for a sultry summer evening...with romance in the air."
Great way to travel the city.. walk and then pop up,We used the stream as a great way to walk the city.. get a local map look for the bridge closest to the attractions you want to visit and then pop up when you come to the bridge.. it is a lovely walk and it cuts straight through the city 
Cheonggyecheon Stream,"An interesting way to present a drained area. Well though out and easy to walk along, free to enter and you can get some good pictures."
Stream within the city ,Pass by the stream on the way to Dongdaemun. Decided to walk down to the stream. One can cut across the stream using the rock placed strategically across the stream. The sound of the rushing water after hitting the stream was awesome especially in a quiet morning. 
Good place to walk at night ,If you feel you want to change your mode just go there after sunset walk for sometime then try to put your feet in the stream and you will not regret it.
nice place to hangout,"Visit the stream, especially at night. To go here, take a subway to Dondaemon station (Line 1 or 4) Exit #8 or #9. There’s also shops selling Grill Fish (Muslim can go here to eat as well) and there are lot of places to shop around this area (Dondaemon)."
Nice place for a stroll in winter! ,Nice place to see lights at night. Photo taking should be done in the afternoon to have a nicer view of the surroundings. It is a nice place for a stroll in winter where there will be no insects! I went to this stream a few months ago also and that was during the end autumn and it was a horrible experience as there was endless amount of flies. I had to walked out of the stream just to avoid all the flies. 
Awesome!,Very pretty and one of the best places to walk in Seoul. The buildings and landscape is really neat to see. 
Peaceful,"Make sure you walk along the stream, it is very peaceful and gets you where you want to go without all the hassle and bustle of the traffic."
Little wishing stream,Cute little stream cutting though middle part of Seoul. Pick it up near city hall and walk to the east. Take some pennies and make a wish! You can walk just above the river on the main street or descend some little steps and walk right next to it. Some nice decorations and features
pleasant walk,nothing much to do except strolling and walking down the stream enjoying the atmosphere. there's a lot of stalls selling street foods for u to enjoy while walking
A fun walk with the family,"I recommend taking a walk here when there are local events. For example, recently my family with young children visited in the evening when there was a festival of night lanterns. It was very pretty and the kids enjoyed all the lights."
Cheonggyecheon Stream,"This stream have nothing special during the period I stayed. The water is clean and it provides a sort of nature flows in the busy CBD area. If you are going, look out for dates that the stream will be decorated, if not not worth going"
Cityscape Reuse and Recycle,"The rebirth of this once almost-dead stream is a source of Korean pride! Not only does it infuse nature in the middle of the city, but city dwellers use it for rest and recreation. "
"Magical, peaceful... and cool","I love being able to walk the stream in the middle of the city. Nature gives me peace so walking along the river gives me clarity and room to breathe. I've been here in the summer and it's pleasant. I've also been here on Christmas Day and while it's packed, the lights are really beautiful and I'd do it again!"
"Pleasant place to relax, particularly during the lantern festival","A little bubbling creek runs through the middle of Seoul, about 3 meters below street level. It's cool and quiet and a great place to relax.In November and early December, the lantern festival brings clever illuminated paper sculptures suspended over the creek. It's busy on weekends, lots of cheerful people, ranging from small children and families to twenty-somethings on dates and elderly people out for a walk."
Hangul Stream,"A stream that is right in the middle of Seoul, a great place to stop by in the evening after work, dip your feet in the cool stream and watch the sun set over the giant buildings."
A summer Visit,"Read about this stream online and decided to see it ourselves as part of our Seoul itinerary during our summer trip in August. The stream was indeed crowded with locals relaxing by the stream, kids playing with water while parents are having a small picnic. Even though it was in the summer, it is still pretty windy walking along this 11km long stream. While walking along this stream, we also discovered Avenue of Youth, near Jonggak Station, a dining area with mostly youthful locals and good food.Overall, a good place to chill and enjoy soaking your feet in the freezing stream water. When in Seoul, follow the koreans. "
Visit in winter,"It was colder out when we visited. Not as pretty as in the photos of summertime, but still a neat walk. Less busy than the street and a different view. You can see small fish in the stream and the kids loved walking across the rocks at multiple locations. Easy enough for a 6 and 9 year old to cross by themselves."
A artistic stream?,I do not see any things spectacular about how the Korean created art in a sewage water stream. I would not visit it if I have nothing else to do.
Rural Beauty in City Centre,This is a wonderful amenity in the centre of Seoul which creattes a leuisurely riverside walk or enrgetic run free of trafic and noise other than a babbling brook
Beautiful Lantern Festival 2016 ,"Wonderful LED lantern along the stream, the vibe was so good and those installations were thematic with history values, rich in aesthetic sense too. "
Lights,When I travel to soul I was lucky because they have to many different lights in Cheonggyecheon street I am not sure but I think the lights are only 2 times a year 
No lights,"I see ao many review about this beautiful place. Full of light it says. But when i visited it, unfortunately just ordinary light. So, please make sure about the time to see the beautiful light"
Nice to visit day and night,It will take awhile to explore the whole stretch of this stream but I think it's nice to try if you have the time. I visited this during winter and the spring season which has a different feel each time I visited. This is near the train station and close to the other tourist attractions at the end of the stream.
OK park,"this was an ok park. but probably not worth it. if you really must, just make a short trip. best place to see it is near jongno 3... other areas have not lighting at night"
Nice at night,Visited during the lantern festival which was amazing since they decorated the place with lanterns. Very nice to walk during evenings. Nice place for photos.
An escape from the hassling of Seoul,"Even in winter, Cheonggyecheon stream is attractive in its own way. I didn't feel like I'm in one of the busies cities in the world. There was a real stork ?? It's unbelievable, at least for me :DThere are also many shopping centers nearby when you want to get back to the modern city.Nice experience to try."
An urban rehabilitation success,"Can't imagine a highway being demolished and a filthy river being cleaned for a nature walking route. I was a bit sceptical and decided to check out the Cheonggyecheon Stream. With the Cheonggyecheon Stream, I was totally converted to believe that the ugly can be turned beautiful if there is a will. The walk was pleasant, the water in the stream was clean, there were fishes in the water and birds in the air. Truly an amazing work."
Enjoy a nice long walk along the stream,"An extremely long stream running through the city, this is the perfect place to unwind after a long day of sightseeing. Order some takeout, sit by this stream and relax!"
Good to get away from the city!,The stream was clean and calm and I found it a joy to walk down deep in my own thoughts. Great for some photo taking as well.
lantern festival ,"it's was during korean lantern festival, held for 3 weeks, ended on 20th Nov 2016. huge lanterns in many designs were floating on the water. the stream is always my favourite spot for visiting; beautiful, clean and well maintained.awesome view during daytime and even spectacular during nighttime.do go for a walk if you are around the area, you won't be regret."
Nice contrast within the city!,"You will find this very nice (and controversial) artificial stream in the middle of downtown Seoul, guarded from chaotic traffic and noise, like an oasis. I visited the stream at night during summer. There were many couples seating on both the banks; some were soaking their feet in it, and some were even having snacks. You will feel totally refreshed by just being there.You can walk as long as you want, amid a spectacle of lights, a waterfall, some vegetation, and the darkness under bridges and overpasses."
A perfect place for a stroll,"This creative place, a combination of nature and architecture, is perfect for a nice stroll. Consider it as a part of your visit to Seoul."
Good for a stroll,"A nice walk after eating at the nearby Gwangjang market. It is a perfect place to work off the calories along the stream. Now do not expect anything raging, it is a slow running stream with fishes and ducks. So quite scenic. Only drawback, there are lots of tourists... We did not come in the evening when the stream is lighted up but it is highly recommended."
"Good, leisurely stroll",Good quiet stroll made even better if you can catch the Seoul Lantern Festival. All of the lanterns were impressive and had plaques describing the meaning behind all of the scenes/sculptures. There were a lot as well. It's a good place to go after checking out the palace. You can get some rest here before moving on.
Lighted Lanterns of Cheonggyecheon Stream,"The lighted lanterns are well worth seeing, but I had the impression that they were going to be spectacular, and I did not find them so. The setting is attractive. There are a lot of large lighted lanterns that are more like parade floats placed in this attractive stream in the middle of the city."
"Walkable river in Seoul, South Korea","Following many employees during their lunch break, we went down the staircase to see this green area inside the city with a small river flowing in the middle of it. There are many plants, a few bridges made of stones sticking out of the water, long murals depicting an historic procession and a small waterfall. We really enjoyed this relaxing walk."
Great couple destination,"Perfect place for a date. Relax enjoy some food, check out this beautiful stream in Seoul. Take the subway to Jongno 5 ga or walk down from the DDP. When I was there they were filming a commercial so that was cool."
Beautiful place to spend your good time in the evening,It's beautiful area in Seoul to spend your time in many good coffee shop. I suggest you guys to go to Jongkak station exit no.5. Then you can walk along the road. When you see the big building on your left hand side. You will see korea tourism organisation next to citibank building (im not sure but around there). You can go inside that buulding to wear free hanbok at 5fl. From the down stair you will meet sungjungki who is popular korean actor. Hope u guys enjoy. 
Cool surprise in the city.,"A nice place to visit and walk along the stream, away from the crowds above. You can even cool your feet in the water if you want too. Really enjoyed it."
Lantern Festival,"Special experience at Korea, lantern festival at this area during my last visit to Korea. Please beware if you are going with kids as the lantern is along the drain. "
Pleasant walk,Easy stroll in the heart of the city. Came here for the lantern festival. The water is clean but some parts smell like a sewer.
Nice stroll in the evening with Seoul Lights Festival,"We passed by this stream multiple times during the day which looks like just another canal. However, at night it was totally transformed due to the Seoul Lights Festival happening in November each year. Most of the lightings features Korea organizations or companies, and historical stories, and a few from other countries."
Beautiful night scenery,"It's nice to walk around in the evening. You can walk to Myungdong to city hall, insadong to Jongro. We highly recommend coming here. It's quite nice to relax and also to take a look at the events and art displays they have there. "
romantic stroll at night,who would have thought the stream at night looked so charming and romantic with dim lighting setting and the sound of the stream flowing...definitely a must go to get away from the busy city.
"an interesting walk, alongside a stream","Quite surprised to know of a Stream named a “tourists spot”… It is actually part of a major part of the massive Seoul urban renewal project. More can be learned of Cheonggyecheon’s history being retold at the newly completed Cheonggyecheon Museum. We came from K-style Hub so only explored a segment of the stream.(covering only 4 of the 22 bridges!!). There are quite many people taking similar stroll, many photo-taking too. We enjoyed the cool weather and the walk, relaxing with plenty of spots to have a nice rest on the river on an October morning. Nothing beyond which, just trees/branches and stream!Agreed with fellow TA that this is not really a must-see more like a chill walkway along the river.. I do not know if visitors actually walked the entire stream of 10km.! But a stretch would be interesting enough... Considering it as a chill out spot in the downtown city. But explore yourselves! And enjoy. Perhaps you may have alternate view."
Walk and relax if you have time,One of the best ideas I saw in a big city such as Seoul. It keeps the nature in the busy city very effective. Worth to see it!
Unique idea,"Without much thoughts, you might be think it's just like usual canal. It's was their Lantern festival. The whole stream was filled with colours & sound of stream until the end. Even had a drawing done. Impressed & definitely satisfied. Free admission. Event changes from time to time. Beside stream there's an area which is similar to Ximending @Taipei or Shibuya @Tokyo. "
An eventful walk,"There are so many things happening along the various sections of the stream.I walked from Station 3 near Bosingak (check the tourist map, there are various stations along the stream) to Pyeonghwa Market. It's a nice, long walk.Keep going up and down, because the sights are sometimes right alongside the stream, like the mural showing the procession of King Jeongjo, or up on the bridges (a tribute to some poet, whose name I don't remember).There's a grey heron living on the stream. He's very friendly, so be careful with your movements. He walked right up to me as I took photos of the mural.It's a sight that's more peaceful during the day, as there are a lot of people chilling there in the evening."
Nicely Restored Stream,"Originally a drainage ditch, it was once covered over but has been opened in recent times and is like an urban canal with walkways on either side and stepping stones across.There are numerous quirky sculptures and other artistic features.Well worth a short walk."
Beautiful stream,This is a must-see in Seoul. We were lucky to be staying relatively close so we went almost every evening. A lovely place to walk and people-watch. On our last night the Lantern festival had just started so we were lucky to see that. Definitely recommended.
Nice spot to chill for locals and tourists,"As a local here, I always enjoy a little stroll at night after having dinner with friends. I would not suggest to visit here as the main purpose, but even if you do, a lot of touristic sights are along the stream. My favorite course would be to start from the main starting point which is by Gwanghwamun and walk your way east strolling until Jongro5ga, where there is a local market called ""Gwangjang sijang(market)"" where you can stop for many delicious street food!"
November Special!,"We went during the Lantern Festival which seems like a very popular time for locals and tourists to visit. The lanterns were absolutely beautiful and it was such a pleasant stroll along the stream. It was a weekday evening and already quite crowded, we had to wait for our turn to take pictures in front of the lanterns. I visited two years ago in the winter during the day, which felt extremely different. It was freezing cold with not much to see at all. But it was still a very serene walk so definitely check it out during the day if you are looking for a quiet walk in the core of the city."
Lantern Festival is Great,Not sure that there is much to see here other than when a festival is on. We were there for the Lantern Festival and it was very colourful with lots of different lantern themes.Very organised in that you are directed to walk in a certain direction only.
Pop by on your way ...,We popped by on our way to Dongdaemun. It is a refreshing spot in the busy city ... but you don't have to make a special trip there.
At last..i found it..!,I went here around evening on weekdays.. not much tourist or activities on february (maybe its winter there). We freely taking some pictures along stream.. also have a wish well there.. throw some coins and make your wish.. ~ gudluck..
Lantern festival nighttime walk,2016 Lantern festival was showing this week so we spent 90 mins walking along the stream enjoying the shows. it;'s a nice walk without the lanterns and very popular with locals who sit and chat along the stream
relaxing leisure walk but not much else,I found this place leaving the dongdaemun design plaza. I only viewed the canal from the upper level and did not walk along the canal. Not much to see and do here
Nice concrete tranquility in the city center,"Apparently, this was underground untiil recent times. Now, it flows in a concrete walled canyon, about one story below street level...so it is nice and quiet when you walk down there. Lovely...for the middle of a huge city."
Not only a peaceful oasis in city center but terrific art,"This reclaimed stream goes through a central part of Seoul. The entire area was very clean, including the water and stream bed, the walks on both sides, and the benches. I found the section starting at Dongdaemun and heading West to be much more appealing than the section heading East from there. I also found the path on the North side much nicer than that on the South side. Many parts of the southern path are uneven and, though the walking is not difficult or dangerous, it just requires more attention. That is important because there is some wonderful art along the path with the best being on the North walls. Although there are lights at night, they were not very bright and there were not many people."
Great walk along Cheonggyecheon,"Did the riverside walk a few times, at day time and in the evening. I was fortunate to see the festival when they place thousands of glowing paper and paint sculptures in de water. "
Peaceful place in the city,"The canal is well designed and serves as city drainage system and also recreation park together. There is less people around in the morning, very peaceful."
space to chill out,little interlude in seoul very typical of korea.Trees and water keep the temperature down to enjoy some time out and nature 
Unbelievably clean,This stream is well maintained. And it's very clean. You can take a stroll along the stream. At night it's lighted up and it's a very beautiful scenery.
Unbelievable,This could be the most impressive civil improvement in the world. Gorgeous art. Natural settings in the heart of an urban area.
rest a while after a long walk,"Cheonggyecheon stream is a rest place in the middle of the city. from Gwanghwamun station, exit 9. you will see the King Sejong statue in front of you, and Admiral Yi Sun Shin statue behind you. walk pass the Admiral statue, until you see the snail-like thing (hehe) in blue and red color. next to it the Cheonggyecheon stream. just take a rest there after a long walk."
Good place to relax,"It's really just a stream. Worth going to once if you're in Korea. If it's hot, you can even dip your feet in."
A cold cold stream ,If there are no events at night . Would advise to go in the morning to see what are the writings on the wall 
great atmoshpere in the middle of the city,"A calm and relaxing atmosphere in the middle of the city.A lot of local couples go here to cool their feet in the water. You can just walk around and enjoy the atmosphere, or you can sit down and do the same, it's always a pleasure!"
What a great improvement for Seoul!,"Truly a respite area for Seoul! Quickly removes one from the hectic pace of city life and the overwhelming amount of shopping that goes on. A peaceful, relaxing, quiet getway running through the city. A brilliant idea whomever conceived it and a very positive attraction for the city."
"Nice stroll, but overhyped","It is a nice stroll from Samil-daero or Myeongdong. But I found that I missed a lot of the above the ground sights if you stroll below. It is better to peer down from the cross bridges, and there were several of these."
Nice place for a walk,Gorgeous place in the middle of scyscrapper area. Great expecially by the night with all those lights.
Stroll in the middle of Seoul and check out the locals,"Nothing better to do? Go for a walk around the stream and check out the art, the locals hanging out and the many things to do on a weekend around the cheonggyecheon stream. Very cool area, and with coffee shops and some of the key touristic areas of Seoul along it."
Nice stream make beautiful and useful. It is so clean,"It is also the shortest way to walk from city hall to Insadong or Dongdenmun.If you have kids, you do not worry of the moving vehicles and waste time waiting to cross at the traffic lights. Kids can run ...wild..that's kids enjoyment and adults to wish for. We can enjoy all the beauty below the bridges, arts, paintings, recycle works...etc. The sound of the water is therapeutics and soothing. I would prefer to walk from city hall to dongdenmun instead of taking the subway a web of underground endless walk. Putting your aching legs to the water is soothing"
Fresh air,"Me and my fiends was sitting at this site at that time. We did put our foot to the water, so fresh and cool. Fresh air also we can feel here. many tourist come to this place and good view to take a photos. Enjoy..."
Tranquility in the City!,"This is a very lovely and peaceful place to enjoy with friends, family or that special someone. During the day many families come here and enjoy putting their feet in the water and hopping around on the many stones in the stream. At night you'll see several couples taking a walk or sitting under a bridge and enjoying the beautiful atmosphere. If you're in Seoul in May you should absolutely check this stream out and enjoy the thousands of lanterns put out for the Lotus Lantern Festival and Buddha's Birthday!"
Tranquil bliss.,It's amazing that a slightly lowered section can be this peaceful in the middle of Seoul. It features art and natural sights and can even be compared to New York's High Line. It's that good!
Relaxing Walk Along the Stream,"The Cheonggyecheon Stream isn't as scenic as the Yeouido Park, N Seoul Tower, but it is a great place to relax and chill, simply just to breathe in the fresh air and take photos."
Nice place for walking ,"We walked with kin pleasure. Kids were running and enjoying. River is very clean and nice. There are several a activities such as panting, creating some traditional masks, etc. The kids (and not only kids) are involved in that activities and it make them happy. I would recommend to everyone. "
Unique,Unique place and very creative! Love how korean people maximize their public place to be a tourist spot. Better visit at night for the light 
Nice site seen ,It a very nice place for relaxing where you can see the well designed river tracking with lightning at night. Also by walking on the Cheonggyecheon you are going to cross the Seoul city from west to East.
Not what I expected,"It's really just a steam in the middle of the city. I wouldn't go out of my way to just go see it. If your shopping in the area of Dondaemun shopping, you'll most likely walk by it on your way back to the subway. Only suggest to walk by it if you are in the area for a little rest break or to take a picture. We only stayed there for a few minutes. "
Relaxing walk in the middle of the city,"Loved this stream as it was located in the middle of the city in between roads and buildings. Seoul has done a great job in preserving its rich culture, heritage and nature amidst rapid globalization. We started off at the beginning of the stream near to City Hall or Gwanghwamun station. Walked all the way to Gwangjang market. A must-see destination."
Unforgettable night walking experience!,"The way Seoul took advantage of their own city spaces is just amazing, and this stream is a must see. You definitively can´t miss it."
Unexpected treat in the middle of the city,I had read about this and we made a point to visit. We were able to walk about a mile along the stream. It was very calming with interesting use of stones as artwork. There was a very cool art installation of umbrellas when we visited.
Early spring night,"It was very cold and stream was empty of ppl. Still nice to go there with wheelchair as there was elevator available and the stream was next to our hotel, Doulos Hotel (btw. best service ever there)."
Lovely,"Beautiful stream of water running in the middle of a busy neighbourhood. Beautiful plants and some artificial waterfalls nicely made. It is a relaxing walk, watching skyscrapers while listening to the stream of water. Whoever made it, this had a Brilliant idea! "
central park of seoul,the stream flows right in the heart of business district and is quite close to all popular attractions like the palace and myongdeong. its quite refreshing and relaxing to sit on the banks and dip your feet like locals.
A relaxing spot in the middle of a busy city.,"I went there at night time. I only saw a short stretch of the stream, but I definitely appreciate the appeal. It's a nice peaceful place to hang out, but all sorts of shops are ready on the sides for you to head to when you're done sightseeing."
Cheap way to relax,I would say this is actually one of the most memorable places we went to in seoul. Ot's such a relaxing place to just stay at when you've been tired all day walking around the city. Many locals seem to like this place too and this is a good place to chill at if you want to interact with the locals. You can dip your feet at the stream. Although I didnt try it.myself cause I was wearing shoes and didnt feel like taking them off I bet it's refreshing. Plus! This place is free no entrance fee or whatever. 
Every city should have a riverwalk like this,"... but then this wouldn't be as special. Amazing below-grade walk along this re-found center-city stream. It's calm, quiet, lots of people walking. Each couple of block the theme changes. Don't miss the huge tiled mural of an old battle."
A peaceful retreat in the middle of Seoul,"One of our highlights in Seoul was the simplicity of the lovely stream. We visited by day and went back on our last night to see the beautiful lights which at the time included a rainbow arch. It was a stroll of only a few hundred metres from near our hotel to the Plaza but it was a lovely and peaceful walk with many photo opportunities. There were a lot of people out enjoying it - couples, groups of friends and visiting tourists. We felt very safe. "
Lovely,"Such a lovely place to hangout. It's very romantic, a lot of couples have their dates there, sometimes there are artists singing and it's simply beautiful especially during the evening. You can have some snacks and drinks or just take a walk along the stream."
Great place to walk by the water in middle of Seoul! ,We took a walk along the Cheonggyecheon stream and it was very serene and soothing. The sound of water flowing in the stream makes it very pleasant to walk along and enjoy some calm time in the middle of Seoul. It's a really good place to walk for couples or families with young children or even if you want to take a quick run. There are shops around the stream but you've to take stairs to access those. I recommend this place if you're visiting Seoul! 
Quiet space in the heart of Seoul,This is a wonderful public space that was once a neglected area and had a freeway over it. It was a major initiative to restore the health of this water and create a wonderful public space; the project started a movement around Korea to restore unhealthy waterways. I was there in the August heat and the shade created by the bridges is a great place to relax and take refuge from the hot sun. It was a bit overgrown and needed some maintenance but it was enjoyable and I felt I was in a unique setting. If you like interesting urban spaces I would recommend incorporating into your trip.
A slice of nature,"I've discovered spots around Seoul all week where one can briefly escape the busyness of the city. This is one of them! Just a few steps below street level, you'll find a greenway of flowing water and random artwork. You obviously still hear some city noise but it's definitely less if you were walking on the sidewalk. I didn't see any benches on the portion I walked, but I did see people sitting on rocks by the water. I definitely recommend this!"
Nice walk up to palace. ,Walking the stream up to the palace was a nice walk. You get a sense of a bit of history of Korea. There is a statue dedicated to an admiral that fought the Japanese and one of the Kings of Korea as well. A very pleasant stroll. 
A beautiful walk during the day or at night!,"A brilliant man made stream in the heart of the older part of Seoul!! This stream has numerous photo-worthy views and places where you can just sit and people watch!! You can cross the stream at several points via bridges or stone walkways so it's a fabulous place to stroll alone, with friends, or with the family! You might miss it if you just hit Seoul's highlights by bus or subway, so get off your butt and walk around and enjoy the view! I recommend arriving at Anguk station...walk down Insadong...hang a right and start near the end of the stream...walk up towards the edge of Gwanghwamun Square...and then head towards Gyeongbokgung Palace (you can also do this walk starting at the palace...just exit the subway at the Gyeongbokgung or Gwanghwamun stop depending on the line you're on)."
Visit at night,It's a long stream located near the DDP so you can plan your trip accordingly. I would say that it's a very nice place to take a stroll at especially at night because that is when the lights are switched on. Many couples hang out here.
Cheonggyecheon Stream,"This is a long stream, good walk way, it is close by Dongdaemum, the stream is very pretty at night when the light are on... take a walk, its nice."
Refreshing and impressive,"It is refreshing, in the middle of all the traffic and high rises to have this stream to walk by.Impressive how the government decided to retrieve a piece of Seoul,s past.I recommend to visit evening and day time but If you do not have much time go in the evening. The lighting is wonderful. "
Very cute,"All things created from Asia is cute and here in Seoul, couple centered. This attraction is no different. This man made river in the middle of Seoul its designed to bring romance and lovers together. Lots of places to sit and enjoy. Especially on a warm summer's night, you will find tons of young college couples sitting and flirting everywhere. Although, this does serve as one of the main thoroughfares for carrying water out of the city for monsoon season. So stay away. The man made river will fill up some 10-15 feet of rushing water when the rains come. The yearly Buddha lantern festival is also held here in May. Come look at the intricate lanterns with the crowd of photographers and their huge cameras trying to capture all the beauty. This can be accessible from many points since it flows through the city center."
Stunning Water Feature Flowing Through the Heart of Seoul,"The open air stream flows below street level through the heart of Seoul and is an ideal refuge from the hub hub and traffic above. Many people sit along the banks, some cooling their feet in the water, and enjoying the peace. It makes for a very pleasant walk from one part of the city to anotherThe stream has several waterfalls, cascades and stepping stone to cross from one side to the other. The area also houses many innovative art installations and is very pretty when illuminated after darkVisitor amenities and information are excellent"
Very nice stroll along the river,"If you like to walk, this would be a perfect thing for you to do in Seoul.We walked from in front Marriott in Dongdaemun toward the end near Gwanghamun Gate. While it was quite far, the walk was nice and relaxing with plenty of spot to have a nice rest on the river.Is it a ""must see""? Well not for the typical tourist who just want to see a flashy attraction, considering this is just a chill walkway along the river. It was more of a nice activity if you're the kind of tourist who like to explore through a nice walk."
Good place to walk,"Start you journey from Gwanghwamun Sta. exit 5 (subway) and find a river down from the street. The river start from the waterfall. It happens to be the source of the water that along for many kilometers onward. This is great when you walk and sit around first 1km, spent the time to stroll along the river but actually you can walk far more than 1km to another area but the view lesser nice walking away from the starting poin.Anyway it was a good place, when the evening comes ... the lights turned on, than you'll have another environment. Good place to photo as well."
"Strange ""attraction"" - not exactly a must see","I set this as one of the places to see unaware of how it operates.Its more like a chill out spot in the city and not exactly an ""attraction"" that you must see.The access to the stream was closed when I got there at night. I went there at night thinking it would look nicer when lit at night. The entire stream is not lit during the night. Only the origin point which is at cheonggyecheon plaza is lit at night. The rest of the stream are basically a stream with a bunch a trees.Its too bad I went there after going to gwangjang market and had to walk about half an hour all the way up the stream to the point it was lit.Do feel free to give this a miss. Not exactly a must see attraction. After a few minutes of photo taking and u wonder what're you doing there.Its in walking distance to Gwanghwamun gate. So feel free to drop by if you're near.Bring your own coffee or chocolate drink from 7E or CU to chill there."
Beautiful at about 4pm,Enjoyed walking along the stream around 4pm and then finishing off with some street food in MyeongDong. Such a lovely peaceful place in the middle of a busy city.
Nice surprise in the middle of Seoul,"A great place for walking, or just sitting and having a chat. Very child/family friendly. Very nicely ""reconstructed""."
pleasant,"nice stroll of a warm evening, see the locals cooling their feet in the very clear waters of the stream walk as far or as short as you like"
Lovely stroll along the stream,This is a must-do in Seoul! Its an easy walk for anybody. I went during the day and I'd like to go again at night when its all lit up. It was quite crowded when I was there with my family but it was still really nice and quiet. You could have a little picnic somewhere along it too!
Glorious walk through town.,"Discovered this gem in one of the guide books.A beautiful walk for miles,you would never believe you were going through a busy city as it is below street level."
Great stream in the center of city,"It starts from cheonggye square on the sejong street. It's a long stream with the walking paths that are both sides of the stream so people is able to sit on the benches and relax or jogging or taking a walk. It reaches many street markets such as kwangjang, Bangsan and pyeonghwa etc. So you can taste the many korean foods!!"
Nice stream in the middle of the city,Its a nice little stream in the middle of the city. Dont plan to walk the entire stream since its pretty long. Do visit it in a combination with insadong and Gwanghwamun Square. A nice trip is Gwanghwamun Square - Gyeongbokgung Palace - Bukchok Hanok village - Changeokgung Palace - Insadong - Cheonggyecheon Stream
Serenity in the City,"This was a great idea to unearth/un concrete this stream and turn it into an urban water park - below the streets. It is lushly landscaped, kid friendly, and in some places, so quiet. A MUST SEE!"
Hang out,"My local friend brought me here. It's a stream running through the city. Only locals come here to hang out, and Thts exactly what we did. The stream is flowing with fishes. You will see many people coming here with their children or couples Jst sitting around having chats. It's a place to chill ."
"Great, free strole with the family","Very relaxing part of the city. The entire family enjoyed the walk along the stream. It was great to cool off our feet in the hot weather.If your into photography, there are many chances to take some great pictures.Or do some people watching.Saw a great mix of people there from families, dates, friends or people out for exercise.All were quiet, respectful of others and generally well behaved."
Take a stroll,"We walked past this stream on many occasions. Lots of people come here to relax - have a stroll, couples spending time here and on a Saturday morning the families would bring a picnic mat and the children would be playing or colouring. In the evening the stream is lit up and looks pretty. "
One of the must sees in Seoul,"A number of staff at the hotel recommended seeing this and until you go and see, it is hard to explain and understand why. It clearly was a fabulous idea to create this and it comes off really well. I went for a really pleasant evening stroll - probably really nice at other times too but it felt quite safe with darkness falling and temperature was a bit cooler. The lighting makes it more interesting too in the evenings and it is easy to understand why it is so popular. Seoul has a lot of history to look at but this is a reminder that they can very creative in a modern ecological way too."
Good place to walk around,Good place to walk around. There is nothing much to do here. If you have spare time you can walk alongside the stream. Otherwise you can do a quick photo stop.
Great walk through Seoul,"If you are ready, you can walk for 10km through this ecological Stream. Nicer during the night but also more crowded."
Wonderful area,"Great place to walk around, especially at night. Very safe. Lots of couples walking around. Spots to sit by the stream. You can cross it at several locations. Nice way to spend an hour or so."
Lampion festival,I visited Korea when there was a lampion festival. We can enjoy the festival alongside the stream. So beautiful.
"very good for walking, relax area","good to walk around at night after shopping, can seat there with some local food and enjoy the quiet moment inside this busy city."
a very unique walk,"my friend and I went this stream on one evening and we thoroughly enjoyed it. the atmosphere is unique:- you are walking on a path in between of a mini forest/greenery/stream and large concrete jungle. if you come here in the evening, there are many nice lighting arts and street artists performing for free. many local couples come dating by the steam as well so you get to embrace the love in the air :)highly recommended p/s: is a stream and not a big drain so no foul smell at all"
Relaxing place,The place is nice for walking. Clean and refreshing. Bring the bird's food if you want to play with the birds :) :) :). Nice for family walk and children.
Dip in your toes,"We stopped by the Cheonggyecheon Stream following a day of touristing all over Seoul. It was lovely to dip our toes in the water and cool off in the heat. The atmosphere was lovely, with lots of families and couples enjoying the water and buskers to listen to. We passed by again after dark and enjoyed the lights. "
Quiet and relaxing walking ,The walking beside the stream is very relaxing. During both morning or night you will be happy to be there. 
"30,000 steps worth",Longest walk I've ever done! It's nice to go here and start your walk on the afternoon until night time. 
Great place for a walk,Such a nice place to walk as its peaceful with the water stream and lovely flowers. We walked along it as we had some spare time and ended up going back a couple times to relax!
Surprisingly boring,"It's a stream below road level in the middle of a busy downtown area. Its like Paris gone wrong. Its a tiny stream that is carved out in the middle of mainstream Downton main road because it used to exist earlier. To me it's an oddity. However, it must be nice for those who live there. It seems to be imposed and not organic to its surroundings."
clear water,The water river is so clear and the place is beautiful during the night. I just can't stop staring into this river.
night stroll,"This is a nice stroll to take at night, lots of artworks and interesting spots to take photos. It looks safe, and there are stores to shop around the area, If you are coming from Dongdaemon and going to Insadong this is the best route to take."
Nice stream ,Night time is get crowded specially in hot days. Is about 10km long it take about 1-2 hours to walk back and fourth.
Calm and peaceful,A pleasant place for a quiet walk in the centre of a busy city. I would recommend it to visitors of Seoul of all ages. 
Cheonggyecheon Stream,"Fabulously stream to walk. Sees the local family having picnic,the senior citizens gathering and exercise there. Wonderful place"
Beautiful stream,This is a beautiful stream which reminds me of Punggol waterway park in Singapore. We visited here in the day but i guess this place will look even more pretty at night when the lights are on. It can be romantic in the night as well.
"Stunning place for friends, family and couples","In the midst of high building and city noises, cheongecheon provides an area of rest and tranquility for those needing a break. Its a lovely walk to take whether day or night, or simply go there to dunk your feet in the water for some relaxation. Its a place where you can go with your friends, family, lover or even alone for some peace. I highly recommend this place."
A peaceful stream in the center of Seoul,"This a lovely place to walk along, below the level of the road, in the center of the city, which was easily accessible on foot from our hotel. What a great idea to create such a place. Somewhere to go to be quiet, or a nice way to walk across part of the city instead of walking by the roads."
Best part of Seoul,This is a wonderful part of Seoul. Visit during spring and fall and you can enjoy the many restaurants and shops in the area.
Lovely Place,"This stream is a great place to stroll along, with lots of places to sit down along the way. You can also cross over the stream over stepping stones at many locations. It is also a great place to go for a run, especially early in the morning when it is deserted."
A healing place ,This is a awesome place...u can release the stress while walking around there...the surrounding are quite and beautiful 
A lovely river in the city!,"Cheonggyecheon Stream is actually quite small in terms of size but very long as it flows into the heart of this bustling city and is considered one of the iconic and must visit place for visitors.Honestly, the best time to visit this place is at night, with its special and nice lightings, it presented a ""romantic"" atmosphere for married or dating couples. Its lovely and nice.Well, for us, as we were around the area (Dongdaemum) to do shopping and walk-around in the morning, so we dropped by this place after our shopping and it was almost noon time. It was not crowded then (as compared to the evening) perhaps due to the warm and sunny weather.One could walk down to the stream (from the road level) through a flight of metal stairs and can choose to sit along the stream to enjoy some calmness and tranquility away from the busy human and road traffic. Actually its not as warm there especially if you go underneath the bridge, quite cooling and its a good place (besides dating or catching up with friend) to relax, shelter for rain.So dropby this stream if you are in the city and remember to come at night and you will see another but more beautiful and lovely aspect of the stream.Highly recommended.* Actually I have recorded some videos of my travel trips but no way to upload here to share. Do contact me if you want to see and can catch them in my Youtube account!"
Interesting,The president created a man made stream right in middle of a very modern concrete jungle Wich is very interesting. It is a good place to visit to understand more about the country of the strong will people. It located right in administrative and business center so it is pretty neighborhood too
So lovely,This is such a small stream but the setting and design are extraordinary. It is easy to see why this is so popular. Don't miss it.
A great place to visit,"The person who decided to create such a clean and great place in Seoul city, he deserves a medal. Just imagine having to filter a polluted dirty river into a clear running stream through the city and creating such a pretty and unique place for people to walk around or to sit around on a good sunny day. It is great to visit at night when the lights are on. A must visit place when one goes to Seoul."
Cheonggyecheon,Nice place. Underneath the bridge locals sit to sing and talk. The river as well looks beautiful. Good place for a date with someone.
An ecological delight,"This is an amazing waterway right in the heart of a concrete jungle - excellent pongsu. It provides an oasis away from the vehicles and hustle and bustle of everyday life. Cafes and tourist information is in easy reach as you walk along. Cool your feet, make a wish and enjoy the greenery as you go at your own pace. Very restful and relaxing."
Nature in the middle of hustle and bustle,We walked from the start of the stream to Dongdaemun. As soon as you get down to the stream you feel separated from the city. It turns into a very nice and relaxing stroll. We planned to walk from the start to the next subway station and then subway to Dongdaemun. But ended up walking all the way to Dongdaemun because it was so nice. Took maybe 45 minutes due to stopping along the way for photos.
Beautiful,Loved hearing the birds and seeing the clear beautiful stream. Close walk from the design plaza. Would love to see it in November for the lantern festival. 
Peaceful spot in the evening,"I happened onto the Stream area while wandering around the center city on a summer evening. As I was in Seoul for the first time and was staying in Gangnam-gu, I thought I'd take the subway one evening to see what I might see. Lots of people were out, children playing in the fountains, and dramatic lighting of the old palaces. By chance, I came across the stream -- very peaceful and pleasant, a perfect reflection of the general ambience."
A beautiful Oasis in the middle of the city.,"The renewal of the Cheonggyechon Stream was part of a massive urban beautification project in the early years of this millennium. It's a great place to wander and enjoy the views, occasional live music and people enjoying a little nature in the heart of the busy city."
A very nice place to take a walk,"As a redeveloped area from a traffic bridge to a lovely stream this place is a total success in urban design from my point of view, it is interesting with different focal point along the way, better to visit it at night to see the dancing lasers and enjoy the lights, visit in May to enjoy the Buda lantern festival too."
Sanctuary within Seoul.,"I have wanted to come to Cheonggyecheon Stream for years and it was well worth the wait. It's such a beautiful spot, I found myself coming here daily during my stay. It's a great place to walk, run or relax. It's one of the most peaceful area's within Seoul and also has some interesting history attached to it.The longer you walk, the more you discover. I recommend everyone who visits Seoul, take the time to come here as you won't regret it."
Gentle stream through city.,"Makes for a wonderful walk next to a gentle stream in the middle of the city. Some neat artwork on the walls. Take off your shoes, and dip your feet in the refreshing water. Great people watching too."
Very comfortable & relaxing Walking Area,It is so rare that there is such comfortable & relaxing walking area found in Seoul downtown. It is original a underground stream and now become a public waling area for the public. I like its night view. It is a very good place for lovers and family. I think a MUST visit in Seoul. You can't find similar place in Asia.
Walk with friends or run.,"You can rather go with friends to do a small walk or also if you enjoy running go there.There's allways people walking, but running almost always foreigners. Among the way you'll find some fitness machines designed to help olders be fit ( you van use them no matter your age for free)!!! "
A sanctuary the middle of a concrete jungle,"It is very unique to have tranquil clean stream with lush greenery in the middle a busy, bustling Seoul. It has a feel of a country side stream yet has that wow factor. Was lucky that my hotel was just a shot walk to the stream so i went there several times in the day and night. Unfortunately it was in the middle to a hot summer week so i didn't spend a lot of time there. I can imagine one spending a lot of time there when the weather is cooler. I know that the Korean government spent a lot of money to rejuvenate this forgotten stream and I must say money well spent!"
Stream in the middle city,Just go here and take your foot to the stream and relaxing. Love this place. So many locals here. Must go
Nice place to stroll and forget about the concrete jungle,It's really amazing that such a place just a few meters below street level can really have a different feeling. 
Peaceful ,"Walking along the stream we enjoyed the trees, butterflies, fish and refreshing water. During a very warm day it was perfect just to sit in the shade and dip your tired feet in the water. At nights colorful lighted. "
Pretty ^-^ ,"I went there twice, once during the day and another time during the night. During the day it's really enjoyable. Even on a hot day you can cool yourself down by holding your legs into the stream. But don't walk around in it, the security(?) will whistle you our ^^ During the night you might bring a date. The lights are really romantic and if you go alone you might feel lonely between all the couples xD "
"Peaceful, but some bushes and trees are too big","This is a great place to hang out at night, but beware of mosquitoes since you are near bushes and trees. I suggest finding out which part of the stream is the most lively since the part I went to was really quiet and the plants were really over-grown it's not as pretty as the pictures. The stream is quite long so I assume there are more ""popular"" sections than others.TIP: use mosquito repellent"
Seoul city river walk,"great place to escape the bustle of the city, but yet remain in the city. Can paddle in the hot summer days and evenings, impressive light show at night."
Great at night/evening time ,A very relaxing experience at nights or evening times. A lot of activities such as people playing music etc. A great atmosphere in general.
Soak your feet and enjoy the greenery,A lovely place to cool down after a hot day of touring. Lots of locals sitting around and kids playing in the water. We spent half an hour soaking our feet in the clear cold waters ( how do they keep it so clean in the middle of the city??).
Nice place,"Cool place during the day, and beautiful still when lit up at night. Lucky enough you may come across the lantern display on the river (one in November). No matter if you are by yourself, with your friends or family, there is always something interesting to see along the river course."
Great place to chill out,The place is great to stroll around and have a bit of peace and quiet in the middle of the city.....
I love this stream!!!,"This stream is amazing. It is so lovely to walk along, especially in the day because when it is really hot, people just sit along the edge and dip their toes in to cool down. There are also stepping stones across which are really cool. Definitely worth a trip if you have time!!! "
relaxing after a busy hot day,"we went there in the evening and walked around a bit, my daughter loved water so she definitely enjoyed it. There is a throw a coin spot to make a wish, which was very funny & worth trying.After a busy hot day in Seoul, we could really relax with a short walk in this area, close to other main spots too (just 5€ by taxi to Myeong-dong)"
During day light nothing special,"Maybe my opinion would be different if I walked there in the evening, but when the sun is up, it's really nothing special. I went there solo, so maybe one gets a different impression when holding hands with their partner "
Sad sight on a rainy day,"One of the two famous rivers of Seoul. When I was there it was raining often, but the view of this river is not special at all. It is made by humans, but in my country (Netherlands) the rivers and canals are much better then this. Not a must go in my opinion"
Nice little eco haven within a cosmopolitan city,Walking in the depth of the stream would have you forgetting that you are in the city since the high walls block off the high rise buildings. Nice to see people just enjoying the nature and a safe place for the kids to just enjoy playing especially on a hot day.
A great place for a stroll.,A lovely place to walk during the day. It stretches quite far so you have to remember that you have to walk back or get the subway. There are bridges along the way to cross sides and art works as well. Many people were at the start of the stream at night sitting by the water which is lit up with lights. 
Romantic place ,"This place is very popular in seoul, at night this place very crowded with people, most of them couple. Also there is some street musician playing live music, very relaxing and romantic place. You can feel the water stream to and very beautiful light."
A walk next to river,"If you are bored and have no where else to go might be a good idea. Dont prioritize it to other attractions, good for a walk at night"
ok,We walked by during the day and it was ok. everyone had their feet in the water but was not allowed to walk around in it. Maybe nicer at night or festival.
Peaceful ,Very clean and beautiful stream in the middle of hot and crowded city. It's nice during the day to cool off and nighttime to relax.
Newly Renovated! Ideal for Evening Walks!,"The city recently renovated this area after years of negligence and pleading. There are interesting sights and creative artwork along the path. Obviously, it is much more pleasant during the Spring and early summer months before the heat wave roles in."
nothing during the day a sight for the evening,a lovely story for seoul but during the day its really nothing. find it in the evening to see it in its glory
Must Visit in Evening,"If you're in downtown in the evening, I highly recommend this park. Just a long stream through the city. But so well done! It meanders below street level. So you seem to enter a different world as you descend the few meters on the paths on either side of the stream. Art work abounds. And in Spring/Summer/Fall you will hear live music along the stroll. A bit cooler, quieter, fresher air. Enjoy."
Great for an Evening Walk,"I visited Cheonggyecheon Stream with a friend the other night. It's a nice place to get away from the heat and bustle of Seoul. You can walk on street level above the stream or down below. Everything seems well lit, and even under the bridges it's not the least bit unsafe feeling. There are a bunch of stores and restaurants nearby. One note: it's a long stream, so getting directions there can be confusing. We went to Dongdaemun station and walked from there: it's very close by. (Although I'm sure there are other transportation options.)"
A delight!,"This cool, fresh, green and clean stream crossing the city west to east, from Sejong-daero to Dongdaemun and beyond is a triumph of urban renewal. People freshen their feet in the stream below the bridges, large fishes swim upstream, herons wait for their lunch, grandmothers lead grandchildren in the mild thrill of stone hopping and river crossing, small groups assemble for picnic, piped classical music accompany you in the segments where nothing else happens and horse hooves on the pavement can be heard as you follow a long ceramic picture of a colorful royal procession. The whole experience is amazing. Over three days, we did follow part of it three times"
Lovely for a stroll,"This is great place for a stroll in central Seoul. It may not be terribly remarkable depending on where you come from, but certainly unique enough to add to your itinerary."
City in the Stream ?,"A pretty ingenious thoughts of creating a stream in the city. Nice place to take a walk in all seasons, though summer can be pretty hot ! The water's clear and clean and soaking ones' feet in it during the summer months does offer a relief to the heat. If the caffeine craze kicks in during the walk, there are a good number of cafes lining the streets above that will satisfy one's craving. At Cheonggyecheon Stream, it does seem to be a hot dating place for the young Koreans. And if photography isn't the way you like to take home as memories, try the street arts. And if you're game to walk around Seoul, try google maps to head on to Insadong. Its not near and its not far either ... and it can be a pleasant stroll in the cooler months. Enjoy the view during the day and night and soak in the ambience."
"Nice, relaxing walk",If you love walking you should try this. The walk is very relaxing and takes you away from the noisy and busy streets of Seoul. The stream is lower than the street level so you don't hear much noise from the cars. The water also makes it very peaceful. A lot of people stop and enjoy the river flow by putting their feet in the cold water. Beautiful place to relax after a crazy day. 
Walk around,Its a nice place and cool too.. too bad i came at the wrong tiem as the sun was blazing hot that summer noon. Couldn't enjoy it that time. But it's nice just choose a different time. Lots of people hang out in there too.
Long stream,"We were already in the area but we relied on Google - so we were brought to the other end of the stream - love wall However, the more popular end with water falls and wishing well is at the other end. If you are already in the Palace (I think the Gyeongbokgung), it is just at the end of the park (near an intersection). Get a tourism map and review with your google."
Loved the stream,"The stream is a great place for having a walk along the path and getting your feet cool in the water. Walked for many kms and loved every inch of it. Liked how locals come with children for story telling, reading and getting together. Do not miss. "
Relaxing,A good place to step by but I recommend to come at the sunset time it is amazing. It is crowded with children and family. 
Perfect walk to cool and connect!,"Walk the main streets between Myeong-dong / City Hall and Insadong, to take in the vibe of the city and stunning high rise and history of the place. Then walk back along the stream and take time to ease warm tired feet in the cool relaxing stream... Perfection! Or just walk to the stream with your lunch or to relax for a while and cool your feet in the balmy Seoul summer heat!It's charming and an oasis amidst high rise offices. With various pass points where you can cross the stream without having to head up to a formal bridge, be sure to wear flip flops so you don't have to worry about wet feet! It would be amazing to have this by my office in the West End of London!!!"
its a stream,I wouldnt have gone out of my way to walk along here. Very pretty and some nice photos but not much going on.perhaps Im just not enough in touch with the serenity required to enjoy an urban stream
Wild bush and uneven pavement,"This idea is brilliant and genius I love it.Then, the uneven pavement is just horrible and the bush is a total eye sore!They should really put more effort into making it a garden park alike zone."
River in Seoul city,It was really nice place during the World lantern festival and really good to walk down the road in summer. It's really cool during the evening and night.
"Beautiful, but can only be a side trip. A touch of nature in the city.","i visited this place last 2014 and i just wanted to rate it. We came right out of Insadong for some shopping and we could not figure out where we wanted to go next, so we just walked and walked until we saw the Seoul Tower. Funny as it may seem, we walked towards it like kids not even thinking about how far that place is and how high it was situated. :D So on our way there we saw this stream. I saw it somewhere while researching for itineraries so i joyfully pointed there and went there for some pictures. It was very nice seeing a clean stream in the middle of a heavily populated and progressive city. It's truly a touch of nature in the city! I would definitely recommend for you to visit this when it's near a place you are going :) Plus i heard there are times that this stream is decorated with lights :)"
Interesting place.,Nice and serenity place to hang out with your love one.You should find the stone with heart-shaped. There's a lot of fun and romantic too.
Serenity in the city,I went there on the last day of my Seoul trip and took a walk along the side.It is a nice place for relaxing and hanging out with friends.
Peaceful place for a stroll,"A wonderful quiet stream that is good for a walk in the bustle of the city, sit down under a bridge and soak your tired feet in the stream. Appreciate the green and the murals decorating the walls, if you're lucky you'll catch a drama being filmed along its banks."
nothing much to see,We stayed at Jongo which is only few steps away from this area.There we nothing much to see here during summer.A place to jog maybe?
Nothing special at summer season,"Unfortunately, nothing special wad there while both of times me being tat this place. But the place is kind of romantic to spend time with your sweetheart."
Interesting Urban Renewal Project,"We had been shopping in the Dongdaemun area one evening and we decided to check-out this newly-built urban waterstream feature. It is lovely even at night. We visited late at night and there were plenty of people there, some wading in the water. It seemed popular with locals and tourists alike. This area is easily accessible by subway."
Great Place for a Walk,"This place is good to enjoy a walk with your partner, family or friends. The scenery is rather romantic at night with all the lights and the waterfall area is a nice place to chill, just listening to the sound of water is calming. Very popular spot with tourists and locals."
Relaxation,"Day or at night - simply a beautiful relaxing place to sit and enjoy life. If you don't want to walk alongside cars anymore it is a very nice change. Locals seem to highly enjoy it as well, especially once it gets dark people seem to automatically be drawn to this romantic and beautiful place."
Nice place to catch your breathe,"Locals are here to catch the cool next to the water, even u can see fish in there. right next to the gwangjamg Market, if u just feed full u shld come here have a walk and then challenge the next shopping area. "
A Beautiful Night Walk Along the Stream,"If you have had your fill at Gwangjang Night Market, or are waiting for the all night shopping in Dongdaemun, you might enjoy a walk along the Cheonggyecheon Stream. This stream, although man made, runs through many interesting neighbourhoods of Seoul and ends near the square of King Sejong the Great and Gyeongbukgung Palace. I would recommend walking along the stream at night, as you can sometimes find street musicians set up under the many bridges, or come to view the beautiful lights and waterfall near the end of the stream. If you walk down the street from Dongdaemun or Gwangjang your way will be illuminated by many of the lights, and you will be dazzled once you reach the end and can view the square with the Palace and statue of Sejong the Great. "
romantic,"During my time in Seoul I loved to take walks down the stream, it's romantic during night and I loved the sound of water. In June there is a festival that takes place there."
Come and try your luck tossing coin,"Interesting place come for relaxing, enjoy Seoul at different view. You can try your luck by tossing the coin to the hole in the middle of the stream. I tried, it almost went to the hole but didnt :D"
Good for women,This place only for shopping especially the women because they will find a lot of things for them. Here great building you can take a lot of photos
One of the Highlights of My Urban Exploration,"I found this place while walking around with my map and had wanted to see it. I live in Los Angeles and it is an example that the LA River Revitalization folks use as an example of what can be done! Loved this place! There was cool public art along the way, you could hear the water flowing, all the greenery was fresh, and there were places to sit along the way. I just love the whole idea of this place and wished I could have stayed longer!"
Ambiance!,"Great place to go for a stroll and enjoy nature in the heart of Seoul day or night. Very clean and serene. If you visit during monsoon season, be careful, because the entire canal fills up very rapidly.If you benefited from this rating, please click the helpful button."
Pretty,Taking a walk along here is a relaxing way to spend your day. It's located city central and is a very easy and peaceful walk 
Good for a relaxing stroll,"If you have the time, take a leisurely stroll along the stream or dip your feet in it, watching the locals do what they do. It can be very calming amidst the hustle and bustle of the metropolis. During festivals, lanterns and other decorations are put up along the stream, making it more colourful than usual. At night, it is also lighted up. The length of the stream makes it quite accessible from most of central Seoul, so do set some time to check it out if you're in the vicinity."
Such a vibrant place to be !,"Loved sitting by this canal, it's got a great vibe going with lots of locals hanging out here, mostly couples and families. Perfect for an evening stroll after a day of sightseeing."
Nice View with Lights at Night,"This is a good place to take picture, meeting point, relax, chit chat, enjoying the atmosphere. We can walk along the stream and hear the sound of water. At night the stream will have so many lights, make sure you take picture of you here."
"If you don't go, you will regret.",It's where the nature meets human structures to create harmonious atmosphere between the two forces. It's where the nature thrives right in the heart of a busy city and people come to get a piece of calm mind. I went there both during the day and night but the vibe you get at night time is just magical with the soft vibrant lights luminating the river. It is one of the most romantic places to go in Korea. 
Super fun if it isn't too hot,"The stream starts with a lovely fountain where you can get nice pics. Take some snacks with you, walk down the stream and chill in the sun or shadow enjoying the water cooling your feet. The stream is really long and not worth walking all the way down, just take a metro or taxi when you have get enough of walking."
Super Beautiful,"Had a walk down here between the DDP and Gwangjang Market. Beautiful little stream to walk down and to get away from the hustle and bustle of the busy city, even if the stream is ironically right in the middle of the city.Perfect place for an evening walk or a morning run!"
Lovely place to unwind and have a good walk.,"This is the place to watch the locals enjoying themselves watching the stream goes by and to do some brisk walking. My family took off our shoes and soak our tired feet in the cool water of the stream. Prior to the entrance leading to the stream there are booths selling snacks and drinks. If you decided you want to leave the stream, there are many staircases on either side to exit and climb up to street level to catch up on your shopping and feasting."
Pretty place for a stroll,It is such a pretty place to stroll. Not do pleasant if it's on a very hot day though. Go in the evenings. On the weekends you get to listen to talented buskers singing. Quite a romantic spot for couples too.
Historical & Meeting point,"This stream is more than 600 yrs old. It's a public place where u can sit down to relax all day & all night. It's considered one of the best meeting point, there r lots of couples & friends hanging out. It's also walking distance to duty free shopping mall. "
One of the best romanic spot in the heart of Seoul,"at first you will find it strange to see a stream in the heart of the city. but when you walk beside it, you will feel very comfort and the wind blow through the stream at night. It was also quite with some environment light. There are some local law that not allow people to drink beer in this area. so if you would want to buy some drink and find a good spot on the side just like what i have done, you would better to bring a bag with you, so that you can hide the drink inside. Many couples siting on the side watching the water flow. and at the end of the stream, there is some kind of lighting show with many different colore. I would strong recommend this activity after your dinner. Be sure to bring a jacket with you too as sometime the wind blow stronger along the way. I am lucky that I meet my local friends from an app call TravoAsia. my local friend Yon Pak told me all the stuff about the attraction and was kind enough to buy me some local beer. Thanks Yon. and when you come to Hong Kong, i will treat you a local meal."
Cool Stream ,I was most impressed when I learned that this area was a swamp before and received a face lift to become a beautiful attraction. Nighttime is especially pretty. 
Cool stream,"This is one of the surprise in Seoul. An urban stream making good use of space and resource. It's very pleasant strolling down the stream in the evening with the sound of water, the colourful light and the crane meandering along the stream. During the weekend, there's dancing and music performances. Not to be missed!"
Nice pleasant walk,"Nice walk, cooling by the water, stepping stones across if you wish. Places to sit along the way, water is not deep, koi can be seen. Great to walk between major tourist areas by passing the traffic!"
Nice!,"It's a natural stream that goes around Seoul City Center, below the street level. I heard it used to be dirty and neglected but was nicely restored by the government with stair access at many locations, boardwalk. It's well-lit at night. Locals like to hang out there. I strolled along part of it one evening and found the walk very refreshing after a hot, muggy day. The water is very clean with fish if you look closely. There are stepping stones at points where you can cross to the other side. "
Lovely,"This was a pleasant site for a stroll on a nice day. Had we planned ahead, we would have brought a picnic and enjoyed the nice breeze and people watching. "
Attractive... good for a stroll,"A very pleasant walk along this canal type stream. Modern, clean and attractive. Takes about 1 hour or so. Great!"
Yeah it's a Stream. But it's a *VERY* Cool Stream,"Koreans have transformed what was an environmental eyesore into a lovely meandering stream through the heart of the city complete with fountains, shaded areas (such as under bridges) where Koreans picnic, check Facebook, frolic in the water, and just hang out. You don't need to walk the entire somewhat long length - just stroll along for 1/2 hour or so on your way from one attraction to the next and hang out for a while somewhere along the way. "
Love this stream,"Despite the initial criticism of the construction cost and the fact that it has no historical value, this stream is a wonderful urban idea. At least it is better than building more malls. It reduces traffic and is a cool place to hang out. The environment is good and makes a great stop especially if you are into kpop since big bang filmed a mv here. They often have shows here too. It is a good form of exercise to walk along the stream. A welcomed sight in the concrete jungle."
Great place to walk in the middle of Seoul,Cheonggyecheon Stream used to be a polluted area until the city decided to clean it up about 10 years ago. The stream is a great place to walk. You can make the walk as long as you want since it's a little less than 7 miles long. There are some food vendors on the Gwahwamun Square side of the stream if you are hungry. You'll see quite a few people sitting at the stream talking with their friends/significant other. It's definitely worth a visit when you go to Seoul.
Pleasant public space,"A nice place for a stroll and a rest by the stream. Lots of couples and families enjoying the outdoors, feeding the fish and dangling their feet in the stream. Some nice places for photos as well. Surrounding shops and cafes looked interesting, but we didn't have time to explore."
Beautify right in the middle of the city,I visit both during the day and night and both were amazing. I first visited during the day and walked about a mile of the stream then visited at night when all the lights are on and it was breath-taking. If you have the opportunity sign-up for the walking tours offered by the Tourism office and you will get to learn a lot about the history of the stream. I had the pleasure of meeting a great guide on my tour who was an older retired gentlemen that remembered the history of the stream and the evolution of how it came to be what it is today which was very nice.
Streaaaaaam,"I went there during night time while holding a hot toffe nut latte in hand. It was breezy and cold. Walked with my friend along the stream and crossed the stream on man made stones. There are lights lit in the waters, and nice landscapes to be enjoyed. A nice place to walk on during winter nights. Thumbs up!"
"Cheonggyecheon Stream, Seoul",Cheonggyecheon is an 8.4 km creek flowing west to east through downtown Seoul and eventually emptying in to the Yellow Sea. The stream was opened to the public in September 2005. There is a walking path along both sides of the stream and it is quite enjoyable to stroll along the stream. This is a great place to people watch and take photos.
Nice place for a walk,"I was running along the place (ca. 3 km long the interesting area) and is a nice place for a walk, full of decoration in the riverside and with nice stones fit cruising the river and places for sitting and relaxing"
Spend some quiet time strolling,I enjoyed the walking path - located nearby Myeongdong. One could consider taking a stroll on a cooling evening to enjoy the pretty lights and peaceful stream along the path.
Good Place to Stroll in Summer Nights,"Among many things we can do during the summer night, taking a walk along the Cheonggyecheon Stream is one of the most recommended activities. Gentle breeze cool down the late night heatwave of the metropolitan city. If you want something very unique activity, you can borrow hanbok, traditional Korean costume from the K-Style Hub, located near the beginning point of the Cheonggyecheon and walk along the stream. You will be the focus of photographers and visitors."
Pleasant walk ,Pretty hot in summer to walk although still pleasant enough. Best time to enjoy is during the Light Festival in Fall but be prepared to rub shoulders literally w the massive crowds. 
Nice place to chill,"I accidently found the stream during my visit to Dongdaemon market, and there were many people strolling. I took a walk and found the stones creatively lined up to make a small bridge between the banks. "
A must-see in Seoul.,"Commencing near the Seoul City Hall Cheonggyecheon Stream winds its way for approximately 8 kilometres through the streets of Seoul (for those who know Seoul better, from Gwanghwamun to Dongdaemun). Plenty of things to see along the way, with the occasional waterfall, symbolic tile wall(s) or seats to sit and relax on. Formerly buried under a highway the stream was renovated in the early 2000's. It has become one of the scenic icons of the city. The controversy with this stream is the need to pump water to keep the stream running!"
Chillout zone in the middle of the market madness,"If you've had enough of street food and markets specialising in stationery or shoes or fashion or anything else your heart desires and your wallet can afford then this stream is a haven of peace to stroll along, to sit next to in the shade and listen to the sound of flowing water. "
Best urban walk,"This is just a wonderful finding in Seoul. I enjoyed very much walking on this urban amenity. Was surprised by arts on the street, lovely people chatting, enjoying. Other cities must learn. "
Nice little stream close to City Hall,"This is an artificial waterway in the middle of Seoul that tracks for a few hundred meters until it ends with a floodgate.People seem to mainly come here to cool their feet in the water, or have romantic photos taken.They have a light show at night too. Nice calm place in the middle of the city below the street level."
lovely to stroll along in the evening...,"we strolled along for several kilometres after dinner one night.........it was very relaxing, despite the cool night. we felt very safe and it is well lit along the path."
Dip your toes in and relax,If you are down by city hall you can't miss the steam. Honestly it's beautiful at night especially at sunset. Sit down put your toes in and watch the people go by. Especially nice in the middle of a Seoul summer!
Best evening stroll,"This is an easy to find and lovely spot for a short stroll in the evening, but especially when the lantern festival ""floats"" are being stored here."
Safe fro strolling,"great place for stroll, even at night felt very safe with many people on the walkway beside the stream,\. a variety of eateries on side streets ."
Urban oasis ... arts setting,"A refreshing respite and walk that is a setting for unexpected art installations. Beautifully lit at night, seeing young and old strolling below street level. "
Not to be missed,"Recommend that you get a free-guided tour with the Korea Tourism Organization. The waiting point is in front of the metro stop near the stream. The tour will go on regardless of the size of the group. Mr Lee, our Korean guide who spoke good English led us on the 2-hour tour along the stream. It was a good walk, taking in sights of the occasional egret or shoals of carp in the stream. You learn how the stream was uncovered, the history behind the long mural tiles, the beautifully painted flood-gates and the buildings on both sides of the stream. We had good conversations with Mr Lee about Korea, its economy, even K-Pop and the global craze for anything Korean."
Good for couple,Nice place for couple walk around there and also you could see the nice view at night and it is really special design. I could find the nice floral around the place.
An amazing drain,"This is a gem. A storm water drain that has been transformed into a cool , quiet getaway. Four metres below street level it is a quiet , cool place to walk or sit. A landmark when exploring wonderful Seoul, it is attractive and practical."
FORGET THAT YOU ARE IN A SEOUL FULL OF TALL BUILDING WALKING ALONG THE STREAM,"Easily accessed on foot from many hotels. Is a place where you can walk and rest while being in Seoul. . There are some Laser shows with sound besides sounds of 779 horses of a caravan that was composed of 1,779 persons. There is even a show with Fog and music."
calming,"a nice break from the hustle and bustle of myeongdong. go for an evening stroll, lots of locals do it too."
A Seoul daily activity you must experience!,"We walked by the Cheonggyecheon Stream every day from our hotel. It is a truly korean experience. Watch the locals and tourists enjoy the site all day long during their daily outings. Do not miss the light and sound show at night, free of charge. Take the time to sit under the bridges and just enjoy yourself. Safe and entertaining. Just do it!"
Lovely stream area,It is quite nice and peaceful area. Surrounded by high-rises. There are couple of bars along the stream where you can relax and drink. They have a laser show sometime in the evening. Recommended for a romantic stroll.
side track,was there around 5:00pm. photos look better than actual. and a bit hard to find. near design center.
Quite walk in the big city,After shopping in the market we choose to walk along the path towards our hotel. It is a wonderful oasis in the middle of a very bustling city.
A Very Pleasant Walk,"If you're a first-time visitor in Seoul that has more than just a few days on hand, I would recommend spending at least some part of a day strolling along this canal. It's a very pleasant walk and a nice break from the busy city. You can enter and exit at various points, so it's a great way to get from one neighborhood to the next while taking in some sights and seeing the locals. There's a lot of resting spots along the way, so it's also great for meeting a friend, getting some coffee, and having a nice talk. Such calm and peaceful places in Seoul should not be missed."
Interesting sight in Seoul,"This is in the middle of downtown square where statue of King Sejong stands. It is a bit hard to find the entrance since the steps going down is in a busy area. This is a walkway with a stream that has interesting decorations on the walls and stepping stones to cross to other side. All the shops or restaurants are above, this is strictly a pleasant walking area worth seeing."
"Not overly impressed, but if you can't go to the country...","Sorry, but I thought this looked like nothing more than a large gutter in the middle of the city. The grey, drab cement was not relaxing. The water was dirty and there were a lot of people cooling their feet in it. Some nice hanging flower baskets stretched across one section, which looked good. The waterfall area close to the giant ""shell/icecream"" at the beginning of the Stream area was one of the better parts. Adding more rocks, pebbled areas, artworks, etc. would make this a nicer place to visit, but I'm afraid I wasn't impressed."
Really enjoyable,This place was really enjoyable! A green heaven in the middle of a car-freak city. Silence and nature. I'd take this to my home city any day!
A relaxing escape within the city.,This stream area can get crowded at times but on a hot day it was a welcome relief to take my shoes off and cool down on the banks of the stream. As I walked around I met many friendly Koreans and fellow tourists. I spotted various wildlife and really enjoyed the serenity of the area. It has many access points and is near several metro stops. It makes it accessible and convenient to spend some time in this area. 
Must-see in Seoul,Was in Seoul on a long layover so I decided to hit the downtown area to do some exploring. I walked along the long stretch of this famed urban park and had a really great time people watching and admiring the modern Seoul skyline. Allot at least two hours to enjoy the scenery and take it all in.
Enjoyable,"To get a rest, to walk among, to take pictures. We even saw a heron that looks to be a resident in there!"
Best view,Love it....its just near by with Dongdaemun free ease to move around n shopping mallVery scenic view of stream n very clean ever i've seen..Love it..
Great place to walk around,This Cheonggyecheon stream is a great place that one can walk around. The water is clean. You can see great arts in the wall in some areas of stream.
Nice Stream,Going to this stream is in my bucket list. The stream and the places surrounding it is so nice and calming.
Gorgeous!,"Runs through the city, very clean and attracts all ages to sit and eat by the water; flood lite at night; very pretty and a great meeting place."
A very nice area in the heart of the city,Visited the stream at night. There's a lot of resting area which is perfect for hang out and gather after dinner. Loads of trees which keep the place green and relaxing in the city centre. 
"Perfect for couples, and people watching if you're in the area","I lived in South Korea for four years and whenever my husband and I visited Seoul in Summer (which was often) , and had time to spare, we visited Cheonggyecheon. Its a pleasant stroll and perfect for people watching. Lots of couples and families on the weekend. Not an outing on its own, but If you're in the area, why not."
Pleasant to walk along,Very attractive stream in the middle of the city. Lots of plant growth along the sides. Some fish. Good exercise.
Nice and inexpansive walk,"You can talk a short or a long walk close to the Cheonggyecheon river. Since it is under the street level, you won't see cars and street's noises are reduced."
A fun place to hangout in the night,The stream is 11 kms long. Its well lit. You can carry your drinks and sit by the stream. Its a very relaxing place.
A stream runs through it!,"The Cheonggyecheon Stream is a creative, man-made water way in the middle of Seoul. It is designed to give residents and visitors a casual, relaxed, open air experience. The stream features food vendors and displays. On our recent visit, we were amused by an egret catching small fish. Great for kids. Close to shopping and dining."
Best to visit at night,"One of my favourite spots in Seoul, even if it tends to get a little crowded. Thanks to the canal and the colorful lights reflecting back on it, the area has almost a European-feel to it, or at least definitely romantic. On summertime there are live performances and buskers all around, which just adds to the charming mood. You can sit in a cafe and enjoy people watching, or just take a walk along the canal. I always feel relaxed here, even when it gets lively. Couples (too) will love it!"
Nice walking path,Historical yet modern spot to chill and relax or just do a selfie session and walk along the stream path. One of my fave spot in Seoul. Still very windy on early May though for you who cams from tropical country don't forget to bring your jacket.
Nice walk,"Not really a stream. More like a canal with sidewalk on the side and street art. If you happen to be walking in the area, you might as well walk along the ""stream"" instead of street level. I read that sometime, there are festivals there and at night, it is lit up. I was there on a regular day so I was not that impressed."
Nice place to relax,Lovely place to wander for a stroll in the middle of bustling Seoul. Loved the relaxed environment and although it is fully man-made it was still a peaceful place to relax in.
Nice walk along the stream,"Though there is nothing really significant about the place, but it is a place worth visiting because you get to enjoy the serenity of the place located in the midst of a busy city"
Highly recommended in winter,"Went during the warm days and not as fun as winter time. No decorations like during the holidays. When it's hot, you can't enjoy yourself there. One positive note going during the day, less people. If you want a really good memorable experience then go during the winter!"
Not much to look at during Winter,Its kinda boring and no lights and lantern on display during winter. So not much to take pictures on.
Nice place to take a stroll & relax,It was a hot day when I & my friend visited this place. Managed to find a cool spot to sit & chill out. Soaked our bare feet in the water & it was a very relaxing afternoon.
Beautiful and relaxing,This walk offers peace and tranquility in the heart of the city. A great idea.Come during the day and night to experience the contrasts. The stream is lit up at night.
river in the center of the city,"it was very glad to see a river in the center of the city, with small waterfall and many color lamp and cold and clean water there, so peacefull"
Know the history within the heart of Seoul ,This is more than just a relaxing place/stream in the heart of Seoul. I recently learnt 2 pieces of history within the area-world largest ceramic banchado recording king jongjo's visit to suwon hwaseong. You won't be able to spot the king as backin the days you are now allowed to draw the face of the king! A piece of tomb was removed from queen sindeok by the stepson as a revenge and the face of queen sindeok was upside down! How better to learn all these history than reading on books!!!
Interesting stream,My wife and I dropped by this stream late at night. There was a singer there and the stream was relatively well lighted up with relevant themes of the season.Mostly couples and groups of young people were sitting down by the stream enjoying the cool of the night. It is indeed refreshing to see the younger generation enjoying their time together there. There is just something 'young' about the atmosphere.
Beautiful ,"Despite it is daylight, it is very beautiful! Nice and relaxing! It is possible to see and feed fish! It is a nice touch of green for this city. "
Beautiful at night,This is a fun place to relax in Seoul. It is fun during the day but especially beautiful at night when the lights are on.
Nice stroll,Enjoyed taking late afternoon stroll here although lots of students snd people from work come to this place around that time. There are food stalls and along the street are several food places too. 
just ok,"After visited palace and Insadong we decided to have a walk back to our hotel in the afternoon, accidentally we found this place well i found this place not really interesting, I am not really sure in the evening but u can find a lot of coffee shop bar and restaurant in that area. "
Lovely stroll along the stream ,"Really nice walking along the stream with lots of flowers and plants exhibited in different ways, grown in bottles, tyres, buckets etc. Highly recommend. "
Must understand to admire,It is amazing to see history of this place and how it transformed from past dirty place to a magnificent museum and art exhibition place.Very beautiful and well organized.
Exciting escape from concret in the middle of it!,"An open sky sewer converted in a river canal, crossing miles alog the city, nice to start from insadong and walk to Dongdaemun."
Beutiful,"The stream is well located in the middle of a busy city. You can just walk down a pair of stairs and there will be a whole new world! Around the stream there are often families and couples walking, especially during the weekend! The stream provides with the calmness the city doesn't have.Under a bridge you will come a cross if you continue walking there were a lot of people gathering and relaxing in the calm environment with their feet in the water. If you continue walking down the stream you will find how it just gets calmer and calmer. When you find the end, you can just walk up some stairs and there you will meet the whole civilization again. During night you can just sit back and relax in the luke warm air and listen to music playing while watching the evening light dance in the water."
Quiet walk and relaxing at night,"This destination has caught my attention for every long time. I am impressed by the effort of the city that wanted to create such a wonderful public space in the heart of the city. It would be nice if we got there when they have some events or festivals. Would like to visit again, but I have to check the canal's schedules year round."
Stream that runs in the heart of Seoul ,This stream features huge paper statues and colorful lights at the night a very nice way to relax and have few memorable pictures hereIts near Insadong so you can walk to another shopping district 
Relaxing,The Stream is a great place to run and go for a quiet walk at the end of the day. There were lots of couples and families walking in the evening especially on the weekend. 
Ideal for an evening stroll ~!! ,"A beautifully done water stream, in the middle of city center, just behind the city hall with kilometers of walking path, both sides. In some places, it is possible to cross the stream and walk back or climb up to the road. It is always crowded, well lighted and very safe. It's a place to relax, walk, listen to music and to chill out while watch beautiful people. ~! One of the most visited spots in Seoul. "
Good for a walk. ,"I went during the Lotus lantern festival in May, and the area was lit up at night with glowing lantern artwork.Even if you miss that, I think the area is nice for a walk and a coffee."
Beautiful walk when the weather is nice. ,"This is a great little attraction. I frequently walk along this stream. It's pretty, peaceful in-spite of being busy and interesting with its regularly changing features. I you have the time and the energy I would walk along through to the Han river. In the early morning you tend to have older folks meandering along with the occasional stop for Tai Chi. In the evening the young lovers are out in force. A wonderful place to relax and unwind. I live in Seoul."
Well worth the time ,Far from the maddening crowd. A respite from shopping and eating. Watch out for all the different art exhibits/installations. And special art events at night. 
Nice walk along the small river,It really pleasant to walk along Cheonggyechon stream as it is a really quiet place compare to the shopping streets just nearby.
OK,The stream is between Dongdaemun Station and the department stores. Can be visited when tired due to shopping in the area. Accessible using two MRT stations Dongdaemun History Park and Dongdaemun Station
A lovely walk.,"Dongdaemun shopping area. I came here to shop and realized I almost miss this place under the bridge. If you are not paying attention to your surroundings, you will not realized this is the Cheonggyecheon Stream. I only knew of this place by watching too many KDramas. Its a lovely place for couples to come and sit around. I came at 5pm and it was quiet and not many people around."
Cozy,"Went there a late September evening with a friend. Its extremly cozy, even though there can be a lot of people it's not annoying. Great place to take your date for a walk!"
Fun public area,"I came here when there is Lantern festival so double the crowd but it still super fun walk down the stream, there are some street musician that also make the whole situation become even merrier"
Nice walk under the sun,"The weather had been cool and breezy and it's so nice to walk along after lunch.I got off the station and walked along the stream after lunch before going to the palace.It's quite interesting where the beginning were more ""rough"" with more vegetation and towards the city center it became solely concrete covered. There were lots of tourists taking pictures along the way and locals with lunch boxes with them.Generally a quiet short getaway from the busy city."
Lotus Lantern Festival,I had seen pictures of paper lanterns on this stream but it's beauty was beyond my imagination. So beautiful lit up with lanterns as far as one could see. 
Very relaxing steam,"Evening is the best time to visit , sit there and enjoy the stream and the fountain. Romantic place , very near to the shopping market. Couples stoll here hand in hand. very good place to relax "
"Peaceful, Artistic","Interesting history that this stream used to divide the city into the haves and have nots and when a time came that those in charge wanted to change the city, the stream was covered over so the two sides could interact. Later, covering the stream was considered a mistake and it was uncovered, restored, and made a public place. When we were there an art show was mounted there - there were even sculptures in the water. You can cross the stream on the stones placed there for you - it's fresh and clean, safe and a lovely break from walking in the city. Many families are there enjoying the atmosphere. Definitely recommend visiting. Also, if you have a map, you can walk the length and you'll be passing some great places to visit (just exit on any of the stairs up)."
More juxtaposed scenes,Something so disgusting turned into something so beautiful is an amazing experience! This is a huge benefit for all who live in or visit Korea. 
Running,Just went on a Sunday morning run before I had to leave for the airport. Excellent place for running and takes you straight through the city. From city center through the outskirts.
Very clean and scenic,We passed by this place on our way to the LED rose park/garden. This place is very beautiful and clean especially at night. 
A little garden paradise in the middle of the city,"I absolutely loved walking Cheonggyecheon Stream during my time in Seoul. Step down into the recessed walking path and it's easy to forget you're in one of the most crowded cities in the world. Returning back to the surface is disorienting, like leaving a dark movie theater in the middle of the afternoon.This stream features lots of interesting architectural features, fountains, and walkways. During the day, it's a welcome spot to relax and enjoy nature. In the evening, it's the perfect spot for a romantic stroll."
Great place to relax,"If you're looking for some place to just sit back and relax, then Cheonggyecheon would be a great place to go and dip your feet in the cool stream. I went just before sunset, so I got to enjoy both the stream during the day and the lights at night. It's nice for a quiet stroll, and you'll even come across street artists if you want to do something touristy and have your caricature made. When you've walked enough, there are plenty of coffee shops and restaurants lining the street so you can stop for a bite to eat as well."
Very lovely!!,"The stream is nice in the day, slightly cooler than walking at street level and youre away from the traffic and bustle. But at night its really great. Seeing the lanterns lit up, listening to the music (which is either from surprisingly talented buskers or via CD depending on where abouts along the stream you are) and enjoying the mist effect which adds atmosphere. Its a nice romantic walk if youre in the city on a couples break!"
worth a visit if you happened to be in the area,"If you happened to be in the area, I would recommend a visit, I didn't find it extremely worthwhile as a 'must go'. I was there during sunset and on a weekend, it was crowded and the river smells a bit stinky."
Nice and quiet place to relax,We visited this place when it was the lotus lantern festival and it was amazing!!! We saw a lot of big size lanterns in different shapes. We an my kids love the time we spend there.For this festival is a must!
Nice when the lanterns are installed,"Since I was there during the lantern festival, the Stream was decorated with lanterns and there were many lantern platforms on the water. Nice stroll in the business area"
relaxing stroll,Best to be there during evening and night time for a relaxing stroll after you are done for the day. Lots of locals sitting along the stream chatting and having drinks.
amazing place for everyone who wants to just stroll around..,"if you want to just take a walk without being bumped by fast street-goers, better come to this place at night and feel the cold air.. "
Brilliant idea of a stream!,We only covered a short distance after walking from the palace. Its a nice place to have an ice-cream :)
A Green gateway in a buzling urban area,"If you arrive in Seoul than a walk along Cheonggyecheon Stream it's definitely a must. It's a very nice break from the noisy, tiring Seoul. The Stream crosses from Est to west the central Seoul, it's easy to reach by foot and along you might find even birds, like ducks and cranes, and different species of fish. It's easy to cross the town and avoid the busy, dusty and noisy streets in the summertime. Last, the area closer to the center and Myeongdong district and Gyeongbokgung Palace it's a very nice and pretty iconic urban plaza."
Successful Urban Renewal Project,This man-made stream starts in central Seoul with an attractive waterfall and extends for about 11 kilometres with numerous bridges. It's a good place to relax or walk. Certainly a successful and attractive project.
Lovely feature in busy city,How nice to walk along this lovely tranquil stream and watch the fish in the middle of busy Seoul. Only problem when we were there was the midges .
Beautiful place to walk,"This stream runs over a long distance. We enjoyed just a small part of it. It was beautiful. Next time, we will try to cover a much longer distance. It is beautifully maintained. Calm and peaceful! "
A unique feature in Seoul CBD- a stream with 32 bridges and lighting,"Amazing by the night, and each bridge over the stream has a different water formation and a nice place to sit by with a bottle of wine or coffee. It's one of those sites that make Seoul so different from other cities. Must visit and spend some quiet time by the water!"
don't expect too much,"This is just another stream or open drain good for a walk to relax after hours of cloth & clothes shopping.The attraction is when they hold festivals with lanterns etc, when the weather is fine.There are some stepping stones under bridges when tourists stop for photos with murals in the background wall.This leads to some popular street hawkers in Insadong"
Good nighttime walk,"This urban stream through the city is good for a nice walk. It is more ""romantic"" in the evening when the sides are lit up, and makes for a good photo op if you have a tripod. Even better if you happen to time your visit around Buddha's birthday in May, when the stream is lit up with Buddha lanterns. You shouldn't come here just for the stream but it is very strategically located near a bunch of sites and restaurants, so the Stream is hard to miss."
go there for a short rest.,"its pretty cool how this used to be a waterway, and then it's being transformed into a pretty stream. go there for a short rest after all your shopping. "
Lovely area in the middle of Seoul,We walked along the stream during the day and at night - loved the area. Lots of locals relaxing at lunch time.
Motorway restored to its original stage,"Nice walk along the river. This used to be a motorway until it was turned back into its original shape, i.e. a little stream. Walkways on either side, some artists, artwork etc. "
Interesting place to take photos in the middle of the city,"The place is perfect for taking photos. You can get on some pedestals in the middle of the stream, and there are some interesting decorations by the wall as well. A short visit will be sufficient, or you can just walk by the place."
Prepare to be charmed by the Cheonggyecheon Stream,"The Cheonggyecheon Stream flows for a few kilometres. Take a peaceful stroll to enjoy it. It should be viewed during the day and night, as there are lights and sounds which add to the pleasure of the Stream.On one side are many tiles explaining an historic procession."
city center stream,This stream which stretches for miles across Seoul .Went there at sundown and walked along the promenade on the sides.very relaxing place .At night there are light shows at vantage points.On exiting this place there are a lot of restaurants and shopping places to visit too.Very beautiful attraction in Seoul!
Lovely respite from busy Seoul,"We were delighted to find a children's boat race happening during our visit, which made our walk down the stream even more enjoyable. The stream is used by many of the locals as a lunch break walk. During a hot day, the stream area was about 10 degrees cooler than the streets, and has a bit more shade. Definitely a must-see during the warmer months. We walked from City Hall to the Bangsan Market area, which is an interesting place to wander around and see all the different shops. "
Give it a miss,"Nothing much to see here. Just see where it starts upstream where there's like a little man-made stream trickling down to a waterfall feature, then move on to something else. there's nothing along the river banks"
Nice walk on a sunny day,"Many people come here for lunch break and it is was nice on a sunny day to walk along and people watch too. There are some interesting art pieces on the wall along the road which are free, one is a reconstruction of the kings army. the stepping stones and mini waterfalls are very pleasant to see in the middle of the busy buildings around it."
That's the stream? That's it?,"For most Indians, it would be a disappointment. And so it was for me as well. We are used to large rivers. If I compare this, the average size of a storm drain would be larger than the Cheonggyecheon Stream. It's just a small rivulet in the middle of Seoul. But to give it due credit, it's very clean, and nicely lit. Benches on both sides make it a nice place to spend time. Enough said. "
Romantic ,"Lovely place for a stroll after a walk at Myeongdong street. If you are lucky, you get to see fishes around. We were happy they have lift to go down as we have a stroller with us. "
a place to relax after all the walking,a good outlet of relaxation in the middle of a busy city. the stream is so beautiful and serene. a must visit place in Seoul.
Nice place to while away time,I think it is a nice place for couples to take a stroll down the stream and enjoy the slower pace despite it being in the heart of the city. There were many couples (therefore my conclusion that it's a nice place for couples) and the stream is really quite long. It was night when I was there but there were still many people. And the area was beautifully decorated and lit with Christmas lights. 
A bit of a surprise,"Was quite surprised to see this in the heart of the city, which was apparently an initiative by one of the former mayors of the city. It's a lovely feature, and a great walk away from the congested roads. Well worth a visit."
Nice place to walk,"The idea of demolishing an elevated highway to make room for a path along a small stream was a great. Being in the middle of the old city, it provides a repite from the concrete jungle, with fishes and birds. Highly recommended if you want to relax."
Nice walk down the stream ,"If you're not in a hurry it's well worth the time to stroll down the stream. Fishes, murales and stepping stones make for a nice and varied walk. "
Peaceful respite.,"Lovely walk through a bustling city. Plenty of opportunities to stop and watch the world go by. Lots of fish in the stream, some really big ones too. Even if you only take in a small section it's recommended. We are in Seoul at the moment and visited the stream, by coincidence we watched an episode of Sense8 the same night and the stream featured in that episode. "
cosy and relaxing,"this place often holds events. It is very romantic for couples , and very cosy to chat with friends.Great to take photos. There is a lot of places where you can sit too. But be aware when night falls , I would suggest to have a good mosquitoes repellent , it is seriously a pain. "
Night and Day,"I went here twice! The night time view has the surrounding lights reflecting in the water and the ends of the stream look dazzling. In the daytime, come here to see the fish and enjoy a snack by the riverside. At almost all hours of the day you'll find locals walking by the riverbank."
Lovely night stroll,We walked along the stream after dinner in the evening. It was very pretty all lit up! I would recommend going at night.
City and nature converge,I liked it. It was soothing to hear rushing water amid the hustle and bustle of the city and it was interesting to people watch and see the sunset and the light installations.
Beautifully lit up at night,"Cleverly functional and beautiful as well, this walkway joins a few shopping areas where you can come up from the side stairways bypassing the roads. Amazingly serene pocket in a sea of highly populated neighbourhoods. Enjoyed the evening walk."
Go at Night,In a newer area of Seoul. Must better at night then daytime. It is worth the effort. You do not need a tour guide for this-just a map
nothing very special,we went in the morning. probably no special decoration during our season. a bit of wall decoration about the tribe of king's outing.
Cool and incredible stream ,Its actually water that comes down from the mountains. Its incredible to see how well lit abd decorated the place is. Also adds a natural effect in the middle of the city .
Tranquility in a busy city,"A very relaxing stroll which cuts through the center of a very big city. Cheonggyecheon stream offers peace and quiet and places to sit and relax. A very artsy place with light shows at certain places, it's nice to see it during the day time and it's even better during the night. See it both during the day and night. You won't be disappointed."
Serious local walkers mix with strolling couples & tourists,This is a lovely way to walk through Seoul. The stream is designed into different parts to give the feeling of a real outdoor experience. Lots of bushes and greenery. You can cross over via big stones. 
Nice evening stroll,"A little too hot in the day, but nice to just stroll by if you happen to be in the area at night. Not much in the way of street activities though, compared to other riverfront precincts."
Nice walk to just think and enjoy ,Nice little stream with a small light show. Great photo spots. Kinda stuck under the bridge and lots of small flying bugs in some areas. Nothing too troublesome. They had an OMAN exhibit around the middle of the stream. It is worth a visit. 
Original,Pleasant and quite original for a stroll downtown. I must admit this has been very nicely made and the place is quite attractive. This being said it is still stream in between 2 concrete walls.... so don't expect a world marvel!
Walking to Gwanggiang markey,"After walking along Insadong we walked along the stream to get to the next market, was not too crowded so walking stress free, some nice nature, fish, birds surrounded by some highly concentrated markets"
A great place to see Seoul from,"I love Cheonggyecheon not only because it's a pretty place to stroll, but because it represents Seoul's modern approach to the city. This linear park submerges you along the river where you can hop from one side to the other on large stones. You can see the city sky line and marvel at Koreas modernism. You can often see families out for a walk, and lovers trying to find a romantic place to pause. I like to walk westward after work on Fridays - it's a peaceful and place to watch the sunset."
great to talk along,good place to walk along the river to get from one location to the next or to just enjoy a drink or snack along the river and people watch.
Beautiful Must-See,What a beautiful sight! A relaxi g place to go for a stroll in the middle of a busy city. It's a bit crowded during the lunch hour. The local business men/women take advantage during their lunch. We went back for the evening light show. It is worth 8 minutes of your trip. 
Pleasant for a stroll,"The water is crystal clear. At night, you can see big fish just resting behind the stones. The place makes very nice pictures and it is really pleasant to just sit on the side with coffee, even on a cold day."
Get below the street level and stroll away.,"It's quiet and tranquil along the stream. Can't believe we are just below the street level of a busy boulevard in central Seoul. The sound of the flowing stream and gentle lighting makes the place looks magical at night. We walked past groups of youngster joking around, couples walking along arm in arm and families taking an evening stroll. Nice way to end the day"
"Urban planners, do stop by",A reclamation of public space in an Asian capital. I benefitted more as I took a local Royal Asiatic Society Walk which gave us the municipal history of this traffic jam area and how this stream was thought of.
Fun stroll inside Seoul,What a fun place to walk around during the day and especially at night. Most cities don't have anything like it.
Serene Escape from the Boisterous City,"This stream is a beautiful, tranquil, and serene escape from the city of 10 million people. The trees, shubs, high walls, and trickling water cancel out the noises produced by the city quite well. I have been to the Cheonggyecheon stream multiple times and in every season and I have enjoyed it every time."
Lovely convergences!,"Spot families, couples, and friends strolling this accessibly stream.We walked here from Gwangchang Market. A pity we didn't finish walking the entire stream. "
A nice way to get from A to B or just take a nice sunday stroll,"I suggest starting before dusk at the City Hall end of the stream, tossing a coin in the wishing well for charity and then strolling along the river as long as you wish. Heard from my sister that sometimes bands play music along the river.. As a sightseeing destination it is just ok.. don't expect too much."
Go during the lantern festival ,"If you can, go here during the lantern festival in the fall. My husband and I spent over and hour walking down the steam marveling at the beautiful lanterns shining on the dark sparking water. After walking down the stream, we walked 5 minutes to a bustling street with tons of great street food, restaurants, and shopping. Even if you can't make it to the lantern festival, the stream is gorgeous all year round!"
Long stream in the middle of the city,"We went for a very long walk, following the course of Cheonggyecheon Stream in the evening and into the night, ending up at DPP, but the stream kept going.It was very pretty in the afternoon sunlight, and there were plenty of locals enjoying it.Note - it's all concrete - this is not a ""natural looking"" stream with dirt banks. But it's nice all the same.Well worth a stroll."
Don't wrinkle in this stream,"You may want to wrinkle in there when you go with your children but the concierges prevent you from go into.Of course, there is no guide of that."
Romantic ,Place is nice for couple to walk around the stream or just sitting along the stream. The surrounding is a financial district. Big tall building. Stream is best to go at night.
So-so ,"Although it's great for a walk or for jogging, the vegetation around needs urgently a hand. Come here for the sunset or at night when the lights dim with the bridges. Also a picnic here would be a super romantic date. "
Nice romantic night stroll,"I've been here in the day and night. It's really pretty at night. During the day, it's a relaxing but bland place to be. Don't go near the city hall side on weekend nights, due to protests. My family caught some pepper spray that drifted downwind to the stream one evening.stay near the Dongdaemun area if you want to avoid it. "
Overlooking the stream,Overlooking the stream and it is such a nice place to visit at night. The surroundings adds to beauty and vibrant of the place.
Romantic place,this stream run through seoul. many people come here to relax or meet friends. also its recommend place for dating where you can see many couples hanging out and street musicians play on their guitars. at night they have light show on water
Absolutely beautiful!,"Really beautiful stream in the middle of the city! Great place for a short or long walk, enjoying all the art all over the place. I went there during day time, which is a pity, because I bet it would be something really amazing at evening. "
It's a nice riverwalk (stream is more like it) and break from chaotic traffic.,"My encounter with this stream and walking path by it was in Dongdaemun. It elicits a faint resemblance to the walk along the Seine in Paris but without the river. It's really just a shallow and relatively narrow stream. But, it's really pretty peaceful compared to the street scene just above it. It was actually a very nice walk for the one city block that I walked. There were no crowds, no bad smells, no trash and it was sort of landscaped with trees, shrubbery and rock placements in the stream. You get up and down to the walkway (paved) via stairs. If there are elevators, I didn't see them."
Seoul water feature,Fun trip and a beautiful area in the downtown of Seoul. Demonstrates their cultural values and a relaxing place in a crowded city.
Pretty sight amongst blocks,"We stumbled across this walk on our way to a supermarket in the evening, plenty of people enjoying a stroll alone, with SO or friends."
Beautiful Hangout Place,"Cheonggyecheon is among the places where both, tourists and locals enjoy having fun. Especially, on the nights, you will see lots of couples walking around, so if you are looking to have some peace from the busy city of Seoul, this is the spot.If you go around the whole stream, it will take you close to an hour, but overall it is worth the walk.If you go on the daytime, it is more quiet as there is a lot of elders walking around."
"Nice walk, great atmosphere","I went to this stream a few times whilst I lived in Korea. It's a nice place to go if you want to sit by the stream and just listen to music or read or just relax in general. It's also great to go with a bunch of friends. Grab some snacks and soju and just chill out by the stream. Also, the stream is very long so it's a fantastic walk! If you get tired there's plenty of stairways right along the stream which lead to subway stations. "
nice walk trhough the city,The stream has been opened up some time ago to make place for a walkway on the streamlevel (one level down from the normal street level). Makes for a nice walk if you want to forget a bit about the hectic traffic.
Best to visit at night!,"It's best to visit Cheonggyecheon stream at night as that's when the lightings will light up and it's super nice and romantic to take a stroll here after your dinner! The stream is long but it's also connected to nearby places such as Myeongdong, Cityhall and Dongdaemun. Recommended to visit regardless whether you're alone or with someone!"
Good place for photographing,"This place was Nic and clean to walk, to hangout with friends. Many festivals were held here, but you will find out so many photographers taking their job around the canal, of course, shooting at girl models."
pleasant walk or place for a sit-down and rest,"This is shallow stream about 15~20 feet wide, with walking paths on each side, connected by several small small bridges spaced out along its length. It cuts through a major part of the city, following the path of a natural stream that was at one time covered up by concrete and later uncovered to make this attraction. At Christmas time and other festival times, the city makes light displays here that are quite nice. Then, I would say this is for sure a place to come and take a few pictures. At other times, it is a just a calmer place to walk - no cars, traffic lights etc. Generally speaking, I think the nicest time to walk here is in the evening, when they turn on the everyday lights (under the water, and along the pathway). It might be a nice simple break after a busy day of sight seeing, and after a nice dinner. You could just walk a little ways, and sit for a while with a coffee (when it is a bit warmer). Kids might be entertained for a short while, but it is more of a place an adult might appreciate.I have visted in summer and winter. It the summer time when it is hot, it feels a little cooler walking beside the water. In certain sections there are bushes and trees that give some shade. Many sit on the edge and put their feet in for a while. In the winter time / colder times of the year, it is not as appealing, because the bushes and trees are brown, and the stone is a little chilly to sit on, so you are not so inclined to mozy along and relax. You could possibly take this walk/coffee break in connection with a concert at the nearby Sejong Arts Center, or in connection with a tour of the nearby main palace (10~15 minute walk from the main starting point). The Myeongdong shopping area is nearby as well."
A calm and relaxing walk after visiting Gyeongbokgung palace,"After visiting the palace walk toward Gwanghwamun, passed through the statue not very far you will see the big purple/blue shell structure on your left. That is where I started the walk, feel refresh once seeing the waterfall walk a bit further less than 10 meters, there is a spot where you can throw a coin into a hold in the middle of the river, to make a wish. Once you get tired from walking there are plenty of exit to a subway station. Try to make it to the light show in the evening if you have time."
Maybe nicer in the warmer months,"Walked past the Cheonggyechoen Stream on my way to Dongdaemun. It was winter and it was during the day, so no lights and it looked ordinary, nothing special. Maybe this is the less prettier part of the stream? I can see even this part of the stream would look a lot nicer during the warmer months."
Christmas lights were superb,"Walking along the paths by the Stream just before Christmas with lights and light shows is an unforgettable experience. It is very popular with Koreans who come to take photos, meet friends and enjoy the carnival atmosphere. Originally this was a run-down area but it is now one of the not-to-be missed sights of Seoul."
Nice Walk,A Nice walk through the city but nothing out of the ordinary unless it happens to be the lantern festival.
Romantic walk! ,"This is a nice place to walk, particularly for couples! It's probably even better in the warmer months, but it's certainly nice in the winter, too!"
A nice walk!,Try walking along this stream to understand the beauty of nature away from the city and technology. Its a good way to understand korean culture.
Nothing special,Just passed by Cheonggyechoen Stream on my way to Dongdaemun. The section of the stream is close by JW Marriot. Nothing really special about this section and I heard that the section near Gwanghwamun is prettier.
nothing much to see,"i just like this place because of what they did a stream that became a tourist spot. they said it used to be dirty, but now it is really clean you can walk there and have a date with your love one. But still nothing so interesting, just go to a park near by it is better."
Beautiful and impressive - a great walk,"The daylighting of Cbeonggyecheon stream was a impressive feat of urban planning and took incredible foresight from Seoul. Today you can enjoy a short stroll along a section or turn into a day tour by waking the entire length and stopping to check out sights just off its trail- I found it so tranquil and relaxing to listen to the stream bubble away and followed it as it got bigger, watching ducks play and spotting the occasional fish ... Great for a stroll, run, family outing or just quiet contemplation... A break from the big city!! "
Successful transformation,"The stream is a good visit for a morning or a couple of hours in the afternoon. You can start near the city hall and walk all the way to the East. There's different parts with some more nature feel or modern urban feel. What I missed was the connection to the street and maybe some places to have a drink. But see this as a nice quiet stroll along the river, that happens to be in the middle of the city"
Any time of year...,I visited here in winter over Lunar New Year and it was very quiet (although there is reasonably unobtrusive piped music along the way). It's a little colder than the street level but it was peaceful and pleasant to walk along and I can imagine other times of the year and at night it would be a lovely promenade. Might be good if you had children and you wanted to let them walk freely without any risk of traffic (the stream is not too deep and has lots of stepping stones in it - so be careful if they are prone to water play). I was warned that it is also used as a flood release so be aware if it has been raining a lot! 
cool,Nice place for a walk at night since the stream is nicely illuminated. Great place for morning run - quiet and safe.
Worth a quick stop,"Nothing spectacular except when there are decorations or particular themes being displayed at Cheonggye Plaza/at the start of the stream. If it's on your way from one attraction to another, it's worth a quick stop for some photography."
Entertaining but not breath-taking,"It's a cool place to walk by if you happen to be nearby, mainly at night. Not necessary to walk all of it, with just a Km you can appreciate it more than enough."
Passed by on the way to Dongdaemum,"We chanced upon the place on our way to Dongdaemum. Earlier, our host has advised us against going there as there is nothing much in winter and he's right! However it offers another type of tranquillity and charm in the busy city area with its half frozen stream and spacious walkway. Worth a drop by if it's on the way but would not have purposely make a trip there during winter months or when there is no ongoing festival."
Pretty :) makes for a nice relaxing walk in the middle of busy Seoul ,"Is a nice change of pace from the rest of cbd Seoul. But definitely better to go at night, with the lights on than to go during the day"
Must visit,Go here just to take a walk and explore many coffee shops lining up the road on both the sides with a very European feel. Note : Make sure you know how to get a taxi back to your hotel. We had to wait for a long time before we got a cab. 
very magical,I highly recommend visiting this place as the river is very clean and has no foul smell. Very close to train stations and shopping areas.
nice area,the in ground stream the runs between the sides of the road. There are often events at the stream and many things to do.
Really awesome place to hangout,"Even if you just want to take a walk across the stream, you will reach other part of seoulwithout having any Idea. Mak sure to check it out during Lantern Festival (it looks fab espacially for kids)"
Turn a highway into a river,"Only two years to tear down a highway and restore the river that was buried underground for decades. Do some research into the history and you will really appreciate what you are seeing. Bring your kids and let them waddle int he water, but remember to bring towels and fresh clothes to change them and not catch a cold! "
Nice stream,I recommend to visit it in the night and before you sit there you should a get cup of coffee and enjoy with nice view. 
Cheonggyecheon stream - Lantern Festival,Cheonggyecheon stream is one of the major attractions of Seoul. It is worth visiting during the Lantern festival (During mid-November)
Peaceful Evening Walk,"This is a peaceful and relaxing walk within this busy city Seoul. There nothing much to expect, but surely is a very relaxing walk. You may start this walk 1 or 2 hrs ahead before ending it at Dong Deamun for night shopping."
Definitely the best place for the couples,Is quite unique as it located in the middle of many buildings . It is11km distance . Definitely a nice place for couples to hangout there . The scenery at there is worth a visit 
One favorite place in Seoul ,"A beautiful place at night that I love visiting whenever I'm in Gwanghamun Don't miss out because it's nice The lantern festival is beautiful too, but be prepared for a huge crowd I suggest taking time to walk the whole trip to the end Start from gwanghamun and walk down to the end "
Romantic Place,This is my 2nd times visited. Both times we visited are different in decoration. This place is very relaxing & clean.
Long stream in the heart of seoul,"Take a stroll down the stream at night,there are some shops around. The christmas decoration is beautiful."
Worth a Quick Visit,This was in walking distance from the Gwanghwamun Square and Gyeongbokgung Palace and is worth a visit while in the area. You can take a leisurely stroll around the stream and there are large stepping stones you can use to cross the stream to the other side.
Nice for a picture if you are in the area,Pretty picture but not worth it if you are going just for this. reachable at different spots so do find the one nearest to where you might want to visit.
Visited during Lantern Festival -Amazing!,"The lantern festival was beautiful on the stream. The line was really long, but moved quickly. The lanterns are just beautiful & it was a perfect location."
Nothing special but good view for photograph,Great view across the stream. Came across the stream while travelling to dongdaemun. Nothing special 
Nice Spot,It would be the best if you come here chilling with your friends or even by yourself in the evening just before the sunset. Nice spot for chilling and walking at the heart of the city 
Wouldn't go out of my way,"The Cheonggyecheon Stream is definitely best seen at night. I went in January (windy, cold, unpleasant) and during the day. There wasn't much to see and had I not been in the area already, I would have been highly disappointed."
Pretty illumination during Christmas,"Went a couple of days before Christmas, so it was lit up nicely with many lights (snowflakes, flowers etc.) There were so many couples! The waterfall at the end was also very pretty."
A great place to wander,"At night it is really peaceful and quiet, there are lights everywhere so the view is really beautiful."
Amazing!,Amazing place in Christmas! It's decorated with a lot of beautiful lights even if you go not in Christmas you will also enjoy it! 
Walked it from Dondaemun to downtown,"Took this walk for the first time last Labor Day 2015. I was all alone, but thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Would highly recommend it to anyone. good walk with a friend or girlfriend, also for anyone interested in Korean history."
Not that nice,"I know it had the best of intentions, but it's not that nice. It's rather random exhibits sponsored by various countries."
Relaxing place for locals and tourists,"This is one of the ""must-sees"" in Seoul and one of the favourite relaxing spots for locals in the very centre of the city.The stream itself is few km long, so you can have a nice walk and chill-out. When we visited, there was some kind of ""eco-food"" festival on Cheonggyecheon Plaza, but steam had not any kind of ""festival"" (often there are lantern festivals and then it looks amazing). Nevertheless, Steam at night is highlighted and looks very nice. Perfect place for romantic walk or other family/relaxing activities."
The stream is your guide,"This stream is awesome, just follow the stream to get to other awesome places. From Dongdaemun, one direction is towards Gwangjang Market. The opposite direction is towards Sinseol-dong's Emart! The stream is a good navigation. Drinking makgeolli by the stream is great too!"
A piece of relaxing stream and countryside in the middle of Seoul,"OK - so you're never going to get away from concrete totally but the effect of wandering alongside a babbling stream (enough to soften the traffic noises) is very relaxing. For us, a must see."
Super relaxing,We found this by accident and really enjoyed just sitting by the stream watching children play in the water. We were among many just relaxing with our feet in the water on a hot evening. Totally recommend it!!
The Colorful river stream At night,"Done this walking from the Colorful stream down, in every 100 meters , there is something special, Music , animation , Grafitties , Galery , it's a stream of Art in the middle of SEOUL Loved it "
Interesting,Visit in the evening where the christmas lighting decorated the plaza and along the stream. Unfortunately the lighting decoration is only around 350m long and after that we found the regular lighting of the stream with a bit rough walkways.Still interesting to visit.
Lantern festival,"My family and I visited Seoul in autumn. Thanks to our friendly vacation rental owner, we found out that there was a Lantern festival being held at the Cheonggyecheon Stream during our stay in Seoul. We really enjoyed our walk along the stream as we stop to admire each lantern piece. The lanterns were all very pretty and creative."
One of my favorite places in Seoul,"This is a great place to visit for a relaxing afternoon. The stream has many lovely shops and restaurants next to it. During the warmer months, you can sit and put your feet in the stream. I have been many times and I enjoy it without fail."
An afternoon stroll,"Having visited Insadong, we walked the short distance to join the stream. I wasn't sure what to expect but I enjoyed the easy walk towards city hall and the ice rink. Although it was day time, we could see the Christmas lights that were dotted around. I'm sure in the evening this is a cute place to walk with a date - very korean!"
Nice view ,"I walked to this stream from Chandeukgung Palace. Since its Christmas, there are many decorations and setting would be pretty during the night. A great place to stroll and enjoy the view. Its quite a long walk if you want to walk from one end to the other end. And you can throw coins into the stream and make a wish"
Nice view with the light besides river,"This place is good especially nice view when we come in the night. The light beside of this river can make this river so wonderful. This river so long, so you can reach from some subway station. I came from dongdaemun station after shopping."
My favorite spot in Seoul,"I just love this place, by day or night. Walked all the way up until the clothes shopping district. It is sooo nice, every big city should have something like that. Thank you Seoul!"
A little underwhelming in the day time,"The photos definitely make this look nicer than it is. There were unlit Christmas lights and figures which were still in the stream, which took away from the experience. It would prob be cooler at night. The wishing well was cool, and so were the stepping stones. But it was underwhelming compared to the photos. "
"Beautiful Spot, Day and Night!","I went to Cheonggyeochon Stream during spring season and it is located near Dongdaemun. At first, I just accidentally saw this places in the afternoon and it is really beautiful. When night came, I visited this river once again and it's still as awesome as you can imagine. The water is really clear and you can just sit on the bench of the river and put your foot in the water, it might be simple but it's sooo refreshing! you can see many couple spending time near this river because somehow this place brings you a romantic feels :D a must visit in Seoul!"
Nice place to visit during Christmas,"Visited on a cold December night to view the special Christmas Light Up. it's beautiful, a nice place to go for a stroll at night with friends and loved ones. The stretch that is lit is about 1 km in length. bring a good camera. "
Not that great - perhaps wrong section,"I was a bit disappointed when arriving the site to find it was just a water pipe with a band playing music; totally unlike those found in the picture. Perhaps, I went to the wrong section just adjacent to the Dondaemun and missed the beautiful section at the other end."
Imagine a stream in the middle of a city,"Refreshing hideaway from the hustle and bustle above. The stream is beautiful at night because of the lights, tranquil in the day amidst the sounds of flowing water."
a case study in urban renewal,i visit different sections of the stream when i visit Seoul as this is a excellent example of greening the urban space. 
A Lovely Stroll,"Located near Jongno; this lovely, man-made steam flows seven miles across Seoul. What makes this attraction so special is the innovative design and creative development which makes the stream so unique. Simply take a stroll alongside this wonderful steam and marvel in the beauty of it all.A must visit in Seoul."
nice place at night,The site is in the middle of buildings. It has beautiful lights and water springs. Nice place to walk and enjoy lights at night. 
Peaceful and calm stream,"Took a walk at this peaceful and calm stream with a friend. It is located very near to Dongdaemun shopping complex, Pyeonghwa market and Dongdaemun market. Took some pictures and enjoyed the peacefulness and calmness of the stream. Not to miss this stream if you are nearby Dongdaemun shopping complex."
Tranquil walk in the middle of town,"This is a peaceful walk along a stream right in the middle of town. Easy to walk to while visiting the palaces. Lots of shopping and food along the way, just take one of the many stairways up to the hustle and bustle of Seoul."
Stream at the Heart of the City,Its an amazing feat having a clean and clear stream at the center of a busy city. We had a walk on this famous stream in the morning and it felt really good. The sounds of the water and the man-made water falls really calms you down. The water is so clean in fact we saw Koi and other fishes. Our Tour guide told us that it's better to visit the place at night especially during summer where there are lots of people just hanging around. Worth visiting !!!
cold in the winter but beautiful,Visiting here around 4.00 p.m and it was windy. We felt amazed because they can change the stream from the worst to be the best. Lights were everywhere and christmas decorations were being prepared. Definitely worth to visit this although it was very cold.
Good stream in the city,This stream is located in the north of Seoul and good for walk and can see many tourist site including dongdaemun market
Beautiful area anytime of year,Relaxing stream through central Seoul beautiful anytime of year. There are often decorations and themes depending on the season. In the summer relax and put your feet in!
Go and see the Christmas lights at night!,The lights are just beautiful! What a lovely way to enjoy the Christmas lights along this canal. It stretches for a long way and there are different themes between bridges. 
BEAUTIFUL STREAM IN MY LIFE,AMAZING! DAEBAK! BEAUTIFUL! I suggest you should visit the stream at night or more good if u visit on Christmas or the latern festival! Romantic and really beautiful! 
nice place to stroll,This place i s nice to stroll along either in the morning or in the evening. its more quiet in the morning as at night this place is full of dating couples esp in Spring. There/s a lantern festival here during November. 
A great free activity!,"I have enjoyed walking along this lovely reclaimed stream for years. It's a great place to go for a long walk and talk, or to take photos, people watch, have a picnic, write, and relax and just be. Grab a cup of coffee and see where you end up, it's also a great way to get to other interesting sites in the area. I enjoy that it's car free and has lovely landscaped sections. "
Great place - go during christmas and new year time,"Been there before christmas, they have just decorated it with lights. it was really beautiful. You can see the local having fun there. There are many cafes and restaurants around. "
Great walk,"Best in the evening in May around the time of Buddha's birthday when the lanterns light up the walkway beside the river. Amazing solo walk, and also for some relaxing picture taking. Calm"
Family vacation,Nothing special and only walked along the stream. Near to Myeongdong and therefore you may walk there when around the corner.
Such quiet and serene area to hang out with loved ones,Went on a quiet Saturday afternoon with great sun reflecting from the water...see families with small children with shoes off jumping in and out of the water just enjoying the water float and lovely sun; see couples talking just enjoying their time together. It's so different from a few blocks over in busy bustling shopping area of Myeundong
Nice walk evening time,"Nice walk at the Cheonggyecheon steam in the evenings, full of life and near a busy nightlife area. from restaurants, to rooms and bars."
Lovely and Romantic,What a romantic hangout. We happened to chanced upon the Lantern festival and had a enjoyable night here. There where lots of food stall along the street too.
Nice walk to get from place to place,Interesting and good way to walk to get off the main road. Some nice Christmas lights. Not sure I'd make a special trip just go go here though. Maybe better in hot weather rather than winter. 
Good for relaxation,The stream is very clean and refreshing. There are spot where we can soak our feet and enjoy the relaxing water massage. There are also a lot of restaurant near the area and sometimes there are also art performances.
Perhaps a summer attraction,I visited here on a rainy November day. I think this might be more or a summer attraction a it was mainly wet and grey when I visited.
Mainstream,What a really cool concept. Revitalize an inner city waterway and make it an attraction. Plenty of strolling to be had and it just makes the CBD a better place to be. The large shell / spiral sculpture named 'Spring' at the head of the stream is an awesome art work and landmark
Romantic and Relaxing Walk,"I was there when it is having lantern festival. So beautiful, suitable for all people. i saw a lot couples, families or friends. This is one of my favorite spot in seoul."
Lantern festival,Visited in Nov and managed to catch the annual lantern festival along the stream. A long stretch of various lanterns and light instillations. A must visit during this time!
Beautiful walkway ,"We went at the end of the Lantern Festival and were able to see the interesting ""Floats"" of historical and regional themes. Also the tile replica of the Joseon dynasty emperor pilgrimage to father's grave. Well worth the time for a peaceful walk right inside the busy city. "
Nice Stream,"Nice and clean stream. If you visit in November you can see the lantern festival, its beaitifull and romantic for couples :)"
Night time is best,This place is spectacular at night. They had so many artistic displays all down the stream it was beautiful. October and November seemed like a great time to visit especially as couples maybe. I imagine it's nice to hang around in the summer to cool down.
Great Stream,"Before my visit to Seoul, many friends have recommended visiting this stream. So I set aside half a day to visit this stream. It's a beautiful stream situated in the middle of a city. It was nice to walk along the stream to just relax and take a break from the busy days in Seoul. I walked along the stream right up till the waterfall where the stream began and where everyone there was taking photographs with the waterfall.Recommended to anyone who would wanna take a breather from all the busy streets and see a long beautiful stream."
Nice River Walk - clean and pleasant,"Having read many good reviews of this environmental success of rejuvenating a heavily polluted stream, I have high expectation of see it. While it is indeed very clean and pleasant to walk, it is a bit too artificial and man-made with nothing really ""nature"". The source of the stream is just 100% city tap water, that is why it is so clean!"
Great place to visit during the annual Seoul Lantern Festival,"The Cheonggyecheon River is a historic waterway which flows through downtown Seoul. Between 2003 and 2005 it was cleaned, restored to a more natural setting and made part of an urban green space and leisure area for residents and visitors. You can access Cheonggyecheon River from popular sightseeing areas like Gwanghwamun, Inda-dong, Jongno and Cheonggyecheon. It seems this river stretches around 11 kilometres and includes 22 bridge crossings. There are walking paths on both sides of the river within the area that transects the districts listed above. We recently visited Cheonggyecheon River during the annual Seoul Lantern Festival, finding the stream filled with various lantern and displays which were delightfully lit up in the evening. These were really nice to see, especially after dark. It was great seeing so many families out as well enjoying their time at this local festival. Overall, we appreciate the green initiative that the Cheonggyecheon River and enjoyed walking its shallow shores. Being there during the lantern festival made our visit even better. Those visiting during mid November each year will certainly have this to look forward to."
Beautiful Stream ,Take a stroll along the stream at evening and see the numerous lights and graffiti art on the wall and thematic displays . The autumn breeze caresses your hair and you don't know you are in the middle of a teeming metropolis 
Unbelievable stream,Come of think of reconstructed and improved stream in the middle of the city and maintaining a very clean flowing of water. A very good place to relax.
Nice place to chill at night,"Cheonggyecheon Stream was once a dirty river, now it is the main attraction of Seoul. This place is beautiful day and night. U are lucky if u travel in November during a lantern festival. It must be so beautiful at night."
Stunning light show,"This place is absolutely beautiful, most especially nice at night. There's a spot there where they have a laser light show set against sprays of water. It's really nice to take a stroll along the banks, and its history is also pretty interesting. "
A beautiful paradise in the heart of Seoul,"My hostel was located on the east end of Cheoonggyecheon. So I decided to walk all the way to the west end, which was next to Gwuangdaemun. I saw people riding bicycles, jogging or wondering around just like me. The water was so clean that I could see fishes swimming, and some fishes were quite big. The birds were flying around and hiding in those brushes. I felt so relaxed and spent the whole morning there. I would like to back for night time scenery next time traveling to Seoul."
Great for a romantic walk,"By day or night, this stream offers a great place to escape the city's hustle and bustle.You will find many people wondering around there, and some couple exhibiting, what the local refer to as: PDA (Public Display of Affection). I found this great.If you have time, this place is not to be missed, for sure."
Worth a look - people watch and crossing to Myeongdong,This is an easy walk from the palace on the way to Myeongdong and some time should be spent here. There is a Lantern festival whole of November so that's a bonus.
Must see place at night,This place is a must see place when you visit seoul especially at night. This place is near seoul city hall and city hall subway station. Many young people go this place at night to hang out whether with friend or with their couples. Often you will see a bazaar held in this place also music performance by locals.
A relaxing place in the city of action,"I went to this area for the lantern festival. I waited till night fell and the lanterns were lit. It was truly magical and romantic. Each lantern installation had its own theme, mostly based on Korean folk stories. The area was relaxing. There were volunteers guiding people. It was nice to breathe some fresh air in a city of fast action. "
"Over-hyped, but worth visiting","This stream is less natural than many think - water is pumped into it from elsewhere. Still, and despite lots of concrete, it makes a nice break from the crowded urban surroundings. Part of it is a wetland and it seems to have attracted quite a lot of wildlife considering where it is."
Lantern Festival,Went there because I heard that there is a lantern festival along the stream. Love the place so much.The latern display was good and the breeze to just slowly walk along the stream was relaxing.This is a great place to go once the shops closes at night.
A nice place for a stroll,"This is a nice place for a stroll and especially in November during the lantern festival. It is also a great landmark to help one find the way when walking around central Seoul, and it often helped us get back to our hotel in Myeongdong when walking up to areas in the northern part of the city. "
A very perfect place for a break,This place is definitely on top of my fave place in Seoul. The river is the best place to have a break after a long walk around Seoul or around the markets... Kekeke
Lantern parade in November,"I can say this is the first stop I did in Seoul. Despite the demonstrations that day, I found this quite nice because it coincided with the lantern parade where lantern and models showcasing Korea and other countries light up the stream. It is a nice walk through and ingenious idea of fusing urbanization and environmental consciousness. "
Interesting,"It is a pleasant walkway along the stream, specially in the evening. The lantern festival in November is an added attraction"
beautiful park,"We walked it during the day and saw the cartoon structures, but that Sunday night, City Hall plaza was packed with tens of thousands of people waiting in roped off queues just to be allowed to walk along the river to see the LED lit animals. I am not exaggerating. We decided to just walk along above to view it. Staggering number of families out late on a Sunday. A very well executed public park!"
Nice view,"Come here at night with lovers, family, friends, everyone can enjoy this view. Just don't forget to bring your camera."
Lantern Festival,"We went at night for the start of Lantern Festival. They had a ceremony with VIP seating and they got to walk along the river first. Down by the river was closed to the public for about 30-40 minutes, but you could still see well from on top. The first few lanterns on display were great, but then they had so many that were there as advertisements and we didn't enjoy them as well. Lots of street food and vendors."
Latern Festival,I went there during November while there is lantern festival. Beautiful lantern and creative activities available. It's very nice to walk and enjoy beautiful lantern.
Just Great!,"A much needed oasis in otherwise hectic city center. This is an example which other cities should follow. We found it very pleasant to follow the stream downwards watching fishes, art and other people taking a relaxing break near water. We even used paths along the stream as a way to our place. It gives one more than just walking along the streets."
Over rated,"Went here in the night to see the lanterns, but this was very over rated. It was ok to have seen it, but not something I will recommend to go to. "
Great idea,"It's a great idea to create a calm oasis in hectic part of the city. It is always a cool place when it is hot. It's a great place anytime, but it exceptionally cosy on weekends when families ramble there all the day, children jump over stone bridge and everybody smiles."
Nice side view,There have many side view along the river~ you can have some photographing along it. The lighting also very nice~
An inspiration,"What an effort...kudos to the Korean ingenuity for making a old river site into a clean, breathable, teeming with life....I am so envious of their nice rivers...."
1 of the highlight of my visit,We visited cheonggyecheon stream on the first day of lantern festival. We came right on time for the opening ceremony (after the governor's speech) which was fabulous. They had some laser & fireworks show. And of course we also got to see the lantern displayed along the stream. 
Just In Time for the 2015 Seoul Lantern Festival,Visit on November and you will witness more of the stream's beauty with the lantern display during the festival. Nice to stroll around and then head at Gwajang market for some street foo to taste.
Gorgeous Umbrellas and Lovely stream,Little stream made in such a beautiful way that I couldn't enjoy hopping around and have my own fun. It is something must see for people who come from outside. We heard Christmas Choir outside as we visited during December.
An evening walk on the way to dinner,"We happened to be in Seoul when the lantern festival was going on in the evening. Nice to see when it was dark since that was when the lantern lights came on. Good for taking pictures if you like lanterns.Daytime.. Well the lanterns will still be there, but without having their lights of course.but it is also a nice place to walk ..you can take the stairs down to the embankment and walk along the stream, if you wish to do do."
"Nice to take a walk along, not much else.","I visited twice on my travels to Seoul, once at night in the rain and once during the sunny daytime. Both times I was left a bit underwhelmed. I don't know what I was expecting but it just didn't have the wow factor I was expecting. It's a nice walk if you're in the area but there's not that much else to do there."
Stream of Peace,Get to dongdaemun station n get out n you will see dongdaemun gate n this stream.on normal occassion only some lights n a peaceful area but during xmas or in some festival it really lighten ur life.
Urbanized stream,Perfect place for a walk. Must see when in Seoul. At night it's all lighted up in magnificent colors. You can get good food by the sides of the stream and wonderful bars with good service. It gets really cold on autumn and winter! Be prepared.
Nice!,It is nice to see a stream in the middle of a big city.clean water and relaxing. Cant believe it used to be dirty water and sewage.
Nice Place,"Nice place to hike, roam around from sunny weather to cold weather, day or night. very close the dongdaemun fashion market. The environment is great especially in the night due to the light"
Cool place to walk,"The lantern festival just started today. Really cool lanterns, such as of the palaces and other tourist attractions. I liked it better than I thought I would. It's a unique thing to see. Check it out!"
Nothing very interesting,We passed by after having dinner nearby and took a stroll along it. Finds nothing very interesting about it.
We walked the entire thing (day and night),This was a nice spot to get a break from the energy of Seoul. We visited twice -- during free walking tours from the City of Seoul (both options) -- and then went back on our own at night. The Cheonggyecheon Museum was also very interesting.
Better at night,"Obviously, as the name goes, it is a stream, but it makes for an enjoyable walk. It is quiet, and at night the lights give it a different feeling, that during the day is lacking. Good though for a run outside the busy roads and streets."
Sunday walk,Perfect place to walk on a sunday afternoon....each side of the stream you will find restaurants and coffee shops for brunch or tea time.
A stream in the middle of Seoul...,"Cheonggyecheon is a stream that flows through the streets of Seoul, not far from other attractions... unfortunately there's not much else to say as that single sentence tells you all you need to know about the stream.If you're already in the area for different activities, it's worth a visit as a water feature in the middle of a busy day of sightseeing can prove to be relaxing, however, it's nothing you should plan your day around for.The stream is beautifully lit at night, though, and that may prove to be a better experience.If you're lucky enough to swing by during November (or any other festivals that may be going on) you would be treated to some beautiful decorations and festivities.But again... don't expect too much as this is still just a stream."
Better to see it in the morning,"We went there at night and it was just too dark. Although it was very refreshing to walk at the sidewalk and enjoy the calmness of the water. I think it is better to visit it in the morning especially if there are no events at night to make the place livelier.The stream is near the market where you can enjoy korean food such as kimbap, soondae (blood sausage), odeng (fish cake) and tteokboki."
Lovely place to visit on a cool Autumn night!,"I went here after visiting Changdeokgung Palace, InsaDon, and Gyeongbokgung Palace. I love the place and it's good that left this site for an evening visit. Yes, I have to admit, it was a bit cold but there are a lot of cafes around the area where you can get a good cup of coffee. You take it with you while you're walking around the place. I love the lighting in the stream. I also love the laser shows they have set-up as you walk further down the stream."
To escape from busy downtown,"If you are tired from walking on busy streets of the downtown, come here for a nice walk along the Cheonggyecheon Stream. "
"Nice for a walk, specially during lanterns festivals","This is an artificial stream in the very heart of Seoul City that is well kept and nice to go for a walk after dinner. It is particularly beautiful during the lantern festival, when a lot of lanterns are placed on the river for exposition!"
"Nothing much, just a man made stream","It's a stream with great historical memories. I joined the free tour conducted by Korea tourism but was very lousy.I booked for English guide but he could hardly speak English, he brought as to a Cheonggyecheon museum which was newly opened and he spent most of the time touring the museum on his own. Not much explaining and its a total waste of time.If you want to just go to the museum to understand the history and walk on your own."
River in the middle of landmark,"Near dongdaemun market, dongdaemon design plaza, and JW Marriot Seoul Hotel. Cool, quite and romantic river in the middle of city. how to get here, please go by subway or metro line 4 stop at dongdaemun station exit 8 "
Good place to people watch,"We rested here a bit after the palace and Gwanghamun square. It was a good immersion to the Korean population since a lot of locals spend their time here, some with family, some with lover.Take a stroll too, since this stream is a bit long. Don;t forget to make a wish at the head, too!"
Go to the stream plaza,I saw part of the stream that was near dongdaemun and it really wasn't very impressive. It was dirty and it didn't seem it kept up at all. The beginning of the stream the plaza is where everyone takes the nice pictures. If your are near go there and check it out and I believe they have a lantern festival so check out the visitKorea website when you are planning to go if you wish to see it. And like many other attractions in Seoul go in the evening.
Romantic setting for a stroll,"My husband and I spent about an hour walking along this stream one night. It wasn't very crowded, possibly because it was a little drizzly off and on. The setting is absolutely beautiful. There are a couple of murals on the wall and a laser show every 20 minutes over a little bridge in one area. It's really peaceful and romantic."
Small and long stream running in city centre,"We past by at night. We went down the stream but it was smelly. So not interested to walk along it. There are lights along the stream, it should be a nice place if it was cleaned."
Nice atmosphere,Nice atmosphere.You can walk along the stream and sometime it has lantern festival in every November.
A Great City Walking Stream,"On a Saturday evening as dusk starts to fall, I find myself walking with local friends showing me the famous Cheonggyecheon Stream in downtown Jongno-gu in Seoul.The place is a buzz with people of all ages enjoying the walking and art.The stream was created in 2005 as an urban renewal project to bring water, trees and art to the community.It is now a great success with many interesting displays of art in the stream, on its banks and interactive art works for the kids to enjoy.A great place to wander on a sunny day for a few hours."
Nice place. Relaxing,At first I find it hard to locate the stream since i was lost. It was a beautiful and relaxing stream. this is a very good initiative to convert such place into an attraction
Beautiful and relaxing ,Beautiful recreation and very relaxing area in the hurt of the busy city. You can do the a walking tour from the canal to the food market 
Must see,"I traveled alone and it was a very beautiful stream, like most things in Seoul. In the early morning you can see people go through their morning routines of walking to work or running for exercise. At night be ready for the sea of couples because it is a very romantic place to be at night, and while being solo wasn't bad, I'm positive the experience would have been amazing as a couple. "
"Cooling Place For Exercise, Chatting or Relax",Depends on your objective. You can just follow the stream and can lead you from Myeongdong to Dongdaemum. Very pleasant to walk and enjoy acoustic of the flowing water. Many staircase available for you to get up to road level and enjoy good food before continue your exercises. You may also choose to sit below the bridge to relax a bit and chatting with your friends. Remember to wear your comfortable walking shoe when you plan to do this. 
A beautiful / romantic night spot,A romantic spot to be at during the night with your loved one. The stream starts with a tiny waterfall feature with lights and flows downwards with more exhibits and lightings feature.
Love it!,One of the best place in Seoul. The water stream is so relaxing. I can never imagine there's a place like this within the Metro. Don't miss this.
Very nice at night,You can enjoy a long walk especially at night. Many people and couples... nice lighting along with water fall. In October they had some art exhibition. 
Great to visit both day and night!,"What a gorgeous concept to include in a city! Strolling along this renovated stream was one of my favourite things to do while staying in Seoul. The stream is full of young lovers, people walking to and from work, and there were even some musicians performing along the way. Go both at night and during dusk, it’s beautiful at both times in its own way."
Just a place,"nothing special to describe this place, just a nice place to take a rest after a long walking day. Too Dark, i think need to put more street lamps."
Quite pretty at night!,Do check it out if you are in the area during evenings. Pretty with the lighting and good for an after dinner walk.
Pretty & clean,It's so clean.pretty place.you can enjoy the beautiful lights at night.but this place is so crowded because the dongdaemun market and subway station are nearby..
Nice for a walk,"A very popular area to go for a walk, with an art exhibition in just recently. Perfect for an afternoon or evening stroll, not a quiet place as there are many people but good for a nice walk along the clean stream in the midst of Seoul. Great to go as a couple or also with the family. many cafes nearby as well as a lot of major attraction in its vicinity."
Romantic,"I visited the stream during a festival and I could not help but fall in love with my wife again. It is natural, yet it is well designed like a man-made stream. There are lots of art works in the stream. The most exciting part is that you can take a walk right besides the steam. I loved it"
great walk,fantastic idea for a nice stroll (day and evening) many happy people around and everything in central part of Seoul
Beautiful even during the day,We passed by during the day and thus did not see the wonderful lights but it was equally pleasant. The stream was nice to stroll along and relax.
Always something going on ,"I have visited Seoul 5 times since April 2014 and each time I have gone down to the stream as I find there is always something going on.Lantern Festivals, Buddha's Birthday Lantern Festival, tying yellow ribbons with prayers of them for the victims of the Sewol Ferry disaster and just recently modern figures made from old LP records.The people of Seoul enjoy this space as much as the tourist and it is always pleasant to walk beside the peaceful stream with the hustle and bustle of busy Seoul a few steps away."
clean well maintained stream,"This is near our 1st hotel so we walked to this stream early morning after breakfast. We had a good weather cold and breezy but not raining, we were able to take pictures of the stream with the artworks, and also the cute artsy benches that were there. I think everywhere in Seoul is just picture worthy, they always have unique stuffs for tourists. The stream is long and clean but it looks better at night with those lights. That's why I thnk many couples were there during the night cause they find it more romantic."
Urban oasis.,And to think that at one time this stream was covered up... This is now - after early 21st century project completion - a beautiful and unusually appointed urban space. Lovely place to stroll and relax. During our Seoul stay it housed a recycled art exhibit and on a sunny October day our stroll was breathtaking beautiful!
Great place to chill in evening,I came here after Gwanghwamun Square and Gyeongbokgung Palace. These place are in one area so you can reach all of them in the same day by walking to each other. Recommended!
Interesting stroll,"Found this restored stream by accident when exploring near our hotel and enjoyed viewing the art work. Morning visit and not too busy, hoping to return one evening to see it lit up. "
Getting Away from the Hustle and Bustle of Seoul,"This is a LONG stream that's situated below the roads of Seoul, and makes it an ideal walking path for many locals and tourists walking from one end of Seoul to another with exits along the journey. The stream was filled with many recyclable art which gives the stream a perception of urban lifestyle that may not necessarily be in sync with the serenity one would expect walking along the stream. I would highly recommend anyone visiting Seoul for the 1st time to take a walk to experience it."
Charming!,"When I read about this place before visiting it appealed but when I actually visited I was double what I expected. Evening hours would be best to visit this place but as mentioned in earlier reviews it could get crowded depending on the event happening around. We visited this place only once just a day prior to our departure. The walkway is very peaceful and is not open all day I think there are timings because when we went in evening the man was opening the doors to get down the stairs for walk close to the water. The falls inside, the spray paint and everything’s is lovely. Attractive place when the colorful lights are displayed!You can easily spend relaxing evening with your love."
A very relaxing Trip,Cheonggyecheon stream is a place that can we fulfill the leisure time...Besides is the place that need to visit when u traveling to KOREA....
Lovely little stream,"I really like this stream. Every time I come here, something different has been happening. Thai festival, recycling exhibitions, photography exhibitions etc. It is really pretty and nice to walk alongside. It is close to the Gyeongbokgung palace and other attractions."
Enjoy nature in city of Seoul,"It's got to be my favourite place in the entire city of Seoul. Agnes and I were there in the late afternoon, we strolled along the stream for 2 hours and enjoyed the stream set against the sunset. It is absolutely beautiful. You'll have to see it for yourself ^^"
A great place for a walk,"Through the hustle and bustle that is Seoul, you may want to get away from the insanity for a little bit. Cheonggyecheon stream provides that escape in the middle of a busy area of Seoul. You take a set of stairs down to the stream and it feels as though the world above simply melts away. During the annual lantern festival in February you can see many beautiful lanterns, both large and small, along the stream. The stream is within walking distance of the Museum of Art. "
Worth a stroll along the stream ,"Daytime or evening time, the Cheonggyecheon stream is worth a visit. The stream is well maintained and clean with clear water and quite a lot of fish. In the early days the stream was more used as a channel to discharge factory waste and was heavily polluted. Through their good efforts Seoul city managed to get a nice place to relax, away from the traffic, still close to various main areas of the city. At different times, entertaining musicians can be found at different places."
Quick tip as a local people,"I work just across the street from Cheonggye-cheon, and here are quick tips for 2-3 days tourists.1. If you are rushed by time, consider visiting here at night time. It's got a fine night view with lights on the buildings nearby.2. The stream itself is some miles long, but it's all artificial and the best part is the starting point.3. If you like tracking, you may consider walking through the stream from Gwanghwa-mun to Dongdae-mun, it would take about 30-40 mins normally.4. MOST IMPORTANT : Don't even try to get into the stream when it rains. The stream has a function of city sewerage for heavy rains, and it easily pours out especially in the summer.

One Small Stretch of an Urban Miracle,"At least four times per week, I ride my bicycle on the bike path that comprises the last few kilometers of Cheongyecheon before it runs into Jungnangcheon and finally the Han River. This path is but a tiny part of a huge system of recreational spaces in Seoul that may be unique in the world for their abundance, diversity of activities, and popularity. It's hard to say what I enjoy most about this--the bird life, observing the people of all ages and classes partaking of sports and fitness activities, the greenery, etc., etc., etc."
nice ballad in a peaceful place,"I used to live 5 years 10 minutes away from this reclaimed place. It used to be a horrible place, with an overpass and sewer nearby. But not it is entirely reclaimed and clean. You will see lovers walking along the canal, painters and dancers.. peaceful. If you are lucky you could see that the light festival,I believe in Spring and that is really nice at night. You can walk from Downtown to DongDaimum (outlets) using this trail. Nice 45mn walk without interruption, have a nice lunch there and come back by bus."
Stream in downtown Seoul that extends 11km in length,"Came to this stream to see the annual lantern festival throughout the month of November. Warning, it place does get really crowded, be sure to arrive early so you can be one of the first people to walk through the lower level of the stream area. Unfortunately, when I came, it was extremely crowded and the line to go toward the lower level stretched for miles. Eventually after 30 minutes of waiting, we finally decided to leave. You can get a couple great shots from the upper level. Along the upper level, there are food carts aligned all over. I purchased grilled octopus and cuttlefish as a snack. If you're in the area, be sure to try some!This steam features other types of advertisements once the lantern festival came to an end, including latest technology mascots, etc. I definitely enjoy walking here when it's less crowded in order to enjoy the sights and for a late night stroll."
"Beautiful in Fall, with the Chuseok Green Umbrella's up","I wished I had realised how close I was to the stream earlier. We didn't head here until the last day of our visit in Seoul. As it was Chuseok, they had the green umbrella's up and it was beautiful at night. We took a few awesome photos and the weather was beautiful! There were a few buskers around as well to lighten the mood..."
Go there on summertime and at night,We were here last February problem is we where there plants are not yet fully grown and it was daytime. We tried to go there at night but because we are staying at Yonsei University it is quite far around 45 minutes of train ride
Small but sweet creek,"When i was young, 청계천 was covered under concrete road. Over decades it's created to the very new landmark of city Seoul. I've witnessed all changes, newly made history. When i walk along side 청계천, i feel like time traveling. There are lots of cafeterias,restaurants,snack vendors, and constant events. You can enjoy relaxed break time in the midst of very busy city life."
A calm diversion in central Seoul,"A visionary mayor decided to make lemonade out of a lemon and turned what was once a dried up drainage ditch into a cool respite in Seoul’s frenetic city center. The start is near the city hall side of Seoul, where there is a grid of bubbling fountains - the water from which immediately drops, waterfall-style, to the actual water level of the stream.At no point should you mistake this for a natural setting. It is strictly a concrete construct but, nevertheless, it has its distinct charms. Up near the start of the stream there are more exhibitions and events, whereas downstream it is strictly utilitarian.With the concrete, shade and water comes coolness, which a definite plus when the temperatures become uncomfortable at street level. They’ve done their best to add elements of nature with shrubbery, river bed stones and schools of little fish. But, along with these things come pesky, gnat-like insects which will swarm you if you are near the water and stationary. So it’s not a good place to plan a leisurely, waterside lunch or romantic interlude.This stream is best enjoyed during a stroll along the concrete paths on either side, at night-time as well as daytime, although it can be enjoyed equally from street level, particularly at night or when there are special events.Taken for what it is – an urban renewal project – it is a perfectly nice place. It really shouldn’t be taken more seriously than that."
Chill out in downtown Seoul,Night or day it is a relaxed place to sit or stroll. Go up the steps and find bars and restaurants. The lighting at night in impressive 
"Nice waterfall sounds and flowing stream in the middle of a busy city, nice stopover but not on my MUST do list to see","Urban oasis, open air space below street level - a nice buffler from traffic noises. It was on our tour's brief stopover - nice on a cool evening or late afternoon for a stroll & to relax, but perhaps over-rated - and, could do without China mainland tourists running all over the place with their guides. It is cool but hard to compare with Golden Gate Park in SFO, Central Park in NYC or Rock Creek Park inside Washington, DC. A series of coffee bar/cafe and snack bars, perhaps with musicians performing and rotating art exhibits, etc. would be good to give this mini urban ""canal"" attraction an extra lift."
The centre of the city.....,A wonderful example for al of us. How to get back to nature. The benefits for the city are enormous and a delight.
Great area of Seoul,Lovely walks during the day and morning. Seoul at night offers a different perspective for the travelers.
Perfect for a stroll,"I can't believe a major city has something so pretty as this canal running through it! Walk along it in the late afternoon and you'll see heaps of people out strolling, maybe doing street performances etc. Just lovely atmosphere, in summer anyway, and it's near major shopping areas so probably not going out of the way to visit it. "
Unwind by the stream,"How a central water feature can enhance any city! This is also the case for this canal, inaugurated on October 1st 2005.We saw the stream in the day-time and there were people around (tourists, passers-by, office workers taking a break) and we saw it at night, all lit up, and it was even busier with couples and families enjoying a little rest and unwinding.The stepping stones and the wishing well are great fun and it was a pleasant rest from the busy city.Highly recommended for the ambiance.Try to see it in November if you can; we were told about a Lantern Festival then."
Nice walk in the middle of the city,Loved walking along this stream at night....lots of street musicians and the night is alive with all the people!
A very pleasant area.,This is a lovely area. A bit of peace and calm in the middle of the city. I visited on a Saturday so it was quite busy. We took our time and walked along a bit and sat and rested for a while. There are bridge crossings along the way. There are rocks making the water flow. 
Worth the visit ,"We dropped by before heading to the palace. It was great place for photo taking. Sit by the stream, it is quite relaxing & calming. There were cute umbrellas hanging above and some parts of the stream."
Get away from the city hussle and bussle without getting away from the city!,An unusual attraction in the middle of the 2nd largest city in the world. They just need to keep the grass trimmed more often!
Kimbab Picnic at the Stream,"My friend and I bought some kimbap and honey ddeok to the stream, sat on the wooden platform enjoying the autumn breeze while people watching. avoid the crowded sections of the stream and wander either ways; find your own spot and you will learn it's a great place to unwind amidst the hustle and bustle of dongdaemun."
Amazing little walk in the midst of Seoul!,We stumbled on this little gem while walking around the city and it reminded us of the San Antonio Riverwalk back home in Texas. It is a beautiful little project that the city developed and it was just lively enough at night to make it even more interesting!
"Walk the Stream and get 10,000+ steps","This stream runs through Seoul. The renovation project is successful because it creates a great ambiance to accessorize the stream. It is very enjoyable to walk along the stream. Walking along this stream in several different locations, I discovered that the stream reflects the ambiance of the specific area that it is flowing through."
"Slow down, exercise, and join the locals.","Slow down, exercise, and join the locals. Walk a few kms along this peaceful stream. If staying downtown, stroll for about 40 minutes to Dongdaemun Design Plaza."
Worth a visit,Pleasant walk along the stream with Murals and things to see. Fountains and coloured lights appear in the evening.
Nice stroll. Nothing exceptional.,"It's a walk along a small river. Probably better on Friday night/Saturday. You can see friendly locals, try street food and watch artists performances. Not a must do but why not if you have time."
Shows what can be done with care and thought,Just a wonderful place to stroll and experience and to be with real people. Folks strolling and sitting together. Kids running around and jumping the stream on the stones. Folks playing music. A beautiful walk that you can spend hours doing.
Oasis in the heart of the city,This little stream that runs through the city of Seoul is really long and we were only able to visit a small portion of it. Nevertheless it was a cool and refreshing pit stop for our family on a hot summer day!
Super pretty at dusk!,A nice place to wander with your SO. It goes from being quite 'wild' to ultra modern and lit up! There is a cool wishing well/ stone thing which could grant your wildest desires - should you get your coin in that is! A romantic place that is just below the roads - a nice pedestrainised part of the city.
Makes walking through the city a complete pleasure,"After discovering this stream we found ourselves adjusting our route just so that we could walk through this area more often. It is a marvelous feat of design that changes how the people of Seoul associate with their city. Instead of walking amongst grey concrete blocks and cars you are greeted with the sound of grasshoppers, running water and what is a very lush area. You'll find people scattered on the banks of the river just relaxing and enjoying their evening, something you will not find in many other concrete jungle cities. While this is not an attraction per se, the stream stretches some 11km and I would highly recommend walking by as you get to another attraction, especially if you're near the Myeongdong area."
Fabulous space,"This is a beautiful public space and well worth spending some time to talk a walk along the stream. Used by office workers to catch their lunch breaks, couples taking a Sunday stroll and the City to display beautiful lanterns during the lantern festival. This is a vibrant city space that is bustling and modern at one end and more peaceful and natural as you walk further along the stream. I love spending time here when I visit Seoul."
