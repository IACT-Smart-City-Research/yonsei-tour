climbing up to the top of the mountain was a challenge and great experience,"i highly recommend that this is a must do when in Songdo , the view from top of the lookout tower was breath taking as you watch down looking at the port and the city. you must do this."
"A good ""healing"" place","I joined temple stay program and stayed here two nights three days. If you want to stay away from busy city life, here would be a perfect place.I had sleep problem but surprisingly during my stay here I could have sound sleep. I don't know why.. I guess probably because of fresh air and healthy food. If you are interested in Korean style Buddism and want a peaceful time, I recommend you to visit here.What you can do-Comparing old and new types of Buddha statues-Having tea time with Buddhist monk-Joining morning or evening service-Walking around the walls (Interestingly this oldest temple in Korea is located inside walls that are know to be built by three sons of Dangun, legendary founding father of Gojoseon)-Enjoying beautiful trees and flowers (I saw many wild flowers I had seen in pictures)-Enjoying Korean traditional tea at the cafe Jukrimdawon.-Playing with cat"
Worth Visiting,"I visited Jeondeungsa Temple using the Free Korea Tour group the airport had provided. This one hour visit to the temple was fascinating. The colors, the architecture, the significance, all were very unique. Knowing its historical significance was interesting. The temple itself is located uphill. It's a very peaceful and quiet place. One can definitely do a lot of meditating here."
Old and serene temple,"Situated inside a small fort on a hill, the temple complex consists of a number of small halls in a serene wooded setting. There are some beautifully manicured trees around and I understand they also have accommodations for people wanting to stay for awhile. There is also a restaurant at the foot of the hill. Although not one of the more visited temples, it is pretty old and probably a better way to experience a serene Korean temple."
Peaceful place,The temple is uphill and quiet. If you are looking for a place to get away from noise and city headache then this place is highly recommended. I joined the temple stay program at Jeondeungsa temple which included 2 days and 1 night. It was an amazing experience and I will definitely go back again
Great place to visit.,This is a must place to visit if you have not been here before. Great Temple with a lot of beautiful buildings and sculptures.
Peaceful ,I went alone and I really enjoyed. This Buddhist temple is so beautiful and I just discovered u can stay there!
Nice place with a park around.,"Was visiting on our last trip to Korea, nice and quiet place, wasn't full of tourist. Nice walk through the park."
paradise,"I spent 3 nights at Jeondeungsa and was so sorry to leave. It was absolutely heaven for me and I highly recommend it. I did the free style Temple-stay and so I was up each morning at 4 for 4.30am prostrations (bowing ceremony) with the monks who were chanting. I loved every minute and found the chanting of the monks really touching, it was so beautiful. The monks didn't speak much English but there were guides and volunteers who did and who also translated when speaking with the monks - during some of the other ceremonies and when having tea with a monk.The peace and tranquility were simply wonderful and I highly recommend this place, it has had a profound impact on me."
Wonderful temple,"This temple is a wonder. You enter the real Korean spirit with typical buildings, well decorated in a sober but wonderful way.The entrance is free as almost everywhere in Korea!"
Nice for a slow walk in the morning!,"I'm not religious or anything, but this place made me feel pretty calm and peaceful. There's a temple themed cafe on the way up!"
Great retreat and insight.,"I did the one-night temple stay, which was absolutely worth it and I would consider going again for longer. Our group did have several children which made it a bit difficult to concentrate, and as our group was mainly Korean, all English speakers were given small headsets for a translator to talk through. The temple itself was beautiful and the rooms were clean - though you will be sleeping on the floor. The food included was delicious, and the activities made even the 4am wake up call seem less difficult. Highly recommended! Our translator was lovely, though when he wasn't around we were left in the lurch as no one tried to help up or show us what to do."
Amazing place,Amazing temple surrounded by gardens and other buildings. We visited in September when the weather was lovely and enjoyed walking around the grounds. Traditional Korean site. Not crowded. Lovely coffee house on the grounds where we stopped afterward.
relaxing templestay easily reached from Seoul,"I chose to do the ""free-style"" relaxing 1 night/2days templestay in this temple. You can also do longer ones and more organised ones. The temple ground area is quite big and lies on a tree covered hill which is great for walks or quiet contemplation. The place is quite busy with visitors during the day, but quiets down after 6pm. I had a room with bathroom and hot shower to myself for which I paid 60'000 won.You sleep on the floor with various korean style mats. The vegetarian food I had in the canteen together with the with my interpreter and other employees of the temple. My guide/interpreter showed me briefly around and taught me the bowing ritual. In the morning I attended the 4-30 am chanting and bowing ceremony for half hour. Breakfast was at 6am. After that I was free to do what I wanted. At 9 am was a chat with a monk over tea. The temple can be reached via public bus transport from Seoul Sinchon. First you take bus M6117 to Gimpo transfer center then take bus 60-2 or bus 700 to Onsuri bus stop. You then need to walk for about 20 minutes to reach the temple grounds. On the way there are lots of cafes and tourist shops. Also inside the temple grounds is a cashpoint in case you need money !! It is quite a commercial place during the day, but also very beautiful and relaxing in the evening. I really enjoyed my stay here getting a tiny insight into temple life in Korea."
"It is very beautiful, full of colorful flowers",One must go for it. It is one of the Korean traditional cultural places.It has a garden as well where you will find various colorful flowers and trees.Very nominal entrance fee.
Aiport free tour,We visited this temple during our transit in Incheon. The temple was OK; I probably wouldn't have visited it if not for the free tour.
Beautiful,It is a beautiful temple. You should take some time to check this place out in your next trip. We really enjoy to this place. 
Nice place for Spirit ,"During winter, we have visit this nice and typical place in Incheon. The entire area was covert by snow. Many spirits inside. The paints around roofs are awesome. "
Quite ... But far,"The temple is 2 hours driving from Seoul, nevertheless if you have spare time to visit the island it is a good half day tour, as you can combine with Gwangseongbo and a god BBQ lunch close by.The temple itself is very nice and not that crowded, what makes it good for relax and good pictures."
a quiet and peaceful place...,Booked a van on a Paju (near DMZ)---> Jeondeungsa Temple ---> Ganghwa-do tour....Saw banners there on temple stays as well... Beautiful 15min walk uphill to reach the temple.No words can describe how i felt... See pictures attached... =D
Nice place,"Big temple, quiet. Take the bus 2 from terminal bus of Ganghwa. Stop at the middle of the road ( you can say Jeongdeungsa to the bus driver) and enter by the south gate. Unfortunately, we missed the bus stop and we enter by the east gate: not so easy !! You have to climb the road. To return to seoul, we have a bus 3100 from here."
A quiet respite in the mountains,This temple is close to the city of Incheon. It's quiet and pleasant and pretty. The food is delicious! A visit to Jeondeungsa is a great way to spend a weekend.
Temple with a rare form of sanctum,"C1 ( 2013.06.03 ) There was a old temple with beautiful landscape. This temple was not big, not small, and had history about 1,300 years old. The overall shape and appearance was not unusual, but main sanctum was unique. Modern form of internal facilities andmModern paintings on the wall was interesting. If you want to feel the atmosphere of a quiet Buddhist in Korea,make sure to visit"
great 2 hour tour,"We took the $10 two hour tour of the nearby temple just to get out of the airport and see something of the country. It wasd a wonderful little trip. The van was clean and comfortable with a nice guide. The temple was colorful and quite interesting, especially with the explanations. Well worth the time and a bargain for the price."
Beautiful location but little else,This temple is located in a beautiful area that when you travel to the top of the grounds you can see over the temple buildings and hills across to the modern skyscrapers of Seoul. It is a beautiful contrast. The program is in the typical Korean rushed way in that you see and experience many parts of temple life but are given too little time at most areas to really relax and enjoy the experience. Also your only drinking water outside of the lunch and dinner meals is an outside fountain with the communal ladles. It also freezes in the cold. There is a vending machine but there is not water available in it. Also coffee is only from vending machine. Please bring a couple of bottles of water. Most of the buildings you are in are quite new as are the buildings you sleep in. Super nice bathrooms were an unexpected surprise.
temple stay,Temple stay is also good for mental health i thinkthere are 3 days or 5 days program for temple stay . once you experiencethis program i am sure you will endure all suffer time with hope
Fantastic for a templestay,"Templestay experience at Jeongdeungsa can become a perfect memory of any trip to Korea. Thjs temple is a gem hidden in the mountains very close to Seoul (around 60km from city center). Everything is well arranged for foreigners. If u do a templestay program you will be accompanied with a translator who helps with basic rules and orientation and even teaches you how to bow, etc.This is just a magical spot to watch sunsets and sunrises in the mountains and the temple itself is beautiful and defenitely worth seeing even if you are just visiting and not staying overnight."
close to visit from Seoul,"you can see the sea and moutain. quiet place where you can feel the recent history of Korea, before open frontiers"
Ok but nothing special,One of the main attractions here and interesting but nothing special
Fabulous,"Very much worth the visit. It is a bit out of the way, but getting here is part of the benefit."
