Good memorial,When we came here the park was open but the tourist things were closed. You can still walk up to the top and see the monument which we did. The toilets are still open too (big fan of all the clean toilets in Korea). At this time as it was closed we parked outside the main entrance but it looks like had this not been the case that you could drive to the top.
"Good museum, nice grounds and its free","Well worth a visit, been 4 times with different people since my arrivsl in Okpo April 2019.Its a lovely walk to get therr from Okpo harbor front, but you can drive there and theres plenty parking. The grounds offer nice views of Okpo bay and the surrounding countryside and contain a temple shrine dedicated to the Korean naval general Yi, a hero of Korea whose tatics defeated an invading Japanese fleet in 1592. The museum is also dedicated to this war effort and whist most info plaques are in Korean there are enough in English also for foreigners to be able to understand what it is all about.This is a must do if you enjoy learning about wartime history."
Its a great walk to this event from the Okpo harbour front,I have been to this place 4 times since arriving to Okpo in April with numerous friends and family. Its a lovely walk to the place from the Okpo Harbour front. The museum is free to enter and there is enough written in English to be able to understand what its all about. Basically it describes the courageous and inventive naval war tactics of a Korean General YI in 1592 when he defeated an invading Japanese war fleet. There are some nicely built 1/6th scale models of the 2 main types of Korean warships below a lovely traditional Korean Shrine built in respect of the Hero General Yi.The grounds alone are very well kept and there is ample parking space should you decide to go by car instead of the walk from the harbour.
An exciting walk,"Nice stroll along boardwalk, but be warned some of the paths are like going on a serious hike. Take water and rest regularly"
A nice walk from Okpo at the weekend,Nice walk along the Boardwalk and then up through the tress. Interesting sight with good photo opportunities. Walk back to Okpo along the main roads followed by a relaxing drink to cool down
very good memorial site,very interesting park with a lot of history about the Korean admiralthat fought against the Japanese invasion 
With great pride to history,This is an open history book located near to the seaside. You may arrive with car from the highway or walking from Okpo down town from the forest's side. the view is extreme nice and do not miss to share a soup of noodles and a cup of coffee from the local kiosk!!!
Lovely place to walk around,The victory memorial is a beautifully maintained memorial. There is a museum which you can visit. It's open from about 10 to 1700. But after hours you can still visit the park. It's about 3.8kms from okpo. Lovely walk throughout. There is a hiking trial too which starts at the bay and goes till victory park entrance and you can continue on it to go to the beach. 
nice hike,"if you don't have time to get out of the city of Okpo, and is only there for a couple of days and wanna see something before you go home this is the place. Its a very nice hike with stunning views from the coastline towards DSME. it take a couple of hours depending on how fit you are, then youre back again. if its very hot bring water."
A beautiful walk along the shoreline and up the hills from Okpo,"Start the walk from the end of the fisher quay and walk along the shoreline and ridge. The scenery is magnificent. Bring with you plenty of ware and some some snacks, as there is no place to buy before you actually enter the park.The park itself is on several levels, ending up at the top with the monument of Yi Sun-sin, the great hero of Korea, beating the Japanese fleet. The the road back to Okpo, and you will find small places to relax."
good hike,"Is a good hike to the site, lots of stairs so not for the faint of heart.interesting way of climbing stairs to see temple"
Interesting park with stunning views,"The views are beautiful and the park has some interesting monuments and is a walk from the centre of Okpo, mind you the walk is very steep."
A Monument about Korean history,Only few western people know enough korean history and it becomes even more true when visiting this monument.This place pays tribute to an old Korean Naval Hero Yi Sun-shin who with his men thought against tyranni and potential Japanese occupation.
Sunday walking.,We followed the mountain path from Okpo to the park. It was very beautiful and relaxing walk. The Park is very nicely made and maintained and the monument there is huge. The view is also very beautiful. It's worth the time to be there 
Interesting spot,I wouldn't make a day out of visiting this but its worth a visit if you're in the area. Its a good spot to just chill out at or have a picnic after doing an activity. It's an interesting memorial area and its always very well kept
Came across this gem by accident,"I was walking in the fine late winter weather hugging the coast and happened across this attraction. I paid my 1000won and wondered this small museum, shrine and memorial. It was a little gem and provided about 90mins of an interesting afternnon diversion. It commemorates a sea battle in 1580 or so between the forces of Admiral Yi and the Japanese. The museum gives insight into the vessels, tactics, weapons and tech of both sides. Interesting and surprising, well worth a visit. "
Nice view,"Starting from Okpho Port by the walking way close to the sea, almost 4kmto go and you arrive at the place. the view is really nice, quiet and clean.feel relax."
Nice to see and learn a little history,"I went after hours, so I was unable to visit the museum and temples, but I did wander the grounds and visit the monument atop the hill, and it was all nice enough, but I don't think anything would really be worth paying an entry fee for."
Beautiful park during sping blossom,"I walked from Okpo city, tok the path thru the woods, it is a nice walk if you like to walk.it is just a short drive from Okpo til the park by car.It was a sunny day and all the spring flowers where on the most beautiful. i met a kindergarden in the park and learned them a few english words, realy nice kids. the shouted after med every time the saw me, ' hello jane, nice to meet you*...It is really interesting learning about the history of Korea and janpan and the war.i relly love this park and have been there several times during the year, but I have to say, that I love most to be there during spring blossom."
Good place to be .,Had a good time walking around the area. Be prepared to climb up the stairs to visit the site. There is a windmill and an aptly called Windy Hill among other sites. Windy Hill isn't to be taken lightly. Hold onto your hat. Lots of photo opportunities with various views of the ocean and rocks.
