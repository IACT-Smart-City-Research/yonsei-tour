Gwangju Art street,Went there on a weekend and shop owners tried to attracted people with some minor street art. The roat itself should be usually car free and you can walk easily. However we were not exited at all and we left after short time. Juniors were bored ......
Completely over-hyped,"Yes there is a street. Yes, there are a handful of shops selling traditional ink brushes and other implements. There are even a few art galleries with either traditional painting or modernistic works on display. More eye-catching perhaps are shops that appear to be random collections of junk.Then there's a row of sculpture that frankly is rather blah.In between these shops are coffee bars and shuttered shops.All in all, don't bother unless you're determined to buy something."
Fun to go when there is a festival,Is a street with little shops and art galleries. Perfect to walk on a sunny Saturday. A good place for the kids to paint and do some art work.
Not worth the trip,"Visited, nothing was going on, a few arty kind of shops but a lot of dead space. Other people wandering around seemed equally unimpressed.Looks like a failed venture from my experience. "
"undeground shopping bazaar, cafes, street food.","A short distance from the Asia Cultural Centre lies a giant web of shopping and food. An underground shopping bazaar, while on street level more shopping, cafes, restaurants and street food, nor forgetting money changer counters when you need them. Somewhere here there is also a cat cafe for those who like cats. Street art is also there in some of the streets. If your legs are weak, or you are not into shopping, this may not be your cup of tea. One oddity is across the fountain near the National Asian Cultural Ctr.. Trees whose trunk and branches are wrapped in wool knitting.Nearest subway line is Geunmanro4-ga Station"
Not worth a visit ,"If you happen to pass through this street, it's ok, but don't take a detour for it. Maybe we got unlucky, but on a Sunday most stores were closed (or maybe they actually closed down?) and there was nothing going on. Better do your shopping in Insadong, Seoul."
Cool Spot ,"Did not know what to expect when we visit this spot. But it turned out to be cute. Very close to the shops area. The place has several cute caf√© to sit back and relax. It is not as bad as other review really. Although this place has several english classes, communicating can still be very very VERY challenging. Expect the same for any spot around Gwangju. "
Fake of Insadong,"Because I live in Seoul I always compare other cities to Seoul.Gwangju is not a tour site, and there are only a few memorial, or historical monument, so I don~t think It's a good idea to visit Gwangju.If you are travelling Jeunlado, then just visit Haenam,Jeonju, Damyang , Suncheon and Yusoo.If you like trekking, Jili Mount will be good.That's all."
Lots of shops,"Looked at previous reviews and was a bit wary of checking it out, but it was close to the downtown core so we went anyways. Found lots of shops there, but they all sold pretty much the same goods. It was the friendly shop owners who really made it fun. Try and communicate in a language other than your own and it seems they throw discounts at you. The trick is to smile!"
more like the street of art schools,"While my friends and I walked down it all we saw were art schools. A bit of graffiti but not too much other than that. We thought there would be arts and crafts for sale, art galleries and the like (well, one school had a viewing area) but there wasn't much."
Not quite Paris,"The Gwangju tourist authority will have you believe that the street of art is a kin to Monmarte in Paris and although it is not without its charm this is a little wide of the mark. The street is easily reached from the main shopping area of down town Gwangju and is worth a stroll if your in the area. The renovated street is home to several commercial galleries along with four or five art supply shops and a few cafes. If you catch it on a good day there is plenty to do and see, but these days are hard to predict and few. Art Street certainly provides a welcome counter balance to the crazed shopping crowds just five minutes away and the small shops offer some interesting Korean souvenirs such as calligraphy brushes."
