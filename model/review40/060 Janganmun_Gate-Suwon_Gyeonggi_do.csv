Great to see as part of the walls walk,Great to see as part of the walls walk. Start at the Palace and go counter clockwise. The round-trip us about 6km and takes 2-3 hours with stops.
North Gate,This is the northern and main gate to Hwaseong fortress. An impressive gate and associated pavilion and watch towers. Part of the 5km circuit of the fortress walls.
Impressive,"The gate looks quite impressive from both the inside as the outside of the walls, although I have to say I liked the Paldalmun gate more."
The main gate of Suwon Hwaseong Fortress,"After passing this gate, you can get inside of Suwon Hwaseong Fortress and reach Hwaseong Hanggung Palace.I guess this gate is bigger than any other gates in Seoul. It's good to visit and learn history & architecture.- Connected to Hwahongmun(Buksumun) to the east.- Walking through the wall outside is also nice.- It's a rare case to build the main gate on the north. That's because the king had visited from the north."
Very impressive old gate for a 18th century fortress,"You can walk thru and around this impressive example of late 18th century fortifications. There are cannons, quarters, archery slots, and lots of stonework. I've walked this section of the wall twice and each time stopped and marvel at the construction. Very cool architecture, aand would have been very difficult to attack."
Icon of Suwon,Janganmun Gate is part of the Suwon city wall that travelers could start here to walk around the wall to have a look of the city.
Beautiful spot on Suwon city wall,"We visited Janganmun Gate when walking around Suwon city wall. It's beautiful, and you can get great photos of it from a bit further back along the wall."
Watch out for the traffic,"Janganmun Gate is above the road that passes through the fortress so be careful if you decide to cross the road. It is the min gate to the old fortress and ""jangan"" actually means capital. It is considered the main gate as this is the gate that the king would come through when arriving from Seoul."
One of the mighty Hwaseong fortress main gates,"It was interesting on our hike along the 5.52 kms long fortress wall how the architecture of all the structures were unique and individual. Janganmun Gate was constructed in the 18th year of King Jeongjo's reign between February and September 1794 and in stunning condition. There is easy access on and off the gate via a staircase, outside the wall we could see a neighbourhood worthy of exploration, to discover local food, had we had more time."
Main gate of the Fortress,The main gate of the Fortress. Brightly colored painting. Walk up to get a good view out to the coty
Impressive,This is the north gate to the fortress and is quite impressive due to it's size.The whole complex is well looked after.
Very Big Main Gate of Suwon Hwaseong Fortress,Janganmun in one of the main gate of Suwon Hwaseong Fortress. It's a very big one which located on the opposite side of Paldalmun Gate. It's very nice in the night time. The opposite side the this gate is the area of food & restaurants.
Beautiful structure to discover if you take time,"Most visitors I saw took to the gates but if you climb up the fort and enter the structure above, you will be rewarded with murals and colorful paintings. There are some parts that you need to take off your shoes if you want a closer look but generally observing from the distance is good enough."
It's good to go through the gate building.,"I could go inside the gate building and it seemed like to participate this fortress system. If one has a plan to trail a half path of fortress, this gate seems the good point to start and finish at Paldalmun, the south gate, where are lots of food stores and shops."
Gate,Part of the whole fortress. Nice spot to take pictures. There are more around the whole area. History
weekend visit,As part of my weekend visit. When walking around the Fortress this is one of the gates. It is wonderful. Please go and take pictures.
Part of the whole area.,The whole area is worth to go. There are four gate and it is fun to visit every one of them. Walk is not too physical.
Average ,Palaces in South Korea are not that impressive. But however it's a good place to visit for a day trip. It's should not be the only place to visit. It's better you plan some other place along with visiting this place. 
north Gate of Suwon Hwaseong Fortress,"There are 4 gates in the fortress, North, South, East and West. It is worth it to see each gate as they differ from each other. These are the entrance ways into the fortress during the old days. The current King still visits the fortress several times a year. It has beautiful grounds and the views are really good from the top of the hill."
Wonderful walk trip,"It is very nice place for easy breezy long walk, the wall is very long. U can take your kids with you, let them try bow shooting (it was free and tutored!) Nice views, very Korean... "
An impressive gate but not the best part of the Fortress in my opinion.,"""Janganmun Gate"" is the northern gate of the historic Suwon Hwaseong Fortress, it also serves as the main entrance. 'Jangan' means capital, and it carries the meaning of being a secondary capital. Janganmun Gate is considered the main gate because this is the direction that the king would come from when arriving from Hanyang, the capital city. It is interesting to note that this gate is larger that the Sungryemun Gate in Seoul.I only saw the gate from atop the battlements as I came upon it from walking along the fortress wall from the direction of Hwaseomun Gate to the west. It is an impressive gate and well worth a visit, however in my opinion I prefer the Hwaseomun Gate and also the Hwahongmun Watergate."
The largest gate of the 4,This is another gate to the fortress. I personally preferred Padalmun but this was nice and we took several photos. Just outside of it many buses got to the Suwon train station at all times. It was convenient as a last stop for us.
Biggest gate.,"Suwon fortress have 4 main gate, Janganmun is North side main gate and biggest gate in Korea."
