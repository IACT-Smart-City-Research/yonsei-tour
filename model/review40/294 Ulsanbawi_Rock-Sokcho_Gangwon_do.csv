Amazing place to hike,"I went in November and I thought it would be really cold, but the weather on the mountain was so nice I had to take off my hoodie and wear my tank top to hike! The hike up to Ulsanbawi takes around 2-4 hours depending on how fit you are; it took me around 3 because we went slow. The mountain looked beautiful even with its leafless trees & I would love to go back to hike here again. Please be advised though: the hike is rather strenuous and you need to be at a relatively fit level to be able to hike to the top!"
Worth it ,This is the best hike in the whole park but warning it is very tough and you need to be fit to do it 
Good hike GREAT VIEW,The hike up was really tiring for a good 1.5 - 2 hours (upwards) but well worth as this is not a very touristy place (you'll find yourself hiking amongst mostly locals). Go early so you don't have to squeeze w everyone else when going up and when you've reached the top. We started at 9am and would say the crowd was moderate - we did have to wait a few minutes before our turn to take photo w the rock ，
Spectacular Crag,The light plays on the white rocks all day with changing angles and intensities. This is a spectacular formation set in an amazing landscape.
Fantastic ,"The path is okay, it starts easily and gets more exhausting when approaching the peak. As a sportive person it is absolutely feasible, it took us 1.5h to reach the peak. The view was stunning! I would recommend to start as early as possible. We began at 8 am and there were only few people, when we hiked down after a looong break the path was very crowded!! After that we climbed up to Geumganggul cave, the path is more difficult but less exhausting and the view was even more beautiful than ulsanbawi and less crowded. So do ulsanbawi early to avoid the crowds and continue with Geumganggul, if you want to seize the day :) "
Unforgettable hike,"This hike is an absolute must when visiting Seoraksan National Park. The hike takes about four hours back and forth. The hike starts easy enough walking trough a beautiful forest on good trails, but it gets strenuous after you've passed Heundeulbawi Rock. From then on the path leads you straight up so many stairs that I lost count. But the view after conquering this climb is so rewarding that you'll forget all your suffering in a heart beat.The Ulsanbawi rock formation is gorgeous, but you need to be a a good condition to get there."
Great 4 hours round trip hike,"Ulsanbawi Rock is a unique rock formation composed of six granite peaks. One needs to be of general fitness to do this round trip hike of 4 hours. The initial trail is relatively easy, walking along the forest on big gravel rocks, boardwalk and stairs. After about an hour, I arrived at the famous Heundeulbawi Rock and had a 15 mins break for snacks and drinks.From Heundeulbawi Rock to Ulsanbawi Rock, the slope gets relatively steep. The majority of the trek is made up of steps, and the steeper stone sections come with ropes while the steel steps come with handrails. I needed to my arms to pull myself up from this point onwards. I finally arrive at Ulsanbawi Rock after hiking 1 hour 45 mins from the base. To reach the summit, I had to queue for about 15 mins along the narrow stretch, just to take photos of the flag and the rock indicating 836m.At the summit, one is rewarded with spectacular view of Seorak Mountain. There were many local hikers resting in the open space to have their meals as well as enjoying the view. The weather was perfect, clear blue sky with some clouds adding texture to the background. I spent 45 mins at the summit before my descent. Overall, it was an enjoyable hike, though tiring."
"I'm 65 and managed it, but it was tough!","Just want to comment on difficulty. I am a 65 year old man, in decent, but not great, shape. The walk was strenuous, especially the last 0.6 km. Uphill on either steps or a rock path. By the time I reached the top, I was quite pooped. But glad I did it. For someone younger in good shape it shoud not be that hard. For someone older or in poor shape, it will be a challenge. Also, I did it in April, so it wasn't very hot.Show less"
Fantastic view,"We decided to climb up Ulsanbawi even though it was rated ""advanced"" on KTO website. We were glad we did because the climb up was great and the view even better. It wasn't not difficult as there were proper tracks and stairs although some parts were rocky steps. The difficult part was probably the energy and endurance to keep walking and climbing. But it was worth it. "
quite challenging going up unless you are fit,"The last .8 km seemed to take forever. Be sure to go early if you wish to avoid the crowds. Got there just after 7am, taking pictures before really starting out on the course around 7:30am (on Wed 10/24). Total trip time ~4 hours. The crowds started coming in when I went back down."
Bring gloves and hiking sticks and hike in the morning,"From the top of Ulsanbawi, you can see Sokcho and the East sea on the east, and the rest of Seoraksan on the west. Personally, the Sokcho side isn't very interesting (go to the Sokcho observatory if you want to see the city), so it would be better to see the other side -- which means you have to go there in the morning so that the sun shines on the mountain and not behind them.However, if you go in the afternoon, the view isn't bad either. You can get nice pictures with the sun setting behind the mountains. The observation deck along the way also gives a really good view (and better pictures, I think, than at the top!) so make sure to visit that.There are lots of comments here about how steep the stairs are. Though they did take effort to climb, I didn't find it too difficult (and I don't exercise that much!). The metal handrails helped a lot to keep me balanced, but they do get hot on sunny days. Bring gloves even during summer; otherwise, you might have to crawl your way up!A big chunk of the trail is also composed of stone stairs. If you have hiking sticks, they'll come in handy in this part of the trail."
Tough hike but worth the view,It took us roughly two hours to get up to the Ulsanbawi Rock. The climb was honestly quite brutally tough with steps up all the way. Need to wear hiking shoes with proper grip as there are quite a number of rocky steps. But the view up there is worth it. It was rather cloudy when we arrived at the rock but during the climb we could see awesome views of the rocky mountain ranges. Very gruelling and satisfying hike haha.
Absolutely stunning Ulsanbawi - must wait for a sunny day,"It was down pouring in Sokcho the night before we planned to go to Seoraksan NP. In the morning the rain stopped, the sky started to clear up but was still cloudy and hazy. We decided still taking the 35 mins bus ride (bus 7 or 7.1) to Seoraksan to do other treks (plenty 2-4 hours treks to choose from) on that day, then go back the next day for Ulsanbawi. Admission fee to the NP is only 3,500 won, well worth to pay twice.This turned out to be a wise decision because the next day we were rewarded with awesome views all the way up and at the top. We had read enough ""warnings"" beforehand but found that the Ulsanbawi trek is not particularly difficult, it just has endless rocky stone steps and a long series of steel steps. The steps aren't really high and quite a lot of flat wooden steps were placed between stone steps to make it easier to walk and balance. My advice is to keep a constant pace and just think of one step at a time, don't worry about how much more to hike. Anyway you will stop a lot on the way to soak in the great scenery. On a clear day the view is getting better and better when you go higher and higher. The majority of the trek is made up of steps, and the steeper stone sections come with ropes on both sides while all steel steps come with hand rails, thus, walking poles aren't essential. Hiking boots with good cushioning would be helpful but running shoes would do the job. The top offers 360 degree of wonderful views of the surrounding mountains; valleys, flat lands, and interesting outcrops. Near the top and the top is extremely windy, a wind breaker would be helpful. Watch out and don't let the crazy wind blow away your caps / hat, phone or camera. Fortunately there are plenty of hand rails to hold onto.One last important advice - go as early as possible. Ulsanbawi is every popular and the top is quite narrow. No fun to bump into so many other trekkers. We started around 8.30am, stopped by the balancing rock (not that interesting), the small grotto (worth a short visit), the viewing platform (fantastic), then reached the top before 11am. There were only a handful of people there so we pretty much had all the wonderful views ourselves. Go even earlier if you can."
Rough hike but very worth it!,"The first bit of the hike is very deceiving as it is paved! Then you get to the dirt and gravel and you still have no idea what you are getting into. Then the rocks aka stairs start and 2 hours later you are at the top. How could 2.2km possibly take 2 HRs?? Easy, crazy rocky uneven stairs that go straight up. I would say this is on par with the Incline in Colorado Springs, CO, US. Except you have to come back down the stairs and your legs are hello by that point. Take plenty of water and snacks for the top! "
Good hike ,Good hike with our 10 and 12 year old. Four hours with the last 90 mins a steep climb. We were lucky with the weather with beautiful views at the top. Well worth the effort. 
Amazing rock formation,"Most people who visit the park like to see Ulsanbawi Rock, a huge granite rock formation rising above the forest. There is a 4 km trail from the entrance but it is hard work to get there. In fact there is a viewpoint about 500 m before you reach there and you can get a good view from there, if you are too tired to continue climbing."
Site at Seoraksan,"I believe bawi means rock. This is the last rock on the trail. A lot of people seemed to stop at Heundeul rock, probably because the trail is rough with many many stairs. I went this past Sunday and the day was cloudy and rainy so when I got to the top I didn’t have the fantastic view that I’m sure others had, But I enjoyed the trek nevertheless. I suggest getting an early start as this seems to be a popular attraction."
Breathtaking view from the top,"breathtaking is really ""breath taking""....to reach there there is pathway and stairs around 3 km from the entrance, the hard part was the last 1 km using stairs with approximately 20 degree inclination....took us around 1 hourThe wind on the way up is very high and we keep on holding handrail...:DBut....it is ""worthed and paid off with the beautiful panorama"".... "
Exhilarating climb up,The first part is not difficult but the latter part is much harder with steep steps and rocks. A beautiful exhilarating climb. The weather was very pleasant on the weekday we were there and the trail was not particularly busy.
It's the climb,"The trail is a series of wooden steps, rocks and steel staircase. It was so windy when we went there and most of the people are backing out. Make sure to bring jackets and mask. The view is stunning and is worth the sweat going up. I will definitely come back next time, and finish the trail."
Gotta do it,Fantastic walk. First 2/3 are very easy last part after temples is a challenge but so worthwhile. Lovely area. Not too crowded. 
Worth it.,"I've been looking forward to hike Ulsanbawi Rock during my Autumn trip since I was not able to do it during my first trip. So I planned to wake up very early in the morning so that there won't be much of a crowd but ended up hiking a little bit late. I started at 8am and reached the peak at 10am. That 2 hours hike consists of picture taking, breaks and strong wind. The view was worthy of every steps in that staircase."
The hike is worth it,"Though tiring, the hike up and down is definitely worth it in exchange for the view you get to see when you are there.Tip: Pack some snacks and water in your bag to keep yourself hydrated during the hike as there is no store or eatery along the way."
Staircase to heaven,"If you go to see the temple with the balancing rock, the path beyond gets steeper and heads for the Ulsanbawi Rock. The path is so steep that it becomes a stairway ... I never got to the top as I was recovering from a broken pelvis ... the steep stairway was just too much but i got within 400m of the top. There is a nicē viewing platform on the way up. I would advise bringing a stick or nordic pole; would be very handy."
average,"only rocks and temple, not so interesting. I should have hiked to another top instead. It is 3.5km far from the starting point. So better choose another path."
Suspended between mountains and sea,Amazing view but many tourists. It is a nice hike for people used to some sport as there are many many stairs to get up to the peak
We went until the top,"It seemed like we were the first family climbed up until the end of the top. Local hikers were kind and nice although we can't understand what they said mostly. One thing, must be very careful to climb up with young kids. The staircase area at later stage is with many big gaps."
Would i climb again? DEFINITELY!,"4 - 5 hours back and forth to get to the peak. Trail starts with wide, smooth steps, then the path becomes smaller and rough. Once you reach the Heundeulbawi Rock, you are only 1km away from Ulsanbawi Rock. Thought it was easy-peasy, but was so wrong! It was the longest, toughest 1km of my newbie-hiker life! (Hahaha!) There are handrails and ropes to hold on to, but steps are uneven.Brought a liter of water, light jacket, camera phone and battery pack. Would be wise also to bring an umbrella, some parts of the climb are rainy. Would I do the climb again? Definitely! View is spectacular!"
Get coffee on the top and enjoy the view!,"Great choice, takes about three hours. The first two thirds of the walk are quite easy, but the last part is basically just stairs up the rock - but definitely worth the hike! Beautiful view! "
"Difficult hike, worth the effort!","The first part of the hike is noisy. You don't ascend that much for the first 3 km. But then the stairs (stone and wooden) start and you go up really fast. But it is totally worth it!The return hike starting at the entrance will take 4 hours. Take enough drinking water when it is a hot day.If it is rainy, don't let it stop you. We went on a rainy day and it was still very nice!How to get there: bus 7 and 7-1 from Sokcho.Enjoy!"
Fantastic hike,"A good hike with fantastic views of beautiful mountain peaks. Take bus 7 or 7-1 to the national park.Signs are well placed and easy to follow.Easy hike in summer, don't need any special gear, but steady shoes are a plus, especially if it's been raining.There are lots of shops selling food at the entrance, so good for after the hike!"
"Beautiful views, fairly difficult hike","When you reach the top Ulsanbawi gives incredible views over the mountain range and valley. It is a very steep hike, especially for the last half as its stairs up the rock cliff. I am a very inexperienced hiker and struggled but made it!"
i love stair :D,"about 2,5 hours roundtrip hike,a lot of people said the view was amazing but sadly when i got there it was covered by fog, but still a nice and enjoyable hike"
Awesome!,"Don't miss Seoraksan or this great hike. The view is amazing. I bagged Ulsanbawi, Geumganggul cave and Biryeong falls all in one epic day. "
Stairway to the Sky,"Do need some stair master time as it's an uphill walk, light hiking gear recommended but we saw some sneakers and tshirts. Climb is a 3,5 km walk through man made steel stairs and carefully placed rocks. Plenty of rest stops to make room for faster travellers, stay to the right! Views along the way tease but finally the peak is worth the effort with 360 views of the surrounding peaks and Sokcho, ocean side. For less effort but higher cost cable car on the other side of the valley is a lesser experience."
The best in Seorak!,"1h and 20 minutes up,45 minutes coming back.but it was fast-notmally you need more-i didnt take break.not too hard walk-i met boy 6 and man 72 years old which made this.but if you are not good condition it can be hard for you."
Challenging bit rewarding,"We walked up Ulsanbawi on an early March day. Rather chilly bit pleasant walking. The route is varied with some smooth easy paths, progressing to rocky pavement, rocky/natural steps to finally iron welded steps and handrail to ascend the final peaks. We enjoyed it enormously but suspected that those of our friends that were nervous of heights would not have enjoyed the staircases the kit out from the cliff face. Whilst extremely sturdy they may not be for everyone. The views at the top are spectacular and there are spacious viewing platforms and dramatic photos to be had. The wind picked up whilst we were at the top so we beat a hasty retreat. Very glad we did the walk. The next day was windier still (the cable car was suspended) and I was pleased that we did the waterfall walk that day. "
"Great climb, fantastic view",Great trek to Ulsanbawi Rock from the park headquarters. Good relatively easy 4km trail till the last km where it is a bit steep ( but with good stone steps) and then the last 500 m up steep stairs to the top. Fantastic views to the coast and across the national park. About 2.5 hours to climb and 1.5 to return. Several interesting stops along the way.
Slow and steady wins the race,"Go, even if you have bad knees like me! It's worth the view, and the tremendous sense of accomplishment when you get to the top is totally gratifying.We went in early September when the summer holidays had just ended which is the perfect time to go if you don't like crowds at all. We only met 2-3 groups of locals (all elderly folk who can climb really fast!), and maybe 5 other tourists/small groups.It took us about 6 hours in all to go up and down, but that included frequent stops to appreciate the sights, rest the bad knees, and a leisurely picnic lunch at the top. The going is rocky with the infamous flight of steps at the last stretch. The good news is that the stairs are nothing compared to the ones going to the Towangseong Falls in the same National Park. We counted more than 900 steps on that one!"
Legendary rock,This rock has a legend. If you can understand Korean or read something before seeing this rock it would be more interesting time. Moderate level of hiking is required.
Trekking for the whole family,"Though i was there alone i'm sure even my small daughters would enjoy this route. The Seoraksan National Park has a lot to offer who the whole family and Ulsanbawi course is one of its gems. Wether you young or old it is affordable to all ages, it takes from 2 to 5 hours depending on rhythm but the final viewpoint overlaps all difficulties on the way up. There is even a toilet available on the half way just below the rocks. Briefly the view is just amazing - one one hand the mountains of national park covered with trees of green and yellow, on the other overwhelming landscape of plain and Sokcho city."
Worth it,"We went up just past the peak autumn foliage, so there were no big crowds to jostle with. It starts out quite easy with generally paved roads, then starts to get tricky with rocky pathways (large stones which you can still put a whole foot on). After the sinheungsa temple (or heundalbawi), the climb more or less gets vertical. There are ropes by the side for the most part, so you can haul yourself along if necessary. Wear good shoes. After a stretch of stony climb, you reach the vertical stairs with proper railings and anti-slip floor coverings. This was the hardest part. If you soldier on you'll reach the top. I would advise some training beforehand, or your legs are going to feel every step of your climb by the next day. Don't attempt this trail if you are terribly unfit. There's an easier one to the left of the park entrance. The view from the top is magnificent if you go on a clear day. We did take about 4 hours round-trip. Bring your own water, you can refill your bottle at the temple's entrance about halfway up. There's a small gurgling fountain there with refreshing spring water. There are no refreshments of any kind sold within the park. I saw locals with thermos flasks of coffee, which is a great idea in cold weather. Also pack some light snacks to refuel along the way and enjoy a picnic at the top to reward yourself. "
Breathtaking view atop!,The view from the top of Ulsanbawi was simply captivating.The autumn leaves were also a sight to see!
Ulsan Rock,This was a fun hike. It took my wife and I about 4 hours round trip. For the experienced hiker I suspect it can be done in about 2 hours but we were busy enjoying the view. Ulsanbawi (Ulsan Rock) is actually one of several mountains inside of Soeuraksan National Park. The trail is about 4 kilometers so the round trip is about 8 kilometers or 5 miles. The summit is 870 meters elevation. 
Amazing views,Beautiful hike. Beutiful views of Sokcho. Painful stairs up and down. Especially the day after. But definitely worth it. Beautiful pictures of the white rock against the blue sky. A little windy when you get to the top. Take a light windbreaker.
"Beautiful Views, but Seorak Has Changed","I usually come here once or twice a year, but I was very busy and couldn't make it to Seorak Mountain since about March 2015.Seorak Mountain used to be full of life, full of mom & pop businesses selling everything from homemade wine, salad, fried grasshoppers, and my favorite things-- medals. Each golden medal had the year you went and the place you visited.I have 2 medals from Ulsanbawi. One is from 2012, and the next from 2013. Every day, a man hiked up to the top to sell the medals. There was a beautiful Korean flag next to the photo zone, and beside the entrance-- was his little shop. He sold coffee (much needed after the long 3-4 hour hike!) Snacks, and the medals. But Seorak Policy has changed. They got rid of every single mom&pop business. There is no more handmade wine along the hike. There are no more fried grasshoppers. And there are no more homemade salads and Korean pancakes.All that stuff is gone. All of the shopping has been condensed to the entrance of the park. Which is terrible. There are no more stops along the way to buy water. So many people on top of the mountain were seriously dehydrated because they were expecting shops to be there. In a way, it's better (if you come prepared). You can focus on the nature. But some of it is dangerous (we saw 2 dispatched emergency vehicles go up the mountain~~ probably to rescue dehydrated or feinting victims).The entrance of Seorak Mountain doesn't have any more Seorak Memories for sale. No photos, no Seorak Postcards, no medals. They only have Buddhist stuff and Seoul Magnets. I feel really sad at how much this place has changed. It's more beautiful than it was (no more garage type businesses/no more random shops on the mountain) but it is also more dangerous and a little less cathartic when you reach those amazing summits."
Worth the hike - even in the rain,"We arrived yes, already a little worried about the weather. Unfortunately the rain continued during the morning, we hiked anyways since it was just rain and no thunderstorm. The entrance to the national park was 3500KRW which is a good price. The hike to Ulsanbawi rock is definitely worth the exhaustion. Even though the visibility was really poor after reaching the top is was still magnificent! Definitely worth it, even in the rain!"
It's amazing when you reach the top!,"This is really a must do trek if you are able to do. The view and experience at the top is simply amazing. Basically, the top is the peak of a ridge and you can see both sides of the ridge. The cliffs fall of sharply from both side, so it's like you are on the knife edge of the ridge!It looks really high from the entrance of the Seoraksan park and you will wonder how is it possible to go up the steep slopes. But it's really not too tough. There are well pave trails most of the way. Once you reach the rocks, there are stairs all the way to the top. As long as you are able to slowly walk up the stairs you will reach the top. A fit person can reach the peak in 2 hours. We took 3 hours.In my opinion, if you came to Seoraksan and did not go up Ulsanbawi, you have not done justice to your trip! "
Very rewarding track,"Just did a track with my husband. We are not active sports person and did not train for this. The track was clear with the final portion literally climbing up vertical stairways. As we were not very fit, it took us between 5 -6 hours for the return journey. We spent about 30 minutes at the summit which offered a fabulous view of the valley and the sea. "
"Magnificient view to Rock, Mountain range and Sea","The climb starts gentle and gets very steep passed the Shakey Rock (Heunduelbawi).Please see my pictures for magnificient view. For a normal adult, the climb takes about 2 hours up and an hour down."
Holy stairs! This is definitely a great workout with great views at the top.,This is definitely a great workout with great views at the top. We unfortunately did this when the weather wasn't great so we had very limited views. The stairs climb straight up the side of the giant rocks. Legs were shakey on the way down but it was worth it.
Great views,"The way up is long, and tiring but easy, cuz the final part are mostly stairs, but once on the top views are amazing. Just... go with good weather, if not is just not worth the effort."
Bliss at the top!,"This hike takes an average of 4hrs up and down (taking account of stops for photography of coloured leafs since it was autumn). Fairly easy hike but some may fear of heights when climbing up the steel staircase. One will pass by a Buddhist temple along the journey. It's a gorgeous view from the top with the rock cliff at the backdrop in your pictures. The only downside during our hike was the prolonged rain which caused fog and coldness at the top! Definitely a must to visit, otherwise you can't claim that you have not visited Seoraksan."
Absolutely worth it.,"Whilst this is not the prettiest hike in the National Park, the peak is well worth the effort. The views and the dramatic rocky peaks are not to be missed. Simply gorgeous. "
Short hike with great views if you hit the weather just right,"Fairly short hike, 2 hours there and back if you hike straight. Great views when you are looking up at the rock formation. Unfortunately we were at the bottom around 10 and skys were very clear. When we made it to the top around 11/1130 a THICK blanket of clouds had rolled in and you could only see the immediate rock in front of you. "
Good hike bu there are better in the park,"This hike is very popular because it is not very long. From the top the view is very nice. You can see both the park and the East Sea. However, if you only have time for one hike I would recommend the hike to Geumganggul cave. It is less popular (so less crowded) and the view is more spectacular. The trail is the same distance and marginally more difficult. If you chose to do Ulsan Bawi? I recommend to go early, before 9 am. After it becomes more crowded (and I did go during the week)."
Great hike,It's very steep towards the end when going up the boulder. But on a clear day the view from the top is fantastic and some great scenery. About 4 hour roundtrip with rest stops along the way. One of the better hikes in Korea.
Tough but worth it,This hike has a lot of stairs at the end but the views make it all worthwhile. My friend and I did the round trip in 2.5 hours plus about half an hour break at the top but we were really stepping it out to do it in this time. 
A steep & tiring trek - but worth it,"We started this trek at around afternoon on a sunny day. Like other national parks in Korea, this trek in the Seoraksan National Park is beautiful, well kept and busy. Since its a popular and busy trek, you never feel alone. As has been mentioned by others, it's the last km of this trek that make the most challenging and rewarding part of the trek. If you are not trying to create a record, go slow - taking small breaks. Spending sometime at the buddhist temple midway. All in all, for people who like to trek - Ulsanbawi can never be a disappointment."
Scenic Ulsanbawi,Truly recommended for people who have great physical fitness and have desire to touch the skies and look down towards the lush greens.
Spectacular,"Spectacular and challenging walk up to Ulsanbawi Rock!! We only had time to do one walk in the park and chose this one, phew it was quite a challenge to walk up so many steps and hot as well. While the view at the top was hampered by the clouds it was still awesome to get up there. The temple built under the rock on the way up was a nice surprise as we weren't expecting it. Certainly take plenty of water on the walk especially if it's a warm day. Well worth it."
Fantastic view,"It takes 1.5 hour to go (if slow) from the main gate to the summit. There is beautiful forest for the beginning, and then very steep staircase. View from the summit is fantastic, and the rocks itself are very impressive.It's for sure ""must see"""
The best peak in Korea,"Great hike, takes around 2 hours from the entrace gate to the top. In the middle there is Heundeulbawi and a temple inside a rock, after that the route gets steeper. Easy to climb (with stairs) but quite exhausting. If you are only doing one hike in Korea, this is the one! Great views on top and different from other peaks. Very crowded during foliage peak season (mid October- beginning of November)."
Hiked it MANY TIMES!,I lived in the area for nearly four years. This rock is the epitome of Sokcho. You see it from every corner of the city. It is stunningly beautiful! 
Tough but great hike,"The sign said it was only 3.8 km to the top of Ulsanbawi but actually they were probably measuring vertical distance from the bottom. It was a much longer and tougher hike but totally worth it. We hiked earlier in the day to avoid the crowds during the weekend of Buddha's birthday.We also did the cable car in the morning (10,000 won roundtrip) which was a bit expensive but totally worth it. We went to the top and checked out the small temple there...we were surprised to find an extremely old pine tree up there.Recommend that you get in line earlier in the day as tickets can get sold out quickly. Cable cars run frequently."
A challenge but do-able,"Amenities like cafes, kiosks, toilets etc dotted about all the way to the top, but it gets steeper and steeper as you progress. Great feeling when you finally hit the top."
Worth the Hike,"The walk is stunning, I probably spent an extra hour with my camera pressed against my face, every time you look around there is something more photo worthy, and look out for the chipmunks.There is a lovely little stopping point before the tough ascent where as I approached I could hear a mantra humming from a rock. there was one tree covered in blossom when all the others had already shed theirs. In a cave there was a shrine where a man was praying. This was like another world and if you aren't the greatest walker it is worth the trek to just get to this point.This is a long trail and at the end a fairly tough set of steps at the end but the view and sense of achievement was totally worth it."
"Not difficult, just long, but so worth it! ","The title says it all. This climb is mostly over rocks and stairs. You don't have to be super fit and there's plenty of space to take a short break during the climb. If you go early, you'll avoid the crowds and you can enjoy the staggering view all by yourself. "
Sharply Slope for me,"Travel on 2010:See a lot of midle to old aged korean people at this place.Look like they become familiar to the trekking.Can't remember how long to the top but recognized the stairs to the top.It's a sharply Slop. So ,for Acrophobia, I 'm not recommend.On the top of the Rock i see someone who sell souvenr,too."
"Nice long hike, takes some work, but not bad for the average person","Beautiful scenery at the top, well worth the moderately hard work to get there. NOT particularly dangerous if you have a decent level of fitness. Last 45 minutes is on an excellent rubberized stairway with handholds. If you are afraid of heights probably not a good idea, but only if it is a true phobia. Saw families with children as small as 6 years old. Continuous stream of people, not overcrowded, on the way there and back offering encouragement. Very friendly to foreigners. At the top a small commercial stall for souvenir medal of achievement! I did not go to the alternate endpoint at the top because the handrail there (on the left just before the very top) is really rather inadequate and the edge seemed too daunting to me. Wear good boots because the terrain Enroute is rather variable until the steps. There is a little restaurant Enroute for drinks and a beautiful Buddist retreat and small temple. Unbelievable fall colors in October and only need a sweater/windbreaker. Bring water with you and hiking poles for the walk down. No toilet at the top but Enroute half way. Probably our top highlight in Korea."
THE HIKING TO CLIMB ULSAN BAWI WAS WORTH THE EFFORT FOR A 50YRS+ LADY,"Fantastic hiking trail along the way to the peak of UlsanBawi. However for a person does not have regular exercise it way quiet an effort. I almost gave up along the way. For those who wish to do it, do not be discouraged. You can do it. Just take a step at a time . Take your time , enjoy the nature as you walk by."
Worth the exercise :),This is a perfect day trip in Seoraksan NP....it is a nice hike and splendid views of the national park. A lot of people are doing this attraction so make sure to start early and take your time....it is pretty steep in the end of the hike - BUT again if u like scenery and nature u should definitely do this!
"Breathtaking view, worth the climb","Take your time climbing the stairs to the Ulsanbawi rock, the view along the climb is worth the effort. The view from the top of the rock is even more rewarding. The stairways is well built and sturdy. Just take your time to enjoy the view."
Nice View from Top,View from the top is amazing. Its a lot of stirs to climb to get the view. But bad part is too much crowd on those narrow stairs.
My favorite course!,Out of the four hiking courses I completed at Seoraksan this was my favorite! It was probably the most difficult that I did and took about 5 - 5.5 hours with rest/photo breaks. The views were amazing from the top! Totally worth the hike!
Top walk,"It is peak climbing season and we came on a Sunday, so the main car park was already full. Korean efficiency was in full swing however and we were immediately diverted into alternative parking and ushered on to a shuttle bus up to the park entrance. Thousands of fit happy relaxed Korean families were enjoying the walk, with cool temperatures, shaded by Japanese maple groves, and the first tinges of autumn colours in the trees. The very young and very old stopped at the main cafe, but the bulk of walkers made it to the 16 tonne wobbling Heundeul Bawi and temple before the walk turned vertical. The hand rope made life easier as did the well maintained stairs and rails. The air cooled as our bodies warmed, and we made lots of photo stops, making the final ascent and panorama very enjoyable. Our lunch included acorn jelly, a culinary first to finish off the day."
Great Views of Seoraksan and Sokcho,"I took 5 hours for this trip, but probably spent an hour taking pictures. Did it in early September morning to avoid the fog that often comes in the afternoon and evening. The fall foliage did not set in yet but it was still very pretty The early part of the hike was pleasant as it follows the course of a cascading river. About halfway, you reach the Heundeul Bawi Rock at the Gyejoam Hermitage. Nice break to take a picture attempting to move the rock. As others mentioned the last section was the steepest and involves a lot of stairs. The view at the top allowed you to see a great part of the Seoraksan park but also the town of Sokcho and the sea. It was the best view of the 2 days I spent in the park."
A good climb,The climb is not for the beginner. The climb has a lot of steps to climb. Has 2 rest areas on the way up. Check weather before climb. May be fogged in. Best to climb in the morning. Great view from the top.
"Easy walk, not worth it if weather bad",It's not difficult though the last couple of kms are very hard on the knees as it's mostly staircase. I wouldn't really call it hiking - the first third is a concrete path and the last third is on steps. It's only the middle bit where you are actually hiking.If you get to Seorakasan and can't see the mountain tops then I don't think it's really worth doing - by the time you get up there all you'll see is grey nothingness
"Intermediate Hike, Very Cool","We decided for the long weekend to go to Seoraksan National Park and go hiking. I chose Ulsanbawi because I'm not an experienced hiker and the mountain peak seemed too much. The Ulsanbawi hike offers a lot to see, but it is not easy for a beginner hiker. It's a 4-6 hour hike and the last 1/3 of the hike is mostly rocky stairs and stairs built into the side of the mountain. Unfortunately, the mountain was very misty the day we went, so we didn't see much of anything once we reached the top. Needless to say, by the time we got back down we were tired and hungry.I highly recommend bringing a lot of water, at least 1L per person, and plenty of snacks. The fare they offer on the mountain is very expensive because it, well, needs to be brought to the top. Otherwise, it's a really great trip and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys hiking."
Hard but worth it. ,"So many steps! Made sure you wear good shoes and clothes, and make sure to bring water. If you take your time I think also anyone can do it. At the top you are rewarded with some fantastic views. If you can try to go on a clear day. "
The last Kilometer is the hardest,"Coming from Sokcho, you will pass by Sinheungsa (a temple) and then arrive at Heundeulbawi (흔들바위). Untill there, it's an easy hike and everybody can do it. But after that, the last hour is rather hard. If you make it untill the top, the view is really great but if you don't feel like it, at Heundeulbawi, you will see a strange huge rock that can move a little bit. For the whole hike, it will take you around 4-5 hours."
Great views,"Really enjoyed this walk had a easy lead into the walk and gets harder towards the end of the walk. Was very windy when we went which is a nerve racking experience, even the cable car had been suspended due to the high winds. "
I didn't make it!,"But it was great trying! There was a huge amount of snow and even with crampons, it was like trying to scale a bob sleigh run most of the way up. I got to the observation point where I could see the top observation point, but turned back. The trek is fantastic and if you are fit, go for it. The views are brilliant."
great hiking with great people,"I took 3 hours to climb up and down of Ulsanbawi Rock. The autumn is so marvellous all the way up and the view is exquisite at the peak of the rock. The climbing will make you exhausted as so many staircases need to be climbed and steep as well so need to be careful. The local people especially the elderly are very friendly and will greet you or even will ask if you need your photo to be taken by them. By the way, don't worry if you need to do some 'nature call' as the place is provided with toilet. There are few restaurants too. At the peak, you can buy hot coffee too as there is a small tent café. Take your photo at the flag of Korea then go down a bit to the other side to get the nice shoot of the rock. Overall, Ulsanbawi Rock is worth visit to those who love nature and adventure. Not recommendable to those who have Acrophobia/Aeroacrophobia,"
Sweet Victory,"It took 5 hours round trip to do Ulsanbawi trail, some people only need 3 hours. Depend on your strength. Total 6km round trip with up and down step. So exhausted but believe me you will regret it if you don't do it, because the victory is so sweet, and the scenery is amazing.Tips: bring enough water and don't spend much, because on top only one seller who sells tea and is expensive."
All the way,"This is my first time hiking and it took me 3 hours to complete the trail of 873m height and 3.8km from the park entrance... the beginning part is pretty simple and in btwn there are stalls and restroom in the middle of no where.. many hikers during this Oct season including senior citizens as well. Some hikers even turn on their radio while hiking....sigh...I can see some rubbish / used bottles on the path as well. The tough part is the last 1km which I had to make a few stops to rest before i can continue. Dont forget to pack some food and water on your way up.. and the ""best"" part is there is a souvenir and photography plus coffee stall at the summit itself !!! which i think totally spoil the whole scenery . On the way down, the path is a bit slippery, just need to be careful"
amazing view,amazing view over mountains on one side and valley and sea shore on the other. quite easy hike to get this high. Highly recommended
Great Trek,Ulsanbawi is a great trek with last 800m nice steep climb on this rock. Fantastic view from the top of the rock
Great experience,"This a very popular hike in Seoraksan Park. Hiking this provides a real Korean hiking experience, lots of fellow hikers, a well-groomed trail and you can top it off with a bottle of makgeolli at the end (or at any other point along the trail if you so wish.) The view from the top is worth climbing the copious number of stairs and following the crowd."
