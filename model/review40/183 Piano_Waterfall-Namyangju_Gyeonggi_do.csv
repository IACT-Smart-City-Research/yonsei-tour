What a brilliant waterfall view of piano toilet!,It was refeshing journey. It's worth to visit. But greatest thing is the way to go there. Riding bocyle alongside the Bookhan river was simply amazing.
Turned off during the winter,"We stopped by hoping to see a beautiful ice fall, and maybe even some ice climbers. No luck during the winter months the man made fall is turned off."
Good to visit passing by,"C1 ( 2015.11.06 ) This fall was mady by ventilated water, so located in sewage treatment plant. This place had good theme "" piano "". So the fall had shape a terraced one, and the toilet was located beside fall, that's funny. This toilet looked like piano, and when I went up stairs, it sound ""piano"". There was good to visit passing by, I think."
Nice little stop for some pictures,My friends and i went to gapyeong for a weekend visit and stopped at a few places on the way. The piano falls was the best out of the three places we stopped. Here is a quick run down for you...1. Its free2. Its a nice waterfall that you can see from a distance3. It has according to some korean sites one of the top 10 toliets in korea. The toliets are in a building that looks like a piano.4. There is a small market if you want to get some snacks5. Max 30 minutes in and out unless you want to go hiking. It has some trails but we didnt do them.Overall a nice little stop for some pictures
