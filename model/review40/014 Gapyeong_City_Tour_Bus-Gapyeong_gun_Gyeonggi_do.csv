Worth it if you are travelling to multiple attractions,The bus was quite empty on the weekend I went. It's worth taking the bus if you are travelling to multiple stops. Alternatively you can take the local bus.
There's English speaking bus conductor ,"I took the City tour bus from Nami island heading to Petite France 25 minutes drive ,there's a lady who sell the bus tickets who can speak English and a bus driver . The ticket was 6000 won per person for a hop on and hop off experience. It goes to garden of morning calm , gapyeong station too . "
