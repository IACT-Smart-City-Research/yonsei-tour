Beautiful and quiet stroll,"Beautiful, large mountains surround the vast, lush area. Not much attractions, but it's nice for a walk or trekking. Paths are easy to find with restrooms here and there. Long walk from 1st gateway to 3rd, but the trail is not difficult. There are plenty of traditional Korean food choices in the entrance area."
Apple Festival,We came here for the apple festival in October. It started down pouring so we did not get to enjoy it as much as we'd like. This place looks very nice and we hope to go back someday.
"Crowded at times, but worthwhile","The entrance area and main attractions are crowded as heck, but the trails leading into the mountains are a little easier to handle. I particularly liked the 2 km walk up to Haeguk Temple (it is on the map). The temple is modest, but has some really wonderful art."
walking historic highway,"This is a historic highway between Southern and Capital (Seoul), an old highway is preserved and opened as a trekking route. Walking into the unspoiled forest with many stones etched old Korean poems, waterfalls, model houses of old post house and tea houses, historic site. Trekking takes about 3 hours and walking from North to South maybe easier because of longer descending."
Beautiful old castle,Well reserved old castles older than 500 years. It was the path way for Japanese Invasion in 1592.
Great place for low difficulty hiking ,"I went to this place in late Oct and the autumn foliage and scenery was really beautiful. From Seoul, go to DongSeoul bus terminal to take the intercity bus to Mungyeong Bus terminal. It takes 2 hours. Then take a local bus to Mungyeong Sanjae. Just buy the ticket from the bus terminal office. It costs 1500â‚© and roughly 10min. The area has 3 historical gates and from gate 1 to 3 is approx 6.5km. The hike is not difficult as there is no stairs or stones to climb. However from gate 2 to 3, it gets much steeper. I feel the best scenery are between gate 1 to 2. As such if you are already tired after gate 2, suggest you turn back after gate 2. There is also a KBS drama city built in this area and periodic dramas such as Chuno, Iljimae, etc were produced here. In all there are a lot more in this area and it's a pity I arrived late and could not explore further. It's now one of my favorite places in Korea."
Excellent tracking road with beatiful view,"C1 ( 2015.04.25 ) This park was very beautiful view, and many people walking though road. This park's road could pass big 3 old gate, and walk some trail. In the park, there was mesuem, drama set place, and some attraction. Especially, I felt good walking with smell, sight, air. Excellent park.."
Mungyeong Saejae,This is a beautiful park that is well kept. The trails to the gates are well paved and easy to walk. This is a must-see in Mungyeong.
Historical Old road,"Here people can enjoy Korean history, culture, drama open set & deliciouse food.Specailly Autumn fall foliage is really beautiful. And people can visit Apple farm for pick up & eating on October and November."
