Walk in the evening ,PleasedConnectedFelt warmthThe government or council thinks about pplWalking tracks with the anti slip resistant and walking aid road track is fantastic well done
Scenic place to visit with family and friends,"Eunpa lake is something in Gunsan city to see. It has East & West gates both with equal attactions however west could be better. Evening , sunset is beautiful . Besides spending time can sip bear, side by hotels."
Great park for walking or riding!,"Eunpa Lake Park has great paths and bridges you walk, ride, or just sit and enjoy the day. We rode through the park and crossed the lake on the wooden bridge. We watched folks practicing rowing on the lake and the park was not crowded on a Friday."
Best place in Kunsan during Spring ,Our favorite park in Kunsan. Walking around the lake during Spring season is so refreshing . So many beautiful flowers. 
Great running/strolling options 24/7,"A great place to run around the clock thanks to some lighted paths, and a wonderful place to spend some time for all: several great cafes and restaurants around the lake shore, and even some kids activities to keep little ones entertained. A great spot - particularly in the early morning to realize why Korea is known as the land of the morning calm."
It's Breathtaking!,"We see the 'Waterlight Bridge' all the time from my home windows. Not just looking out the window makes us breathtaking but also taking a walk anytime we want/need 24/7 with very fresh air surrounded by pure nature such as ducks swimming, very calmy peaceful but zig-zag curves around the huge lake gives us changeable fun!There are awesome cafes and restaurants here and there, so you must save a day or two to enjoy the beauty of the lake!"
Good Socializing,"You can see elderly using the little workout machines, kids in the playgrounds, often times the wedding halls across the street have a thing going on in the park. A little bit of everything. This is a great place to go if you are looking to past the time and want to see some nice scenery."
Beautiful Park,"I always enjoyed walking around this area. There’s a beautiful lake with a fountain. It’s great for a solo trip with your camera, going for a stroll with someone, or taking the family out to enjoy the day. I loved walking around Eunpa during all seasons. Bundle up and enjoy the snow covered ground and trees, or bring sunscreen and enjoy the lake on a hot sunny day. My favorite time is when the weather is a little cooler and the cherry blossoms are in full bloom. It’s very picturesque."
Everyone,This park has something for everyone.Go alone or take the family its always a good time to be had here.
Nice quite park for a run ,Park was not to busy on a Sunday afternoon. It is a great spot to run or walk around the lake. I will return once the weather cools down a bit 
Great place to walk and relax,I lived not far from the lake and would often go there in the evening and on weekends just to walk and relax. At night the bridge is lit up in different colors and the fountains are beautiful. In the spring the road along the edge of the ledge is lined with cherry blossoms and is just magnificent. If you find your self in Gunsan I highly recommend a walk around Eunpa Lake.
Afternoon Stroll along Eunpa Lake ,"We were in Gunsan on April 22 , 2017 after a 3 day adventure in Jeju-do. After depositing our luggages at our Korean friend's house at Seocheon , we went back to Gunsan for a late lunch at an Italian resto ( I know! ...a lot of road trip going back and forth,, but it was worth it). The resto was right infront of Eunpa Lake. Good food and Nice view!!! On a full stomach,, we explored the area....Luckily, a jazz band was playing at the outdoor stage. I can only imagine how it would look like in the evening....perfect for a fun night.Unfortunately, we missed the cherry blossoms and only saw a few white ones along Eunpa Lake. But the stroll was just enough to burn those calories and have a pleasant exchange of ideas about life and our travels.Love to visit it again when cherry blossoms are everywhere!!!"
Amazing!!!,"I visited this park many times while I was stationed with the military in South Korea. When you get to the park, stop and grab a cup of coffee lakeside and then begin your walk around the lake. The walk is very easy and follows the lake along a dirt path. Some of it is paved. The trail will take you over a bridge that at night is colorfully lit and the fountains in the lake will begin shooting water into the air. In the summer, it is very hot so bring some water! This is also a great place to take photos. In the summer of 2014, I took engagement photos there. It also a great place to meet new people along the way and engage in local culture. A definite stop if you're ever in the area. I assure you that you will return many times after that!"
Very relaxing ,We went for walk around Eunpa Lake last night it was quite chilly with sharp wind blowing. It was still quite quiet and relaxing. Many people running and walking around pathway. We had dinner in Italian restaurant at one end overlooking lake.
A gorgeous spot!,"I did not go to Kunsan to find this lake, but I was thrilled to be staying near it while I was there, and either walked or ran there during each day I was there. I love the spot. It is well groomed and manicured, and the bridge is fun to go across if you want a shorter outing."
amazing place,I went there with my kids at nightThe weather was good and the lights made it a piece of heaven.My kids loved the lights and there was a concert which i liked very much although it was in Korean. A good walk with magnificent view but i think it would be better at sunset 
Beautiful,"One of my favorite places to go when I'm in Gunsan! Go during the day and at night! During the day you can stroll around the lake, see the blossoms (if in bloom) and even exercise at the park. At night, the lights are on and it's gorgeous!"
Beautiful relaxing place to stroll,"There is a large, well lighted maintained dirt/asphalt path around the lake with music on portions of it. The scenery is incredible especially in the fall and spring. On Saturday nights in the warmer seasons there is usually a few live bands at the two small amphitheaters they have set up. The bridge in the evening is lit up in many colors and there are spectacular views of the surrounding city towers. It is a excellent place to walk or slowly ride a bike. There are city bikes for rent at several spots. There is also a paddle boat rental, you can cruise around in a duck shaped paddle boat. At sunset the bugs, especially mosquitoes can be overwhelming certain times of the year (I got over 80 bites on both legs once!), use anti mosquito spray or wear long pants. The locals will be covered head to toe at times. Once it is completely dark there are less bugs."
It's alright.,"If you have not experienced it, I would suggest you to try this. For me, it was not new, but It was enjoyable. "
Nice area during spring season,Beautiful and calm area with a lot of flower during spring season.9km walk with possibilities to short cut in the middle by the bridge.
Must visit!,"They have peddle boat rentals, lots of places to eat or get coffee or a snack, and lots of cherry blossom trees!"
Very Nice,No Smoking! Walk around the lake is nice but make sure you don't smoke the Koreans will yell at you. During the holidays the view is great and festive.
Walk across the bridge and enjoy the lights,Beautiful! The lights at night were great and it is a romantic place to walk around and enjoy. It is also very safe at night.
Relaxing get-away,"Beautiful city lake with walking trail (or biking trail) all the way around the lake. When in season the cherry blossoms around the lake are beautiful! There are four separate workout stations at different locations around the lake, so you can take a break from walking or riding your bike and hop on the workout machines. There is a concert area at the main entrance to the park. There is an area by the huge fountain in the lake where you can buy a cup of coffee or snacks or rent paddle boats that look like swans. You can also walk across the lake by the fountain on the beautiful bridge that was built."
"Great place to bike ride, walk, run, lunch, relax","The lake has paddle boats, bars, bathrooms, hiking trails, bike/walk around the lake, many restaurants, coffee shops, outdoor roller park, and a horseback riding arena near by. "
Beautiful at night,Love this place when it's lit up at night. A paved biking/walking/running trail encircles the lake. Saturday nights live entertainment.
"Lovely urban oasis in city with trails, lake and outdoor theatre","My husband and I went to Gunsan for a wedding and stayed at the Ritz Plaza and were pleasantly surprised by being a walking distance to Eunpa Lake Park, a reclaimed urban oasis with a 8 km Boardwalk/trail around a lake. We had a nice afternoon and evening stroll which covered the famous lover's bridge, an outdoor theatre with a festival, and tons of park space. We even rented paddle boats for 10,000 won for an hour to see the city from another perspective. At night, the lights of the bridge lit up and the boardwalk is still busy with couples and families alike enjoying a little exercise and fun. An excellent way to spend some time while visiting Gunsan."
