What a VIEW!,"we visited this attraction on a beautiful sunny day in tongyeong. It was a good thing because there was no wind and skies were fairly clear. I even saw them hel people in wheelchairs into the gondola.Once you get to the top, the views were breathtaking!! We just went on the yeosu cable car and this is 100x better with spectacular views. I would say this oi s a mist do if you're here on a clear day."
Good cable car,"After hiking to Mireuksan Mountain, we took this to come down until Luge Track.The view was nice with islands and clouds.It is said this is the longest ropeway in Korea.I think the price is fair even if it's more expensive than many other cable cars."
Good facility.. But we visited in cloudy weather.,"CY ( 18.05.16 ) I and my wife visited this facility that was famous in this area. But we were disappointed because it was cloudy. We couldn't see anything in the cable car, and top because of cloud. Though that is our misfortune, but if we visited in sunny day, there was very beautiful, I think."
Not ordinary cable cart ,Tracking the mountain could be adventurous but if you want quick visit to this place in short time.... Cable cart or ropeway is the best choice. Enjoyed it too much. 
Pawalg,It is worthy for going up to see the beautiful view and panorama view of Tongyeong city and the sea.
For an awesome view of the beautiful Hallyeosudo islands!,"The Hallyeosudo Landscape Cable Car stretches 1,975 meters above Mt. Mireuksan (461 meters above sea level)."
Exciting!,The rope way about 2kms long.Plenty of cable cars which keep on running continually so there is not much que.Return fare is around 10000 won per person which is pretty reasonable.Good connectivity via public transport.
Nice view for those without a height phobia,"It was a foggy day when I took the ropeway, so the view wasn't that good. I walked up the hill to the entrance and regretted it - just take a cab. The round trip ticket is 10,000won and it's just a modern cable car system - unlike the antiquated one at namsan tower. I have a phobia of being in a cable car especially when it wavers in the wind, so I closed my eyes on the way up. When you reach the top, there is a souvenir shop as well as a few snack stands. You can also walk up to the top for a better view, or pay 500won to view the landscape through a telescope."
panoramic views,The ride up to the top gives an amazing view of the bay and city. It costs ₩10000 for the round trip. And don't lose your ticket stubs as it will cost you ₩6500 to come down. Take your time and climb up the stairs to the top. It can be windy at times. Enjoy the different stops along the way to the top. 
Amazing view! A must see!,"It's a bit out of the way from the main town, so take a cab there (it will cost about 5,000 won from the centre). The fee is well worth the view from the top, and the journey up is also spectacular. You can see all the many hundreds of islands dotted around the bay and out into the sea. On a clear day you can see for miles and miles and I spent a good few hours just taking in the view."
Intense!,"I found this cable car pretty high, thought I'd challenge a bit of a phobia by using a round trip ticket (10,000¥) The views are spectacular, we had a clear day and could see for miles albeit not to Japan. Lots of nice vantage points from the trailways at the summit. Could be worth getting a cablecar up & walking down via the temples on the mountainside: this was recommended to us AFTER we got down."
Great views. Worth a visit.,"It's a (very long and pretty) cable car ride part way up the mountain. You have to hike the rest of the way to the top, but the views are worth it. You can see the spot where Yi Sun Shin's famous navel battle took place. (I don't think there was really info about the battle in English, though. So if you are interested, be sure to look up Yi Sun-sin before you go.)"
Very nice view for Mt Mireuk and south sea. ,Very nice view for Mt Mireuk and south sea. You can go up Mt. Mireuk if you take the cable car (actually it is gondola). You can enjoy the scenery Hanryeosudo National Park while you are moving. It will take about 10 minutes from end to end. 
ropeway,"been there 3 times; autumn, winter and spring. never fail to mesmerise..highly recommended. go early, tickets are limited during peak season."
Fantastic View and Great Hiking,"Get ready with your camera! This ropeway is what we would call a cable lift such as are used in US and other countries for ski resorts. The view is beautiful while riding to the top of the lift. When you reach the lift exit point, there is a little shop for refreshments and then on for a hike up the remainder of the mountain. This climb is an easy one with steps most of the way. Highly recommended!"
Beautiful!!!,"It was most beautiful scenery. Although it was cloudy, we could enjoy beautiful coastal scenery.It took about 20 minutes to the top of the mountain.Staffs at the ropeway are very nice and kind."
Good to do on Weekdays,"Great views, nice little walkabout on top. Can be very busy on weekends, get there early ie 8:30 for first ride at 9:30"
"Superb view, nice walks and impressive ropeway",Longest ropeway in Korea. Big careful it can be chilly and windy at the top. The view is superb. Nice walk to the observation deck. It is also a nice way to see where happened these famous turtle ship battle. Apart of that I recommend to keep some energy for extra tour to very nice and authentic temple. Although there are remote and need some walking (very well indicated) it is worth the effort. You will find wonderful temples very quite in the middle of the forest.
