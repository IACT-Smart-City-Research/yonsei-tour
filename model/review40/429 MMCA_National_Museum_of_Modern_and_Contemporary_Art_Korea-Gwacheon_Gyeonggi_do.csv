Website update please,"Large extensive grounds, interesting stores including one selling clothes repurposed from other clothes. The exhibitions were, well contemporary and I'll leave it at that.Why the title? According to their website, the museum is supposed to open at 10:00 on Sunday, when I got there the sign said opens at noon, which is a bit frustrating on a hot sunny day."
Wonderful museum,Highly recommend visiting this wonderful museum. I had the chance to see a wonderful exhibition on Park Seobo and honestly I was amazed by it. I wish there would be a lot more discussion about modern contemporary Korean art.
Great Museum,The MMCA is a beautiful building is worth to visit only because of its Architecture the exhibitions i saw The Korean Artist price 2018 was pretty remarkable.
less than expected,"I used to be a frequent visitor to Seoul but recently have not had the opportunity to visit so I was excited to return to the city. Several friends suggested that I visit MMCA and raved about it. It was much less than my expectations. Building is interesting but exhibits were boring. Too much empty space to wander around. Perhaps it was the time I visited. It is quite a distance from even Insadong, although it looks much closer on the map.and is definitely a destination visit. I love modern art but unfortunately this is not one of the best museums I have found."
"Fantastic place to spend the day, wonderful exhibitions and lovely architecture.","MMCA is quite easy to get to, it's right next to the ancient palace Kyung Bok Gung. The area itself is artsy and even if the exhibitions are not to your taste, it wouldn't be half bad to just stroll the surrounding area after your visit to the MMCA.Anyway, I really enjoyed my visit to the museum, free entry for under 24s and seniors (also have happy hour offer for entry after 6pm) which is a plus. A lot of interesting things to see at the museum, suitable for those who want to take a day or half a day off from their shopping spree in Seoul"
Long haul,"A long metro ride and then 10 minutes bus ride on the free shuttle bus to get to this museum, so you need to have plenty of time in hand for a visit. External sculptures as well as 6 main galleries. Check what's on before you go to make sure it's worth the effort."
""" one of the best Art Museum """,""" so awesome because the admission is FREE! Perfect place to visit especially those who love paintings, collections , and some unique arts. Great to know that some of the paintings and arts here have history to tell people. Best place as well for students and for the whole family """
"Wonderful Museum, Lovely Grounds","This was a really nice museum and I was quite surprised to discover admission was free. There was a great variety of exhibits, which I really enjoyed.The grounds of the museum were beautiful, with a reflection pool where you could sit under an umbrella and enjoy a coffee and a sculpture garden.If you're up for a bit of a hike, I highly recommend getting off at Seoul Grand Park station and walking up the hill to enjoy the view of the city and get a peek at Seoul Land and the zoo. There's also a shuttle that runs several times an hour if you prefer to ride. Parking at the top of the hill is limited and looked cramped, so if you're driving I highly recommend parking in the large lots at the bottom and riding the shuttle!"
The best painting that is seen through a window is nature,To see outside of the windowAfter I saw the paintings.I soon realise there is.Hold my breathAnd feel.NATURE.Nothing's specialBut tells me something.
"Extensive collection, best part was its FREE","I'm not really an art person but i enjoyed my afternoon here. Getting there was EASY. After coming off the Grand Seoul station (line 4) exit 4, a few meters away is a shuttle bus going to the museum. It runs every 20 mins and the service is FREE.There is a large garden with an open museum with various installations. There's also a small snack bar for those who wish to have a cup of coffee or sandwich while enjoying the beautiful grounds.Entrance is also FREE for the permanent exhibitions. There's a ticket for the special exhibitions but i opted not to. I must say there was a lot to see and even if Im not really an art person, every form of contemporary art imaginable was there. From photogrpahs, to paintings, to 3D art, multimedia and interactive pieces.I spend around 1 1/2 hours walking around which was quite relaxed pace. Overall for a free trip, it was worth it.Also there a nice pond with tables and chairs at the front of the museum where once can just simply enjoy and chill and relax."
Good (free) permanent collection with several special exhibitions,"Came here for a culture fix and was pleasantly surprised by how much there was. The permanent collection and some exhibitions are free, although several temporary exhibitions are extra (the cost though is a few USD equivalent only).The museum itself is in Gwacheon, and reached by line 4 of the Metro to Seoul Grand Park, from where it's a 20-minute walk or so.The museum is on a hill on your left, and in the atrium behind the ticket desk there is a large June Nam Paik installation. Off from this atrium, there are three floors of the permanent collection (spent about 2 hours walking around) and rooms for the special exhibitions. English-language information is sometimes a bit thin on the ground, but the introductions in each gallery are bilingual Korean and English.Worth a visit if you're in Seoul and a modern art fan."
Outstanding curation with excellent facilities ,Brilliant permanent collection (free entry) with meaningful descriptions in English and Korean. Beautiful facilities with a thoughtful layout and good options for dining. Definitely worth the trek out to Seoul Grand Park. 
First Class Museum. Do not miss,"This is a new world class museum in Seoul Korea. It is brand new and most people are not aware of it. The exhibits are very modern and cutting edge in the world of art modern art. The exhibit spaces are very large and can accept almost any size piece. The exhibit works of not just Korean artists, but artists from all over the world. There is a Worhol, a Morris Louis, Koons, and other contemporary artists. The building is on three levels and the ceilings must be 20 feet high. Do not hesitate when in Seoul to stop and see this museum. We were surprised at the exhibits and the building.Also do not miss the Samsung Museum of Art. Another must see in Seoul, especially the architecture of the building."
Great contemporary art museum,"Great contemporary art museum. This branch at Gwacheon is probably the best of the various branches around Seoul, certainly the biggest. Its mostly Korean artists, mostly contempoary work. As with all contemporary art museums you won't like every piece, but for me there were more hits than misses. Also, there is a nice outdoor sculpture park.It's free to get in (exhibitions cost extra - but this is where the permanent collection is housed so most stuff is free here). There is a cafe restaurant on site. Its a 15-20min walk from the subway, or there is a free shuttle bus, or there is a very nice cable car."
Wonderful museum! don't miss it,"High class museum, wonderful shows and a great permanent collection. Don't miss Yayoy Kusama's pumpkin outside, Niki de Saint Phalle's woman and Nam June Paik's installations. The Hockney current display is a one painting exhibition (the one from his documentary film). The museum is surrounded by a wide and beautiful sculpture garden.The museum is located in ""Seoul grand Park"" that includes also a zoo, an entertainment park, a romantic cable car for couples and marvelous landscapes, so you can spend there a day without a problem whether you're solo, duo or a family."
Great place to Visit on a weekday,"The museum is at the Seoul Grand Park. As the park has the Seoul Zoo (one of the largest in the world) and the Seoul Land Amusement Park, don't visit on a weekend as crowds are overwhelming. A great collection of modern and contemporary art. A beautiful building with a wonderful sculpture garden. There is a shuttle from the subway station but it doesn't operate when the traffic is heavy. The sky tram from the park ends very near the entrance to the museum so you can ride on the spy tram to the Museum!"
By far the best modern art museum I have visited.,"Huge of collection of contemporary art in a gorgeous location surrounded by forested hills that will look stunning in autumn (but also now in winter). It has to be one the greatest modern art museums in the world. Entrance is free on the last Saturday of every month, so that's the day to go. The location means you don't feel you are in a city at all, it is efectively a trip into nature. The drawback, of course, is that there is no dropping in -you need to make a special journey and then catch the (free) shuttle bus from the underground station. A hassle, but absolutely worth it. The museum shop is sadly not quite a match for the museum (it looks like what I think must be a very spacious prison cell). Likewise the (Italian) in-house restaurant doesn't look particularly interesting, but don't let this hold you back, it is a fantastic museum. The coffee kiosk outside is much nicer and will allow you enjoy the garden and mountain views."
Accessible Contemporary Art & Excellent Location,"For visitors that often steer away from contemporary art, this museum may be a great introduction. Firstly, the excellent facility and grounds are pleasant to explore. The exhibits are unique, and the video art by Korean Artist Nam June Paik are world famous.While contemporary art is not always my ""cup of tea"", I could easily appreciate this museum. The sculptures on the museum grounds are also worth browsing."
Awesome Museum,This museum is set on beautiful grounds... Having garden art as well as a wonderful exhibit inside. Great place to spend the day~~
Worth a visit,The permanent exhibit was really cool. The Korean artist section was innovative and informative of the culture. The presentation was great and the price was really great.
