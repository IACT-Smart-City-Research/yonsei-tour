Good place away from busy city! ,"Was there after strawberries pickings at nearby farm. Was a small park with some cafes. We went there just for some photo taking shots.As it was winter, the lotus flowers in ponds were withered. The water had also started to freeze.Nevertheless,the season couldn’t hide the facts that the scenery from here should be great during other seasons. We were here by joining customized Day tour guide. As such it saved us a lot of time & ease in traveling with group of seniors & teens with lots of diverse activities."
Dumulmeori’s Charm,"Yes it’s a charming place, the side where the water is. And it’s not difficult to get those scenic shots that you see posted online. However, it’s not a huge area and other than enjoying the serenity of and admiring the pictursque surroundings, there isn’t very much things to do. You get the laid-back sort of vibes and you could choose to while away the day sipping a cuppa with your favourite pastry at one of the cafes there. We didn’t think we would need to make a special trip there so we wove it into our strawberry picking itinerary.We went to Yangsuri Strawberry Farm near Yangsu Station in the morning, had lunch at one of the restaurants along the way and took a leisurely walk to Dumulmeori which is about 700m away from the restaurant.We then crossed over to Semiwon via a connecting bridge and back to Yangsu Station before taking the train back to Seoul in the evening. The walk was seamless and relaxing although the lotus pond at Semiwon has become a wiltered lotus flowers’ graveyard. I’m sure it would have been gorgeous during spring time. Do bear in mind that there is a “toll fee” to use the bridge connecting Dumulmeori and Semiwon - KRW3000 for adult and KRW2000 for students.All these within a day at a leisurely pace and doable on your own. Was an effective relief for shopping fatigue."
Every Season The Best,"Here is the famous spot where the tides of two rivers(Northern Han river and Southern river) meet. Pure water and scenery is harmonious. You can walk freely for 1 - 2 hours. If you have a chance to come to Yangpyeong-gun, it will be a MUST-VIST place."
Beautiful scenery from every angle ,"This place cannot be judge by just looking at photos. What you see personally is different from what is seen in photos. Walking in the park and looking at different angles gives you different views. Great place to enjoy the fresh air and beautiful sceneries, lake, mountains, trees. Also, great place for drawing. "
Lotus Park,"Lotus Park, you can say it, but when I visit there it's was during March, so the lotus not yet blossom. But the scenery is awesome, my friend explains to me that was where 2 rivers meet together. We walk along the way, enjoying the view and fresh air."
Winter visit- ice river,"It's quite easy to reach the destination, walking from yangsu station exit 2, all the way straight to traffic light(saemiwon), turn right to cross the river and turn left into a small path along the river. Walk for another 30-45 minutes to reach the infamous photo frame and continue down to the point where two water meet. It's pretty amazing to see in winter, the whole river is frozen and we actually walked a bit at the side of the river. Worth visiting! The journey is rather long from Seoul but it's relaxing stroll and I would recommend this place for sure!"
Unexpected Stunning scenery,"Was in Yangsuri for strawberry picking activities. Coming here was not part of my list, but was glad that we decided to walk over from the nearby strawberry picking farm ( 10 mins walk ).Crowds here are locals which filled up this place. Mountainous view was absolutely stunning and breath taking. My mind simply wanders off to a llalla land.We chose a cafe and rest our tired soles. With such mesmerising view in front of us, seeping on strawberry shakes / sweet potato hot latte + a kimchee pancake to go with. What more could we asked for.Glad that we make a visit here! It would have been beautiful when seasons are in full bloom. * PS - People who are not able to walk much are advised to get a cab back from here to Yangu subway station. Maybe could get help from a information counter at the carpark area. We walked for at least a good 40 mins or so which was really tedious for an elderly.A local told us walking to Yangsu station which would takes us at most 20 mins, but we embarked on a seem like never ending walking journey back."
Beautiful scenery where 2 rivers meet,"Dumulmeori is the place where 2 rivers meet together. It has very beautiful scenery. If you visit during autumn, you can see colorful foliage with the chilly breeze."
Dumulmeori in Yangpyung,"Two rivers - Bukhan and Namhan - meets at this place. This place is near Semiwon Garden. There are several cafeterias around there. You must experience the worst traffic jam from Seoul to there and around, especially on weekends."
"Beautiful, Just Beautiful","Feels so happy that we decided to come here. Its peacefull and beautiful here. Especially the lake and surrounding. We took a cab to go to the lake and walked after enjoying the view, back to the train station. A little bit far but we enjoyed it very much. If you don't want to walk, after the exit of the train station, you will find many bicyle and you can rent a bicycle there and enjoying the beauty of Dumulmeori.."
Dumulmeori- Where two river meets!!!!,"From Semiwon Park you can see the Dumulmeori area across the Hang River. It is a beautiful sight to behold. Dumulmeori means the ""head of two waters"", this is the place where the ""Bukhang"" River and ""Namhang"" Rivers converge to make the famous ""Hang"" River of Korea.From Semiwon Park you can walk to the Dumulmeori area by crossing the ""Bridge of Boats"" (배다리). This has been built by connecting boats underneath to support the bridge. This bridge is said to be first built during the Great King Jeongjo's (1752-1800) time.After crossing the Bridge of Boats one can reach the Dumulmeori area. This area is such a picturesque area that photographers have tried to capture its beauty all the year round. The 400-year-old Zelkova tree adds more beauty to the location where a huge swath of water flows by."
"Many many lotus, and good mood.","C1 ( 2015.11.06 ) This attraction was located beside Semiwon, and had river, walking road, and many lotus. Many people walked along a river with good view and air, and many shop sold various food and lotus one. I went around this place about 20 minutes, the mood was good. Good place to walk along a river."
"Good place to calm your mind, enjoying the scenery","its best to visit during summer, because all the lotus will be at the full blooms at that time. here while enjoying the picturesque river you can also enjoy various lotus based snacks that can only found here"
Beautiful and Vibrant Dumulmeori,I loved Dumulmeori for the fabulous mountain views across the intersection of the two rivers. The place is wide with lots of other tourists. You can enjoy snacks and food at affordable prices. It was quite great to take a photo with the Zelkova Tree. It wold be nice to visit.
Perfect scenery,One of good attraction in KyongGiDo where the Han River flows silently.North Han river and South Han river combined in this place.
"""take a break from city lives""","entering yangpyeong gun is like entering into 'a slow city' every things changes from busy and fast seoul city lives to a relax and slow pace.From yangsu station is about 25 to 30 min walk ,there are bicycle rental near the station or you can choose to walk since there are not many traffic or vehicles on the road.There are sign to guide you though not obvious,you got to look out for it or follow some local who travel in 'groups'and with 'hiking attires'.There are a few trails that you can choose from but the most popular trail will be to dumulmeori, the walking path towards dumulmeori was beautiful and peaceful ,along the way you can see some farming and plantation from the householder backyard,there are also chairs facing the lake that one can enjoyed the scenery and seeing some ducks' swimming'.overall in my opinion it is a good place to 'slow down and relax' nature lover will like the place ,,there are also some organic food and plantation or garden that you can visit.It is good for people who just want to relax and have a cup of coffee and really doing nothing much .,enjoy the scenery and taking some good and fresh air."
