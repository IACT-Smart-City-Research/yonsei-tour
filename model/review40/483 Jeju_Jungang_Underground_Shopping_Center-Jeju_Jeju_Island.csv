What an experience,"One just can not envision the size and number of stores in this underground mall. Even if you don't buy anything, it's worth checking it out. The clothing is very inexpensive. Lots of cell phone stores but they only work in Korea so the employees won't even look at you if your not Korean. But all the other shop are very friendly."
Amazing Place,Worth the visit. Amazing. My kids enjoyed the place. Great time for exploration in the area.Visit the area.
So so,"They sale a lot of clothing with self brand, the price is more expensive that some known brand like uniqlo, h&m etc... "
Many things except kitchenware,They mostly sell clothes and cosmetics here. This place is equivalent to those underground shopping centres in Seoul. It is a large space and you can try bargaining too. Close proximity to Dongmun Market and a gem of a historical area called Gwandeokjeong.
Korean Fashion,"Communication barrier is not a problem for us to shop here. Yes, they don't really speak English. But, we still had a good time to shop and bargain. If you want to shop korean fashion (but not the designer label or branded one), clothing, accessories, bags, cosmetic, skin care, this is the place. One place for everything so that you don't have to walk more. Innisfree, Nature Republic, The Saem, Skin Food, you name it. All are here."
Underground shopping great during winter,"We enjoy shopping underground. We were able walk from one end to another. Just remember where you enter. There is a number so you will not get lost.There were beauty products, children clothing, adult clothing, bags, shoes, restaurants, etc. They are not your designer stuff but cheap items. Since winter, they sell winter wear. We bought some face masks, cleanser for less than $10. We also bought bags for $15. The lady said made in korea so we think ok. The backpack is great cos very spacous. Good for traveling. Quality is just ok. Then at one exit near to the wet market, we found a shop called bang bang. It belongs to a friend of the korean actor who starred in the famous korean drama ""my love from the star"" we were able to buy simple T shirts, socks. They are less than $10. Socks about $3. We actually shop here 2 times when we were staying in ocean suites hotel. It was just 10 to 15 minutes walk to this underground shopping area.There are restaurants here too. We found a good korean restaurant here. It was good food and affordable."
Convenient but boring ,"Maybe coz it’s winter, mainly promoting winter clothes. Not many knick knacks to see or buy. Haven’t yet compared to shopping malls, but can’t say it’s very affordable either "
Short underground shopping link,"Since my hotel is located at one end of this shopping centre, I visited this place every day during my stay in Jeju. Being underground, it was great to shield the winter cold especially in the evenings.The shops essentially sell similar products - clothings, cosmetics, shoes, accessories, bags, hats, etc. There are few eateries and fast food chains too. This shopping street tends to be crowded in the evenings. There are free toilet facilities at one end, i.e. exit 1."
Nice place for shopping,"good facility,many store and warm when winter season its the best place for shopping at Jeju.nearby to dongmun market and its easy to go by bus"
Long stretch of shopping ,"It's probably the best place to shop for street wear in Jeju but it's nothing compared to Seoul. After visiting this place, one realised how expensive jeju is compared to the mainland Korea.Free samples are given out when purchasing cosmetic in Seoul. Nothing of that sort in Jeju. Fashion spotted in this mall is old and pathetic. Don't get your hopes high.Only saving grace is this mall protects you from the weather elements during shopping. But so is any mall in Seoul too. "
Cheap and Lots of Variety,"Forget Lotte Duty Free, You can find almost every Korean Skin Care Brand here, TheFaceShop, Etude, Isoi, Banilla , Nature Republic, etc, all with cheap price and lots of bonus."
Big but not flashy,The entrance is an orange frame which juts our of the ground so it will be really hard to miss. But If you go for flashy shopping centre then this place is not for you. There’s a lot on sale if you take the time to browse through. Unfortunately I am the type who goes for flashy shopping centre so we just came in and breeze through. 
the usual shops,"nothing much to see here, a typical underground shopping mall with the usual shops and F&B. good thing is that it wasnt that crowded.they do provide free wifi though."
Cosmetic center,"When you vivit Jeju Island, it is very easy for you to find cosmetic center in jugang underground shopping center. There are many kind of korean cosmetic product. Such as soothing gel, sheet mask, lipt tint, and facial wash. From airport you can go to jugang underground shopping center by bus or by taxi. You can ask tourist information in airport about bus number that can bring you there"
Perfect for Korean cosmetic fans,"My hotel was almost next to exit 1 of this mall so spent quite a bit of time here shopping for Korean cosmetics but otherwise it's just a regular shopping center, nothing special. Didn't try any of the restaurants down there, as I'd prefer to spend more time in the open air. But this mall serves as a great connection point to many other areas of interest within the city including the Mok provincial government historical site and Dongmun traditional market, with clearly marked signs at each exit."
One thing neat about this one is that...,"You might go in the market which is partially underground and think you’re in this. You’re not. This is about 100 little shops with similar wares. About 3 places to eat including don burger. One neat thing about this is that they say it is the largest in the world. It’s one block but in the middle flares out to several aisles. I don’t know if anybody reads trip advisor unless you click HELPFUL. If you do this, it sends me an email and it makes me smile :-)"
Underground shopping street ,"Came here after having our dinner nearby , stroll along this underground shopping which was not that long , bought some Korean brand cosmetic here that's all, not crowded , free filter water with paper cups for drinks , clean toilet to use , heated on a cold weather . If it's raining outside would be nice to spend some time here . "
Nothing much to shop,Underground shops over around 2 blocks. Nothing really interesting. You can skip it if you run out of time. Some clothing shops. Better save your money and time for Seoul.
Usual underground shopping center,"Very near the Dongmun market, just like any ordinary underground shopping center. Nothing new, nothing different. Many entrances and exits too."
Good place to buy make up,It's a good place to buy facial mask escorts from some famous Korean brand like innisfree or natural republic.
ug shopping mall,this ug shopping mall has a lot of entrance one of them was located near dongmun market.mostly sell clothes and food.
NEAR TO DONGMUN MARKET SO VISIT THIS PLACE ON A SINGLE TRIP,"Its a short street UG mall sells things you will find in normal shops in Jeju. The catch here is that this place is not just underground BUT its air conditioned. Its maintained very well with clean toilets. We spent about 40 mins leisurely but didn't buy anything in the end. I won't say its a must-go place but if you happened to be at Dongmun market, its a short walk to this place."
1st Underground shopping in Jeju,"This Underground Shopping Mall is again beside one of the walking street. It also has many entrance/exit. Basically, the shops are selling more for women and not for youngsters. It really make use of the space on the island, and place to hide during down pour."
Good shopping ,"A lot of selection, different price ranges for all the price brackets. Clothes, some gifts and food. Worth coming to see."
Good option for bad weather,"Can find almost everything here cosmetics (of course), vitamin, souvenir, fashion apparel, also few restaurants here. Almost can find everything here but not that fantastic. Some of the coat and sweater was expensive.This is good option to go for bad weather."
Shop Cheap Items in Jeju,"We were looking for a good place to shop and buy souvenirs and we found this place in Jungang area. Lot of cheap items from clothes, bags, shoes and beauty products.Tips:- GPS: 752-8776- There is a public parking in front of Jeju Bank along Ohyeon-gil. 3-4 hours cost us 3700Krw.- Jejumok Gwana is just on the West exit (exit 11). You might want to drop by if you got time.- There are Korean food in the middle section. Cheap but taste good."
Nice and tidy,"Not being the world's greatest fan of shopping malls, underground or otherwise, I wasn't expecting very much. However, I have to admit that it was very nice and tidy, a long parade of shops stretching at least a quarter of a mile. Most of the outlets were selling clothes, shoes and that sort of thing. Be careful about payment since many do not accept MasterCard or Visa, let alone AMEX. Haggling over prices seems to be tolerated, but language might be an impediment.Happy Shopping !"
Good Variety But Not Fantastic,"Stumble upon it when wanting to cross the road. There's mainly women's stuff, plenty of cosmetics, very few man's stuffs and some restaurants. Looks like a typical China zhuhai gong pei type of underground mall, but smaller. The ships above ground sells higher quality stuffs. "
Not worth going,It basically looks like a shopping mall in Shenzhen. There are a few cosmetic shops but most of the shops sell old-fashioned clothes. Not worth a visit at all. 
Nothing special,"Relatively clean and orderly but nothing special. Mostly clothing and cosmetics shops, surprised to find not even 1 souvenir stall that sells ""Welcome to Jeju"" t-shirts"
Underground Shopping,"Located in Jungangro of downtown Jeju this underground shopping mall was the perfect spot to take in some local shopping due to the rain on the day we visited. Most of the 280 shop locations were open but quite a few locations were in the process of or still had yet to open. Most shops here sold shoes, clothing, and cosmetics. We found several shops for children apparel and a few shops of general items and a couple of places to eat (which we tried - very good). Of the shops there we didn't really find anything to our liking but the shopping experience was pleasant. The shops varied in what they accepted for payment. Most accepted Wans and several Credit Cards. If any, tenants spoke very little English."
A trip down under,"This underground shopping street is kinda cool. It has clothes, beauty products, a large number of children's stall, and no doubt impresses the many thousands of tourists that come through Jeju City every day. However, if you have ever been to Singapore, and experienced the underground warren of the connected malls on Orchard road, this will not in any way tantalize you. At best it will make you smile at the 1970's feel of it all ;-)"
Cloth n cosmetic is a lots here,At there if you looking for almost all kind of cloth and cosmetic there you will love it! Because some brand name is there and almost is a fashion cloths there! For cosmetic is so many brand there start from Korea product will go to almost every brand in the world and the area is just next from dongmon market ...and don't forget you are shopping at underground shopping centre not in a big mall because I will experience some poor service...have a great shopping
Interesting but average,"Unfortunately we visited in the morning and a lot of the stalls were just opening up. I was surprised as a lot of the markets in Asia open at the crack of dawn. There are a large number of stalls selling a large variety of goods, some at fairly good prices. It was a dull day so it was nice to be indoors."
Cheap market,"It is just like the cheap Chinese market in my hometown, with small stalls, no room to try things on and dirty floor. We were quite surprised when we got there, as the reviews of this place are rather good. Did not buy anything there. If you want some normal shopping in Jeju, go to any Emarket instead."
great place to shop except the poor service of some stalls,"Generally, a great place to shop for mask, body care, face care products with great prices. Do beware of some shops do actually give a kind of face/attitude if you touch or even asked for prices ( please note that, most shops dont include a price tag) after you decided not to buy."
Juju-do Shopping Centre,There are a lot of steps to negotiate - but on looking again a lift as found and used - very interesting mall - extremely clean as is the entire city
Awesome for Shopaholic ,"To be full of cosmetics and fashion items. If you're shopaholic you shouldn't miss an opportunity for shopping. Quite Cheap. If it's rainy days and can't go for climb mountains, you can go jungang instead."
"Wouldn't make a ""special"" visit to see","Lots of shops, but I wouldn't go out of your way to see this. I just happened to be in the area. Wouldn't be very nice shopping if it was crowded either."
UnionPay Heaven,"Lots of various beauty shops and shoppers crowded around those shops. You can buy some good Korean made health care products, and a lot of Chinese and various types of Asians. It claims to be a tax free zone, and the prices are more than reasonable. Also, the free wifi hotspots are good, as well as very clean bathrooms. Good place for shopping."
