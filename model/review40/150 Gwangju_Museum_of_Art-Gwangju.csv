Genuinely interesting displays,"Great displays here - well worth the visit. Sculpture, aesthetic installations (moving pillars!), traditional and contemporary paintings and a special hanji display were all thoroughly absorbing. Also, you can leave your backpacks in the lockers."
Great art!,Stayed there for 2 hours. It has many beautiful paintings to see. It’s a must for any art lover. It’s for free as well.
Museum with nice education space,"exhibition (Jeong Gwang Hee, 2014) was fair, but the education space within the museum was well planned, which tailors not only the kids but also the adults"
with a guide,I visited the place the place with a Korean friend and listen to the explanation about how old Korean people used to live was awesome to me beacuse I am interested in Korean culture and Art. Advice Art lovers to visit it 
Visit to Gwangju National Museum,The Gwangju National Museum is a great place to visit to learn about the history of Gwangju city. Located at the outshirt of the city it give a very informative historical account of city and also the history of the Korea people going back as far back as the Chinese Tang dynasty. A must visit for first time visitor to the city.
nordic spirit,Beautiful museum with so much to offer. We came on the opening of Nordic Spirit which is a gorgeous show filled with makettes and an interactive sound piece. The show is curated beautifully. The works on the 2nd floor are absolutely beautiful ( unrelated to Nordic spirit). The flow of this museum is easy with beautiful floor to ceiling pieces. 
Break from the Park,"A nice stroll through the park leads you to the Gwangju Museum of Art. There was only one exhibit up, so it was short, but we did enjoy it: the ""Photography and History: Document, Monument, Memory"" exhibit. The exhibit was well done, though very little of it was in English. At 500 won for each adult, it was a nice break.The museum is clean, has storage for backpacks and a large common area where a lot of families with children were lounging and taking a break from the outdoors. (There were a lot of people in the park - Korea's best leisure park)Recommended: If you have time or if you want a leisurely weekend. We went on a Sunday and it wasn’t very busy."
"Good, but short","The exhibits were pretty cool, but each took literally 15-30 minutes to go through. They seemed as though they changed quite often, so Im sure it would be better if you actually lived in the area and went back every few months. The cafe is also amazing!We actually went during the May 18th ceremony, and were able to watch a video, hear a presentation (in korean), and listen to people sing. Just happened by chance.The area that this museum is in is what made the day for us. The walk around is gorgeous. Not only that but the Gwangju Folk Museum and the Gwangju National Museums is so close that you might as well do all three in one day.Keep in mind that Monday all of these places are closed! Best days to go are Tuesday to Friday."
Great rainy day tour,"We toured the art museum on a rainy day. It was full of artwork and artifacts to look at. If you're not really into either Korean history or art, then you may want to sit this one out. It is very detailed in everything and for those who do not naturally enjoy art museums, this one is not going to offer anything extraordinary for you. I really enjoyed the time spent here and would go back. "
"Nice cafe, but boring exibition","The main exibition was classic korean landscape-paintings of hills forests. They were painted in the last 10-20 years by the same artist and they where uninspirering and boring without any creative touch. We went to the child exibition and thus was actually much better. There were some provocative art made by korean artists. Also do not forget to visit the cafe - its very charming with strange, but exciting korean sweets. And you can buy nice art."
