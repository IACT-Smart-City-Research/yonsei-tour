Substantial fortress in the south of Korea,"This fortress is much more than some dusty pile of old masonry. It contains beautiful buildings, houses and a major museum. While we were there it was particularly interesting as colourful (historic) life sized manikins were everywhere, either attacking or defending the castle, or displaying aspects of life in historical times. The display overall is very impressive although a couple of bits were a bit to ""Disney"" for my liking. Like most attractions of this type in Korea the entry fee was very low. The castle walls and structures are in very good condition, parts overlook a large river. If you are in Busan I would recommend you set aside part of a day to visit Jinju and its castle. The bus from Busan drops you off a short distance from the castle, it's really worth a visit."
Beautiful fortress with amazing view,We had a great time with our friends- a large group of 11 of us ages 1-40+. I would just caution to watch young children as there are rocks without railings. 
Amazing fortress site with attractive buildings within,"This fortress has a key position on the river & easy access to the city. The site is surrounded by the fortress a walls & has various gate entrances/exits. The interior has a lovely garden feel with grassed areas & trees. There are numerous building's /temples structures to look at & access. The view from the wall across the river is great, especially when the lantern Festival is on.Within the grounds is the Jinju National museum - also worth a visit. "
"Lucious gardens, old stones, Korea remembers heroes of the Imjin Wars","It costs around 2$ to see. Stone ramparts run maybe 2km. Pavilions, Shrines, statues, altars, monuments, gates, a temple and a free national museum emerge from the forest/garden as you wander cobble stone paths.The place is maintained to remember the Imjin wars, in particular the 2 battles of Jinju, where the Fortress first repelled and then succumbed to the Japanese invaders.Heroes are remembered, patriots are honored, sacrifice is respected.Living in Korea I get a little tired of all of the historic sites dedicated to remembering how horrible the Japanese were, and how amazing and patriotic the koreans were. I get it, message received, maintaining national narrative and national identity preserved. Now can I learn about what daily life was like? How many people lived here? What did they eat? Where did their food come from? What was the relationship between the local people and the feudal overlords like? What did you need to do to be the boss of this fort? Was it a hereditary title, or were military officials appointed from the capital? Did the generals live in the fort? Where did their families live? What kinds of people worked here, and what were their jobs? Who were some significant korean historical figures who passed through here, did they say anything about the place?What objects were part of the average person's life? What were their houses like? How did humans live here?I have so many questions.... ahh... and yes, I'm lazy, and greedy...I want them answered on nice big boards in at least six languages.Yes, that is a complaint. But I really like the place, in fact I've gone twice, in Fall and in Spring.The museum and fortress are worth a visit. There are lots of places to sit and read a good book under a shady tree. The view of the river is lovely. I wish I could learn more about the daily lives of past people. But the purpose of the historical site is to remember the violence of the Imjin wars and to honour patriotic korean heroes."
Great History ,"Got to learn a great deal and accuracy on the war that was fought involving Joseon, China and Japan. The museum is new and i really enjoyed how it is curated. Simple, interactive and detailed. The artifacts were awesome especially to learn on the prowess of weaponry back in the days.Entry fee is 2000KRW.To get here from Seoul is rather time consuming. I took the Express Bus from Seoul Express Bus Terminal. It took 4 hours. Alight at the Jinju terminal. Bus will stop outside a university before the terminal.Then you have 3 choices.Walk.Turn left outside terminal.Walk and cross to the right. Walk on the left for about 15 to 20 minutes.Once you walk across a river, lookout for Jinjuseong sign. It will point to the left.Taxi.Just flag one outside the terminal.BusGo left outside terminal.Cross to the right.Walk by the left.Take Bus 130 from nearby bus stop.Alight at the 4th stop.Lookout for Jinjuseong signboard which will point to the left."
Pleasant walk in nice weather ,"While thereâ€™s not much to see in Jinju, this is definitely worth a visit. Simply strolling around is quite refreshing and gives you a good overview on the city and river below. "
More Park than Fortress,Our tour group stopped at this site during our trip from Seoul to Busan. Although this place is called a fortress but it was more like a park with several monuments to the battles with the Japanese in 1592 and 1593.Do pick up the pamphlet about Jinjuseong Fortress at the ticket office which provides pictures and descriptions of the main features of this site. Signs at the site are in both Korean and English. Expect to do plenty of walking in the sun so a hat and sunglasses are recommended along with sunscreen.
The fortress with good river view.,"CY ( 18.05.15 ) This castle had important meaning when Japanese Invasion of Korea in 1592. The castle was located beside river, and had historic event. The inside was good to walk with good river view, and had museum."
The Fortress,"Former castle/military installation which has now been converted to a memorial of sorts with nice leafy grass areas within it's walls.There are a few shrines and memorial installations on the premises and it's a good place to go for a stroll if you have any interest in Korean military history.The car park is quite small and finding a parking space is a bit difficult particularly on the weekends, so best to visit early. "
"Nice place, important history with great views over the river","This a compact fortress with many small but very interesting buildings. The statue of General Kin Si-min is quite impressive and he is obviously held in very high regard within this area, if not through the Korea....The story attached to the Uiam Rock is quite bought provoking. I'm sure you will read all about it however a lady ""Nongae"" threw herself from this famous rock killing a Japanese General and herself at he same time. Quite a sacrifice for revenge.....The memorial alter is also very special in that it commemorates the lives lost in three great historic battles.... 70,000 including civilians on one occasion...... TD a modern alter built in 1987.In summary a very interesting place to visit but important to read or have a guide to explain all the history for full impact. Certainly worth a visit."
Proud of my hometown,"jinju cattle was war place of jinju cattle war. jinju was good place of Chosen and it has much of historical means. there are many attraction the best of this is Chok suk lu. view of Chok suk lu is really good, and behind of Chok suk lu, there is 'Ui rock'. that place is nongae commit suicide together japan general after jinju cattle was fallen. and there is museum, cattle wall and cannon etc. really good.let's visit Jinju cattle"
"Great scenic fortress , at night with the Lanterns-","The fortress, does not seam that big and beautiful , but once you see it at night with the spot lights on the walls it is impressive. went during the lantern festival and it was amazing, I highly recommend it during October. the festival had a lot of vendors and activities in each side of the river. lots of nice food and merchandise. the fortress was clean and nicely presented. The Museum was closed during the festival, which was a bit of a let down."
Most interesting site to visit in Jinju,Lots to see and well maintained. This is probably the most interesting item to see & do in Jinju. I would recommed having a local take you on tour.
Pretty place to go on a nice day,"This area is very beautiful and has a great view of the river. There are steps involved, some of which are steep or uneven so may not be ideal if you have mobility issues. It is quiet and serene here."
Jinju overnight visit,"The Jinjuseong was absolutely beautiful. We visited this old fortress between 8-10 in the morning, early May. It was fresh and a nice way to start our day by walking around. The grounds are quite large and house the Jinju National Museum as well.I would highly recommend visiting this fortress in Jinju.Please see attached photos."
Nice place in Jinju,"Nice to walk around on a sunny day. Beautiful temples, statues and park. They even have explanations in English here which is useful if you want to understand what it's all about. I found the museum so-so. If you're on a tight schedule you could skip it. On the other hand you'll be out in 20-30mins. "
The floating lights festival near jinju palace,"The jinju floating lights festival is for 2 weeks in the end of October in every year. If you pay 1000 krw under $10 for festival, you enjoy watching the decorated lights at jinju palace and nam liver. There are tons of the street food with good price!"
Namgang lantern festival,Its awesome place especially during lantern festival which happen in the month of october every year. The entry fees during the lantern festival is about 10000krw. Emart is very nearby so there will not be a problem for the foriegners who cannot eat korean food.
Jinju Fortress Visit,"I was on a business trip and had some free time one morning so I walked over to this historic site from the hotel. It is a very nice, well worth the time if you are in the area. It's good representation of the area history, well maintained and some nice exhibits. It is a relatively large park like area with many monuments, buildings and displays. We walked the perimeter wall, very impressive and there are lots of good views of the surrounding city and river/bridges. There is a museum there also - I did not have time to go into this building.Definitely worth seeing if you are in the area"
Tradition and beauty,This is real.You should follow wall and garden here.Natural environment and artificial atmosphere are balanced at this castle.Let'go now!â˜†
Very informative and fun few hours,"Jinju Castle is brilliant, it's got a lovely park and a very informative museum that goes into detail about the Japanese invasions - a 3D film is also available to watch!"
Well kept fortress and park.,"I was quite taken up by this attraction for it is well kept and beautiful! The commanding view over the meadering river was just magnificient!KRW 2000 for the entrance fee is well worth paying for the historical attractions and the museum within this old fortress.Tip: The Busan to Jinju express bus runs almost every 15 minutes, from Busan Seobu Bus Terminal (above. the Sasang Subway Station) to the Intercity Bus Terminal in Jinju. The fortress is within walking distance, west of this station on the northern shoreline of the river."
A Great Escape from the Urban Sprawl,"Jinju Castle is located in Jinju, Gyeongsangnamdo, South Korea. This beautiful traditional Korean Castle is located right on the South River in this Southern Province on the Korean peninsula. The castle offers a unique respite from the urban sprawl that covers most of South Korea. Unlike other such traditional architecture in the country, this site is relatively untouched by rampant urbanization. The castle has a large open area just inside the entrance with grass that you can actually walk on, which is uncommon in South Korea, where a lot of grass is off limits or seemingly untouchable locations. The castle is the ideal backdrop to the small city. You can walk through the grounds, stopping at the pagodas located in sever as well as a cafÃ© and museum. Signage throughout the area tells you of the sites history. There is an ideal location in the park for picnics, which seems like a slightly more modern Central park. The aforementioned open space is not altogether unlike Sheepâ€™s Meadow in Central Park where people go to relax almost like a day at the beach. Though sometimes the staff asks you to vacate the grassy area, this can be a peaceful retreat from the seemingly endless National Hustle."
Interesting historical fortress in Jinju,"This fortress is settled along the Nam River, where a battle took place with the Japanese. There are many great photo ops, and the history is incredible. I would recommend visiting during the annual Lantern Festival in early October."
Nice Park,"Pretty cool overall. Good open space, very cool architecture. Would probably be better in the spring or summer!"
Pretty cool,"I came here at night. There were not many people. You can walk around it. I was very cool. The walls, design, and the landscape are awesome"
Nice park,"This park it nice! i lean Korea story from there.It is oldest some King palace.nice threes,nice around over there."
Jinju Fortress,A very educational experience for us all. You can definitely see Korean culture and history at this place.
Jinju Fortress,"Here is some background ""Jinjuseong Fortress, which is historically linked to the Japanese invasion in 1592, was originally named Geoyeolseong Fortress during the Three Kingdom Period, later renamed as Chokseokseong Fortress in the Goryeo Dynasty and finally settled as Jinjuseong Fortress in the Joseon Dynasty. ""Anyway, this place fortress was a key area for protection of Korean penisula from Japanese invasion. There is a small fee for entrance and wide parking spaces are available. The place has been designated as historic site number 118. Come and see the history of Korea."
Close to the city center and beautiful view on a river.,"Everything is good for this place. Take lots of pictures. Good memories. There is a museum inside of the park, which is free with limited open hours. We could not make it because we arrived at too early. "
Korean fortress,"Jinju fortress has long and high wall that run around there are signs in English ,it played important role as outpost on Japanese invasion in 16 century,it will be worth visit for people interesting on history."
Tranquil and historical,"I spent an hour here walking around, despite the freezing cold and also spent much of the night on New Years Eve. On both occasions I had a very interesting introduction to some of the history and culture of South Korea. I particularly enjoyed spending time at the temple and walking the rolling path around the perimeter."
Beautiful and full of history,This is a beautiful site along the river. There are expansive parklands and wonderful views. On site they have traditional battle demonstrations and there are a few pavillions. To get the most from it you should go with a guide who can explain the history of this fortress and the battles that took place here. If you are in the area you should definitely see this - not worth a trip from Seoul however.
historic place,"Get ready to walk, and don't miss the 4D movie about the history of this castle, and i suggest that you go in October when the festival star 1 -15, or go in fall to see the most beautiful colourful view. Every saturday morning they make a traditional show with Hanbok, nice place really"
Great setting,Visiting during the October lantern festival is the best time to go. Good setting on the river and in with a good park to explore.
Visit during one of the festivals,"I've been to Jinjuseong many times. It's a typical Korean fortress that has been turned into a public park essentially. Last I checked admission was $1, but they frequently do events during which times it is free. The national museum is inside the fortress and there is a place to try out archery behind the museum. Located in the furthest reaches from the entrances (both of them) is a small temple, where warrior monks were trained. As a tourist site though, the temple is not very thrilling. During the Lantern festival or Nonggae festival are the prime times to visit Jinjuseong. Nonggae festival is in April or May and the Lantern Festival is in the first two weeks of October, usually the first to the tenth. During the Nonggae festival they have traditional games and arts to learn. The lantern festival is probably Jinju's biggest attraction and there is always something going on for that week and a half. "
Jinju Fortress,"This is a nice place to walk around for a few hours if you happen to be in Jinu. It is right on the river, hilly in places, and a good place for pictures. A lot of the signs are in English as well as Korean. Interesting history. Make sure to visit Uiam Rock. It also over looks the music fountain, which we didn't go to, but looked cool from the fortress. It's free, but they do sell tickets maybe for the museum outside the gates- you don't need a ticket to walk in the park. I think the museum is closed on Mondays because it was closed when we were there. If you are looking for the ""silk factory"", it is just across the street from the East entrance of the fortress (opposite side from music fountain). There was also a good bibimbap. We just walked in and held up two and some people helped us out. I think there was only a few things on the menu, but it was great! "
Not as touristy as othe Korean towns,"Very kind people. Not touristy, but still had some western things. The fortress there by the river is really cool. And the botanical gardens about 30 minutes out of town are a fun place to spend the day with a picnic."
Pleasant enough place for a stroll,"There's not much to see here except a few old pavilions and the Jinju National Museum, which has extensive displays on the Imjin War. Still, it's a nice spot for a relaxing stroll and has good views of the Nam River. "
Lantern Festival in October is highly recommended,Jinju is the site of a Lantern Festival in October and there are many lanterns along the fortress and along the river. It is highly recommended to book a hotel well in advance as I couldn't find one when I looked the day of the event. The fortress is fairly interesting and was the site of a huge battle during the Imjin War. There is also a museum within the fortress.
