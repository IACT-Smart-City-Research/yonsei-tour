OOTD Place,Located inside COEX Mall. Beautiful library for OOTD. tried to find en English book but it was none - but love it anyway. 
Library in a bustling shopping mall!,What a great idea to place a library in a bustling shopping mall. A must visit place if you are fancy taking extraordinary picture for your Instagram. 
Staggering Display of books,"Admittedly, I got teary eyed when I saw all of those books with readers of all ages sitting everywhere. This public library reminded me that some parts of the world values reading BOOKS & MAGAZINES, not just texts or social media. Do visit if you're in the area & then head to the Lotte World Tower, 5th tallest building in the world."
Nice and Big Library,"We were just be there to take photo as all the books are majority korean language.Opposite the mall is Beomosa, there is walking distance but nearby."
Over-rated,It's too crowded with tourists who are just taking photos there. Pity those people who really needed a place to do their work
Smaller than I expected - blame IG,"I was expecting to be awe-struck But it was a ""library""/ bookstore inside COEX mallStill, worth a pic for instagram . Beware: lots of other people there for the same reason. "
Looks like something out of Harry Potter!,This was so not what I was expecting to find in the middle of a shopping mall - an enormous beautifully laid out library full of people of all ages browsing a reading rather than being on their phones. Amazing!
A little noisy.,"It was too crowded with people taking pictures, and noisy. It's an open area library with cafes around. The ambience wasn't my cup of tea and I was only here to take pictures."
Loved this,"I’m not sure this would be worth making a special trip to visit, but we were already in the area to visit Bonguensa temple (just over the road from the COEX Mall) so came in to see the library. It is wonderful - as book lovers it was a real jaw dropping sight! I can’t really imagine a UK shopping mall having a public library as a centrepiece..."
Every mall should have one!,"Wonderful resource in the middle of the mall. For non-Korean readers, the offerings are a bit limited as most of the books are in Korean. Nevertheless, there is a great selection of English magazines. Very enjoyable to sit, people watch and take photos (which is what most were doing). Having said all that, it is a great idea and other malls would do well to follow suit, even with a small/modest collection, if only to encourage people to read."
More akin to Barnes & Noble,"So this was so neat to see, it's a beautfiul library, however, it's just too crowded with people grabbing the most insta-worthy picture. I felt a bit like Belle must have in Beauty and the Beast when she saw all those books in the massive library, but I was pretty sure I couldn't read any. We left after only 10 minutes here because it was just too crowded and noisy."
Really entertaining for people watching,"I wouldn't quite call this a must-see attraction. As a library - it's pretty, but it's not particularly large. Also all the books are in Korean (no surprise).What makes it more appealing is how comfortable the surroundings are (you can grab a comfortable chair, and there's a good bakery on the second level for coffee and dessert) and just how entertaining it can be if you need a bit of a rest and want to do some people watching. Interesting to watch all the people go through taking photos, selfies, staging full on photo shoots fully dressed up and posing as they ride up and down the escalator."
Picturesque Library ,"This is a unique library in the middle of a mall and convention center. Not sure how functional it is, but it makes a unique spot in the mall. "
Bright open and airy space (except for the noise!),"Situated in an upmarket shopping Mall (Coex), it seems an odd place to place a public library. It's definitely noisy and not the greatest place for a library. The upper levels are definitely better for reading and all the seats and desks are occupied most of the time. However, if you're into a look rather than a feel, it's definitely worthwhile walking through amongst the sea of books and look for the best place to take some photos. The books displayed on the upper open shelves are just boxes with a title page stuck on them. Practically speaking there would have been no easy way to access them so they are there purely for show. If you're near or in Coex (eg going to SM Tower), it's worth coming past."
Typical KOrean site- Instagrammable and totally pointless,It's not like the books on those gorgeous shelves are accessible. You can't really read b/c of the noise even if you could snag one of the few chairs. They spent a lot of $ on construction - b/c Insta publicity is more valuable than anything else.
If in the area walk in,"This place is impressive. I would not invest time to go there, but if by coincidence you are in the area (e.g. because of your hotel), walk in and sit down for some minutes on the upper level seats. "
"Best photoshoot, library theme","This library is bright, looks fabulous and offers the best place to take photos with books.The location is very convenient for leisure and shopping.We did not browse the book lists though."
Modern Library,"It is a library where you can take a very instagrammable pictures. Stunning design of the skyhigh book racks. If you really want to read a book, i would say that the environment is quite noisy as it is accessible to COEX shopping mall with many people walking around. A korea entertainment industry is also there and if you are a K-pop fans, you’ll gone crazy looking at your idol’s posters."
Upscale mall,"It is inside the Starfield Mall which is an upscale one, easily accessible on Line 2. If you are going to Gangnam anyway, it is worth going. You will like to take some photo of the place and do some shopping in the mall, which is one of the best in the city. There are a lot of choice of restaurant. If you have the time, you may also visit the aquarium which is quite nice."
Inspirational - a beacon in a sea of shops,"Who would have thought to place a library in the middle of a shopping mall, near Samseong Metro Station? It was genius who brought this to life with such an inspired design.Starfield Library has four stacks - eight layers of books mostly for display - one at each corner of a square. There are books and magazines accessible to the public, at shelf level. There are chairs and desks to sit at to read them, which were all well used. It's a busy buzzing place.Take it in slowly, and explore the Library from all angles, and on both levels, to absorb the genius. Take a spare chair. Listen to the tinkling piano music.Then indulge another sense - taste - and go to the Billy Angel Cake shop on the upper level in one of the stacks and enjoy their famous carrot cake and a long tea. Then go back into the mall inspired by an architectural marvel."
Short View Of Library,Went all the way to this place..saw the library inside a mall but never did get a chance at all to look at the shops inside the mall. Wasted day spent with a person who would rather shop at markets instead..
Harry Potter in Korean is here :),"Gangnam can be a bit of a trek by metro is you are staying in Jongno or near Namsan but if you want to visit a cool mall, Coex is fun. The library is a great Instagram spot and you can have the fun of checking out Harry Potter books in Korean and the Star Wars novels in Korean as well."
Underwhelming,"Pretty cool stack of books in the middle of a busy/popular mall. Not sure that it qualifies as a library and I cannot imagine that there is any hope of getting work/studying done here. Hugely popular spot for taking pictures - lots of individuals/couples/families taking pictures all over the place to the point where it is 1. impossible to get a picture without getting someone else posed in yours 2. impossible to avoid getting into someone else's picture. If you are at the Coex mall for another reason it is worth visiting - not worth the trip just to see the ""library""."
Amazing design,This is such a great place to relax while you wait at the mall. It's filled with books and magazines you can read for free and they have desks like a library where some locals study or read. The shops around are also international brands.
Good not Enough,"I love the interior design,Everyone appreciates around there, But staff is not friendly / there is someone who wears glasses with White shirt/ Guy which is i asked about take a photo of me he said just NO, and staring at me like noONe. Bad experienced for solo traveller"
A very cool library,"I went to this library the first day I came to Seoul. It is really big and really nice. I could have spent hours there just watching all the books.There is also a cafe. Some people also try to study there but I wasn't sure if they really succeed. For me, it's a little bit too loud for studying but the sit there, read a book, drink a coffee or tea, it's fantastic."
Awesome Library,"I was so amazed by how big this library is! This was so strategically located, so it can easily be accessed by locals and tourists alike."
Noisy library but fantastic vibes,"Given it’s proximity to the Co-Ex museum, this was meant to be a pit stop for me to tick off my Seoul list. However we stayed for a longer than expected time, taking in the tall structures (3 in all) and how they have been categorised.There’s a whole lot of movement and noise (not your conventional library) and obviously Korean books make up 95% of all the books here. Interesting to see that there are donated books -both by large corporates/ Foundations and by individuals.There is a very short write up to the library in Korean with a smithing (subtitled mainly) of English -which i had fed back to the information counter, was insufficient.Spoiler alert: middle to TOP layers are “fake books” according to the lady at the counter... don’t quote me coz it could be lost in translation; but frankly, it didn’t make much difference if that was the truth ;)"
Huge and beautiful library ,The library is probably more for photo taking then books reading. Undoubtedly very instagramable. While it isn’t totally silent yet it is not noisy. Problem is that it is very crowded. Still glad that I came. 
Very big library,"This library is huge with an amazing interior and place to enjoy your time. There are quite a lot selection of books that you can choose. However, almost all of the books that provided in here were in Korean. But it's a good place to take pictures also "
massively beautiful,"Lovely place and a must visit while in Seoul. This library is at the Coex Mall, so there is a lovely Mall adjacent to this. Lots of restaurants and cafes, even McDonald's. Lots of photo opportunities. there is a duty free area downstairs as well, so you can purchase alcohol, cigarettes etc duty free, just remember your passport."
Impressive,I heard about this place but definitely have to visit the place in person to realize the crazy nature of the design and the architecture. Highly recommend.
Kids can read for free,If your staying around the area in the hotels this is a good place to meet up if you lose each other. I came her with my family with 4 kids. Ranging from 9years to 7 months. We rested on couches and read some books to the kids so they could take a break from the heat. 
Instagrammable,"I don't think it's worth traveling to, but it was a cool experience for the first 10 minutes. Maybe if you're bored with your friends and are in the area, but as it's a bit out of the way, I think if your time is limited in Seoul/Korea, then your time could be used for something else. This is something that I would recommend more for someone who was living in Seoul and was looking for something else to experience than someone who's traveling to Seoul/South Korea and has limited time here."
Wow,One of the highlights of this trip. How good is a library in a mall? People were using it from early morning to late at night. It is just a wonderful resource and piece of design. I just kept coming back to enjoy
Busy nice library ,This is a library in the middle of the Coex mall. Most tourists are busy taking photos. Huge library and beautiful in this building. Turn left when you get out of the station facing SM town
Beautiful!,I haven't been to a library with this unique layout. Massive number of books and areas to study and read. It was relatively quiet compared to the amount of people who were passing through. Great place for a book lover!
A beautiful library!,"This library is very inviting as a place to sit and read for hours, or take photos. Not sure if there are any English books, but there were all kinds of Korean books. It's worth visiting if you want an Instagrammable travel photo. "
Impressive,"Just like pics. Really an impressive place, especially by night with all the lights. Even without stopping to take a book, the library itself make you feel small. A funny thing is that when you go upstairs, there are coffee shops and small stores between the shelves.The COEX Mall in its whole is really a cool place to go shopping!"
Just like in pics,"If you are around, definitelly nice to see, but for tourist there is not much more than what you see in pictures. "
Starfield Library in COEX – Paradise for BOOK LOVERS,"If you are in Seoul City (South Korea) you must visit Gangnam District. If you visit Gangnam then you must visit COEX. In COEX there are lots of Shopping Malls, Restaurants, Coffee shops, Hotels, Playing area.. you name it. Everything is there. But there is one place you should not skip while you are in COEX. “THE STARFIELD LIBRARY” Its free of entry. I visited and I was amazed with the library. The library is gigantic, unique and believe me lots and lots of books. (Check my pictures – you can feel it)It’s a paradise for book lovers! I would say its worth to visit and you will love it."
Quite unique for a shopping mall,"We were walking through Coex and Starfield when we passed by this library. It looks stunning, towers of books and books, in the middle of the mall. It is like an oasis in the hustle and bustle of Coex. People grab books , sit down and read, just like in a library.Quite stunning overall."
Interesting,"How books became an element of decor ? Well, that place is probably showing the way. If you are looking for literature, pass your way. But if you want to see people reading ""for the dummies"" while shopping, you won't be disapointed. "
A Star In The Centre Of Starfield,"A stunning example of design in this sprawling underground shopping mall. Take time to enjoy the ceiling as well. Such a great place to watch people taking selfies, especially while going up and down the escalators! Back in the days when I used to buy many books I would have gone sick in this bookshop!"
Gigantic and photogenic library,The library is located in department store so it's easy to find. It's really beautiful place and cool to visit. It's a instagram hot spot that you shouldn't miss.
Beautiful crossroads between mall streets,"Books, books everywhere! A nice place to visit especially if you are thinking of shopping in the malls as well. You can also just pop in to see it and enjoy a coffee or snack at one of the cafes or shops located inside the giant cornerstone bookshelves, accessed via escalators to the second floor."
Amazing,Love this library. Its fancy... but simply artistic. Ive taken multiple selfies during my visit. I passed this site multple times as this is near the venue of our convention.
Books Stonehenge,"Smack in the middle of COEX mall, with no doors and all open access, you will find this monument to printed books. Natural light filters in from the ceiling and the sides of the mall (the largest below-ground mall in Asia), illuminating the gigantic bookshelves with carefully-placed books, giving a first impression of wonderment and spaciousness. Part library and part tourist attraction, it is likely that the tourists taking pictures outnumber the actual library patrons, though the patrons linger with a book in one of the many seats arranged in the hall, and the tourists snap pictures and move on. A cafe is conveniently located in the premises, for those who want something sweet with their reading. The concept is very interesting, as it appears like a space for boundless access to information. But in this day and age, when printed books are quickly being replaced by electronic media, this library is a work of art that could be interpreted in many ways by the diverse audience..."
A Must See in COEX Mall !,"Speaking personally, I think that the idea of having a library in the middle of a bustling mall is utterly genius. Starfield library is a perfect place to gather and have a read-fest, or to have your shopping break."
Library with giant bookshelves!,"A library with giant bookshelves, what do you expect? Certainly an iconic place and must be visited! You can relax while reading a book here, of course you can also take dozens of photos. Its location inside a shopping place makes it quite comfortable."
Booklover's Paradise,"Booklover's unite! Located in the center of Coex Mall is this dreamy and welcoming place called the Starfield Library. Note that since it is inside a mall, there is a constant hum of noise and activity so it is not like the typical library you may familiar with but it is worth a visit nonetheless. Rounded and lighted bookshelves stretch far above your head and are simply mesmerizing to see. You can sit on the steps below the bookshelves or at any of the various tables located throughout. Pictures do not do this gem justice."
Incredible!,"Let me know if you find out how they get to those books right at the top!! All in Korean, of course, but spectacular and it's part of the mall."
keep the expectations low,"this was the main reason to why i went over to coex starfield mall. and boy was i disappointed. i was expecting like multi-leveled library but it was just a two floor library. don't get me wrong, it is quite the sight but i was expecting too much. it is good to see see, but that's about it. every around is using the spaces like a library"
Calm in the sea of shops,"This place is really a god send in the large COEX mall and really you can not believe you stepped into a library. Public space meets a library, where people indeed linger and enjoy themselves. One element to make a simple mall stand out."
Starfield Library at COEX Mall,"Being tourists in Seoul, we went to the Starfield COEX Mall primarily to to see and take photos of the huge Starfield Library. And, indeed it was huge, and photo-worthy. 5 stars."
Holiday ,I thought books in original printed form would become extinct. Not here. The place is amazing and definitely worth a visit. Seeing people sitting and reading was an unbelievable experience. 
Stunning design ,"Excellent for photo-taking! Most of the books were in Korean so we could not understand it at all. Nonetheless, the library itself was beautiful and we ended up taking many pictures there. "
Book Lovers Paradise,"We stumbled upon this library inside the Starfield Coex Mall and we were quite surprised with its eyecatching design and thousands of available books that rose all the way to the glass ceiling. That ceiling also greatly added to the ambiance and let in lots of natural light during the day. Both Korean and foreign books were displayed here covering many different subjects and all could be retrieved for your reading pleasure.During our visit, it seemed more tourists than book readers were present. However there were a lot of different places to read and enjoy your book or sit back and people watch."
unique library style,the only reason i visit this gangnam area is because of this library.worth to have a look at this place.
Unique Library,"When you should visit Starfield Shopping Mall at Coex you should visit this unique library.Free of entry , the setting is really extraordinary."
