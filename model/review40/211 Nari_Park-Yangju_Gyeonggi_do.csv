The park was closed!,Traveled 1.5hrs just to find out the park is already closed. They should have put a notice somewhere to notify the tourists. Last year they closed the park Nov but it is only mid of Oct and it is already closed. So dissapointing.
Yangju Nari park,Beautiful scenery . Beautiful flowers. Many Photographer there to capture nice shot. Even have photography take photo foe me and my daughter. Different season different flowers bloom.
The Park is close on NOV!,Its terrible that there is so little information for some of the attraction in Korea. We travel 1 hr plus from Myeongdong and was told that the park was close on end Oct! It is such a disappointment and wasted our time traveling. Lucky we ask the tour information counter at the station before we board the bus. 
Beautiful garden of flowers,"This place is a beautiful garden of flowers. Went there in mid October and the flowers were already violet and pinkish. Nothing else to see really, just the flowers. I suggest going in the late afternoon to have a better sunset lighting. Itâ€™s also very easy to go here. Entrance is 2000 won."
Normal park,"There's nothing here except some kinds of flowers. I think we should go to Soyosan first. After that, we can come back to Nari park if we have any freetime."
Beautiful and large flower garden,"This is an emerging attraction out of Seoul. Good to visit and see many flowers.- Lots of visitors come by driving and parking lots were big enough.- by subway & bus: After getting off at Yangju metro station (line #1), escape through exit #2. Cross the road and take bus #77-1 or #80. Bus stop name for Nari Park is Haedong Maeul. 20~30 min from Yangju Station. No need to worry if you don't know where to get off. Because lots of people head to Yangju Nari Park.- Starting from Yangju metro station, there are continuous food stalls. They are very affordable. Fruits and vegetables are much cheaper than Seoul.- In the park, there are zucchini tunnels, flower gardens, observation hill, etc.- Open from September to October. Zinnia Festival in September is the best time to visit.- Entrance is just 2,000 won. And there are many conditions to pay less.- We were surprised to see many foreign tourists even though this is a quite new site."
Absolutely stunning and beautiful!,"Came across a picture of Nari Park and I felt the urge to visit, so I went on a day trip from Seoul the next day. It was the best choice I ever made during my trip as I was absolutely amazed by the sea of flowers at Nari Park! Highly recommended to visit and I will definitely return again next time. It's only about 1.5h away from Seoul, easily accessible by subway and bus. "
