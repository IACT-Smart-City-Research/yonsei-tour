First hike in South Korea,Was very excited at the opportunity to climb Gyeyangsan. Set out on a foggy Sunday afternoon with my 13 year old daughter. We both enjoyed the hike immensely. The views were spectacular...at one point were walked through mists that made it seem otherworldly. The people we met on the way were friendly and welcoming. Looking forward to other hikes in South Korea. 
Best Mountain in Incheon,Gyeyang Mountain is easy to find just walk up the hill from Gyesan Station (Incheon Line 1). There are few shops along the same road to buy supplies.The mountain can be busy on weekends and a little tricky for those not used to hiking.Nice views across Northern Incheon await those to complete the climb.
