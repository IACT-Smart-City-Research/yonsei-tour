Cute store,"While walking around in Sinsa, I decided to pop into Stretch Angels attracted by its colorful facade. I really liked the interiors of the store. I ended up trying a few purse-pouches on and decided to buy one because I liked the way it felt and was actually looking to buy a pouch. The interior decor is really interesting and cleverly designed. "
