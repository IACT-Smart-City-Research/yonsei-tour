Good climb worthy of the view of Mokpo City and also the seaward,"Its a good climb, about an hour maximum, which does not require any special climbing tackles/ shoes other than flat. There are well trodden path with steps and guide ropes. There is a sculpture park on the way."
Easy walk with great views and sunset hot spot.,Parking your car at the entrance will cost you only 1000 won.Then a walk to the top gives various route options.The climb is reasonably easy and the time is less than an hour.The view from one sides shows the Mokpo Bridge which will give a great view if you stay till sunset.Plus a great view of the city light up at night.
Easy and beautiful climb to the peak ,"A local family drove us after dinner to the places near the peak of the yudal mountain park. Along the way the city and harbor view are beautiful. We stopped halfway to view the harbor and locals liked the coffee from the vending machine near car park. On reaching the peak, we had an easy climb to the park where the view was beautiful. We met a Korean family of multiple generations. One young girl spoke English and she studies at the Yale-NUS college of NUS, returning for summer to visit home."
Very nice view!,"A must see in Mokpo! Very nice way up to the top. Enjoy the view. The way up is not to hard, even my parents made it."
Hike in the late evening,(1) Do prepare yourself for a strenuous activity. (2) Not much to see. Just the view from the top once you reach.
Not the most spectacular view,"The hike to the top was nice even though there was no English signage to indicate which path to take. However, the view of Mokpo from the top was nothing special in my opinion. There's not much else to do in Mokpo though so it's still worth half a day's visit."
"Nice walk, good views of the city","It's not a difficult walk up this hill, on stone-paved paths. There are a few pavilions at various levels, each offering views of Mokpo city below. On a clear day, you'll also see the sea and islands. You won't be solitary because it is quite a popular place for Korean domestic tourists, but even when I went on a Saturday, it wasn't too busy. Mokpo was done as a daytrip from Gwangju via fast train. No rush at all."
Fantastic view,"Walked up here on Sunday morning. Lots of others doing the same. Quite an easy walk and really good views at the top. Well cut out steps to climb on. Not much signage, just keep heading up!"
Beautiful morning outing,"Started the hike on a rainy morning.... but picked up a $6 umbrella at the store at the bottom of the steps (good thing, it rained all day). Even in the rain, the steps were not awful slippery, but must watch your step as they are stone, and laid by hand. That is part of the beauty of this place. The walk up, taking 10 minutes on each stop to admire the view, took less than 90 minutes with a purposeful step. But can be done in much less time if wanted. Very nice views all the way up, but the best view is reserved for the very top stone lookout. It is open to the elements, and must watch the rain and wind when up there. Several shops along the way to get drinks, snacks, and souvenirs, and misc hiking paraphernalia.. Great morning adventure. "
Come here to enjoy a nice view,The area is very extended and you can enter through different pathways. There is a lot to hike and a lot to see. A lot of couples come here to enjoy the view together. Since there are different paths one can enjoy the view on the city or on the seaside. You have a nice view on the bridge too.
Best views of Mokpo,"Yudalsan (san means mountain; so if you say it in English, it is Yudal Mountain). This is a must see stop when in Mokpo! There are several ways to approach the summit. For those looking for a hiking workout while ascending Yudal, you will want to start your hike at the base of Yudal, from Haeyangdaehak-ro, just past Yudal-ro. The path is quite obvious. I would describe the effort as moderate from this point. At the top of the mountain, there are two peaks and views of the city, the Mokpo Bridge and the islands are spectacular! On our second visit to Yudalsan, we approached from the Eastern most end, and this took us through the older part of town. At this end of Yudalsan, we were able to see the statue of Admiral Yi Sun Shin. There are a lot of steps on this approach, however it is an easier trek than the previously mentioned hiking route. There are several sights on Yudalsan, such as ""Sculpture Park"" and the temples. Also of note, Yudalsan is illuminated at night and is easy to use as a landmark both day and night."
Great views and an easy walk,"A walk up to the two peaks of Yudal Mountain is a rewarding experience. It only takes around an hour to get up to the tallest peak and each turn gives you better and better views. There are lots of places to stop, rest, take photos and even picnic if it takes your fancy! Some of the paths are very steep or the steps may be small so make sure you wear trainers or comfy shoes. We really enjoyed using the opportunity to get our bearings in Mokpo as it is our new home. I know well will climb Yudal many more times yet!"
Watching scenery of sea shores,"Though it's not that high, there are many trails you can try, not just rock stairs from the entrance. On the top, you can see various islands around the coast."
Great views,"It was a short and easy hike. Great views for a fall afternoon. The steps were a little steep in some places coming down, but it was a really nice walk. "
Awesome Hiking ,"Although this mountain is in the city, it features beautiful, well kept and designed trails with gorgeous views of Mokpo. This is a must see if you are in the area."
Nice Hike,Once you get to the mountain it is a fairly short hike to the top. You can start at the Yudalson Sculpture Park and continue. There are 2 peaks. The highest one is the highest peak in Mokpo.
Short Interesting Hike,"A short walk from the train station brings you to the foot of this 'mountain', it's only around 200m high but a pleasant and fairly gentle hike brings you to the top which gives great views over the city and surrounding islands. No map is really required just keep going up the main path.I did this hike on a very hot day but there are shelters to rest and provide shade at regular intervals and a couple of places to get refreshments.After reaching the top I walked down the far side towards the University and followed the promenade back around the coast to the town."
If you're in Mokpo,"Hiking up Yudal Mountain is a really beautiful site. On one side are the views of the city and on the other there is the port. It's a really nice hike up the mountain, with various statues, pavillions and historical information to take in. If you're in Mokpo and the weather is nice go take a hike!"
Hike well worth it for the fantastic views!,"Stairs and a well maintained, tree-lined path, complete with pristine pagodas make this area of Mokpo a must see. The views from the top are spectacular, the city of Mokpo and its adjacent harbour spread out below your feet. There's a rest stop with food, drink and bathrooms for the weary traveller. But most won't need to stop here as this hike proves friendly to even the most novice of trekkers."
Make time for visiting here,"Fantastic vantage point for views of Mokpo and gives you a break from the city. Obviously best if the weather is fine, as it was when we visited. Views can be hampered in pour weather."
Must Do Yudalsan Mountain,"Amazing views with every step you took, places to rest on the climb up the many steps, very well cared for and maintained . The pavilions beautifully decorated and welcome shade to rest under.Nothing to dislike!"
Historically fun and great views,Very brief hike to the top. The views are great for a mountain on the edge of town. It is mostly stairs the whole way up with many places to break and have a picnic or drink some soju. I cant explain why they play the traditional music over the loud speakers but it makes for a unique experience.
Hiking and climbing in the heart of Mokpo.,"Sea views (a spectacular sunset), pleasant hiking and two rock climbing crags. Yudalsan is my main destination whenever I am in Mokpo. The villages that flank it's base are authentic and worth exploring!"
Enjoy the view of Mokpo!,"This mountain near the harbour provides visitors with great views of Mokpo and neighbouring islands. If you are not looking for a difficult day of hiking, this is the mountain for you. The trail up to the first of the three peaks has well maintained paths and paved steps. If you are willing to explore, there is a lot for you to see. This mountain also has rock carvings, a temple, an outdoor sculpture park, and many spots worth finding."
