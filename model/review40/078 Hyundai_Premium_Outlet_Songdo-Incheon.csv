"Great deals, lots of choices and fantastic food court","Travelling from Seoul is long but convenient and totally worth it. We spent whole day at this place as more than 50% of their shops have some very good deals. Some deals are not even displayed so there is good awards for pile diggers.Foodcourt has many great choices, and Metro takes you straight to the heart of this outlet.Highly recommended shopping experience."
Free wi-fi,"Safe place to sit and while away the time. Free Wi-Fi. Unless you want expensive shops, this is not the place to come. Good food court."
Nice Place to Hang Out for a While,"The feel of the outlet is that it is relatively new, so there are empty spaces as you walk through. The food court has some good chains and has a good variety of offer."
Amazing place for shopping and eating,"I. Love. This. Outlet. It is my favorite outlet in all of Korea. They have amazing restaurants and stores with style, and you can go here yourself, with kids, with the elderly, with family, with anyone!"
"This post is not going to be about Hyundai outlets, which is a really wonderful place. Its gonna be about CU shop","I couldnt find it in Trp advisor. But do really want to share the experience. Well, CU shops are something like DAISO but smaller. They are very famous in Incheon, South Korea.Usually I shop at CU which is in the Any Ocean Building. In the evenings the cashiers are youung people, if Im not mistaken 1 guy and 1 girl. They are OK. But in the morning a pretty old lady works there and she is quite aggressive. I bought coffee powder and usually koreans can make coffee inside the shop, but she refused to give me the cup. I even said that I can buy it but she refused. I really liked Incheon and the majority of people are very friendly. But cant help and must say that such situations darken the whole perception."
"Great shopping, great food, very Clean",This place you could spend a whole day easily. The outlets have excellent prices and plenty to choose from. There must be around 100 shops from sunglasses to premium Sports shoes everything you want top to bottom. I really enjoyed the bakery but sadly I only had 2.5 hrs but needed 6. I would like to come back.
Excellent array of choices,"From sports clothes to luxury items, this was an outlet mall that offered more than the usual fare of outlet goods, Prices were fair, choices outstanding. Amazing food court. "
Amazing Mall To Visit,"If you happen to be in the Songdo area, make sure to visit the Hyundai Outlet. It has everything you could think of â€” restaurants, cafes, chain stores, famous brands, etc. "
Fun for all ages,"Shops are kind of high end, food choices from Premium Market food hall at the basement are great. There is a Champion gym where you can drop off the kids (younger kids need to be accompanied, but if your kids are between 7 - 12, they should be able to explore on their own and have fun) for a couple of hours, so you can take time to shop around. In the neighbourhood, you will find Triple Street and Plus Mall for brands such as Zara and the likes, so cheaper option. The mall is 30mins taxi ride from Incheon airport, so if you have a day to kill, not a bad idea, as for Metro station, it is right at Techno Park."
3 hr is not enough,"Hyundai Premium Outlet Songdo , Divided into 2 zones. The area is wide enough. There should be at least 5 hours."
Good selection of food ,"B1 is full of restaurants and they range from $8~12 per dish. A good place to eat and relax. Merchandise at the outlet isn't cheap when compared to outlets in Europe or in the US. A good place to hang out and to kill time. Also, currently parking is free."
Good Restaurants & Events,"There are numerous and diverse types of shopping malls and complexes in Songdo and Incheon. The Hyundai Premium Outlet Songdo becomes a must-visit site after being opened. Many shops but more many great restaurants. Many local and business people visit there on weekdays, but more people and travellers visit there on weekends. Also many events there!"
Worth visiting now after Triple Street opened next door,"A good outlet with lots of shops and fantastic food court. The above ground floors are mostly occupied by luxury brands and several restaurants. The more interesting (at least for me) part is the underground level B1. Here you can find more affordable clothing, a lego shop, Kyobo bookstore, electronics, cosmetics and cheaper brands overall. Lots of sales and discounts year round. The foodcourt offers a large choice of korean and foreign dishes at good prices and stalls sell baked goods and tasty desserts. If that is not enough, have a look at Triple Street, another big shopping complex that opened this year next door. There you will find more shops and restaurants and also Megabox cinema. If you come by car, there is plenty of free parking available or take the Incheon Subway Line 1 and get of Technopark station."
Restaurants serve tasty food,"My first experience to premium outlet in Korea. It is a very relaxing place with most of famous brands for shop. You could buy with discount rate and tax refund, so be careful for buying too much. The restaurants operate at the centre hall, you can take the seat outdoors to enjoy the sunshine. I chose a Thai noodle with miller draft was fantastic lunch in this sunny day. "
High prices!,The outlet is brain new but the prices are high. It has an easy access by metro. Good place to go if you are not looking for cheap things to buy. as the ones we find at a real outlet. 
Nit your typical outlet mall,I was not sure if I was in an outlet mall or a Westfield [for those in Australia and USA and UK that may be meaningful]he atmosphere was like any good quality mall but it was supposedly an outlet mall- milleau nice- facilities nice [even the bathrooms]definitely woth the experience
New premium outlet in Songdo - Incheon,It's very new in Songdo. A lot of shops and brands with special price. There are also Premium Market with high quality of products and many restaurants & cafe.
Big and lots of shopping,"It's really BIG and offer lots of shopping. Depending on which country you compare, the price and discount are acceptable. The restaurants can be quite pricey but the premium market at B1 offer very good food at good price."
Quick shopping! ,"Outlet stores are Great! Both Nike and Adidas! Also other high end brands are there like Coach, RayBan, UniQlo etc. food stalls serves mostly Korean dishes. "
Outlet with a great food court,"Personally this place is very closed to my house, I can get there within 5 min by walk.I am not sure what the premium outlet is meaning, this place is easy to acess for everyone, pretty mordernized than the many outlets that I visited all over the countries.For the point of selling price, this is not so attractive but for the point of foods, this is the best for everyone except that the price is pretty expensive; from the basement floor to 3rd floor, there are many food shops there, mot of them are famous for their taste & quality, I mean that they all approved from the peoples for a long time..On the roof floor(3rd floor?) I remember there was a small merry-go round.There is a subway station connecting directly to this place, I recommend that pleasedon't use a private car if you are planning to visit on weekend, you may have to spend pretty much time in your car before you enter the parking place."
