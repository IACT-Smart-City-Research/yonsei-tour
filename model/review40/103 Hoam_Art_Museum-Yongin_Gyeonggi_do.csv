Serene and Peaceful Park,The Museum is secondary for the visit . We came here for the Cherry Blossom which is blooming. The trees along the road is fully bloom.Its a great for a picnic and relaxation overlooking the lake and hill.
"Beautiful place, garden and surroundings",The museumbis located in a beatiful place which is more than half the experience. The garden is lovely and some of the stone sculptures wonderful. As a foreigner it was somewhat difficult to understand the art even if we had a guide. I would have needed some more pre-knowledge about Korean history to fully appreciate the museum. Still a visit there would be worth it especially during more beautiful months like spring or fall.
Absolutely stunning!,"Make sure you stop by to see Korean masters if you are an art junkie. They have an impressive facility, view and landscape that encompasses the work very well. I think its a place where you wont feel crowded, disturbed and may be a great place to enjoy a cup of tea and scenery with your lover or family. Very laid back and secluded from everything, you must be willing to drive here though!"
A Museum in the nature,The best thing of this museum is the natural environment around it. You can find the stereotype of traditional Korean garden just in front of the museum. 
Did not go in - gardens were so lovely,"We did not go inside as we spend four hours enjoying the garden and surrounds on a lovely spring day. Close to where we live. The grandchildren loved the lawns, paths, peacocks and gardens - so did we!"
the true meaning of tranquility,"Ho-Am museum is an absolute jewel. The grounds of this museum are beautiful. It has been designed exactly like a traditional korean garden. With the four seasons of Korea it can be enjoyed anytime of year. The museum's building is also designed like a traditional house. Wonderful gazebos, a large lotus pond, and wild peacocks roaming all over the grounds creates such an incredible atmosphere. This is by far one a hidden gem. The museum's collection is not all that grand. It is small and mainly consists of a few paintings, pottery, and some wooden furniture. If you are just coming for the art than I would recommend the National Museum in Seoul but if you are coming to experience all it has to offer then this is a place for you. A little out of the way but accessible. There are busses from Seoul to Everland. From Everland's main gate they offer a shuttle bus. The bus runs on the hour, every hour and returns 15 minutes past the hour, every hour. The price is 4,000 won to enter and totally worth it."
