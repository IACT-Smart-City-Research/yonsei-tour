Worth a visit if you're around Seosan,"The place is in a good shape and on a warm day, it's a good trip to make. I wouldn't go out of my way to spend time there but if you're around Seosan, go for it. It has a lot of history, in one hand for Christians as it was where 1000 Roman Catholics were martyred in 1866 (the Pope Francis went there in 2014) but also give you a good glimpse at a traditional village. The place is wide, and if the entrance is free there's few paid activities that you can do like archery or renting an handbok. When I went there was also few traditional games available for kids and adults to try for free and a market with both traditional products and food. A lot of kids are using this place to fly kite so overall it's a nice place to spend some time to relax, know more about history and have fun."
Practicing Korean traditional Archery ,"Not so much to see inside but you can try archery you need to pay of course but not so expensive, very far from Seoul its in Chungcheungnamdo Province, peaceful place and very wide inside"
Historical ,"Although the fort has been rebuilt, it gives a good impression of how the different classes would have lived in South Korea, it is also a sacred place for especially local Catholic people as they were prosecuted and hanged at a tree in the fort itself. "
Interesting,"The stories and culture around this fortress are interesting, and the surrounding area free of tourists but with nice mountains, friendly town, rice paddies and old Buddhist temples."
"Beautiful History & Fun, Traditional Games",The grounds are beautiful & peaceful. Lovely area to walk & stretch your legs. There is an area with traditional games set up - perfect for all ages!
Well maintained,"Fortified area converted into a park, while maintaining the history. You will see old habits with information on one side and on the other people with kites."
Haemi Fortress,"Beautiful after a fresh snowfall. Two blocks from the main bus stop. Lots of local restaurants. Some events during the year with ""guards"" in traditional dress. (summer)"
