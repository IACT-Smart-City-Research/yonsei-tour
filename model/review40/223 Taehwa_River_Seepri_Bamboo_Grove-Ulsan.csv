Taehwa River Bamboo Forest,"The easiest way to get to Taehwagang National Garden is by cab. The garden houses an incredibly vast garden. Bright yellow flowers were in full bloom during my visit. Silver grass reeds magnificently rose proudly in the afternoon sun. On the other side of the garden over the wooden bridge is the Bamboo Forest, which is definitely worth a visit. And a walk along the Taehwa River is highly recommended. "
Well maintained park in the city,"While you walk in the bamboo grove, you would feel you are far away from a city. You would hear birds chirping, wind touching leaves and children laughing. This grove stretches over 4km along the riverside and there are a few other gardens you can visit as well.If you happen to be in Ulsan, this place is worth a visit."
Cool Bamboo Forest,"If you love to visit a non touristy and cool Bamboo Forest, this is definitely the one you're looking for! Take some time to indulge in nature! "
Ok place if you have time,"If you are in Ulsan and happen to have a few hours to spare, you could consider this.Quite cooling if you walk inside the grove.Getting here can be complicated though. This was my route:- Ulsan Express Bus Terminal- Cross the road and walk to bus stop on the left- Bus 407 to Taehwagang Observatory- Walk down a path at the petrol station to a white building and turn right at the end- You will reach the river. There is a small ticket booth. Get a ticket for the boat at 1000KRW. The boat is special. Pulled by hand on a suspended rope. Apparently it was the way in the old days.There is the National Garden across the bus stop earlier. "
very nice gardens,not only bamboos worthes to be visited : very large park with nice various gardens a small marsh with white herons
Walk in a Bamboo forest,"This is about a 5 block walk off the bus line on the main drag to the forest. There is a vistor center and fountain with a pond. The entrance to the forest is nearby and takes you on a 15-20 minute walk through the forest. There are online games/activities for kids, sections of the forest are illiuminated at night, and one activity where you squeeze between sections of bamboo. If you are walkers, you can exit the forest and cross the bridge on the river and walk to the foutain cave complex across the river. Transportation options from there are slim if you do no0t plan on walking back."
Walking and Running along river,Big Bamboo park. Bicycle for rent and a lot of space for picnic... you can spend your free time here
good place,"one of other good places in ulsan ,by river side. must try cycle ride .good place for evening walk with family"
Worth a quick look if you are in the area.,You can visit this bamboo area as you are in the surrounding park.There is a short walk through the bamboo for a photo.Then you can explore the surrounding park area.It is not a must see place.Plenty of free car parking.
near the river side...,"I wasn't in this city travel plan, but I'm glad I went. especially the riverside walking track is very well arranged and intertwined with nature.I saw this in Japan similar to the bamboo forest, but this place is not bad either."
lovely but probably stunning in any other season than winter,"lovely walking trails, enjoyed immersing myself in the bamboo forest. lots of space and activities for families. enjoyed the music piped throughout--it was non-glaring.the flower beds were plenty--merely barren in February."
Like Asian Movies,"Very beautiful on a windy day. Not much in the way of other things and it's much shorter than anticipated. It is however, if memory serves me correctly, next to a huge field of flowers. So it's best to visit in the Spring or Summer. Make sure to bring drinks as it's a decent walk to the nearest coffee shop/corner store."
AWESOME,This was the highlight of my most recent trip to Ulsan. The bamboo grove colled me off from the heat and was pretty.
Walking,This is a weekend relaxing place for old and young to do exercises. Leave the traffic behind and bring your walking shoes and walking stick and come and explore nature in the city!!
Bamboo forest fun walk,"Taehwa river grand park is awesome. Bamboo groove is a part of its attraction. It has a nice walk way. You have to walk a lot but its soothing and enjoyable. People go for jogging, dating, walking around there. It looks beautiful from afternoon."
Taewha river seepri bamboo grove,"I am staying in a hotel at samsan-ro and walked to the bamboo grove. Their is a beautiful path along the taewha river banks for pedestrians and cyclists. Also their are grounds where people play golf, exercise with some available gym equipments. Bamboo grove is nice and some birds live there. Although I find the size of the bamboo grove a bit smaller than I originally imagined of (that is a purely personal conception). It is worth visiting the grove and neighbouring park area on holidays and have a stroll in the pedestrian path."
A nice peaceful oasis,"A lovely park with a bamboo forest for all the family to enjoy, with lots of paths and routes to explore, either on foot or on a hired bike."
Bamboo forest is beautiful!!!,Do you know? In korea have a bamboo forest. In the picture is a bamboo forest in the city of Ulsan. Taehwagang Grand Park (태화강대공원) I like it. Don't miss out!
Something different ☺️,As an European I really like forests but this is different. It makes its own sound. It's nicely illuminated even. And for some magical reason it has a Wi-Fi zone in the middle... 
A very nice place for a Sunday walk.,"The Taehwa River Seepri Bambo grove is a very beautiful place for a nice and quiet Sunday walk. The very pleasent sound of the Bambo wistling in the wind is wery relaxing. But keep to the track, dont go into the bambo grove itself. Some suprices can hit you. Enjoy."
It's a nice place ,"My kids had a great time running along the paths throughout the bamboo grove, and they especially loved it, when we went off the path and into the actual bamboo itself. It's very pretty and quite extensive. The paths are level and well maintained. The park is situated next to a beautiful river that has fish jumping in it and a number of water birds. There is even a cable ferry that ferries people across the river to a tower that has an observation deck and a cafe. There are a number of toilets throughout the park and there is a market held next to the grove, every 4th Saturday. Opposite the park there are a number of cafes and restaurants. The grove is part of a much larger park. Alot people hire bicycles, tandem bicycles and segways to get around. The bike hire place is right in front of the park and the segway hire shops can be found opposite the park. There are no carparks in the actual park, but there is plenty of paid parking along the road in front of the park. The ticket men only take cash. People with a disability card get a discount on the carparking fee. We were there for a few hours and it only cost us 600￦, with our disability card.We will definitely go back as there was too much to see and do in one visit."
Exotic walk,One of my must-see places when visiting Eastern Asia is a bamboo forest. Taehwa River Seepri is just big enough to dive into juicy green colour of mighy grass and have a feeling of walking in the real wildeness. And is very easy accesible.
Well ...,"It's an OK way to pass some time, but nothing special. All the cut bamboos there and free wifi signs made it feel too artificial, but yeah why not spend half an hour walking there, it's some alteration for the normal parks"
Relaxing and Beautiful ,"Want to have a nice relaxing strole with great scenery all around you? Then I would suggest this location! It is peaceful and beautiful, especially during sunset and night time...! * During spring and fall the weather is perfect for chilling and having a picnic, but summer and winter the weather is a bit too hot and cold..."
Come here for a refreshing walk and downtime!,"I walked here from my guesthouse, it was pretty easy to find since its next to the highway. Midday in May wasn't that hot and there were not many people. I think the nicest view was from the Bamboo Grove, many people were inside taking photos. It was also relaxing to watch the fish leaping in the stream."
Beautiful with a Side of Mosquitos,"This is a lovely walking area. The bamboo forest is one of two in the area, near Taehwa River. If you're walking in the spring or summer, note that there are quite a few mosquitos in the area and possibly poor air quality. I would suggest getting a face mask from CU or GS25, the ubiquitous convenience stores near the river."
Great afternoon - cool in the summer temperatures,"A lovely walk around in the kind of newly renovated park. Everything is absolutely gorgeous, a few places are still being upgraded but it is a wonderful afternoon walk. The flowers are looking beautiful and it is great to walk around or rent a bike. We saw some segways as well, so I'm assuming you can hire those too. You can walk all the way from Taehwadong down to Samsamdong or Seongnamdong along the beautiful river paths. A great free day out. Always several degrees cooler so it is a delightful respite from the heat. There is free wifi in the middle of the bamboo forest too if you need it. It's easily accessible from the Taehwadong side of the river. A taxi from Samsandong shouldn't cost much more than 5,000 won on a normal day. However, there are many buses that go from Seongnamdong."
relaxing place,The favorite place for strolling and play with kid and biking. Very nice photo spot at any season. The place for the season festivals like Buddhists festival and whale festival. 
Good for walk,This park is ideal for walking and their is a bamboo grove right at the heart of the city and is easily accessible from all areas of the town.
Amazing view,"I liked a lot this part of the park, I loved to see bamboos that tall and in that amount... if you are nature lover you should visit this place. "
Nice,This bamboo grove is a part of the Taehwa Grand Park and is located in the middle of the city. Walk through the park and listen to the birds singing - very relaxing.
Taewha River Bamboo Grove,There is a walk path in the bamboo grove which is located near the Taewha River flowing through Ulsan. The bamboo tress are supplying shades very good for walkers along the path in the bamboo grove. You can see flocks of crows and migrants birds in winter.
A cool place to enjoy nature in the heart of Ulsan,"A great addition to the Taehwa river park. This forest offers a nice cool walk, but just watch out for the cyclists. They sometimes ride through there really fast. Every year they have a haunted forest here too, which is quite fun."
Weekend walk,I was staying at the Lotte hotel and decided to talk a walk on the weekend. It was about 15 min from the hotel to the river and another 45 min down to the bamboo grove. It was a relaxing afternoon and the bamboo groves offers additional walking paths. There were a couple of model airplanes flying over the river too which gave another attraction to see. It was cloudy but still rather warm and at one end of the foot bridge there was a small shop selling various snacks and cold drinks. Not much else to see but I enjoyed the 3 hour trip.
Nice walking park,"Very nice park!with many pictures opportunities!WeEnd the day in the Bambus park,and it was very nice! Probably a lot of bugs in summertime...A lot of restaurants bedside,Easy to park(we paid 1,200W for more than 2 hours)U can use bikes as well!next time,we will try them!"
Beautiful place.,The walk around the bamboo grove was lovely. The walk was peaceful and relaxing with great photo opportunities. Highly recommend a visit here.
The key feature of Taehwagang ,Besides the mAssive spring garden is the large arrays of bamboo... A very clever walking path and place to relax and enjoy the little bit of peace inside a heavily industrialized city. 
how did they do that?,"you can walk for about 2.5Km and on both sides there is this dense bamboo forest, along side the Taehwa River....you will love it...take the carmera."
"Out of the city, in the city!","Walk along this lovely man made river side and come into the bamboo forest.The green rubber sidewalk is easy going on joggers knees, and then the peacefulness of the bamboo scenario is pleasant on the mind and clears the air for the lungs.Benches are scattered around the area, and some scenic places alongside the river have meditation verandas set up.Either side of you, there is the hassle and bustle of the city, but in here, you escape the stress.Further down the river, towards downtown, there lies 4 artificial turf football pitches. We found a football game starting, and the average age was 75- yes you read it correctly! Must be something to do with the bamboos!!"
