Concert place,"They also held concerts here, for indoor concert, do not choose floor area, not a good view unless you are in the first row. Buy tickets with reserve seating. "
"A lot to see and do, place for baseball and Football ",Great area of Seoul ... great when the Korean Football League and Korean Baseball League is running... always a game there apart from Mondayâ€™s for the baseball... and a good family based team called Seoul E-Land play in the Seoul Olympic stadium .... watch football in a piece of history. The stadium of the 1988 Seoul olympics... 
One of the funnest baseball experiences of my life,"I grew up in Los Angeles, and am a die-hard Dodgers fan. I have had the pleasure of seeing professional baseball in USA, Canada, Japan, Cuba and now, Korea. I can easily say that this was one of the best games and experiences I have ever had. South Korea is such an amazing place, with the nicest people on the planet. Go here even if you don't like or know anything about baseball: it is so fun!"
Sports Complex,"The Baseball stadium, the Olympic one, the gym are part of the Complex. A lot of concerts happen here. Wiz Khalifa came here last Wednesday "
