Big out,Just come if you have anything to buy since the location is far from city. It takes 3 hours with private transport if jam. Overall Adidas has the best bargain. Majority is local visitors so might face communication problem if you wish to get something from the food truck or stalls with local food.
Paju premium outlets,"A medium-sized shopping area in Paju City, with many items to choose from. And have a beautiful corner to take pictures"
Need More Time and Space to Shop,"Part of our travel group itinerary going to the airport was spending time here to shop. Left with 2 hours time frame , I hate to admit, I was not that ready to do my shopping. No more space in my luggage to do last minute ones. Regretted not buying something from Adidas , Nike and Lacoste. Need to spend a half day at least here. Many restaurants and it would be convenient with the cooler weather cooperating.The only downside was the typical lining up at the airport for those tax refunds. Beautiful place to stroll around for a bit also."
Go on weekends although it's crowded.,"The journey from my hotel at Insadong to Paju premium outlet took about 1.5hr. There's nothing to wow about as the prices aren't cheap except for Adidas. Do note that take bus 2200 from exit 1 of Hapjeong station instead of exit 2 as stated on the website. The bus to Lotte premium outlet is much nearer than Paju,about 30 mins difference and the announcements for each station are all in Korean so pls do keep a lookout for the alighting point.I spent about 5 hours here due to the crowd at Adidas but it's all worry it! I bought a pair of kid's sandals just for 8000 won! Bought 4 pairs and 2 pairs of Adult's shoes cost me 140,000 won only! Other than Adidas and Nike, Other brands r not worth going.. I bought a Coach wallet in Sg for about $180 after a whopping 50 percent off but it's costs $350 after a 50 percent off! So it's actually much more expensive here! Having said that, I'm lucky that I came on a Sunday which is crowded with family and there's alot of events and freebies for the children. Like the vibe though but I will not visit in the near future... the prices in Japan's outlet is much better than here. "
Not like the rest Premium Outlets,"Unless you have allot of money and trying to pay extra for luxury goods from previous collections avoid it. There are so many uber cool areas to shop in Seoul with local desginers. Follow the ""Made In Korea"" labels. No regrets!"
paju premium outlet,"When I went to Korea I will always visit paju premium outlet .u can get mcm with a lower price than at e shopping mall .this outlet is easy to travel .Bus]Hapjeong Station (Subway Line 2 or 6), Exit 2. - Take Bus 2200.- Get off at Paju Premium Outlets Back Gate Bus Stop.- The outlet is located 600m from the bus stop.(Bus schedule: 05:30-22:10, 10min intervals/ Travel time: 1hr)Hapjeong Station (Exit 2) or Baekseok Station (Subway Line 3, Exit 4).- Take Bus 200 and get off at Paju Premium Outlets Bus Stop.Geumchon Station (Gyeongui Line), Exit 1.- Take Bus 033, 035, 036 or 900.- Get off at Paju Premium Outlets Back Gate Bus Stop. (Travel time: 20min)"
Journey is far but able to get some good catch,"Took bus 2200 from Hongdae (outside KDB bank) to paju premium outlet and on the way, you get to pass by lotte premium outlet too.As the journey is far, it will take you an hour to travel here.The sales is quite attractive as i managed to buy a MCM crossbody bag (past season) at 170,400 won before tax refund at airport. I’m happy with my shopping.Happy shopping everybody"
A good place for outlet shopping and good prices,"We happened to be there on one of the days which they had additional discounts on top of the pricing. Cons is that, it's out of Seoul. Would suggest a half day to full day there if you really into outlet shopping."
worth a short trip from seoul only if you love shopping ,not everything is cheaper than those in myeongdong. there a number worth the buy. pretty cold here. there was a sale going on. can try lotte premium outlet also as it’s along the bus route. took bus 2200 from hongik univ. exit 1 (go to your right and walk for a 100m). only an hour away. you can catch a view of north korea while enroute. 
Buy or not to buy?,"Taken here from airport. There were a number of buses parked up..so the potential was there for business. Quite a big shopping complex, with individual shops, .. this is an OUTLET SHOP, for older and slower selling stock.. not for the latest!Lots of people... tourists and “locals”... most were seeming to be just browsing.)no/notCheap enough?)Nothing caught my eye, or was cheap enough to tempt me to buy..( cf with HK prices?)Saw a few shoppers with shopping bags....Rate... just a number of “ branded” shops... who’s prices were not as sharp as I thought they would be....in Korea! Just average at best.Time to spend= do they have what U want = more time choosing..Could spend time JUST BROWSING.. & buy nothing.. or lot more time to choose...10/20 mins to. ?????? !"
As Expected from the Premium Outlet Chain,"If you’ve been to Vacaville or Gotemba Premium Outlet, Paju is like their little sister. It still had the usual brands like Nike, Polo RL, Adidas, Michael Kors, Coach, etc. But I was hoping they had more of the luxury brands. Good thing the Lotte Premium Outlet was nearby and it was the perfect complement to Paju.If you have time to spare in Seoul, you can actually bundle it with the DMZ tour as it is in the way there. "
Bustling place,"Decided to make a trip to Paju Premium Outlet since I went to Jeonju Outlet in my last trip. It was a long journey to the outlet. Unfortunately, I took the wrong bus and only realise it when I found myself to be the last person on the bus. As the bus driver does not speak English, after lots of hand gestures and tries, I alighted the bus, crossed the road and waited for the bus the the bus driver told me. When I finally arrived, I found the place bustling with people and activities... lots of shops and local brand names that I am not familiar with. Place is huge. Walked for an hour or so but did not buy anything.... probably wrong season and tired after the journey. Think I prefer the Brand’s in Jeonju outlets which is my personal preference."
Worth a visit,If u r coming to Seoul for outlet shopping this Paju area is good choice. There is another Lotte Premium outlet so is a kill 2birds with 1stone. Fr Hapyeong station exit 1 take bus 2200 (2500won) per pax u can pay w ur Tmoney card. Abt 90mins journey. Download app Kakao bus to check the busstops n arriving time. Recommend to spend sometime here n proceed to lotte premium outlet by the same 2200bus. (Take Bus stop opp where u alight/ same for return)
Drove to Paju premium outlet ,"The stores here have quite a good range. But could not buy anything as it is not that really cheap. Maybe in terms of comparison to the Seoul shopping, it’s definitely cheaper in that way. There is an English map that makes it easier to move around. "
Good deals!,It’s a good outlet located far from Seoul. We visited on a weekday and it was not crowded at all. Got good deals from Adidas and Nike. Well worth the trip!
Okay,"Was expecting brands like Prada, Gucci, YSL, etc. to have their standalone boutiques but in Paju it’s just one shop (Elbon if I’m not mistaken) that carries these brands. I saw in a website that Paju has these designer brands so I was expecting a lot. Their MCM & Hugo Boss stores were nice though. Bus ride was okay as you’ll have a glimpse of the quiet side of Seoul. Paju is 2 hrs away by train and bus so it’ll only be worth it if this is part of your tour’s itinerary or if you have extra days to spend in SK. Went on a Wednesday and it was not crowded."
Not in a Cold Day,"The outlet mall was our final stop for our day trip tour. Since we were not interested in shopping - we end up spent the whole time in the supermarket on 3rd floor. Luckily, they have a snack bar where we can enjoy noodle soup."
Great place,"Ok since I have been to Paju Outlet, I will give detailed directions here.From Hapjeong station (green line 2) exit 1, take bus 2200 or bus 200. Bus 2200 will takes about 45mins to reach, bus 200 will takes about 75mins to reach because it goes through the housing area. Both bus will alight right in front of Paju Outlet.On the return trip, cross the road and take bus 2200 or bus 200 back to Hapjeong station, you will alight at Hapjeong station (green line 2) exit 4,The fare is about/around 2400won/pax/way.This outlet is not bad, if I am returning back to Seoul and have extra time, I will revisit."
Nice outlet malls,Paju Outlet Mall is a huge Outlet Mall with many interesting shops. But it’s not too crowded. So nice for walking around. You can also visit s smaller mall - Lotte Mall nearby.
Premium outlet near Seoul,Must visit shopping outlet for every first time visitor to Seoul.Great if you can self drive only 30 min from Seoul in good traffic.Good choice of brand outlets and reasonable dining options.Close to DMZ observatory and so you could kill 2 birds with 1 stone.Great for a day trip from Seoul downtown.
 Shop till you drop,"A nice collection of designer stores. As usually, know your prices and personal limit. Be aware that even in outlets like these European designers are not cheap and can be found less pricy in Europe or the US. Still, it's a nice outlet and very American like atmosphere. Before hit one of the big Dept. Stores downtown you may wanna give this outlet a look. In addition, the Lotte Premium outlet is very close by and combining both makes sense.... If your credit card allows. "
Deals Galore,"Lots of deals by big brands such as Nike, Coach, Michael Kors etc. I ate at Johnny Rockets at level 3. Man... the burger was delicious! Apparently free flow of coke (at this time on my visit).It is quite a distance to this location. I followed a blogger's directions and it went horribly wrong. I wasted 2 hours trying to rectify my locations and arrive safely. And its difficult getting a cab here. Below is what i would suggest, if you are coming from Seoul.1. Line 3 train and alight at Hapjeong Station.2. Use exit 1 and go to the bus stop at the exit.3. Take bus 2200. Queue up for it.4. Alight at the back gate of Paju Premium Outlet.Thats how easy it is.Just take the same bus on the opposite direction to go back to Seoul. If you are lucky, it could be a double-decker coach!"
2500 krw Hapjeong Station exit 1,"I read some earlier review instructions to get out of Hapjeong station exit 2, this must have recently changed. We did this and got a little disorientated. When we finally got to the right exit we missed the bus! So DO get out of exit 1 and it’s right in front about 15metres coming out of the station. Luckily another bus came around 15 minutes later, it was a newer double decker bus (although the first bus we missed was single level). DO prepare 2500krw for your ride, there were locals who used their bus pass. I presented the driver with 10 000krw for 3 people, placing it in the glass metal box - he returned my change with a coin dispenser giving me 25 x 100 coins , which I later used for my return trip back. We went on a rainy day, November 10th. I found the outlet to have excellent choice of winter clothing compared to Australia . I purchased from Style on Air (cashmere knits were cheap here), Nike, North Face. There was a pop up shop for North face in one of those tent ⛺️ things, that was not able to give me a tax refund, I bought it anyway. All the other stores gave me a tax refund receipt, which I got back at the airport. We got there at 11:30 and left at 6pm. We didn’t get past the first floor of shopping!!! The food court 3rd floor, doesn’t open until 11am, and I think the outlets opens at 10:30. Overall I had lots of fun and will come back if I’m back in Seoul. Oh, DO, take a screenshot of the name of this outlet in Korean as we did come across another outlet mid bus ride. Show the bus driver if you get confused. "
4 Star Outlet store in Paju,"I took a taxi from lotte hotel seoul on a sunday it took me 40 min to reach paju, the cost of the taxi 60K won and it was worth it. The prices on the outlet store are very cheap especially the RL store i definitely recommend it, if you are looking for a good bargain and lots designer brands like Nike, Armani, Under Armour, Gap, Lacoste, Northface and other korean designer brand."
Generally expensive,"To get here, take line 2 to Hapjeong Station, look for exit 1. The bus stop for Bus 2200 is just outside the exit. Queue line actually starts at the far end, look for the yellow line on the ground (note that bus number is not written on the ground). Reverse direction to get back to Seoul.Before you start shopping, get the VIP discount coupons from the Information Counter. Just show your Visa credit card. Stuff here are generally expensive, but there are good heavily discounted items. Just look within the shops for the bargains. Not all the shops offer tax rebates, and most staff couldn't speak English.There's a quick tax rebate kiosk just outside the Information Counter."
prefect for me as i was looking for somethign specific,"got what I needed there - PUMA GOLFI visited here right after the lotte outlet nearby, they are only about 10mins in between."
Good outlet.. Excellent to me..,"C1 ( 17.08.02 ) There was very good to me because of outlet's shape. The inside was well-arranged and different from another outlet in downtown. There was good atmosphere and had modern mood. And the food court was not big, but good to me. All was excellent to me."
"Bored, Bored, Bored","Never have I suffered such tedium in my life. The shops sell clothes the same clothes with different logos on. The staff in the shops look about to top themselves as they have no customers and all the time you have to listen to music through speakers everywhere Two shops stood out Lego and Tefal ( because they don't sell clothes ). There is food available at a food court , nice. It was interesting to note that despite the vast number of advertising claiming 50 - 60% off ( with the usual comment in small print "" up to )at no time were any prices shown !"
Affordable pride for high-end brands,I love the nike store there. It is pretty big outlet consists of 4 big constructions. Food there is not good. I could barely found lotteria burger
Nice,We visited with own car. There is no any parking problem. All well oganized. There are huge amount stores and all visitors can be satisfied.Prices are not lowest in Korea. If you are lucky you may find good deals. Good place for shopping. Very convenient with kids and babies. Day time is very crowded. 
Line friend and Lego outlet,從孔德到合井站1號出口，地面已經是2200巴士站。記得要見到英語村後第7個站下車，若唔清楚可以問司機叔叔的。落車後對面馬路便是坡州outlet。孩子喜歡Line friend 和Lego所以買得很高興。我推介大家可以試下food court的中的手拉薄餅和炸豬排。
Something for everybody ,"Love this place in all Seasons. Depending on luck sometimes, some merchant has good discount. For me, I bought a RLX jacket at 75% off at Ralph Lauren outlet. Happy shopper. Food is all available on level 3 with inexpensive price.How to go? Take train to Hapjeong station, up exit 2 and take bus 2002. Well, turn back and walk to the bus stop where u can see the sign '200, 2002'. Queue up early. Where to stop- this is tough.. the first paju town isn't the place, the next one is. Use google nap or waze as guide. U should see paju premiumOutlet on left when it turns right to the stop"
Shopping Haven For Tourists,"Take 2200 bus from Hapjeong Station (Exit 2) , you will see a round signage written 2200. Just stand at the side of the signage and the bus will stop. It takes 50 minutes journey from the station to Paju Premium Outlet and there will be few stop before its arrive at Paju, listen carefully on the destination announcement as there are no English announcement for most of the stops except for the tourist attraction. However not to worry as announcement made in Korean for Paju sounded like English:).I will definitely recommend this place for tourist to shop as i find that the price is very reasonable compare to the prices at the shopping mall in Seoul , November sales make the price even more cheaper which we ended up spending 2 days there.To avoid heavy crowd do not go during weekend as you will find lots of local people and tourist buses around the area. Paju Premium Outlets offers brand such as CK, Levis, Gap, Guess, Michael Kors , Coach , Puma , Nike , Adidas , Lego etc, beside that restaurants and cafes are also available."
Had fun!,We had a good 5hours shopping around. There are many shops and had a luggage filled with loot. Nice environment and not super crowded on a Sunday. There's a food court and few restaurants that we didn't have time for. Worth the trip. 
you can cheaply buy various brands,"This time i visit to this place. There was lined with a variety of brands. so i can buy things easily. Especially i received a almost 30% discount to MasterCard. I was satisfied that. If you ever visit here, see the master card ;-)"
Shopping,"Its a best place for shopping, which is bit cheaper than the main outlets in the city. The outlets are massive and ample parking space. Its a very good place for kids, there is a vast space for kids and which you can enjoy shopping while they are playing. Its worth a visit.There is a art village which is near to the centre which shouldn't miss at all. There are art cafés. Pls do do visit, you wont regret."
"Nice architecture, many shops, expensive prices ",We went to Paju Premium Outlets to buy some new clothes for an Outlet price. We were really surprised about this really expensive price tags. Many luxury and popular/famous brands.But they are more expensive than in Germany/Europe!
Wide array of choices,"The place definitely has a lot of shops. However, IMHO, the prices are not that low compared to other outlet shops in other major Asian cities. It is quite distant from Seoul and if you dont really have anything to buy in mind when coming here, you might just end up not buying anything. Personally, i just bought a pair of Nike training shoes so as not to feel bad. :)We went on a weekday so there was less people. Not sure how big the difference is with the number of weekend shoppers."
A swanky place to shop for less,"Paju Premium Outlets do live up to its name. The most popular here seem to be the Nike Factory Store, Adidas and Calvin Klein. The prices are good. However, for other outlets, sizes are limited. There's not a lot of options for those in the bigger side. I like the vibe here. It's good for a stroll. There are good cafes and restaurants around. I also like the Kids Cafe. For 10,000 won ($9), my 3-year-old enjoyed a lot of toys and play structures for 2 hours, while we shop. "
"Long ride but, lots and lots of shops","We wen to Paju Outlet last Christmas. To get there, we took subway to Hapjeong Station ext 1 then walked straight to bus stop number 2200. There was a long queue with both local and tourists when we arrived. It was a long ride out of Seoul (much longer than we expected) like 1.5 hours. (On the way back it took about 2 hours as it was during rush hour and our bus got in accident) We went to Lottle Premium Outlet before and didn't expect this one to be so far away. The place is huge. We are ok with the brand available. They are not a high end luxury brand but lots of designer brands which we did not recognize but, enjoy shopping all the same. We spent all afternoon there and didn't think that we covered it all. At least I got want I went for."
Shop shop shop,"If you are going to seoul for luxury goods shopping especially MCM , do not give paju premium outlet a miss. Although the items on sale might be one or two season ago collection, its it really a bargain to shop here. Most items are slightly more than half of the price in normal boutique. Worth the 1 hour bus ride."
Just okay~,"Went here on 26th December hoping there's Boxing Day's sale, but umm no, only normal sale. I took bus 2200 near Exit 1 of Hapjeong Station to go here. There are several boutiques which are worth to shop such as Coach, Nike, Gap and Polo Ralph Laurent. Of course other peoples with bigger budget can shops more unlike me, lol. I quench my thirst by sipping the hot hazelnut choco latte at Paul Basset cafe, the best latte I swear to God. If u're hungry, there are several restaurants, cafes and food court u can choose from. Spend time here almost 5 hours with only 3 paperbags in my hand. :)"
Many branded shops,"We Went there today and found many branded shops. The VIP Coupon Book I signed in from web generally gives a 5% discount when you purchase some 300k to 500k won worth of products from the shop. The price is 3x more expensive compare to premium outlets in California. We spent 3 hours and buy nothing. Several items include Tumi, Bose, ECCO, Crocs, .. are at same price as shops in Singapore."
Paju Outlets,"Paju premium outlets, famous for containing the most popular brand outlets of the world. The market has 3 stories and containing more than 200 shops in it. There you can find branded shops like NIKE, Armani, Banana Republic, Boon the shop, Calvin Klein, DKNY, GAP, G-cut, Galaxy, Jeep spirit, Levis, Lacoste, Sj Sj, The Izzat collection, PUMA, and many others. Also, the market is very beautiful, especially in the center of it there are many food spots and entertainments. You can have rail ride there. The products there are duty free and you can buy on a cheaper rate."
Shop Till You Drop,A haven for all shop-a-holics. HUGE discounts from international brands. The thing that makes Paju Premium Outlet standout from other shopping malls is the beauty of its sophisticated architecture combined with a scenic natural surrounding. Simhaksan Mountain serves as the perfect backdrop for the shopping mall. 
Boring,Further than Lotte Outlet which is a more pleasant mall to shop with a larger span of space. Not really cheap and the AX Exchange lady staff looked really unhappy and bored. 
Paju premium outlet near seoul korea,"Stop at subway station hapjeong line 6 exit 2, take the 2200 bus. U can use your tmoney card for the trip. This bus also passes by lotte premium outlet. We found lots of bargain, and for muslims go to the food court. There is one stall that sells fries, lemon or chilli shrimp. Something to tide u over if u're hungry. Best thing is at the food court water is free. The cups are warm and u can choose warm or cold water. So don't complain about the price of coffee in seoul, jst drink plenty of water that is available free at the malls. There is no gucci or prada shop but overall I found lots of stuff I wanted to buy. Kipling, corelle was cheap when i visited the outlet.To return to seoul take the bus across the road and stop at exit 3 or 5 of hapjeong station."
Great shopping destination,A truly shopping paradise not only for locals but also for tourists. So many international brands are available like in many shopping malls. The offer was too good to miss. Could't resist myself from shopping a number of items. Tumi Store was an excellent one. The collection was unparalleled and attractive discount is available. The same is true for Adidas and other top brands. The items that I bought are certainly memorable and this is the thing that I did not regret
Excellent Shopping!,"A lot of luxury brands such as Prada, LV, DKNY. Don't forget to ask for tax refund forms! The place is nice, good parking, airy, and 3 floors to visit a variety of shops. "
Good selection of international & local brands,"Most stores opens from 10am onwards . Food court is on the top level - 3rd floorCafes and restaurants abundant on all floors.Look out for those with big signs 30-70% sale and need not waste time checking out as prices are generally high. So unless there is a good markdown , need not visit . ;-)Nike has a big store there. Reebok offers good prices. New Balance was not interesting when I visited Feb 2015."
Selections were okay for Michael Kors and Coach,Pros: a) various selections and good deals for coach and michael kors bags and wallets (i.e. up to 40% off); b) accessible by bus - 1hour from Seoul; c) affordable and good food at their food court; d) not too crowded and sales people were very courteous.Cons: a) not much facilities for elderly to sit and rest from all the shopping; b) no bank or forex available for currency exchange; c) disappointed coz the marc jacobs store had no good handbags at all.
"a bit far, not much things to buy there, and close at 8pm","we took the wrong bus to go there and it was about 2 hours from myeong dong, you need to go to some stop and took the bus from there to paju premium outlet. Took bus no 2200(express bus) from Hapyeong to the outlet. Make sure to queue at the bus stop. the outlet close at 8pm, and it's bit far, nothing much there to buy, and not interesting and rather quiet.but I think the shopkeeper in Issey Miyake shop there is friendly and helpful. I bought some stuff there."
Weak ,"Been to lots of premium outlet malls around asia n states. They have a pretty good range of brands a total of 220 stores. But sad to say the prices are patheticly expensive. Knowingly , the word outlets means prices are lower but that is not the case.Luckily , for us we self drive and manage to visit other attractions surrounding the area."
Either a hit or a miss,Took bus no 2200(express bus) from Hapyeong to the outlet. Make sure to queue at the bus stop.A miss for me as I did not buy a lot of stuff
Clear and many brand shops ,A lot of brand stores are along the path inside outlet. Good to take advantages of special discounts from all the brands. can also have meals at the restaurants while shopping. The pizza i had at a bakery shop was very tasty and delicious. I waited for it for 30minutes due to previous orders. You can reach to Heiri village and provence near outlet if you have spare time. 
If you're a regular outlet shopper.... you'll be disappointed,"Premium outlet to me means you'll have at least Burberry, Gucci, Prada etc but most of the big brand names are missing. Yeoju outlet is much better. The Paju outlet has most of the same stores the Yeoju outlet has. The Yeoju outlet has more of the big names."
Limited Brands,"This outlet is rather close to Seoul so went there couple of times. They have limited choice of international brands. If you are looking to spend a day shopping, I would recommend the Yeoju Premium Outlet. Although Yeoju Outlet is quite a distance from Seoul it would be worth the trip. They have better selection of international brands."
Just another outlet shopping mall,"When you think outlet malls, you think medium-quality goods at affordable prices. Well, Paju Premium Outlets does sell Grade A brand-name merchandise, but the prices are anything but friendly. Located on the popular tourist stopover to the DMZ and other attractions nearby, the mall has three stories of premium products on sale. All the big European, American and several South Korean brands are here, retailing at prices to rival flagship stores in their respective countries. The place design is airy with a wide courtyard in the middle. It seemed to be great for families window shopping or for people looking to buy luxury items, but not necessarily at bargain prices. I am sure similar stores are prevalent in most other countries, so I think this is more for locals than for tourists. It does have some good dining options on the second and third floors."
Paju Premium Outlets,"Only Mcm was worth going. Still, not much choices of past season Mcm products. Anyway I managed to grab some cute stuff there. Still happy with my purchases. "
If you have half a day free,"If you have half a day free, do pop by the outlet mall. You can either book a cab (each trip is about W50,000) from City hall Seoul to paju outlet mall. I would only recommend the ralph laurens, it's about the same price (or even cheaper) compared to the outlet mall in states."
Not worth the visit,If you used to visit outlet malls around the world that will be not the best place to spend on. The travel time is more than 4 hours (return trip) from Seoul and the shopping outlets does not worth the visit.
Good outlet for shopping in korea,"The place is quite big compare to other outlet in korea. We got new balance, nike, coach there. They have starbucks for resting. The adidas out let shop is very big. Recommended Place!"
"Korea, Paju Premium Outlets Nov13","1st trip out of Seoul, so took a cab out of Seoul from Hapjeong subway station after some online research.The journey took about an hour on the expressway. Layout-wise looks much like the outlets in US, spacious & accessible. Difference is there are 3 storeys buildings here. Variety of brands here, more than some i have seen in some US outlets. But the goods available are quite limited in terms of variety & availability. Disappointed with the choices to say the least, not to mentioned most stores were advertising winter clothing at that time,to be fair I did visit in winter. 2 pieces of advice if you intend to take a cab to & from Paju Premium Outlets: 1.have Korean writings of Hapjeong station & Paju outlets, not all drivers understand the English language & the pronunciation, so these will come in handy. 2. try not to stay till closing time but if you do, follow the staff there when they knock off from work. Why? There are 2 exits from the outlets that leads to 2 main roads. 1 main road is quite deserted, you won't find any taxis in waiting. In fact there are not much traffic there. This road is also in front of a big carpark. I had to make a detour back into the outlets & approach a kind korean staff to show me the way. She led me to the main road on the other side of the outlets where the local staff usually take their buses home. & it's true, there are a couple of taxis waiting in line for passengers!"
Shop till you Drop?,"I visited this place with my family last winter as part of a package tour. We are not shoppers so would probably never have ventured to this place on our own but I suppose for those who love to shop, this might be paradise with more than a chance to get branded goods at a bargain.Paju Premium Outlets is a three-storey building which apparently has 165 shops. The building is modern, clean and well lay-out. Bargain-hunters would be pleased to find their favourite brands, like Bally, Coach, Escada, Gucci, Armani, Escada, Hugo Boss, Vivienne Westwood, Max Mara, Marc Jacobs, Lanvin Collection, Bean Pole, Polo, GAP, Banana Republic, Galaxy, Nine West, Vans etc going for a discount. For sport lovers, there is Nike, Adidas, New balance, among others. However, I am not too sure if one would be able to find the latest designs there, but probably not, since these are discount outlets after all. We are such passive shoppers that all we bought was a Nike soccer ball for my son!For those who are not interested in shopping but somehow ended up there like us, there is always the option of heading to a restaurant or the food centre to rest your feet and have a meal/drink as you wait for your tour bus to pick you up."
Nice place to do some shopping if you have half a day free,"About an hour out of Seoul, this USA-style outlet has all the usual brands. Prices aren't as cheap as those in the USA but you can still find decent deals there. There's a food court available as well as various restaurants. I've googled quite a lot of places to find out how to go but have had problems getting proper English instructions. So here's a try putting it down (the way I went). This assumes you already know the basics of getting around Seoul's subways. - Go to Hapjeong subway station (Line 2)- Get out of the station at Exit 2- Immediately outside the exit is a bus-stop- Hop on the 2200 bus (use your T-money card; you can save on transfers)- Bus arrives at about 10 min interval, total cost should be about KRW2000 (not sure what was deducted from my card, but its not a big sum)- Bus will stop at 1 more stop in the city then head out to the expressway- About half an hour later, it will leave the expressway & enter a small town/ business area- There are English announcements but only selected places seem to trigger those- One announcement here is Eche Shopping Mall pronounced (Ee-Chay)- After which, you will see a big red brick building & if you look carefully it states Lotte Premium Outlet at the bus stop. - This is NOT Paju premium outlet, so don't get off here- The bus will then get onto the expressway again - About 20 min later it will go off into a small village like setting- English announcement : Paju English Village (you can see castles, etc. Looks like a theme park)- About 2 stops after that, you should be able to see the premium outlet on your LEFT- There will be Korean announcements but you should be able to hear ""Paju Premium Outlets"" clearly in the announcement.- Ring the bell, tap your card on the way out & happy shopping"
Good place to Shop,"This is an outlet that looks a lot just like USA's a lot of designer stores, restaurants and even have live music the day i went."
