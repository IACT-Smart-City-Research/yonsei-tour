A lot of fun - Korean professional baseball,Very well organized stadium and a lot of fun we can find it. Specially BBQ zone is very well organized for the group event and family event.
So much fun,"An incredibly user-friendly baseball park. The game is the same (of course), but the fans and the experience is so different than an MLB game. I would highly recommend going if you're in Seoul."
Went to buy Ball Caps,"We stopped in to buy some ball caps. It is a nice stadium, Standard ball park fare. It was fun! The souvenir shop was kind of small though. There were quite a few different types of food stands and of course you coukd buy beer. I think the prices of food and beer were just about equal to what you would pay stateside."
MUST EXPERIENCE KOREAN BASEBALL,"All Americans must experience Korean Baseball when in Korea. Munhak Stadium is the home of the SK Wyverns. Stadium is small compared to American standards, but all seats are good and the experience is a must see. Songs for each player, fans standing for each player and cheerleaders."
Great Atmosphere on a Saturday night,"Very well priced, and always seats available in the huge unallocated seating area. 9,000Won per ticket which is an incredible price for 4 hours of sports (however its totally open, you can turn up late, leave early).Very very easy to reach on the Incheon Metro line, and food and drink reasonably priced in the stand. Atmosphere is certainly aplenty however slightly manufactured by the two ""cheering zones"", one allocated to each team, who have a cheerleader team almost orchestrating the chanting. Nevertheless incredibly loud an effective and makes for a great evening out if you're there for a week or a few days!"
Wonderful Place for Watching Baseball Game,"Munhak Baseball Stadium in Incheon is the home stadium of the SK Wyverns, one of Korea’s baseball teams, and it has many varieties to enjoy. Most of all, there are three things that attract you to the stadium. First, the stadium has diverse seats that meet different demands. If you visit alone and want to concentrate on the game quietly, then I recommend the Wide Zone behind the catcher’s position that offers you the overall ground view, looking down from the high place. Another recommendation is the Live Zone that makes you the closest with players so that you can feel like you’re in the game. It is expensive but will be worthy of the price. However, if you go with your friend, the cheering section is better to be excited. Besides, the stadium has good places for your family. These are the Family Zone and the Green Zone. Especially in the Green Zone, the grass in the outfield, you can feel as if you are on a picnic with your family.Second, you can enjoy various foods during the game. The most famous foods in the stadium are chicken and beer. Fried chicken and beer are popular foods in Korea, and they will be more tasty with the baseball game. In addition, there is a place called the Barbecue Zone where you can cook meat on a grill. It is for four, so I suggest going with your family. Moreover, there is another amazing place. Hite Club is the restaurant where you can have great plates and watch the game at the same time through the glass wall. It is available for everyone who visits the stadium, and the price of food is like the other restaurants. Finally, you can experience unique Korean cheering culture. There are many cheering ways in different situations. For example, when a player gets in the batting box, home fans in the first base section sing a song, cheering up the player. Every song is so exciting, and sometimes the songs of power hitters overwhelm the pitcher on the other team. During the game, if the pitcher checks a runner too often, then the spectators jeer him with funny songs. If you are well aware of these songs, you can enjoy the game more actively. In addition, there are many events like a beer drinking contest or dance battle. If you win these events, many gifts are awarded. And then in the bottom of the eighth inning, everyone puts up a phone with the flash turned on, swings it, and sings Yeonan Pier, a song representing Incheon. The scene is so spectacular. Therefore, even if you know only a little about baseball, you don’t need to worry about having a good time. As you can see, there are many things that can relive your stress, not just watching the baseball game. So, if you visit Incheon, how about enjoying the baseball game in Munhak Baseball Stadium? Check the schedule on the web-site, www.sksports.net, and don’t forget to reserve seats when you are planning to go to the stadium on the weekend."
