Excellent Dinners,Visited this street many times and love it. It's got a variety of restaurants and many offer brunch. 
Fine cafe street in neighborhood,"I actually live nearby so I pass by here many times. I just want to explain about this place through this review. I hope this review can help many people. First, it is worth visit. You can find lots of shops, restaurants and cafe. Personally, I liked cafe Browny 70. But, you can still look for many other gorgeous places.Recommend for couples. Weekday day-time will be little less crowed.However, parking will always be the biggest problem here. On weekends, public parking seems to be full every time. Very narrow. Street illegal parking all the time. Very heavy traffic nearby as well. If you come at day time, come earlier and start from E-mart (has Electromart 2nd FL - new trendy electro gadget shop with an arcade) or Shinsegae Mall would be a good idea too. But, those area will be also have miles of cars waiting to get in... Walking from mall (e-mart) to here will take about 15 min. There are also place to walk nearby called Tan Cheon. Skateboard park is next to the street. You can find it easily. There are toy crane arcades nearby. maybe this could be the entertainment.By subway: get off at Jukjeon station. 15 min walk. You can take bus in front of station. But needs to go only one bus stop. so why not take a 15 min walk and get more appetite?Thanks,"
So so,From the picture you expect very romantic cafe street but in fact that happens only in the picture. Some are still very good and reasonable but some only pretty from the outside. 
Europe in Korea,"This is a place to escape traditional Korea. You will find neat cafes and shops that aren't anything like the rest of Korea. You will pay a little extra here, but its worth it to try new things."
Food galore and nice ambience ,A little bit European style as traffic has mostly to stay out and the streets belong to the pedestrians. A lot of places offer seats outside and between the restaurants there are small boutiques.A lot of good choices available. 
"Not big area, but various cafe and restaurant..","C ( 17.10.02 ) I and my friend visited this area for meal and chattering. I didn't expect about this area's atmosphere, but there was very good to us with good atmosphere. There was not big area, but operating various cafe and restaurant. I were satisfied this area with good atmosphere. With a Coffee, food and beer, all was good to us."
Best place for food around this area,"I live nearby and my office is across the street from this place so I frequent the area with my wife for lunch.It is still relatively untouched by large coffee chain businesses (only 1 coffee bean and a smaller one at each end).Try as many shops as you can, cause I have yet to be disappointed by any of the ones I tried. (Well, there was one but they went out of business soon after, so that doesn't count!)"
Nice for coffee or tea after lunch or dinner.,"The cafe street is great to stop by after a meal, with friends or family as there are plenty of places to go without worrying about waiting in line. There are plenty of different themed cafes that you can surf through and multiple pricepoints to serve almost any budget.At the most western border of the streets i also would recommend a place called gagae mekjoo which is a run down soju/beer store (its really hard to call this place a bar) which is themed to look like an old school crappy deli, it's actually a fun place with a funny vibe and can be a great place for foreigners to enjoy cheap beer and food with locals.Everywhere can look crowded but outter skirts of the neighborhood are less congested so dont hesitate to wander off from the main street."
Beautiful cafes with great ambience ,The jukjeon cafe street is lined with many cosy beautifully designed cafes and shops. It is also located just beside a small river and I would recommend taking a walk along the river. I had a coffee at one of the pet cafes in the area which was very enjoyable.
Best Cafe Street,"This is probably the best cafe street in Bundang/Suji. Has a lot of variety in terms of restaurants and shops. Well worth the visit to this friendly place. A lot of locals and little international influence, which for me gives a great Korean experience. "
