"It's cosmetics, cosmetics and more cosmetics. ",Interesting place if you're looking for cosmetics. Go for the street food as the restaurants here serve Korean food that's below par with a higher price. It's hard to bargain even with the stalls and mom-pop kind of retail outlets as I have the impression that they have fixed the prices. 
A great shopping experience ,This street is simply a good visit. There are all kinds of shops from stalls to big departmental stores and prices vary accordingly. It has great street food especially at night and it’s a good place to interact with everyday Koreans. It’s worth a visit 
Highlight of my trip,The shopping here was fantastic. The Korean face products were not too expensive and street food was awesome.
So lovely and vibrant ,"This area got it all. Small shops big departments store, food street and restaurants. Gets very busy late evening specially on weekends. "
Shopping Heaven,"Even if you are not a shopaholic, you would agree that this place is a shopping heaven especially for cosmetics. There's a lot of brands you can find here without good price. Find shop called, Baviphat where the items here are much cheaper than the other shops. If you are buying from the stalls, bargain as much as you can!"
Shop. Snack. Repeat.,"Fun place to wander around at night and stock up on k-beauty supplies. Shop employees will be handing out “free” sheet masks in exchange for ushering you into the stores and trying to make a sale, so be prepared lol. This place gets packed after dark w/ tourists and locals alike. Tons of delicious restaurants and street food to choose from, so come hungry."
Fun after dark,Good place to spend an hour. Go after dark when the street food vendors have set up and the stores are still open. A bit touristy but good fun nonetheless.
The Happening Spot! ,"A good spot to spent your evening here - plenty of food stalls and others like clothing, souvenirs, cosmetics accessories, etc.Take your time to walk from one end of the street to the other.A must visut place whenever you're in Seoul. "
Food!!!,One of the best place for hawker food in Seoul plus shopping! Cold weather this time and there’s a Nanta Show here!
a lot of restaurant here!,"There are a lot of people and shops in this area. when I first went there, there were so many people that it was inconvenient but after a while i feel comfortable.If you want to taste Korean street food, go here!"
Must visit,"Day and night both speak the local food and shopping culture - delicious and interesting street food, most trendy beauty and clothing shops. Unquestionably crowded but amazing just to walk around!"
Myeongdong Shopping,"This is a crazy and great shopping district where there are a lot of lanes that you can cover. Definitely a place that you can visit a few times during your stay in Seoul. A lot of things can be found there like clothing, skin care, food etc..."
A must do in Seoul,This is a must do if you visit Seoul! The street food is fantastic. It however gets really crowded and you see the same cosmetic shops scattered all over the place. The staff at the cosmetic shops here are not as friendly as those in other parts of Seoul and not so willing to give samples as compared to past visits; but a still must do when you are in Seoul. 
Shopping!,"If you love shopping, this is a good place to be. Very busy street, lots of big brands have shops here. It's also nice to be here at nighttime. "
Great area to walk around,"This a great area to walk around, do some shopping if you're into that and also to eat. You can walk to the cable car that will take you to the Seoul Tower from there and there is also a church that you can visit. Overall is a good place to visit as there are multiple options and there is a subway station nearby too. "
Street Food!,"First night in Seoul, we head over after dinner not knowing what to expect. We used an undercrossing, and as soon as you started back up the stairs, the smell of cooking food was like a beacon. Lining both sides and in the center of the streets were random booths, selling everything from pop sockets to fish pancakes. Was definitly a great experience walking up and down and seeing all the different vendors, and all the stores behind still open as well"
Best place to shopping cosmetic,"I really2 like Myeongdong because I can visit it in night time and it still so full of people... If you looking for cosmetic, this is the place that you should visit. For muslim, there are food stal that has halal logo (even the chicken), just search the halal logo in the stallYou can access the shopping district from myeongdong station and walk to euljiro4(sa)-ga (even though the areas near euljiro4(sa)-ga not to crowded. Along with the route you can find cheap cloth store (check out the basement of the store to pay and more goods)"
Late night shopping and great street food,"We came in at 9pm and the streets were still bustling. Most of the stores closed at 11pm so we had fun looking around the shops and the stalls, eating street food along the way."
All styles for all ages ,"Good street food, and a massive selection And range of shopping Options. Well worth a trip with all ages of children and adults "
짱 - Myeongdong Street Food,"Myeongdong Street Food - 짱♡ almost all of the food at the Myeongdong Street FoodShould try : Gimbap, Eomuk, Dak-kkochi, Hotteok, Bingsu, Ppopgi, Yangnyeom-chikin, Cheesy Grilled Mussel, Jokbal, Bossam, Japchae, Jajangmyeon, Okonomiyaki, Grilled Garlic Butter Shrimp, Bindae-tteok, Honey Vanilla Ice Cream Bread, Strawberry, etc... "
This Is One Of the Best Shopping Spots in the World,"I brought my wife here and it was like she was in Disneyland. I’m not into shopping, but it made her super happy. Everything is very cheap with decent quality. It’s not all beauty and makeup products, but it’s definitely a woman shopping zone."
This is real experience!,Myeongdong reminded us of Harajuku - it's filled with street food vendors and little shops (mostly clothing and skin care/cosmetics). Great for people watching or getting amongst the throng and wandering around a bit!
Shopping palace and street food paradise,"Must try the street food even some are repeatings. For the street clothes stall, we noticed that they are not putting any price tag.I guess if you are tourist, they will just quote you higher price. Please be alert and aware. Of course, the cosmetics is alot and many brands to choose and great offer for masks. During the trips to Seoul, I never purchase any mask even they are in cheap price. Because I have seen alot mask promo, they actually put the mask at outside the store during day time under the sun. Choose those store with tax free and with promo. Plan to go there at least 2-3 days so that you can see which store offering lower price for the same items."
Street food extravaganza!,"This is a must do when in Seoul; the street food and whole area comes alive especially at nighttime. Indulge and enjoy... from hearty dishes to dessert, there is something to everyone’s taste. It’s packed with people but generally easy to navigate. Shopping is an added bonus here!"
Must experience,Myeongdong is a must when visiting Seoul. There’s plenty of shopping and a variety of street foods to enjoy. If you get tired of that you can always go underground shopping. You can bargain and get get some deals too.
Cheap stuff,"Many shops with cheap stuff, a lot of face masks and cosmetics etc. Been there 1 hour nothing interesting "
Beauty paradise,"A delightful street sprawled with endless beauty shops makes one lost for choice..but rest assured the cosmetics sold are Korean products and clearly labelled.Shop assistants are happy to explain if there's a need. There are freebies handed out at almost every shop and lots of instore offers. The most popular are the korean sheet masks which are just amazing ! There are small cafes in area n the area is next to the subway , easy to get to."
Shopping street,"Anything from high end brands in huge stores, to smaller discount shops, cosmetics, street food - and a great bubbling atmosphere. "
Shopping area,"If you love shopping , beauty products, clothes and food., you must go there and i really like this overcrowded area specialy at night with crazy food stands...a real must i would say. Also you can visit Seoul tower and hannam village."
Busy shopping street,"A lot of shopping options. Good street food options, but we had dinner prior, so we couldn't really eat anymore. Street food probably a bit expensive relatively compared to the restaurant options. Many shops, a lot of tourists, and a bit difficult to move around as there were so many people. Mostly selling cosmetics. Have never seen so many face masks in my life!"
Shopping and Streetfood,"The first thing we saw stepping out of the taxi is the KoreaMart. We then proceeded to shop for unique Korean snacks, Maxim coffee, chocopie, all kinds of face masks, as pasalubong.We also tried the streetfood of sausage&tekkbokki, fish cake on a stick. We were too full to try the rocket potato and seafood. We also shopped at Innisfree. There are a lot of make-up stores here. There are also many ""tiangge""style sellers of clothes, coats, socks, trinkets, etc.A must place to visit ecen if you are looking to shop."
“Amazing shopping Street in Seoul”,It’s definitely one of the most attractive street for shopping in Seoul and it’s highly recommended especially during the sales time. The shops open till 11 PM and most restaurants open till mid night. It’s good place for hanging around with friends and family especially during both the weekdays and weekends. Some goods are sold with a very good price and recommended to buy during sales and reduction session.
Myeongdong,Nice shopping street. Suggest to go during early Nov as the cooling weather can ensure you won’t sweat while shopping around here.Recommend to try Innisfree Green cafe. Nice soufflé.
The best of Seoul,"I spent 9 days in Seoul and must have gone to Myeongdong 3 or 4 times, I loved everything about this place, specially the night market with loads of good food. Definatly one of the best neighborhoods in Seoul."
Awesome! Go at night!,Very cool night market with many fun street vendor foods to try. Bustling with activity all hours of the night.
Best place!!!,The best place for shopping and food in seoul but more expensive than other streets in seoul..but it's really nice.
Great face cream shopping.,Close to Lotte Hotel. Short walking distance and discovering little shops. Lovely Korean face creams found here.
Great shopping experience,There are so many shops here of various sizes selling a variety of items. At night a large number of food and drink stalls are set up with a. huge variety of tasty Korean foods. It does get very busy but well worth a visit
As expected ,"Has about everything you would expect to include ""bargains "" but I found for some items, just shopping in traditional stores would find the same price or slightly cheaper.It was fun and worth a trip if you're being dragged their by you gf/wife just seeing that many people shopping and eating street food is part of the charm"
A must visit whenever I am in Seoul,"Street food and shopping. Also you can buy souvenirs and treats, like the famous almond honey butter and cute socks.Its a very lively place, big crowd.There are a lot of restos in this area, better check them out."
Awesome for shopping,"A must visit shopping street if you really love to shopping or like to window shopping.you can get everything from here. Even at night you will feel like morning here. A place where you can shop, observe people. A lot tourist you can see here with various style of seller and customer. A largest Uniqlo in seoul and 11 levels of dyson also available here.I stay here for 7 nights and what i can say this place is very crowded and happening. Not suitable for anyone who want to relax and quiet place but for shopping its really awesome.No word can describe :)"
Street food and cosmetics haven,Love the tiny shops selling cheap and good cosmetics and yummy street food! The energy of the place is great! Totally enjoyed it.
Crazy shopping and street food fun,"Many shops to shop and plenty of street food stalls, even halal food are available. Many options to buy souvenirs to bring home for family and friends"
Nice food and Shooping ,"Very popular place. Clean and lot of tourists, the food is exciting and clean especially in street. There specialty shops around the area. The ambiance are very celebrating. Will coming back again for our next Holiday. Thank you "
Wide variety of foods and shopping items but too crowded,"The place was swarming with tourists and locals alike, but the dizzying scene was compensated by the delicious street foods and a plethora of shopping options. Then again, food prices were too pricy. Anyway, if you're in for your first experience in Seoul, this area should be one of your first destinations!Also, there is a tourist information center just near Myeongdong Catheral where you can ask for directions of money exchange shops, luggage coin lockers and the like. The guides directing us were really friendly and willing to help."
Crowded,Myeongdong is not what it used to be. Totally disappointed ☹️ streets filled by food vendors and most of clothing shops converted to make up shops:(
Make sure you check and compare prices,"Please make sure you compare prices before you make your decision to buy. Prices vary double.I bought some nuts in a shop which offered tasting. (It looked like special store), it costs W6,300 each. I picked few bags with different flavours and paid.Once I stepped out and walked to the next shop which offered buy one , get one free.Another similar experience was happened in Namdaemun market, I bought 2 packs of stainless steel chopsticks at W5,000 each, at the next shop ( just 3 steps away), it costed W10,000 for 3 packs. This experience told me that I need to compare prices in different shops before I make final decision to buy."
Shopping and Food Paradise,A great place to have anything in affordable and reasonable price. You will love this place and to me is better than others country with such place. Trust me you won't regret as the variety of food and goods to buy is pretty awesome...
Let's shopping!!!,"So many shops and nice restaurants,cafe,etc...Start 4pm street foods. One day can spend this site.If with little kids bit hard area I think,coz so many peoples here."
Seoul2019,"Shop and dine in Myeongdong whenever you find yourself in Seoul. They have everything and more! So many great restaurants, street food could be a bit pricey but the ambience and the fun vibe covers for it all. You will also find hundreds of cosmetics and souvenir shops. Cafes and bingsu shops are tops too!"
Excellent Night Market ,"The night market is a must to visitors here... an excellent variety of local el fresco food available to cater for all and some even sell Halal food. There are also retail outlets adjacent mostly selling cosmetics, sport shoes, etc ! "
Only good for shopping,This place is too crowded and I only went there for shopping. Didn't try any restaurants there but luckily the snack along the side of the street was pretty good.
So crowded at night,Mostly sell cosmetic product and almost all are selling the same type of food just with a bit different taste/ price... the food is pricey and some were tasteless.
Good for shopping ,"Very alive and vibrant area, for me a good place to explore when in Seoul and it’s best to go there late in the afternoon and in the evening when food stalls are lining in the streets with different varieties of street food. One of the special thing to visit in this area is the dog cafe and cat cafe. It is also a good place to shop for cosmetics and souvenirs, etc."
Exciting modern shopping area spread over several streets.,"This area is a must for travellers to visit. If you are into Labels you will find them all here. Also street food, cafes and coffee shops. Also a pretty impressive cathedral for those interested in such. "
Food and shopping ,"A must go in Seoul. Opens till 11-12am. Tows of street food and shopping. Grab s ok me facial masks for your girlfriends and wives. Go for the bbq pork skewers, cheese lobsters and boba tea. Skip the fried chicken cutlet and red bean porridge. "
Great busy shopping district,Great place to shop. All of them are smaller shops on both sides of the street and there is no traffic in the street so everybody goes there.
Best Street Food Ever,"The Myeongdong Market was easy to get to and the street food was the best. You Can sample fried chicken, octopus, escargot, squid, coffee and shop for clothing. There are so many vendors we loved it."
Face Products and Food Galore!,"When I think of Korea, I think of 2 main things: face products and yummy food! The Myeongdong Night Market helped to kill 2 birds with 1 stone. First off, this market is crowded and very lively. There booths set up on the streets selling food, clothes, and souvenirs. The food was amazing! The 2 main things I would recommend are the Roast Lobster with Cheese and the egg bread. Both were really great. The streets are also lined with some of the most popular Korean skincare brands, including my personal favorite “Holika Holika”. Overall, if you’re wanting to eat some yummy food while sfocking up on face products, I would highly recommend shopping!"
So much going on ,"If you want to shop, eat, drink or just watch the hectic Seoul world stroll by then this is the place for you. There is so much activity, lights, people but it is all safe and interesting. A highlight was the Korean Fried Chicken and beer - I am not a shopper."
One of the top spots for shopping ,"A lot of different types and sizes of shops selling a wild range of products. Is a must-go place for first-timer. There are also a LOT of restaurants. You could spend a whole day here. Moreover, there are also numerous fx shops here."
"Shopping, food and loads of fun",Highly recommend those who are interested in shopping (clothing/cosmetics) to stay in the area. The street comes alive at night when the food vendors push out their carts. Avoid the overly westernized foods as they are pricey and not very tasty. For those purchasing face masks/beauty make sure you shop around the same product can vary as much as 50% from a different store. Dr Jart masks are a must buy. 
Food street,"We had a fabulous time shopping and trying the various foods sold along the streets in Myeongdong. The rose ice cream (6000KRW) was especially pretty and yummy. Green tea/yoghurt/strawberry flavour and also chocolate flavour. We also enjoyed Egg Bread (2000KRW), Chestnut, Ginko Seeds, Fish Ball skewers, bbq pork, and much more."
Cool and cool,There were so many street foods and street markets with a Korean atmosphere and you could find your travel special from there
Tons of Fun,"If you like shopping and street food, this is the place to go. Tons of food choices from sweets, fried chicken, churros, meats, seafood, etc, and lots of local foods you won't see anywhere else. It all smelled delicious even though I couldn't sample any of it because of food allergies. The shopping was just as extensive with both mainstream retailers everyone knows, to local stores, to carts with ""authentic"" goods. Lots of people during the evening, but grest for people watching. Most full service restaurants here are inside the buildings that line the streets on the second or third floors. Just a fun area to go and explore. "
Myeongdong will not disappoint you,If you are in the Myeongdong area you can get anything you need from here .... from bargains to upscale products as there is a Lotte department store here too. Not shopping but on a food trip??? Restaurants abound from fine dining to street food. Whatever your heart desires will be met here. Make sure you spend enough time in Myeongdong when you are in Seoul. 
great people watching ,"I was not in a shopping mood but I explored the area as part of my vacation workouttoo much food to choose from. check out the live seafood (eels and octopus)cute police station, good place to exchange currency. I saw only 1 street bum.beauty products.... look at the foam"
"Bussy, late night shopping ",Most of the shops closes at 11pm. Restaurant closes earlier. Very busy area with lots and lots of cosmetic shops everyone trying to lure you in with free samples. Food stalls offers typical street food of Korea. Worth a visit once. 
Lively ,"Very lively little street at night, both a mix of local culture and lights alongside European influences."
Favorite shopping place,It is best for cosmetics specially the facial masks. The merchants are helpful and willing to give you samples and extra bonus if you buy some. Street foods are many variettes but so so but it is fun to try .
Shopping and Food madness,"Every major city in Asia has a shopping area and combined with food stalls. Seoul has one and this place is crazy, especially in the evening hours. While the shop keepers try to lure you in to buying cosmetics, streets are lined with food stalls from either side with plenty of options, reasonably priced and decent quality. If you are a vegetarian, you will have limited choice but to see the spectacle, you must visit"
come early for enjoying the shopping experience,"If you the type of person who enjoy shopping then Myeongdong is the place for you. from cosmetics, shoes, t-shirt, souvenirs even food you can get in here.if you come in the afternoon, the area is not that packed with people but there's no street food but if you come in the evening there's a lot of people and of course the street is full of street food."
Best street shops,"It's a best street shop for food and drink and sweet ,, cofeThe street have a shops and both they sell every thing You can spend 5 ,6 hours"
"A must experience, must do!","This is what we were looking for, an experience of sound, light, food, and aromas that assault your senses. As soon as we began our walk through the area we knew this was the real Seoul we has come to see. Crowded streets filled with pedestrians, flashing neon, and a cornucopia of food to sample and wares to buy. It is something to experience at night or at least early evening, things just get going at dusk. There are all sorts of stores to shop and food to eat, you decide what you want. We just enjoyed taking it all in and strolled the alleys and streets, people watching and observing. I do recommend the fried curly potato on a stick rolled in BBQ seasoning."
Worth an experience,"I visited the night market and it was quite a pleasant walk, just looking at things. This place sells mainly skincare, clothes and street food. The variety of skin care brands and products is so wide but I did not buy anything. Mainly because I was not sure which ones are good and they all look the same to me. But if you are a big fan of Korean skin care, this may be a place to visit. Street food is nice but not fantastic. My overall experience is good. The place is vibrant and busy, the weather was cool and comfortable when I was there. I am not really a night market person but I really enjoyed my walk, looking at things and people."
You are not Pushed Here,"Visited at night when the shopping street becomes a night market after a plethora of booths, almost all selling street food, are set up in the middle of the road.Because the streets containing the market are wide, there is plenty of room to walk comfortably, without claustrophobia, having to push or being pushed. This gives Myeongdong night market an advantage over every other night market I’ve visited in Asia.A further plus is the amazing variety of foodstuffs offered. As opposed to other similar markets in Asia you don’t have three, four, or ten merchants offering exactly the same food.For those who like street food and/or night markets Myeongdong night market is very highly recommended."
Mecca for everything SKIN CARE and more ,"My daughter and I stayed at a hotel right in the center of Myeongdong and proved to be the most convenient! If you are looking for anything For skin care.... this is absolutely the place. Do your research about Korean beauty products, there are a million brands ... it is quite overwhelming .... store after store offer beauty products. Also there are lots of clothing stores, restaurants, coffee shops and much much more. The stores close a little later at night so its a very fun street to walk day or night. On Sundays, all the street food and bargain stalls set up in the middle of the streets making it much more fun even... it was nice to walk around the take a taste of the different kinds of street food. This street is a must see when in Seoul . "
Best shopping place in Seoul ,"Been to Seoul countless times, and feel that this is probably still the best shopping place for tourists, especially ladies. It’s practically ladies’ heaven... lots of beauty shops, and fashion shops. Love the street food during the evenings. No matter how many times I’ve been to Seoul, this is still a must go destination whenever I’m there."
"Fun vibe, but the food is very much overhyped","With expectations set pretty high after watching loads of Youtube videos on this neighborhood, I was understandably left feeling 'eh' about it after getting a chance to experience this for a few days.First off, I loved the vibe of the neighborhood, despite how crowded it became every night. That said, the neighborhood actually is not that big - two main thoroughfares, primarily, each maybe 4-5 blocks long. Lots of side streets with other shops and food options, but the main action really is on the thoroughfares. Lots of cosmetic shops, lots of cheap clothing of the Forever 21 quality level.The street food was very much hit or miss, nothing completely mind blowing. Lots of repeat stands, but note that not all the stands have the same quality. I tried to use the length of the lines for each as a rough gauge on how good the stand may be - also a hit or miss approach.Two tips and heads up (literally):- there are a lot of hidden eateries, cafes, and shops in all the buildings above ground level. really pay attention and look up to see what you may be missing out on! I found a few cafes that I loved - grab a coffee and a window seat and you can people watch all the action down below for awhile- garbage cans are really hard to come by. stay with the vendor you purchase food from and chuck your garbage with them after you're done, or come prepared"
Must see!,"We went down several times in the evening. Street food is very diverse and even finer. The atmosphere is inimitable, real Korea!"
All day action area ,"One can basically shop till they drop as there are countless of shops selling cosmetics, clothes, souvenirs, etc. There are also many restaurants and cafes in the area. The street vendors will start setting up their stalls from about late morning and finishes late at night. Many of these vendors sell street food as well as other stuffs, so the area is a great spot to try Korean street food.Do bear in mind that in the evening and night, this place is packed. Also, we found some street vendors are selling some souvenirs at much higher prices than in Namdaemun market.Overall, it is a great spot for shopping and getting food, whether it is restaurant or street food."
Food Heaven,"I ate here most nights. Great location to just stroll and eat. Can get crowded, but that is also part of the charm. Must visit when in Seoul."
Great shopping experience,Lots of shops and stalls selling everything. I spent the whole might walking around and tried most street food.
Busy,"Otherwise known as cosmetic street, I found it very busy and expensive, compared to other places. I also believed I got more samples of cosmetic when I brought stuff in other areas of Seoul. Also restaurants in the are are expensive, and feels a bit like tourist rip off central."
Lovely Night Market,"This street is full of life! If you are into shopping for food, facial products and clothing, it’s full of those options. At night, it comes alive with endless stalls. The night market has some of the best local foods. The fresh watermelon juice, cheese corndogs, potatoes on a stick covered in powdered cheese, octopus balls and more, are a few I’d highly recommend. "
Not just a shopping street,"It's a wide shopping area which includes a ""night"" market. Very colorful, clean, and you can find many interesting things to taste."
Mmm,"They have 2 Market places, very similar, they have their history, But to crowded, if you do nit have anything to do go"
Full of cosmetics store :) ,"Great place to buy local souvenirs, Korean cosmetics, bags/shirts etc and you can bargain! If you're lucky they even give you up to 20% disc. "
The only good thing about visiting seoul,"Lots of food and items to buy for yourself or souvenirs. I recommend you to buy almonds, cosmetics and clothes if you come here. Dont bother about the restaurants because you will want to try all the street food stalls. The food stalls is not good as Japanese or Taiwanese stalls but they are good nonetheless."
Touristy place,"Everything at hand - food, cosmetics, clothes, things you need and don't need. Very touristy but worth a visit if first time. Vibe is very foodie related! Enjoy ;)"
Beauty Products Haven,"Myeongdong is a haven for Korean beauty products. The atmosphere was buzzing in this area. I only visited in the night time and there was an array of street food. One thing to note is that you'll see the same shops every 100-200 metres apart so if you're not looking for anything specific but are on a time crunch, I'd suggest visiting the bigger branches which should have everything. However if you're looking for specific Brands/products, you may have to visit different branches if brand/product isn't as popular. For example, I was looking for COSRX products which I found only to be available in certain branches of Olive Young."
Fun place to spend a few hours,There are numerous shops selling everything you can image. Enjoyed the sights and got some good deals on gifts to take home to family and friends.
"Good for females,couples and families",A place to buy the lastest and most trendiest lines of cosmetic product. Great place to buy cosmetics souvenir for your love ones.
Crowded but worth an experience ,"We really liked the street food market there. We came there for snacks every day. The best thing were the stuffed puff paste fishes.The other things you can buy there (Tshirts, handy covers, toys etc.) aren‘t high of quality but the market is worth an experience. Especially since there are good and known shops too. "
Fun market experience,"Many many shops, skin care stores, cat cafes, street food and more. Definitely recommend as a tourist experience. "
Full of surprises,"A lot of skincare shops along the shopping street, with lots of streetfoods to check out the place well and for you to shop.Myeongdong is located at Line 4. Easy to find with Subway app and Rome2rio app locator.My second time in Myeongdong street and its better to travel with your friends and family! But at your own risk since its very crowded and you might get lost. Be sure to know your meet up points in case you are lost.Be careful also to the sales person who pulls you to buy their product. Be alert!"
Shops everywhere,"Beauty products, clothings, bags, socks, snacks, street food, cafes, tea houses, everything you need is here. Be sure to have a list before going to this area because you might end up buying things you dont really need. Kpop stuffs are abundant. You can get a lot of samples if you buy from cosmetic shops and they usually give you another item free. Dont get lost by taking picture of the street where you enter so you can go back to that area in going to your place. Street food costs around 3,000-4000 kr won, cosmetics at 1000-75.000 kr won and clothing from 6000-15,000 won for cheapest range. Restos from 12,000-33,000 kr won, its a set meal usually good for 3-4 pax. You will really enjoy this place. A must visit for traveler. A lot of cheap accomodation in the area."
"Beautiful experience, fantastic street food","Myeongdong Shopping District is a must-see if you're travelling to Seoul. I would recommend spending an entire evening walking around and exploing the area while tasting some street food! There is a big choice among typical stuff and very un-healthy desserts.As for shops and resturants there is a wide choice, almost everything is typical from Korea!"
Excellent ,Shopping street bustling with tourists and locals alike. Worth a visit... or 2... street food was expensive and had nothing to shout about though
Awesome and attracts for women,Cannot move on with the shops and boutiques.hahaHahaI feel good and happy there.will come again later ehh
Skincare heaven,"Skincare, cosmestics, stationeries, phone accessories as well as some trendy clothings. Most shops offer immediate tax refund, if not, you can try to locate kiosks to do so. You can save more if you buy in bulk with lots of free gifts offered. Tired of shopping? There are many casual eateries and even street food at night."
Expensive Shopping District,"H & M and other major brands. Why shop here for what you can get elsewhere? Go to Namdaemun or other ""local"" shopping district for better deals and better prices. Some street food inside, more on the main road outside. "
Great for shopping and street food,"The whole area is very vibrant and crowded, with a mixture of street stalls, bargain shops and international brands. If you enjoy shopping for make up and clothes this is the place for you.There are plenty of restaurants but the street food is so good you can eat well on the go"
Shopping paradise!,Perfect place in Seoul to grab a bite and get your shopping done! Plenty of street food options and retail shops to choose from!
Manic but a must if you are a beauty addict.,"So for sometime now I have been using various Korean beauty products. Needless to say when I finally booked my holiday to South Korea, I immediately did my research where to buy beauty products. The place to head to is Myeongdong district which contains a grid of streets brimming with shops selling beauty products. Seriously, I was in heaven. I also found that if you spend over £30,000 won most of the shops would immediately deduct the tax free amount so no need to claim it separately. Take your passport with you.Also, when you buy stuff from these shops most of them give you freebies ... I loved it. A must visit for anyone who is a beauty junkie like me. "
good food nice shops,"here is a place where you can buy make ups and tons of korean beauty products. they also have some restaus, pharmacies, groceries and street food. live the street food especially the fried banana and glazed strawberries"
Shopping,"Looking to stock up on beauty products, creams and everything you will ever need, this is the street to go.. They do deals for tourists like buy 10 get 10 free plus if you take your passport with you they will give you the vat back on it. You dont need to take your passport but it saves the lines once you get to the airport to claim your vat back"
More of an evening location,"Initially walked around at mid-day and it was deadsville. Lots of shops and restaurants that could be found in multiple other locations. Happened to come back in the early evening and was shocked by the amount of people walking around, the lights and the energy. Don’t regret going but still didn’t feel it was particularly special."
Everything you need is here,"very neat and organised shopping street, good stuffs ranging from cheap until branded.the attractive ones are line shop and art box. the place is also very instagrammableproblem is quite hard to find that can show the direction in English, since the google maps doesn't help a lot in finding certain spots by walking. Still very interesting place to visit even more than 1 time during one visit. will try again to visit during night time with different ambiences of course. Since it would take a lot of walking, good shoes and nice weather/ season choosing would be important."
Delicious food vendors,"The Myeongdong marketplace is a large area offering a large variety of clothing, beauty products, and food vendors. It comes alive after 5:00 PM with young people and tourists converging into the area. Of special note is the “Cookin’ Nanta” theatrical production located in the heart of Myeongdong. A definite “must see”. Also, if you like lobster, the bbq lobster tails with cheese are scrumptious. Numerous street vendors offer this delight."
Lots of food and shopping,Full of tourists and nice ambience for shopping. Good prices and a lot of varieties but a lot of fake goods so beware
Trending market ,"This is a long and small road that has formed a market. Inexpressible by the excitement of this market. This is a street market so it is very fun and too much items.If you are a food lover, this is the street with the most junk food, the price of food is not expensive, only about 10.000won.Besides, this is also a place selling many cosmetics and fashion clothes. From famous fashion brands to ordinary types. The neighboring countries in Asia also see this market as a precursor and create fashion trends for Asia.If you come to this market to shop, you should prepare personal trolleys because there are so many goods here, you will save health and spend more time to shop, enjoy delicious food."
Shopping ,We had no idea how much shopping plays in the lives of the Koreans. This area is like times Square in New York. 
"Very clean, friendly and polite people, interesting and a visual shopping feast","Very interesting varied shopping area. Friendly, helpful and polite venders. Good bargains to be had.At night markets, street food very cheap and delicious. Fascinating to watch the stall holders prep and cook their food- very clean. Area well lit, easy walk, friendly atmosphere, Well worth a visit"
Great place to shop and eat,"Fun, bustling area with plenty of places to shop , people watch and eat. Great Korean restaurants and street food options are plenty and delicious."
Hustling and bursting with food,"We stay at nine tree Myeong-dong2 hotel ,about a block away from the shopping area Nice walk up the litter hill and you are there , after 4pm all the street food stall starting to come out and in no time at all every corner is fill with food stall , prepare to go there with an empty stomach, everything you can imagine it’s there , wow what a place to be I feel like a kid , wanting to try everything, because of so many different type of food we went there 3 night in a roll just to try as much as we can"
Good for an evening vibe,"This is where to come to get the street food in Seoul - there is loads of it available in the evenings. There's also a lot of high street fashion brands, including the Korean affordable brand 8 seconds. Recommend visiting the Myeongdong cathedral at the same time."
Just like any other shopping destination in Asia,Good to see just for the sake of knowing how it looks like in person. But it’s just like any other shopping destinations in asia with focus on beauty and skincare products. Although there are other selections too like clothes and shoes. Street food’s quite nice if you’re starving while shopping. That’s all there is to it.
Busy shopping street with lots of food stalls,"A busy areas of stalls down the main side streets of Myeongdong. There is a lot of tat stalls but within there is traditional korean stalls. The variety of food on offer is excellent but beware if stalls don't display a price - always ask first, as prone to overcharge tourists. "
"If you like shopping, this is your place","Seoul is plenty of shopping centers, markets,.... but Myeongdong is the top:a jungle of shops, restaurants, bars, hotels,... that will meet your expectations. If shopping is a boring activity, acoording to me, avoid this place."
Shopping central,"This is definitely a great place to stop by. Even if you don't care for shopping too much, they have a lot of great street food options and it's just really cool to see and experience. If you do love shopping, then this will be glorious. Maybe even to the point that it can get overwhelming. Not only do they have hundreds of shops in a bunch alleys, there are multiple (and I mean MULTIPLE) of the same shop. So, if you're looking for Etude House, you'll probably find 4+ of those. It can get confusing considering how many alleyways there are. Also, the stands will have some shopping too.Overall, a great place but if you're wanting to shop I'd suggest dedicating at least a few hours. It's a lot to go through."
Amezing Myeongdong,The most colorful area of Seoul. The paradise of cosmetics and fine coffee. People from all over the world are doing their shopping and at the same time tasting amazing local delicacies from street vendors. Don't be afraid to try them! The market starts from the Catholic Cathedral and reaches the Lotte department store.
"Feast for the eyes, Ladies' Haven","So much to see, so much to explore. The koreans are really good at their pitch sales. The attractive deals and the friendly sales people draw me back night after night to hunt down its bargain. Go in the night, weather is cooler in the evenings in June and the street foods are irresistible. "
Superb Shopping Location,"If you have clothes or shoes to buy, look no further. You will go crazy at the number of ABC-Mart or fashion boutiques here. Shoes are really much cheaper in Korea! I wonder why that is so though. There are also many roadside stalls selling Korean street food, although there tend to be many shops of the same variety. I think the best experience is to grab any street food you like and munch on them while shopping. By the time you are done, you would be filled with food but empty in the wallet."
Shopping street,Shopping street good also for street food: a lot of choices and a lot of restaurant around.You should find also what you are looking for.Nice place where to walk for your shopping.
Myeongdong is a must!,"Our Myeongdong street experience is one part of our “fantastically memorable “ Seoul trip. This is a must see experience. We enjoyed the food vendors here and you’ll see how the place is well patronized by people of different culture. The vendors are so kind in receiving tourists who were there to join the fun!! It’s so exhilarating to be there even just to be a spectator the place is easily reached by train, and there are so many things to do and of course buy!"
It's Unique Korean Handmade Store,It is very cozy and lovely the various handmade store.I'd like to highly recommend this store when you visit MyeongDong Street.MyeongDong 6gil 2-1
Must do,It's hard to believe how busy this street is when the rest of Seoul is quiet. This street is a must-visit place. There are so many street foods to try and many restaurants are open late into the night. The best part of this street is the food. Don't miss it.
Crowded area,"Personally, i don’t really like this area but it has some shops i really like, like TopTen10 and Uniqlo. The street food is great though. I was surprised of all the cheap copies of e.g. Supreme that was on sale everywhere"
Very good ,"This a very busy area full of shops and small things to do like late night massage, food and drinks. "
Busy Street,We really enjoyed our visit here even though there are a lot of shoppers going around for this is a famous place that you need to visit when in Korea. Since my daughter loves korean beauty n makeup products she really went crazy buying stuffs for it is much cheaper here. Their street food is good if you're not picky.
A Tourist Spot,"If you never see what's night market, then this is the place. You can try all kinds of Korean street food. You can shopping at all kinds of shops. But, be careful if you have young children as they will get lost as it is very crowded during weekends. "
Everyday a place to go since it's close late and near to my hotel,"It's just not tired for coming here everyday!!! I love all the sports shop there just too many! I grab most item that is on sale. From face mask of all korean brand to try, make up, sports shoes, bags, ladies clothes, socks, korean snacks, whatever you need it's just here to get.Must try the street food, take a look at the cart stores selling clothes, jackets, korean small restaurant to dine, Cafes, too many aisle to walk just don't get lost or find the Nature Republic Green leaves at the tall wall if going back to the train subway :)"
Night Time Shopping,"Plenty of shops in this area of Seoul and they appear to stay open all night as well. Busy area with lots of local restaurants, street food and national and international chain stores selling mostly clothing, make up and other fashion products. Be prepared to be walking very slowly as it is likely that the crowds in this area will make it impossible to get anywhere fast. Not my kind of shopping area with all the international stores but a good place to visit anyway."
Must see for shoppers....,"Non-shoppers may want to stop by just to see the scene or grab some delicious street food. Myeong-Dong is super busy from about mid-morning until late at night. Really, there is something for everyone however, mostly geared toward those interested in shopping. Skin care products are all the rage and are all over the place here - from high end to bargain buys, there are clothes in all sizes, and more food options than you could imagine. Street foods (anything on a stick), the sweet and savory egg bread, my personal favorite Delimanjoo (pricy at exit 4 of the metro, they put on a bit of a show too), and higher end restaurants where you can sit for a nice meal. Go with patience and empty hands (i.e. - don't bring your luggage). Definitely not a 'local market' experience however, good for some gifts to send home and people watching."
Very vibrant at night,"I really like Myeongdong night market. Its so alive and people of all ages come here, so it's not just tourists. Its a great place for street food and souvenir socks which retail at W10,000 for 11. I'd definitely cone back again. "
Everything in one place,Massive shopping area with side by side cosmetics and fashion stores making for easy price comparisons. And food stalls that come out at sunset make for a wonderful street food experience.
Shop Shop Shop💯,"Myeongdong shopping street was easy to access as it is near the subway station(exit 7). The shopping street has different things that you could buy such as souvenirs,branded shoes(fila,nike etc),bags and they even have street food that sells halal food which is easy for a muslim traveller like me. So you could grab street food whenever you are hungry while shopping definitely recommend travellers to visit Myeongdong to shop❤️ The price is affordable for certain things as some of souvenirs is pricey but as you walk around you’ll find cheaper ones!!"
Tons of Korean beauty products ,"This shopping street was near our hotel so we made sure we checked it out. The streets were so long and we didn’t see where they end. You can find street food stalls here, Korean marts and souvenirs but omg if you are into Korean Beauty products this is the place!!! I was in heaven and bought so many masks ✌️Definitely worth visiting!!!"
Interesting but I preferred Namdaemun,"This market was interesting,but I found Namdaemun fascinating.If I could only visit one of the two,it would be Namdaemun. "
Busy part of town. A little difficult if you have young children,"I loved this place. When we went, there was a huge market with food, crafts, souvenirs, cheap knock offs.. it was lively and smelled like good food the entire way.. great Korean scene. Lots of people, mix of tourists and locals. We had your children so it was difficult to get around with a stroller. Definitely would not recommend letting your kids walk around without at least holding your hand. If you're looking for a deal, it may not be the best place. Could find similar but cheaper stuff in Dongdaemun, especially on weekends."
Shopping paradise for women,You can never get enough of Myeongdong shopping street if you are a woman who likes yummy street food and make-up. All the Korean brands are there and the prices are cheaper than in my country.
Great shopping area,"Skincare, cosmetics and so many other korean products you can find in this area. Prices are reasonable but it sure is cheaper than buying them from my country. So if youre into korean beauty products there's a line of shops that carry your favorite k- brand that you can choose. You can also buy many other things like korean snacks, souvenirs, cute things and a whole lot more. "
Must see,"Well organized market that has everything from electronics, to groceries, to clothes, to cafes. Everyone was pleasant and no one was pushy. Highly recommend to visit and try some of the local cuisine "
Central skincare products!,"Crowded place. But good to come. Many halal street foods too... if you love skincare products, you should go to this place. I took taxi from hotel near Anguk Station, with just 4000 won... cheap enough."
Lots of good things to see,The shopping street is a series of closed off roads where vendors sell local foods in the evening. Cosmetic shops and local grocery stores proliferate. Not sure if too many bargains can be found but it is a fun night out. Of course the obligatory massage places are also everywhere.
Great shopping and street food 🍲 ,"Top area to go shopping.Really good street food as well !! All diff. brands there. Lots of shops for cloth, beauty products and other things. Reasonably priced. "
Birthday trip,"This was our stop before lunch. This shopping district was very not too crowded and we freely walked from vendors stalls to shops without any rush. Some of us were even braved enough to sample free coffee and teas. We purchased some of our first souvenirs and clothing in this shopping area. Prices were reasonable and you can bargain. We had limited time and were only able to explore one end of the shopping area before meeting with our guide for lunch. If I go back I would certainly add more time here. Again, impressively clean. I was too busy to remember to take pics."
Myeongdong- A Cosmetic Paradise ,"♨️✈️ Myeongdong- A Cosmetic Paradise A cosmetic haven. One can buy, buy and then buy some more and then perhaps come another day to buy few more... and folks that is Myeongdong Market for you.It’s a cosmetic aficionado’s or enthusiast’s paradise.There is a vast potpourri or omnium gatherum of popular Korean cosmetic brands. You could choose or collect all from HOLIKA HOLIKA to Innisfree and Etude House to Tony Moly and MISSHA. The list is never ending. When you feel like taking a break you could pick a fruit glass or choose from an array of grills from the vendors in the middle of the road. Once replenished, you could start all over again. So shop till you drop."
Must to visit at least one of the shopping centers,Must to visit at least one of the shopping centers especially the night ones! Unique experience and not that known... its a great surprise while getting informed about the sight seeing of this wonderful city
Street food and many more,A nice place to spend the evening with the street foods and shops opened until late night. For middle easterners the a halal restaurant Saffron Restaurant is just around the corner.
Amazing,Amazing and almost overwhelming!So many vendors to choose from-all assortments ofgoods and food stalls. Packed at peak times but that is part of the experience!A must see in Seoul!
Bustling place,"In the evening the area becomes a bustling place, with music raging from each & every shop; food stalls, souvenirs, and clothes stalls line up the streets while the lights of commercials and adds placed on the buildings add the finishing touches on this lively & intense place "
"Crowd place, the street food over price","Its full of shops, and it will be no enough for 1-2 hours. Mostly cosmetic and sports shop. We tried to the food street, however we notice they sell the food veryyy pricey as they know many tourist come to the area. As comparison, fish cake in usual street near hongdae is only krw 1000 but in myeongdong krw 2500, same for all street food, all over price. If you get lost, there is always some person with red clothes who can give you direction to closest exit to subway or assist you to find the shop that you want. They usually stand in middle pf myeongdong. Love to see around myeongdong but will not buy food from there again. "
Little of everything along with night market and street food. ,Found this place the first night we got in as it was only 20 min walk from hotel. They have a several street food to sample. Lots to see for a quick tour of the neighborhood Had our first fried chicken and beer here 
Must see,"Skin care stores are all over and you will see their chains on the next block. So don't worry about finding one particular location. Some products irritated my skin and I don't have sensitive skin so test before you buy. We went on a Monday, after 4pm, you will see food stalls on the street. Must try the food!!! They have grilled seafood like lobster tails. There are also restaurants nearby, one inside a mall and they are good too. Underground shopping center for souvenirs is great - items are negotiable. If you need another luggage you can also get it here for all the stuff you buy. Right next to subway line 2 and 3 too."
Perfect ,I love Myeongdong street. This is heaven shopping paradise for me. All the sales person are friendly and warm smile. We love the street food too. 
Crazy energy,"At night, all the stores shine in neon. Every Korean cosmetics company has at least one store here. Also has the honey butter almonds shop. Many street food innovations that I haven't seen before. Not quite cheap, though."
Great for an evening stroll,"Great place for an evening stroll. Plenty of interesting stall having a variety of street food and some very unique,loved the egg buns and grilled lobster"
Lots to browse - layout suspiciously similar to my other fav haunt!,"Myeongdong shopping street and the accompanying underground shopping belt is full of surprises. Look out for the largest Uniqlo, and the “factory outlet” of the famed flavoured nut snacks... nuzzling and busy.Maybe it’s me but the Underground shopping belt is strangely similar to platinum mall in Bkk...."
Myeongdong Shopping street,"Myeongdong street is a shopping heaven, both for food, goods, and beauty products. It is clean and not rowdy, making it a safe place to roam around even at night. You have to try the street foods, they taste really yummy and cheaper than eating at a sit-down restaurant. You can have a good fill of delicious food just walking around while shopping. Beauty products are sold at stores left and right. You cannot go wrong as Korean beauty products are top of the line. It would be a mistake to come home without atleast buying one beauty product. As far as buying replicated goods on the street, it is not advisable to haggle down on the price as every vendor sells pretty much similar items in the same price. Don’t embarass yourself as they will just dismiss you or worse, you may end up being laughed at or given the dirty look. "
Back again and again,"No matter how many times I go to Myeongdong shopping street, I never got tired of it. There are so many shops and people, just very happening place. Lots of nice stuff to buy, apparels, food. We went to the same cafe on 2 consecutive days and will go again if we visit the street in future.At around 4pm, the street vendors start setting up their stalls and the whole place just gets busier. Highly recommend this place to Seoul visitors."
Shopping shopping shopping,"If you want to shop this is the place. We only went for a browse, but you could find anything you needed here. "
"Busy, crowded but fun",We went one night during heavy heavy rains yet still found this open air market unbelievably active and crowded. Fun to look at all the interesting food being sold. Parking pretty impossible there.
touristy but worth a visit,"i’ve been to seoul several times but i still can’t resist returning to this place to shop every time, particularly for masks and cosmetics. yes, it’s touristy and crowded, and you will be solicited by shopkeepers on the street every now and then (i haven’t encountered anyone particularly aggressive or pushy so they’re easy to brush off), but i would still recommend going there to shop for beauty products as there is a wide variety and the prices are decent."
I love it and I hate. ,"Unless you visit at 10am between Mon-Thurs expect it to be a mad house. It’s always jam packed with people. As as westerner it has some of the best options for shopping in my opinion as it offers more stores and sizes that I’m familiar with. Also it has all the major local stores if interested in those. The street food is second to none in Korea! I would recommend everyone go at least twice, first time time to experience the crowds so when you return again you’re have an idea of what to expect and will be able to enjoy it a bit more. "
Great for shopping,A few connected streets suitable for walking and full of shops. Great for shopping clothes and beauty products. The street vendors selling food were all very delicious too.
Best to visit at night,"Lots of shops, market stalls and street food. Feels very safe (as does the whole of Seoul). Most shops accept cred and debit cards."
open-street shopping mall,"especially great after sunset. colourful and impresive. Full of people in street. There are lots of small street. there are sample of fast-food on street mid-line. they are freshly prepare the food such as shrimps, pork rib, kebab, potato and local fast food and you can eat when walking. "
Busy Busy Busy,Myeong-dong market ist so busy. You can buy a lot of stuff you dont really need but also try food you never tried befoe. Seoul has a lot of diffrent types of markets. Check it out !!
Good shopping,"Actually this the second time here in Seoul, we stayed at royal hotel in the heart of Myeongdong, really this nice area , active day ,night, skin care , food,clothes ! You will enjoy while walking here, but August not good month to visit Seoul, so hot,rain also high humidity, choose another month to visit Seoul & enjoy. Regards"
dizzying maze of goods,"Quite an experience + better if you are not set on buying stuff. Interesting street food. Well, since you WILL buy things, they are selling good-priced suitcases as well (Guess, why I know!)"
A Beauty Shopping Heaven,I visited this place almost every night during my 8 days there in Seoul. Many beauty shops and restaurants options. 
Good deals for cosmetics and fashion,"The Myeongdong Shopping Street is actually for us a web of walkable streets that have great stores and food kiosks left and right - Innisfree, Forever21, The Face Shop, optical shops, souvenirs, food like the delicious skewered meats, prawns, ice cream, milk tea - everything!The theater is likewise in this area so you can spend the day here and forget about your worries. Even the shopper with a tight budget has a lot to bring home."
"If You're Looking for Korean Skincare, This is the Place for You",All the famous Korean skincare lines can be found here. So much cheaper buying here than buying them in the US. There are also clothing stores and typical name brand stores on the street. You can also find some really good street food stalls up and down here. There is a nice taxi stop outside the Metro area. 
Great Shopping Area,"Nice environment, variety, reasonable prices, good service and great food.Definitely will come back! I recommend this place!"
Nice but too commercial,"This is probably the best street if you want to have some shopping in the very city center of Seoul.There're lot of stores, bar, cafè and restaurants, but in my opinion the fashion stores are too commercial and nothing special, they don't represent a good picture of the Korean style. Besides prices are higher compared to the other stores and bar that you can find in the city.Very recommended to young people or to people who like this kind of commercial tourism!"
Shopping heaven ,This is a perfect area to spend your time. A lot of shops from street food to brand name products. Prices are also very competitive. There are also many restaurants that one is spoiled for choice. 
Paradise of Street Food,"One of the best place where to go in the night.Is the paradise of korean street food, you can try whatever you want: everything seems delicious (but not exactly cheap) ! There are also many shops, especially beauty shops (as in all cities in Korea), even if they all sell the same things, less or more. Here you can buy sweaters or t-shirts at a cheap price!Unmissable!"
Lots of shops of any kinds,"Here you can find whatever you want: any kinds of foods, souvenirs, cosmetics, toys and whatever other items you would like to bring from Korea at affordable prices. Majority of shops accept credit cards. Despite of crowds of people, no crime at all and very friendly atmosphere. Better time for visit is from 10 AM till 4 PM on working days. "
Wonderful place to wander...and eat!,"We were told that we could get a fast and simple meal from the street food trucks in the Myeongdong area...and mainly that it was SAFE to do so. The streets were mobbed with people of all ages, and the food options ranged from grilled lobster to things I couldn’t pronounce. We opted for the grilled shrimp, fried chicken, and some fruit. Not so easy to eat standing up and being jostled by the crowd, but it was worth the experience, which was so fun!"
Lots of shops open till very late,Has lots of street food stalls at night. You can try all types of korean food. Those who like cosmetics will live this place. Seoul is quite expensive though. 
Cosmetics,A lot more beauty / cosmetics shops. Affordable and tasty street food. Street food only during evening until late evening.
Hive of activity,"The streets come alive early in the evening and afternoon on Sat. Plenty of food stuff to sample and shopping to one's heart contend. Very convenient to get to by subway or buses. Be prepared to do a lot of walking so wear comfortable shoes and clothes, unless you are planning on buying a new pair of shoes or clothing there."
City lights,"Crazy shopping district, particularly nice at night with all the lights on and the street food vendors."
Everything is here,"From make up, skin care, good food and hotels - eveything is right here. This street is very convenient if you want to do everythinf. Note that the streetfood here is more expensive than streetfood elsewhere but still good to try. Try the shrimp and the lobster with cheese."
"People,People and more people ","Lunchtime mid week, it’s hot and humid. The fans are buzzing and there are people all over the place.The street has shops and it’s buzzing. I note there are plenty of places to eat together with plenty of small independent shops. For me it was people watching. I found a place for lunch and it was packed. Aircon was a plus and wifi. A great place to wonder around."
No doubt - touristic & commercialized but still draws a crowd and worth a visit,"There's no doubt that Myeongdong has been so developed that it feels touristic and commercialized. Lots of visitors from all countries at any time of the day. Most interesting things to do here is to:1. Shop2. Shop some more3. Shop till you drop From cosmetics, Korean groceries, apparels, shoes, etc - you're bound to find something that would interest you. Along the way, there are some pretty good cafe and restaurants. For first timer's to Seoul, I'd recommend staying around this area."
Busy Market ,It was very busy with lots of people but lots of good street food. There is an endless amount of shops to shop in. There is something here for everyone no matter your age. I enjoyed it a lot.
Organized chaos,"My hotel was literally up the street from this place and boy did I go all 3 nights I was in Seoul. All the beauty products you may want or not want, they have. All the street foods you want to eat, they have. It’s busy, loud but thats the fun part of it. Visitors and locals in one place = organized chaos."
Shopping bonaza,"If you enjoy shopping, this is a place you needto be. The famous korean face masks of varied kinds are available in the various stores on huge discounts. And the variety of food that you can eat while u shop.. its a jaw dropping experience"
Every other shop a beauty shop??!,Busy streets with every other shop a beauty shop. In addition to beauty shops the area has restaurants and clothing stores but mostly local brands. Enjoyable to walk amidst the street food vendors and sample here and there.
Shopping Haven,"They have all the ladies (and men's) beauty products. They also have cheap restaurants, outlet stores, and other shops. This place is massive and the layout is confusing but who cares! I'm loving it. "
"Full of tourist trash and ""Sheet Masks""","Avoid this place - full of garbage trying to get tourists to buy beauty products. It is the same 5 stores repeated over and over again, all selling these packages of ""sheet masks"" for your face or your feet. They have ""foreigners only"" discounts, and try to give you a free sheet mask in an effort to draw you into their store (and if you walk 50 m there will be the exact same store with the exact same crap).If you're afraid to adventure out in Seoul and need to have a meal with the tacky tourist board and translations, then you should enjoy this street a lot."
Street market,"This is an excellent market, which has a range of stall selling a variety of food, from kebabs, dumplings, pancakes to tempra shrimps and Gimbi. At night the market gets very busy."
Good for Shopping and for food,"Myeongdong is good for shopping and for food. It is less crowded during the week. On weekends and at night, it's packed."
An awesome day shopping for beauty products and enjoying good food,"Myeongdong houses many different beauty brands close to our heart such as Mamonde, Innisfree, Laneige, Etude House, Tony Moly and a lot more! It is indeed the best place for a day of shopping for beauty products. They have many restaurants and eateries and even street food as well, so you will not have to worry of having to walk far to find a food outlet after your shopping. The famous Myeongdong Kyoza is located here! "
Shop till you drop,"If you are in Seoul, head to this place for some shopping. It's basically a street shopping market. You can bargain too and that's depend upon your ability how well you can do so. One can get a few souvenirs from here. "
Street food and trendy clothing,"Street food is not always cheap and in this case, definitely not cheap. We had dinner before coming down the street and were happy to browse the shops instead. There are plenty of choices of food and shops and you can easily spend a couple of hours roaming here."
Amazing Street Food and Shopping,I thought this was a really cool spot to check out the shopping and try out some of the street food. Tried the potato swirl on a stick and lobster with cheese. Pretty good! It’s definitely busy but worth a visit for anyone that’s in the area. 
Crowded and Busy,"Lots to see and do, jam packed with shops selling facial products and clothes, lined with street stalls selling local fare. Full of life, definitely worth a visit (even if you don’t shop like me) to soak up the local culture."
Delicious (But Expensive) Food Finds,"I’m not fond of crowds and crazy shoppers; so Myeongdong’s beauty shopping mecca doesn’t really spell paradise for me. The only thing that draws me back would be its hardworking purveyors who spend their nights feeding hungry bellies, no matter the weather.It’s important to note that Myeongdong’s street food are darn expensive. It’s something that definitely won’t fall under cheap eats; as you’ll usually be able to eat a hearty meal in a sit-down restaurant for the price of one or two of these street food finds.There will never be a shortage of options in Myeongdong Night Market. The tricky part is though is how to strategize what to choose, given that you usually have to allot for queuing time and work with a limited budget and stomach. The Roast Lobster with Cheese (KRW 15000), for example, is an insanely indulgent treat, which serves grilled juicy lobster topped with a fluffy melted cheese blanket. It’s delicious, but it definitely won’t fill you up.Baked seafood served with hot gooey melted cheese seems to be a popular trend (given that we arrived at the tail-end of its winter season), as kiosks of Cheese Butter Baked Scallops also drew in their own lines. The scallops were humongous; but tended to be overcooked.The Shrimp King’s Grilled Shrimp (KRW6000) may be an uninspired choice compared to its flashier neighbors; but its perfectly cooked juicy shrimps were addicting. Its sweetness guarantees the freshness of the shrimps and makes them perfectly delicious to eat on their own. They do give you a variety of sauces and dips to play around with though!"
Get lost but bring a map,Great place just to wonder around and get lost while shopping. These streets are lined with many shops and cafes. Don't go too early as a lot of places don't open until afternoon. And note that most restaurants close around 8 or 9 but you can find a few open 24hrs 
Best shopping street,"During our stay in Seoul we visited myeongdong everyday before we went back to our hotel. myeongdong is very good if you like kpop as the underground market has all the CD’s and other merch for very good prices. If you aren’t into kpop the street itself has all the best clothes shops, skincare and other little stalls dotted around from etude house to forever 21. I highly recommend people visit this street at least once on their trip to Seoul! (Also you must get a twisted potato, it was so yummy)"
Crazy shopping ,"Bombarded with masks shops and endless food shops. The night market sells stuff on skewers mostly 4000-5000 won. Too tempting as they smell good. Desserts like ice cream including rose ice cream, cat cafe and witch cafe. Just need to be careful as after spending 30,000 alone won still hungry as they are just tiny stuff"
Best street for food and shopping,"Best street for food and shopping, u will find alot of delicious food in the street which u can grape and eat while u r shopping. Such as shrimps, fish icecream, lobster, egg sandwich... and alot more.This street is full of beauty shops. Mostly makeup and face masks. "
Spoilt for choice!,It'll take hours if one were to stop at every stall. The varieties of things sold ...very eye-catching. Tried quite a number of types of food. The lobster with cheese...very delicious but priced a bit stiff at ₩16 per piece. The Taiyaki there is different from the soft ones normally eaten. Its...crispy/flaky. There are quite a few stalls with the 'Halal' logo but some are like photocopied( not original). So not sure if its authentic. Surprising that quite a number of the stallholders can speak good Malay! Impressive indeed.
Oh yeah!!! I'll be back here!,"Paradise for a shopaholic. Many shops for every taste. Large shopping centers and small cosmetics stores. Huge selection of everything. Plus a colorful, atmospheric street with local food. I’m writing, but the stomach itself sucked. This is an amazing place!"
Extreme Shopping,The whole district is shops wherever you go food is also available specially local food. Coffee Shops are everywhere. Reasonable and negotiable prices.
Shopping And Eating Street,"A trip to Seoul will not be complete without shopping and eating along the streets of Myeongdong! As the name says, its a shopping ""heaven"" where you can go crazy over the choices of face masks they sell at quite affordable prices! From various types of street food such as BBQ Prawns, Squids, seafood, ice cream, Juice stalls, you can find quite a number of Halal stalls so Muslim readers, not to worry as they will indicate Halal sign on those stalls selling halal food! "
myeongdong shopping,Lots of street food with trendy shops. Worth checking out for some tax free shopping. Street vendors speak some English and Mandarin. 
One of the best walking streets,"The best walking street for shopping in Seoul! Hundreads shops for cosmetics, mixed with mass market clothes stores and street food!The best time to go after 6pm, in the day time there is no charm...and no street food))Recommend!"
Crowded hectic street,"It’s a fun street to stroll once, not more. Try cute and various street food and shop for cosmetics. But it is super crowded which makes it a bit stressful unless you like crowd :)"
"Tourist central, street food galore, cosmetic heaven","I recommend to come here once and only once. Come to get your currency exchange. They have the cheapest rates. While you do it, by all your skincare products and eat some street food! "
Good place to see,"One of the famous place to buy or just walk and chat with people.Crowded district where you will find everything you need or not there's a lot of shops, restaurants and you can always find what you’re looking for or what you didn’t expect to find."
Spoiled for choices,"When in Seoul, one won’t miss to visit the Myeongdong shopping streets. At night fall, the streets are lined up with hawkers offering all kinds of mouth watering local delicacies. Brace yourself for the authentic Korean flavours."
A shopper's paradise,"I went here thrice during my stay - twice during the day and once at night. If you want serious shopping for Korean makeup and skin care, go during the day when the street is not filled with food carts. At night, it can be hard to navigate in and out of stores as the crowd and get quite thick. The stores and stalls in Myeongdong sell all sorts of trinkets, clothes, bags, shoes, socks (a LOT of them) drinks and delicacies, including lobster tails!. There is a cat cafe and a dog cafe - I only went to the cat cafe and I enjoyed it! A must-go to even if you are not a Korean make-up fan."
Chaotic mess,"Shops and shops selling the same things..... Some of these shops employ ""rude idiots"" that stand outside the stores with ""fake"" gifts to entice you to go into the stores with no intention of giving you any such gift. One was shoved in my face as I walked by and as I reached for it, the jerk pulls it away and says ""come in and take a look"".. WTF?? Wanted to punch him!!"
Must visit for shopping,"Lots of shops and small shops, where you can buy almost everything, including gifts and souvenirs, good restaurants and great street food."
Everything you could want.,"There's all your usual shops down here from JD sports to Nike to cosmetic shops. Additionally there are tonnes of good eateries including my personal favourite BBQ joint in town. There will be tonnes of people, but it's not like it's tourists, it's 95 percent locals. Bring comfy walking shoes and water as the SK humidity is no joke and there's several hills in the area. There are good food places legit at every corner so just take some time to explore."
Loved it!,"Not my first visit but loved it anyway. It’s a big area cramped full of shops and stalls selling everything under the sun. Many skin care and cosmetic brands at lower prices than Singapore especially when buying in bulk. Other shops selling clothes, accessories, restaurants, nic nacs, shoes, you name it, it’s all there! More suited to the younger crowd though.Lovely atmosphere to spend an evening. "
Shopping,"If you like shopping this is the place to go .with regards to street food was NOT impressed at all .oily foods seems to take over.you get better food in small Korean restaurants close by ,and much better value for your money"
You must to visit,"Full of shops and restaurants. Interesting area to visit the afternoon, shop and dine typical Korean bbq or fried chicken"
Food and fun!,"Loved walking down here tasting local street foods, seeing the many different face mask products and trying out some very interesting tasting almonds that they seem to love here! Highly recommend spending a few hours walking around here, seeing what the stalls have to offer and enjoying some tasty foods! It’s packed but that makes it all the more fun!"
We loved this place,"So many shops and currency exchange places. Look for the currency exchange shops that are further into the shopping area. You get a better rate. For example, I used the first one I saw right by the main entrance and got 1160 per US Dollar. Further in another stall was offering 1170 per US Dollar. Is a difference if you exchange a larger amount of USC. Also so many shopping, eating, desert, food places to enjoy. We loved walking around here."
Halal korean food heaven ,Loved. Evry bit of this place very delicious food which is halal also is a blessing being a muslim traveler sometimes its very hard to find. Suitable food when ur traveling in south east Asia n mostly cant try their local cuisine but this place u can try all korean food very cheap n very clean by all means n freshly prepared loved it one of the best markets in asia i hv ever been to u can buy beauty products n get lots free samples But we went for food only for four days 
A food and make up place,I stayed at Myeong-dong and the place is best during the night when the streets are full of food stalls. And the choices of food and makeup products is vast
Lots of shops and street food stalls,"Visited on a Saturday during the day which was too busy bit went back again later in the evening when it was more enjoyable to wander around. There are so many interesting shops, lots of lovely street food and a great buzz about the place. Loved it!"
Dense & Busy,"You can shop for many different brands at Myeongdong street. (Cosmetics and fashion either)It’s always busy and fulfilled with foreigners.You will see many shops for a brand while going along, so do not worry about missing any brands. Furthermore, there was street food market at night with various choices from foods to drinks. *a bit pricey "
Awesome place. ,"I haven't been back to korea since I moved to United States 40 years ago. I was so looking forward to the visit and ir didn't disappoint. Myeongdong street was one of the places I visited and it was one of the best places I visited, second only to namdaemon market. Picked up a few gifts for friends back at the state. Anyway it was very pleasant experience. "
Overrated shopping street ,I expected much more from this place. It was basically streets of lots of facial stuff and nothing much more. The clothing and other stuff like electronics are sooo limited. Was a disappointment for me 
Shopping,"Cosmetic,local food,healty items,clothes,shoes .It's right place to find anything especially cosmetic items.However for those love to eat .it easy to find local food."
"Lots of shopping... but, same shops","This was a great area to shop. But as I went down many different streets, I saw the same shops. Stores like H&M that are anywhere, and local stores over and over. How many do you need in one area? Still, it has a nice feel if you just want to shop. I was looking for something specific and became overwhelmed by street after street of the same thing."
Nice place ,You can enjoy a very good street food or you can eat at a lot of different Restaurants.Also you have a lot of shops 
Great Lively Street,Wonderful time walking around with our family in this area. Very safe and lots of shops. Wonderful atmosphere in the evening with so many places to eat and shop!
"Street food, Shopping area, Restaurants",Myeongdong is famous for shopping and street food. The area was filled with tourists and foreigners. I loved street food but it's too crowded to walk comfortably at times.
Satisfactory,"We stayed for 5 days in Loisir Hotel (just a few steps away from shopping street), almost every day we would go here, and we can't seem to find the end of this street. I would personally explore more but since my parents' stamina is not exactly the best, moreover we brought our 20 months old niece with strollers... well you can imagine.Beware tho that this shopping street is not where the cheap stuff is. Cheap stuff goes to Namdaemun Market nearby. But if you want to experience the crowd, and want to know what's the hype all about, brace yourself for an ocean of people, smoky aroma form the food stalls, and not so clean streets. But hey, that's what we all want to experience, right? Because despite all that, we would totally go back and explore more of this infamous street."
Con un pie roto en Korea.....,"Was a magnificent arrive ,we walk from our hotel ,the Royal Seoul Hotel,enjoy the several types of snacks from street vendors,cosmetics shops,lots people speak english,you can get chips for your celular phone,drugstore at the corners ,massage feet,...Kool days..!!!!!"
Just like in the movies,"Also known for its fame, myeondong is a great place to spend your day or night shopping, one of my Favorite market place in Seoul! Myeondong is big enough for you to never get bored, it has EVERYTHING! so many shops, bars, restaurants, and food stall galore from its fresh seafood to finding a bingsu or bobba joint, myeondong offers you everything,if you REALLY LOVE SHOPPING go to MYEONDONG"
Lots of shopping,"Crowded, but whatever you want to buy in Korea from food to make up to clothes can be bought here, lots of restaurants and also street food stalls open a bit later on. Must visit if in Seoul "
Excelent way to spend your day in Seoul ,"There is a lot to do in this commercial district in Seoul South Korea. Hundreds of great fast food from shrimp tempura, seafood, pork belly and octopus skewers, caramelized plums, oh my God, my mouth is watering while i’m writing this review. From souvenir spaces to large fashion stores like H n M and so. Even an interactive racoon, cat, meerkat and kangaroo café. We had so much fun. I have to say Korean people are awesome. They’re very attentive and nice."
Sensory overload!,"With all the shops, cafes, street food, and restaurants, Myeondong is such a fun area to explore. The lights, chatter, and aroma of street food tingle all of your senses. Though a bit touristic, walking through here is a neat way to soak in some of the culture. There are many great deals on food and shopping. Especially, on cosmetics and beauty products!"
Very busy even on a Tuesday night,"This area of inner Seoul is best known for women's beauty products but I enjoyed the street food more. It was hardly bargain basement prices at KRW5000 for a small box of chicken and rice balls but since we insisted on freshly cooked, it was delicious.Appears to be a very safe area. Easily accessible by Korail Seoul Metro Line 4."
Repeat of many cosmetic stores and yummy food,Great place for cosmetics and popular clothing stores. Street Food also repeats and is ok. Fun cafes for coffee and desserts. And lots of bbq places. 
A place to buy it all,Would you be able to buy the things at a cheaper price elsewhere? Probably. Do you really want to spend the time looking for these stores? Probably not. 
Awesome street food!,"My family and I loved going to Myeongdong Shopping Street. My advise is to go after 4:00pm, when the streets are filled with street food ranging from 1000 won to 7000 won. I recommend to try anything that looks good! Our favorites were: fish cakes on a stick, barbecue chicken on a stick, tornado potato, mini kimbap, ice cream with honey comb, takoyaki, Milky bee rose ice cream, and fluffy soufflé pancakes at Innisfree Green Cafe."
Must go shopping district,"Told by others must go to do shopping. Yes you must go, the snacks, cosmetics and a very famous Michelin star Korean beef soup rice restaurant here. You can compare the price before you buy but I recommend one in the photo later. The beef soup rice is very authentic, it may be a home run business. The plain beef soup rice cost ¥12000 Korean won for each. the side dish of kimchi is unlimited supply. You pay and order before you get seats similar to any fast food restaurant. One thing is the Clinique facial cleanser at the Lotte duty free storey is cheaper than other duty free department store when you buy twin pack. But it is also available at the same price inside the airport at the gate 120 area. I must say only the Clinique brand and I don’t know other brand There is also a five storey Daiso shop with many varieties than any other Daiso so far we have visited. Lots more to tell ..... so prepared your energy to spend a day there . See below the photos of this shop, they have three shops within the district"
Great shopping and eating destination,"When you look for a place to shop and eat , this is quite a place you need to go to check out first."
Fun! ,After hearing mass in the Myeongdong Cathedral....where to next but dinner in the streets! Did not disappoint. A must do when in Seoul. 
Shop shop shop then eat,"Visited around 4pm on Saturday. Absolutely nuts - stalls everywhere, shoppers everywhere, food carts serving huge variety of street food. Just amazing to wander through the chaos and take in the scenes. Lots of cheap goods if you are looking for souvenirs from Seoul. Plan for at least an hour to wander, more if you want to eat."
Street Shopping,"Myeongdong Shopping Street is bustlingwith activity. You can't help yourself but spend some KR $ . Name brand of course. In the afternoon at 4pm is the start of all good things ... STREET FOOD. Delicious food of all things grilled or fried. I had the best Chop Chae Noodles, try it. This area is a MUST to visit. In need of a MASSAGE, there are many choices. People will hand out flyers and guide you to them. I personally tried 2 places. Both were clean and massages were good. Take your pick, it will help your aching feet and back."
Bustle area with many shops.,This place has many shopping malls. It has big department storw for who looking for elengant one. Even for young people. There are many alleys with non brands shops but quite well catch fashion people's intention. Many other cosmetetic shops as well. You can easily lost your way if you are keep walking. Please keep in mind there are a lot of turists and people who is calling you. If you want to visit quite and peaceful place this place is not for you. If you are looking for busy and comnercial area this is for you.
Interesting,"Interesting to walk between all the people, buy and see many items: Street food : fish and sea food ,desertsA lot of small stands with cloths and toysThere are big shops all around and some restaurantsFUN"
Good shops and great street food!,"Really like the shopping here, good for cosmetics and laddies clothes! Street food at night was fun to try, come with empty stomach! Be careful of people pulling you into the stores and restaurant no eye contact with them to avoid that! Goodluck"
Festive Street,"We were in Seoul in December so Myeongdong Shopping Street(s) were festively lighted up in the evening. It is perpetually crowded with tourists. It's a haven for cosmetic, clothes and jewellery lovers and if you scout around, you may get good bargains. Lots of food vendors in the streets as well. Food is pricier here compared to the nearby Dongdaemun and Namdaemun markets. Nevertheless when in Seoul, you must at least experience shopping in Myeongdong Street. A good tip is to book hotels (there are budget, midprice and luxury hotels so do your homework before you book) nearby so that after a day out and about at the sights, you can have a relaxing walkaround, do some shopping and have your dinner in this area."
Great street for night food ,Place has got tons ofLocal food and shopping on the street. Great place to spend an evening and enjoy the Seoul culture. 
Lively,"As my hotel is in Myeongdong, I walked past this area regularly. There are the usual malls, shops and restaurants. As expected in Korea, there are many cosmetic and accessories shops targeting the ladies. Not to miss are the food streets. Suggest you visit in the evening to experience the atmosphere and buzz here."
OMG I LOVE IT,"Perfect place, so much shopping fun. Lots of free samples, and all kids of beauty products souvenirs street foods. The best"
Neon vibes,"This place is just perfect for street photography especially after an evening rainshower. Other than that, there are a lot of flagship stores where you can just shop until you drop."
Myeongdong,"Myeongdong is a character place in Seoul. I have been there for the 3rd time with my two visits in Seoul. On my first visit it did not reaally make a sense to me, but it was just an ordinary shopping area full of people. My recent trip last June make me appreciate Myeongdong. Why did I say that it is a character place. From the train station you will be greated by a a foreign exchange cum shoe repair shop. The exchange rate is very good. As you go along on the alley left and right are cosmetic shops of different Korean brands. It comes to my mind why the skins of the Koreans are so clear and beautiful. Walk . . . walk. . . and at the middle you will be greated by their iconic theater, the ""I"" tourist information personnel who will assist you if you have any questions. Their is also the Myeongdong Cathedral for the spiritual side ( a must see). There are also lots of Korean restaurants that will answer for your gastronomic needs. One thing, I thought ""Daiso and Uniqlo"" is in Japan only, suprisingly I found it in Myeongdong. And if you will go into food trip (Korean food) lots of it could be found at the middle of the Myeongddong Alley. I know that for every tourist who visited Seoul, Myeongdong will not be missed out"
Awesome area,"This is most of the shops are xall kinds of shops, restaurants, bars, spas, duty free, street vendors are located. It is good to travel with family or even alone, a lot of things are going on specially at night. Bring some cash and don't get lost, it is easy to find a way out. A must while in Seoul "
Face masks,"Octopus grilled - 8000 KRWFish cake : 3000 Face masks - but 1 get 2 free (at 10000 KRW)Experience - priceless. What a lively street, id rate it very high on street food, but if you like the food experience you have to go to Gwangjang market"
Shopalholics,There are lots of foods to taste and shops are everywhere. You can start shopping at around 5:00 p.m. until midnight. 
Fantastic Cosmetics Deal,There were a lot of offers for sheet mask in Myeongdong street. Many kinds of brand and its up to individual to choose. Buy 1 pack sheet masks yang get another pack for free ending up it costs you very little. I bought quite a number and hope there will be another oppurtunity to shop at Myeongdong street again in future.
Very busy place with lots of things to do,"First off: cosmetics, you will find soooooo many brands and they have at least two to three shops in the area, so if what you're looking for is not on one shop, find the location of the other shop of the same brand. There is a tourism office near a big Global Tax Free department store and a money changer along MyeonDong Gil Street. You can get your map there.Tip: Get the freebie and enter the shop. It doesn't necessarily mean you'll buy. They give free face mask to the people who will enter the store.Next is the street foooooodss.. the main street is full of different street foods which are must try. We literally went from one stall to the other. Their skewers are great and they have lots of delicious stuff cooking.. If you like to explore street food, try everything out. Especially their very high ice cream. 52cm they say.Tip: find the ice cream store near Pretty Skin Shop in MyeonDong Gil St. it only cost 2000KRW other ice cream stalls have higher price.Cafe: there is a Meerkat cafe in the area. You can experience cuddling a meerkat by buying drinks which includes the entrance fee. or you can rest in some other cafes (there are many cafes you could choose from)Traditional food experience: you may want to go down the smaller alleys near the exits of the area to experience traditional korean food at a cheaper price in a homey atmosphere. We have eaten at a small underground canteen (can't read the signboard) which serves food for as low as 5000KRW with big servings good enough for two people.Best time to go is in the afternoon to evening, but it is also the busiest."
Hyper but not diverse,"I think I know every street here by now. It is a relatively large area with modern shops which attract mostly young people. Girls clothing shops and make up are abundant, as are restaurant and bars. I like the street food the best. There is something for every one. Nearby is the Lotte department store and posh brand section."
shops and cheap food,A must visit when travelling to Seoul. A great place to sample Seoul's street food. A nice place to shop too..
Age relevant,"If you are under 35 or shopping for someone who is, this is a 5-star shopping street. If over 35 or shopping for someone who is, go elsewhere. Noisy, crowded, oh-so-young-trendy . . ."
Shopping street,Many stores are along with the street. Nowadays many cosmetics and street food are seen. The street is for pedestrians only. No cars
Great shopping,"What more do you need, lots of shopping, lots of restaurant, plenty of beverage shops, just make sure you bring some comfortable shoes."
Shop and Dine,"Myeongdong is a wonderful district to visit with Endless shops and eateries.Lotte, Shinsegae, underground and above ground shopping streets are all in this district. Many good restaurants on Myeongdong ga-gil waiting for you to explore as well occasionally some street stalls along your way can quench your thirsty or hunger.Myeongdong station is not the correct station for Lotte Duty Free or Lotte Department Store. Don't be misled by the advertisement in the station. Take the Euljiro-1ga Station is much closer. Use Myeongdong Station exit 6 will bring you right in the heart of Myeongdong shopping streets. Here is the best place to buy Korea Snacks back home. On Myeongdong 8ga and passing Myeongdong 2-gil but before the main road Sogong-ro, you will find Lotte Mart at your left. The famous Wangjigib BBQ is also here. Lunch special up to 5 pm only 11,000 to 13,000 won. However, Lotte Mart is not the cheapest for Lotte Products. You can check Korea Mart and other shops along Myeongdong 8ga-gil. Promotions of Korea Snacks are plentiful here and sure will cause you over weight.Whilst you already reached Lotte Mart, mind as well go across Sogong-ro to Shinsegae Duty free and Department store. Since you are on Sogong-ro, at the fork, take Namdaemun-ro North to Lotte Young Plaza and further to Lotte Duty Free and Department Store.You finished off your Myeongdong Shopping Street at Euljiro-1ga station."
Quirky shops and great for skincare ,"We loved visiting Myeongdong. The tax free shopping is great, there’s great stationery shops (Art Box... go there) and the beauty scene: there’s every brand you could want in both standalone and mixed stores. It’s a must if if you visit Seoul."
Nice clean street with lotsa to see,"I stayed in the hotel at the center of myeongdong shopping street. The whole street sells clothes, shoes and cosmetics in various brands. It also has some marts, money changer, restaurants, etc. At night it has street food though there are some food are repetitive.But overall, this is a nice place to shop and eat. "
Ladies shopping heaven,"Lots of shopping for the ladies, besides bags, clothings & cosmetics you can also find Daiso, sport wear, and many dining options. Sad to say, Myeongdong is losing its shine as the place have evolved to serve tourist appetite. I hope it’s unique Korea shopping area can refocus on it’s uniqueness."
Wonderfully immersive,"Our apartment rental is right on the edge of this large night market, and we have spent our first two nights wandering through the streets here, just taking it all in. It’s full of people and awesome little shops and stalls. Just looking down the streets with all the lights and visual clutter makes you want to take a photo every five minutes. There’s nothing like this in the states!"
Great shopping district but very crowded,"I’ll always pop by myeongdong for food and shopping whenever I’m in Korea Street food are all good but definitely a little pricey as most tourists will pop by here! Overall, I still enjoy coming to myeongdong despite the crowd. It’s a place where I can get all my shopping done in a day!"
Must visit on seoul,"Heart of tourist area at seoul. Everything you could find here. From food, shopping, bar, coffee shop, etc... should stay here at least 2 to 3 days to explore."
Shopping in Myeongdong,"Walking around in Myeongdong Street Market was an experience for both the pocket and stomach. With lots of street food vendors, this will be a good time filler while waiting for your significant other while they shop. Personally, my favorite snack was the croissant stall (nutella croissant) this was was only 2500 won (2usd). Another favorite was the pork dumplings (3 huge dumplings) for 3500 won. Surely you wont go hungry while going around the street market. There are alot of stores as well with alot of varieties (fake supreme shirts, shoes, belts, bags) to retail stores (Uniqlo, ABC mart - sells shoes) this will definitely be good to go around after a long day touring the city. Stores however close early (between 9pm -10pm). The nice thing about this, you can keep coming back."
Test Your Bargaining Skills,"Shopping in this area was extremely fun, if you like to haggle on prices. Vendors almost enjoy the competition to see how high they can sell their wares to you. After proposing our final bid, the vendor scoffed at our offering so we walked away. The vendor actually ran us down and reluctantly accepted our offer! Some of the items our group purchased were; “Air pods” for $7, dash cam mirrors for $24, and an assortment of iPhone cases for under $2."
Shopping,Nice placeShop for cosmetics some shops offer tax refund and discount with a minimum 30-50k wonStreetfoodsBranded shopsBakeryRestoThe cathedral is located here
Awesome shopping ,Love the skin care products.Lovely stunning place to shop for lovely things.Crowded streets but safe lovely souvenirs to buy.
went there at least 4 times,And shopped a lot too. Be sure to get a map from the people wearing a red shirt since there are many alleys and you may get lost. Lots of cosmetics and clothing stores. There are some kpop merchandise too.
Lively with a lot of street foods,A really lively area. There are so many varieties of foods and goods to purchase from street vendors to stores. 
Beauty and fashion paradise,beauty products everywhere. You can get tons of freebies from beauty shops just by walking down Myeongdong. Lots of street food as well but a bit more expensive compared to other place.
"Snacks, shopping and deserts","Can be crowded but what's not to like. You will never go hungry along the these streets. We were there friday, Saturday and sunday night and there were the street was lined with small temporary snack shops. Bring lots of cash and have a snack fest!!!"
Shopping,"Skin care heaven, lots of street food nearby. A little expensive the street food here. A bit of clothes can be bought here. Quite expensive also. Not that cheap. But great shopping experience. "
Fun and Safe Atmosphere,"My friend and I were staying close by and we walked through the Myengdong Shopping Street daily. It was fun to people-watch and see the street foods for sale. We felt safe (as two women) walking around here, even at night."
Quick and relax 3 nights stay,"Very easy to get to, 10 minutes walking distance from our hotel. Totally different feeling when you go during the day and night. I like it at night to try all the street food too."
Crowded with many good finds,"This Street Market has many exits. My preferred exit is number 6 because it is right where Uniqlo is. However there are many street foods which really come out more at night. Is street food is not your thing then there are good restaurants scattered throughout as well as shops for clothes, facial products, or souvenirs. If you are walking all day I would recommend getting a foot massage as that really helps to recharge your feet to continue shopping all night long."
Too crowded,"Lots of street food and cosmetic stores. Very convenient. Went there but can’t enjoy too much bcoz too crowded and people makes you keep walking. A lot of cosmetic places. If you buy more than $30000, will do the tax free for you immediately. Bring your passport. Enjoyed the environment but can’t really have a mood to buy stuffs slowly. "
Good street food and cosmetics,Myeongdong is actually made up of a couple of streets not just one. The main ones and a few side streets have just about every kind of Korean street food. The shops sell mostly Korean beauty products at decent prices. There are cheaper places but this is definitely the most central and convenient.
Huge and crowded place,"This place is huge and crowded. Can find many street food seller around 3 PM till close. A lot of shops to buy cosmetics, clothes, shoes but mostly cosmetics. There are some hotels in the area too and it's easy to find restaurants. Easy to reach using bus, taxi or subway. There are some malls around the area too such as Lotte Young Plaza and Shinsegae. I'm confused why there were some cars still enter some of the streets even when there's a crowd. It's quite difficult to find thrash bin as well."
Bustling pedestrianised shopping area open till late,"Myeongdong is a signature South Korean shopping district which you will need to visit, whether you are a shopper or not.The side alleys off the Main Street offers many local Korean brands ranging from boutiques, cosmetics, consumer goods, digital equipment etc.This is a area where you see a young Korea in action. The biggest plus point is that the stalls are open till late."
Stick Food,Many stalls set up on this pedestrian street food zone that is actually a UNESCO site. They serve just about everything on a stick including the tornado potato which originated here. It's crazy crowded and crazy fun for awhile until the tummy is full anyway. I am not into the shopping however and blew that whole thing off. Many high end stores have made shopping one of the main tourist attractions here.
A must visit in Seoul for shopping and food! ,"I totally love this place. It is busy yet you have so much to see. You can find souvenirs, clothes, korean fashion stuffs, food, convenient stores, massage parlour, cosmetics and beauty products stores. Its best to come early (before 1pm) if you want to avoid crowd and the heat. I prefer coming over at night, probably after 630pm, where you have lots of street stalls selling more merchandise and lots of food stuffs. The beauty shops such as Innisfree, Nature Republic and Olive Young is worth a visit as they might have special offers especially if you buy more. This is a long street with many directions to walk about. Just take note of certain stores as landmark for your easy reference. There are some brands which has more than one outlet at the same area. It can get quite crowded at times so pace yourself. A mini usb fan will be helpful... I would recommend this as a must visit especially if you are into shopping, cosmetics and beauty, street food, fashion stuffs and souvenirs. "
Find the right price,"Items may be overpriced at street stalls. May help if you do some research on what you want to buy. Can find bargains too. Huge variety of food, clothes and shoes. Avoid if you dislike rubbing shoulders with hoards of tourists, it’s almost inevitable. Appears to be very popular with Chinese tourists. "
Crowded but fun ,Visited here several times. Street food vendors start setting up later in the afternoon offering different foods. Crowded with shoppers and tourists. Lots of stores selling K beauty products. 
Bustling Shopping and Eating Area,"We came here multiple nights as our hotel was in close proximity to this shopping and dining area. The family found cutsy accessories for school, classic KPop CDs, cosmetics and some clothing. There were both Korean and foreign chain stores here, above and below ground, and we sometime came across multiples of the same stores that were within a block or so of each other. i don’t know how each of them makes enough to pay their rents.There were also a lot of restaurants located here and we probably ate at a good number in this area. Overall many different cuisines and styles to satisfy any type of food craving.Almost every evening the streets were crowded with people and the weather was cooler which made the wandering more enjoyable."
Lots of food and clothes for sale,"Usually am not a fan of shopping but Myeongdong had many shops that sell nice food, interesting souvenirs and clothes to be brought home as souvenirs. Possible to spend the entire night here and yet not walk finish. "
Sister shopping,So much to see and taste.. could of spent a week instead of only one day. Found many good souvenirs for family and friends back stateside.
Amazing,"We love myeongdong. The ambiance of food, people and shopping was awesome. We came here everyday during our honeymoon trip. We will definitely come here again. Must visit when you are in seoul/myeongdong are..."
Holiday ,I hate shopping but this is not a place to miss just for the experience. Crowds are unbelievable and the stock on display is mind blowing. You can buy anything from genuine brands to counterfeit items. The vibe of the whole place is electric. Got to go as seeing is believing. 
Beware of scams in Myeong-dong ,"This is a reasonably fine place for some overpriced street food and shopping. Please avoid the touts on the streets who will try to entice you with some cheap massage packages. As the saying goes, if it is to be true, then it probably is. Once you follow them to the massage parlor, the sales staff there will pressurize you to take up very expensive sessions, if you are not keen, they would exert more high selling tactics. Once you refused to take up any of these exorbitantly priced session and opt for the lower price one, they would turn sulky. As it turned out, a 45 minute session became a mere 20 minute session. When I informed the staff about the session had ended way too early, the staff did not bother and insisted that it was already 45 minutes. The massage was also woefully bad. Please do not go for any massage in this Myeong-dong area. "
Best shopping place in Seoul,"For those interested in Korean beauty products, this is the place to go to. Shops open as early as 9am and close as late as 1030-11pm. It may be best to check out the different shops first and see what their promotions are so you can compare as this can differ from shop-to-shop. However, the downside though is that one promotion given today may be gone or be different tomorrow. Most shops can already refund a certain amount of the sales tax if you meet a certain amount so no need to do this in the airport. This is also the best place to get Korean street food, from fried/griiled food products to desserts. The sellers open at around 4-5pm and close at about 10pm. There are also proper restaurants/coffee shops at every corner so you will definitely not go hungry or thirsty. It is best to bring your own shopping or reusable bag so you don't have to pay for a bag from the store."
Shopping beauty paradise,"This is the most popular places now in Korea shopping district, you could see plenty of beauty shops around the area especially selling masks , cosmetic etc. At night time you can try alot of local food as see in the pictures. Beside that, there is also under pass shopping if happened rainning day you still can continue shop.There are a lot of hotels surrounding, therefore it's convenient to book a hotel nearby. Subway station also just near the area easy to travel to other locations. Bus station to airport also available in walking distance from nearby hotel.Overall, a good area in Seoul. "
Perfect for beauty product fans,"Lot's of sales, some streetfood and everything you would want to visit/have if you like k-beauty products. lot's of sale and famous korean brands for a lower price! "
Both high end & bargains,"This is the main shopping area in Seoul. If you want to get away from the high end pricey department stores, then you can come here. There are the brand shops but there are cheap stuff to buy as well."
Perfect for shopping and good street food,"This is a long stretch of street market where you can find streetfood everywhere from seafood, meat, chips, strawberries, grilled food, etc. There are lots of skin care shops from Nature Republic, Missha, Tony Moly, Etude, etc and lots for shops for clothes, shoe and some souvenir items. The skin care shops offered lots of freebies and the prices are way cheaper as compared to prices of the same brand in shops here in the Philippines. If you dont like streetfood, there are also lots of restaurant. Good to try this place. We went here for 2 nights. "
One stop shopping in Seoul ,"A must visit place if you are planning to come to Seoul. Lot of choices of items from fashion, cosmetics, foods, Coffee shops and familiar brand like The North Face, Uniqlo, Daiso and very close to Myeongdong station. Plenty of guesthouse around and also close to Seoul Tower and Seoul Station. Friendly for english speaking travellers. "
Everything you need is here,"I suggest you to stay in this area during your visit in Seoul. You can find food street at night, breakfast in the morning, good cafe, restaurants, fashion, cosmetic, hotel, and many mores. Everything you need as a traveler...even though you are a solo traveler. It has the atmosphere that makes me to return to this place again and again. "
So so!,I was a bit disappointed in this area - there are heaps of shops around but for some reason this area didn't do much for me. There are some others with more atmosphere- Hondae for instance.
Intoxicating in a good way,Love this street!We stayed in a boutique hotel in the centre of this area. Worth visiting during the night when it is fully lit.Definitely sample some of the street food on offer.
Probably the busiest street in Seoul,"Even though I hate crowded places I find myself going to Myeongdong quite often. That’s because I really like the big H&M and Forever21 stores there. Also, I guess there’s no better place if you want to buy a variety of korean cosmetics in one place. Plus, you can try many street food there. What I don’t like about Myeongdong, except for the crowds, are people advertising their makeup store with giving you “free” masks or so.. Guys, these are no free unless you buy something from their store. And the other thing is that there’s really no good restaurant there."
"Shopping, Shopping, Shopping! Korean style!","If you simply must go shopping in Seoul, this is the place to go! With all the stuff that Korea has to offer, you will find them here. Souvenirs, specialty shops, beauty products, Music Korea, Innisfree, etc. etc. you name it. What really sets this place off is during the late afternoons to evening when the food carts come in to give you a taste of Korean street foods. You can choose from a wide variety of preparation which is distinctly Korean. This truly should not be missed by anyone travelling to Seoul."
7 May 2018 first visit at this pedestrian shopping street ,"My first day of Seoul, s Korea trip brought me from Incheon Airport to Seoul railway station. Next, after leaving my luggage at the hostel, I swiftly decided to see the Myeongdong shopping street! First impression, very long and lots of restaurants, clothing shops, and souvenir shops on there! Most well known brand such as Zara, HM, and Polo were all there, furthermore, I found Miniso the Japanese and Chinese bargain shop there too! Very nice! Lots of BBQ restaurants there too! Great place. "
Great shopping,"Some of the sellers are a bit sweet/pushy for you to buy their merchandise, but nothing rude....they have a lot to offer. I did make a mistake and bought a letter opener, thank goodness they allowed it on the plane. It wasn't expensive so it would not of been a money loss just a souvenir loss. :-)"
Shopping for masks ,A good place for shopping and food. Staying near this busy street is easy for us to shop and eat. Enjoyed our shopping but realised that the shops there are selling similar stuff and so much of their touting. 
Probably one of the most lively places to shop in Seoul.,Good place to shop for cosmetic products and savor some street foods.Transport is easy with a MRT station nearby.
Great eats! Cheap prices! ,"Myeongdong is a great area to visit. Great eats. Anything tried was delicious. Egg pancakes, fresh cut fruit, steak, fries banana, tornado potato. Street food at its best. Loads of shopping. Clothes, cosmetics, skincare, shoes. Visit the cathedral as well. There is a tourism office near the Myeongdong Theatre if you need to ask about city bus tours. "
awesome shopping,"great shops, bargains galoregreat for skin care, beauty carealso with restaurants, street food to die for, hanging out to come back."
Shopping! Shopping!,"Shopping in the cold is one experience i will probably remember as my wife and daughter enjoyed a lot and did not mind doing.. It made me sick though I may probably do it with more prepared proper clothing. Lots of interesting things to see, buy and eat. Be ready to burn your wallet."
Cosmetic Heaven,"Best place to shop for cosmetics. Must visit if you go to Korea. They have a lot of discounts on different brands of cosmetics. Must visit. They have etude house shops which have good discounts. Also, the salespeople outside the shops will give you a lot of samples to try "
everything is here !!!,"good place to do shopping n food , all in 1 area myeongdong shopping market.crowded n nice environment too."
Shopping Mecca,"I don’t know if I can say anything that hasn’t been said before about Myeongdong. If you aren’t into skin care, cosmetics, fashion and Korean interpretation of current trends, visit the place anyway to experience the crowds, sample street foods and pop into the cat/dog/ferret cafes in the area. "
Best Place for Beauty Products,"A one-stop area for beauty products - Innisfree, Etude House, Olive Young, Missha, Nature Republic, Skin Food and many more. In the evening, there are many Street food stalls selling gimbap, BBQ meat, egg bread, grilled lobster with cheese, fish cake on skewers. There also other vendors selling socks, knock off designer bags and souvenirs. There are many nice cafes and restaurants along the streets."
Fabulous Food!,"My friend a and I loved wandering the streets of Myeongdong. At night the food stalls provided the ideal opportunity the try lots of different things without spending a fortune! There’s lots of lovely outdoor bars, Korean BBQ restaurants and ‘chicken and beer’ places. Shopping is good too - Korean and American/European shops as well as places to buy souvenirs. Great fun!"
Great find,So many cheap beauty products to see here and a variety of street foods to choose from. Highly recommended to purchase skin care and beauty products here.
SHOP TILL YOU DROP,"Masks and cosmetic products sold here are way more cheaper than any other places in Korea, there's a lot of Buy1Free1 promotion going on.Loud hipster musics as background.Happening street which is full of all kinds of street foods.Love the oden with toppoki at the end of the road , beside the 7-11 store.Love the environment but people here might be alil pushy if you block their way."
Loved every minute of it,"Shop til you drop, not kidding. You can stop and get a bite to eat at many restaurants and at street food vendors, and go back to more shopping. We simply loved every minute of it. So many cosmetic stores and you can spend hours there looking at so many different products. It's very reasonable there too. I bought a trench coat for only $45 and the best part is that it fits! I'm very short so most clothes need to be altered but not here in Korea. Most of the clothes were made for Asian women I think because they fit really well."
Great vibe,Myeondong shopping area is a great place to amble through day or night. The street food is amazing and incredibly good value for money. 
Myeondong Cathedral - Street Food - Shopping,Went to eat at Myeondong noodle restaurant three times. Serving is fast. Enjoyed the street food market at night and shopping with all the neon lights making the place well lighted and fun to walk around.
Redundant stores every corner,"You can count on a few things in Myeongdong-gil...- skincare stores with employees soliciting outside the store trying to give you a sample- stores and vendors selling knock-off designer bags and accessories - street vendors selling local eats- a ton of Korean restaurants - a ton of convenience stores The downside is all the stores in each category seem to be selling the exact same stuff! It’s hard to distinguish one alleyway from the next because the stores are so redundant. There’s literally duplicates of branded stores as well.All to say, Myeongdong-gil is a cool place to visit and shop but gets old after a while. Make sure you check out a Korean BBQ restaurant ...we really enjoyed them.Strawberries dipped in syrup on a stick was a cool street vendor eat we enjoyed.Check out different foods you find in convenience stores...they’re all good! Fishy ice cream sandwich below (not fish flavoured lol)"
A compact and busy shopping area,"Busy small streets at night. Lots of small shops that sells everything from beauty products, electronic gadgets, and clothes. We went for the atmosphere. The shops facade are heavily decorated with neons and lights. Feels like you're in a manga. "
Skincare shopping paradise ,"I enjoyed shopping here for 24K Gold, Caviar, and Snail ingredient skincare products. Most shops-Too Cool for School, Holika Holika, Missha, etc we’re having a sale, buy two get one free, etc. I did my research online first and if the shop sale was offering a better deal then online I snagged it. I didn’t care for the constant harassment grabbing my arms and hands to force me into entering certain skincare shops (Pink?, Skin Food, etc), but a very stern “NO” helped. I enjoyed Myeondong shopping and street food vendors; my favorite was hands down the grilled lobster tails with cheese. Definitely worth $15,000 won."
Great place to by cheap skin care products ,"We found this to be one of the better places to buy affordable skin care products like face masks, face lotions, etc. There’s also a lot of restaurants and knockoff clothing vendors. Fun to stroll around for gifts "
Street shopping heaven!,"Shop till drop! Lot of street food, shops and here you will find huge crowd. There are information people placed at random places if you need guide. You can buy souvenirs here which is cheaper. There are lot of junctions here and make sure u remember your source junction, you can be a bit confused."
Super shopping,Never seen so many shops and so many people on a saturday afternoon. Incredible. Nice and clean environment.
Nice place to walk around,"There is so much to see here. Especially the food is great! There are many shops too, mostly cosmetics stores."
Most wellknown main shopping street in Seoul,"Just around the corner from Lotte department store and Lotte Hotel. Myeongdong shopping street is the most wellknown main shopping area in Seoul, especially for ladies, old and young. Mainly for fashion, lifestyle and beauty. There are many cafes, restaurants too. The most interesting attraction might be the very propular one on instagram : Stylenanda Hotel, so named but actually not a ""hotel"" to stay, but a shop selling cosmetics, fashion clothing with a cafe, all housed in several storeys designed like a hotel and spa. The design concept dominated in pink color is interesting enough to attract younger crowd to go in and browsing around, taking photos and selfies for their instagram posts. At night the whole street is turning into a night market, with food stalls selling all kinds of food, snacks and souvenirs."
Really fun,"Lots of food and souvenir stalls, and high street shops. Bustle and hustle after 4pm. Be prepared to hunt for bins for your rubbish. We found some next to subway stairs. "
Cosmetics cosmetics cosmetics,Myeongdong is for girls and women. Yes there are some nice cafes and restaurants along this area but the amount of cosmetic and make up shops in myeongdong is insanely high. The clothes shops are also primarily for women. 
Good Food,"I felt this area was a kind of hybrid between the older style markets and modern shopping malls. It was primarily pedestrian access (but make no mistake, watch out for small trucks and motorcycles) and at times was very busy.Lots of food vendors of all types of street foods and most were very cheap. I had shrimp, crabs, and strawberries and all were good. The stores were more conventional brand names and there were a lot of them. It seemed popular for the younger crowd.When i went there were numerous tourism representatives eager to help. My overall impression was that it was very safe and friendly. Great place to try the street eats and maybe scope out a bargain."
A must!!,"A must see!! Full of shops and street foods to try!!This is what seoul is about! Cosmetics, food , masks, etc!"
Racist against non asian,"Nice street with almost only beauty stores with great products but beware if you are not korean or even asian you will not be treated with respect there ! We bought a lot of products and they wouldnt give us samples unless we ask for it and even when we did ask they would only give 1 small sample while they would give 10 to 20 samples (yes!) To asian people right next to us who spent half less.... Also when entering no one would come to help us, no hello, no goodbye..Even if prices were good we did not feel welcomed there... Especially at Laneige (such a good reputation oversees but it was the worst, as well as Innisfree). Tony moly and etude house were a little more open to tourists."
Don't miss this place ,"Definitely something not to miss while in Seoul. The street with the food sellers is amazingly full and interesting for someone who is not familiar with the Korean food, so this is good to see and then taste..."
Easy,This shopping street is a perfect shopping street for those who like to shop and eat at the same time without having to go any other places Can find a types of food and many cosmetics and skin care and some good brands 
My #imightSeoulyou trip,If your a make up lover then myeongdong street is the best for you. You can found almost everything and every brand you can name on. After shopping you can eat street food coz at night there’s a lot of street vendors selling foods.
Great,This place is great to walk around day or night! Lots of stalls appear at night selling food and bit and bobs. I think I walked around here everyday I was in seoul
"Indulge in the World of Cosmetics, Foods, Foods...","Was here on a weekday and the crowd was tremendous a lot and by diinner time it was more livelier with foods stalls on the streets, restaurant along the alleys and not to be missed out cosmetics outltets are plenty over here.Get your cheap face masks here....."
Time passed fast walking and eating,"Lots of shops selling food, cosmetics, clothes, accessories. Lots of choices. Street stalls also added ambience to the shopping street. If tired just hop into any korean dessert shops. "
Wild place to visit ,We visited this place on 16th of May 2019. This is one wild place to visit and I loved every second of it! There are some amazing shopping centres and a huge daiso shop with 5 floors!! I totally recommend shopping in this area if you get a chance to fly to Korea it’s a total experience to remember! 
Good place to eat and shop,The street food is great. There's a lot of places to shop especially if you're in to K-Beauty. However I would skip this place if I don't have time. Myeongdong isn't that unique - there's plenty of shopping districts like this all over the world. Most of the shops are targeted for Chinese costumers and it's always overcrowded. If you like the atmosphere I recommend Insadong or Hongdae instead.
"Lots to do and see, also eat!!!!","This is one of the most popular shopping district in Korea for tourists. Many tourists come here to try the street food, and shopping. This area is famous for yummy street food, from the start of the station exit 8 or 9 all the way straight down to the shopping areas. You can eat, get a massage, see lots of cafe, and eat desserts here. You can rest, and shop as you go; because there are many cafes around. Go here for some food and shopping fun!!!"
Crazy experience,"We stayed right next to this street, and found it a great place to explore at night. There are blocks upon blocks of streets to explore along this street. The streets are lined with vendors selling street food, socks, shoes, shirts, trinkets, jewelry, dresses, and almost anything else you can think of. On top of that, it is incredibly crowded with people stopping, pushing, bumping you, eating, and just having a good time. It was a lot of fun just exploring these streets and restaurants along the way."
Tasty street food,Very vibrant area. Really liked the atmosphere even though I am not a big shopping fan. Went there every night of my stay in Seoul to try some new Korean street food. Some good traditional Korean restaurants can also be found in the side streets.
foods and shopping!!,"you can settle everything there. foot massage is also available but did not try. full of cosmetic shops (10+10free) masks, sports wear, etc.. nice street stores available too. but you are in for a “fight” especially when there is a sales. and yes, plenty of halal foods for muslim tourists!"
Busy shopping area,"This is one of the busy and best shopping street in north Seoul, used to be for residents , now mostly for tourists; many eating places and shops. Weekend would be worst time to go."
Shopping!,"Lots of different stores, foot massages, coffee shops. Had a great time wandering around looking at everything. Cosmetic stores abound here, with people outside trying to get you to go in. Vendors selling socks, trinkets or food - always something to see. Very interesting place"
To keeo the ladies happy,"An interesting market street, good for the ladies. However, big westerners will find the trinket shops of more use. Many beauty stores for the ladies selling high quality products."
Skincare everywhere,"You could find many skincare's shop... like Nature republic, missha, the saem, etc. There are also many street foods and souvenirs. "
Shopping haven for ladies looking for skincare or makeup,"Myeongdong is filled with many different Korean brands of cosmetic and skincare. Many different price range and every outlet has different promotions. There could be another same outlet on another street so be sure to check out the promotions before your purchase. Also, consolidate your purchases for higher tax refund/ rebate. The higher the amount, the higher the amount of tax refund. Also check out the cafes such as the innisfree cafe. "
Good shopping experience ,"The street was crowded but clean. The shops were all kind. My friend got sleepy in the shop, and the they quickly came and asked if my friend’s conditions was ok or not. Very hearty experience "
Buzzing,"It's so busy, but electric for the first time visitor. It has every shop and more! I mainly wanted face masks, because South Korea has the best. You can pick up something fresh to eat aswell great place."
Amazing shopping!,"This place was just amazing shopping experience, the different types of food barbecue seafood was just amazing, you can get really good deals on items and souvenirs. It was really a sight to behold a must see."
Authentic Seoul,"If you want to experience authentic Seoul lifestyle you should stay around this area. Most historical sites are mostly walking distance or short cab ride away, and authentic Korean restaurants and entertainment venues are also nearby, lots of street foods at night. And every where you go there are always stores selling beauty products, I have never seen so many variations of facial mask until I came to this area, and these products are seems to be the best giveaways to your friends when you go back home..."
Shopping for skincare ,"Good for shopping especially for skincare, street food, cheap souvenirs and snacks! There are jewelry & sports boutiques too.. Can find almost everything but for fashion apparrel better to go to dongdaemun. "
Lots of shops,Great variety and a ton of different shops and eateries as well. Great place to see people doing street performing also.
Street food+cosmetics,"This street gets to life by evening and is busy till mid night with people selling food, clothes, accessories all at a very reasonable price. We ate a good varity of food like cheese roasted lobster, nutella pastry,BBQ chicken.. Along side we shopped cosmetic like facemask and they have most of the top brands selling stuffs at 50% (most of the time)..Happy Shopping!"
Lots of things,"Lots of things for shopping. You can find almost every brands here. Some cosmetic shop will let their staff to give you a free gift but you need to visit inside that shop. If you don’t want to visit or buy anything, better deny for that free gift. "
Experience the korean street food,"Very crowded in the evening. Good experience authentic smelling street food, that not experience in my home country. Lots of facial masks and facial cosmetics for ladies. Its a ladies world. Different mask products which is sold in discount packaging. Unless u know which product to buy, u will be totally confused. Average price between 1000 to 1500 won per mask. But if u buy like 10 + 10, the cost can be as low as 500 wong. Shop around and get the best price."
A shopping experience you mustn't miss.,"A bustling shopping area that is filled with people looking for the right bargain that they are looking for.If you love to try local / street food this is definitely one of the best places to visit. The variety of street food will surely sate your tummy. From your typical hotdog on a stick, to something more exotic like flame grilled lobsters and oysters.As for shopping, you definitely will find great deals from mobile phone cases, bags, tshirts, pants, and most important of all COSMETICS!"
Excellent people watching and street vendors,"Perhaps one of the coolest places to visit in Seoul at night. There are tons of stores too (I skipped those), and some great restaurant options. A short walk from the city center."
Great way to spend a cold and rainy day,"Had a lot of fun shopping, especially at all the K-Beauty stores. It was a really miserable day to go sightseeing, but a perfect day to go shopping. The streets did not disappoint!"
Cosmetic Shoping only here.,"If you want to you any kind of the face or body cream, mask, anything for beauty - you must to come here. Great atmosphere, lot os shops, multi choice. "
Exciting Beauty Kit and Skin Care shopping,"If you love Korean skincare or beauty products, here is the best place to go look and spend your money on it. Cheaper than in your country, all the face mask, night cream, or whatever. Not just one store, but almost all brands are here. Plus, if you start to get hungry, there are a lot of Korean food street here. The price is a bit higher than in other places in Seoul (street food) because Myeon dong has more international tourist than other places. Maybe that's why they put a higher price, but the taste and quality are the same. Just pick the most crowded food stall, they probably sell a tastier one than the other.Most hotel/hostel in Myeondong also have a higher price, I always booked into a different area and go to Myeon-dong via subway. Cheaper and faster.You might want to bring a small suitcase to buy a year worth of face mask here. Lol!"
Shop till you drop!,"Beauty products, socks with characters, shoes, street food! What's not to love about Myeongdong Shopping Street? Don't forget to bring extra shopping bags! "
Myeongdong street market,Wow. It was fantastic n with so many shops and people it makes it a bit hard to walk around and choose the shops there. You have to check one by one to make sure what is the best that you can get and it can really gets you tired. But it's worth it. For Malaysia n Muslim lookibg fir halal food there is a Malaysian restaurant naned Restaurant Kamoungku. The menu is delightful and at quite a reasonable price. Im sure to be back again at the Myeongdong Street Market
Not a best place to buy stuff,Hearing a lot of people said a cheep place to buy street food and souvenir...not at all the street food here & stuff were 2x more expensive than other major road street food. It's very crowded and noisy not suitable for big adults. My advise never to greedy of this free mask sample given out if not planing going to buy it. There will gives you sample if you are truly brought from them and sometimes u can asked extra another few more sample free from the counter (it depend shops).
Best for shopping cosmetics,"The place though congested is the best place to shop your loved make ups..You don't need to complete walking around., you can find your best items anywhere."
Nice place to shop and try all the street food,"There are many beauty product shops along the street, but not so generous in giving out sample anymore as compare to previous years ago. its getting more crowded by night as most street food vendor just started up in the evening time"
Go for the street food,"One of the places I enjoyed visiting the most. Be warned tho: It's crowded and noisy. The cosmetics are cheap, and you can buy anything here. I enjoyed the street food the most. Try it, I'm sure you'll enjoy it too!"
its Like Harajuku,"they have a lot of small stores here you can find anything you want, clothes ,shoes, bags, cosmetics, they also have street foods, a little spicy but delicious."
Have a walk around,"Have a walk around and enjoy the busy bustling atmosphere of that quarter, at 5 pm the place will be packed and people are enjoying the streetfood - surrounded by trillions of cosmetic stores "
excellent food,"it was good to do some cheap shopping with some awesome street food like lobster, shrimps, crabs, egg bread, etc"
Myeondong Shopping Street,"Easy to find things to buy here. The atmosphere is perfect for a get together, enjoying snacks or just to get the best bargains! Anyone travel to Seoul must make a pit stop here at Myeondong and shop your hearts out!"
Seoul Shopping Capital <3,"2nd time visited Myeongdong Shopping Street. Myeongdong Shopping Street is an all in package for beauty products,shoes,bags and street foods. even they have an underground shopping for kpop fan not oly for kpo fan :) but it was really nice that you can roam around and don't bother on getting bored :)"
EXCELLENT,"My hotel was just next to the busy street. It was excellently well placed. Everyday I would go out of my hotel and 10 meters away is the busy shopping street. You want food? No problem? Shopping? No problem. This is a haven for those shopping for beauty products. You could spend thousands of dollars here. I purchased food, snacks, beauty masks, socks.....you name it. Would I come again? DEFINITELY."
Ladies shopping paradise,"This shopping street is meant for the ladies, really, with cosmetics outlets all over. The night shopping sees more life with food stalls selling all kinds of snacks . The food outlets and cafes can be found at the side streets and are plentiful. Be prepared to queue to get in, which seems to be a standard practice here. All the stores have mandarin speaking sale staff who can converse in English too. So much of the bargaining can take place quite comfortably."
Repetive,Visited this shopping street and found it very similer to Shinsaibashi in Osaka JapanMainly cosmetic shops selling all the same stuff shoe shops convenience shops and eateriesEach street in the area the same
Bargains galore!,"As a keen lover of Korean Beauty, this was HEAVEN! The prices are much cheaper than back home in Australia and there is so much variety! A quick google told me the “must haves” and these were so easy to find.Olive Young is like a Korean version of Priceline that we have in Australia and there are great brands available there and many sales or promotions going on. If you like skincare and cosmetics, THIS is the area you need to shop in!"
Capitalist madness!,"Myeongdong is absolutely batshit, and in the best way. It's crowded and lively, with a bewildering selection of shops, cafes, and restaurants. There's underground shopping as well as street-level, but don't forget to look up: most commercial buildings in Seoul have shops on the second, third, even fourth floor. If you're looking for skincare, nearly every top Korean chain has multiple stores here. You'll find Western fast food, international restaurants, Korean BBQ and dumpling places. Anything you could possibly want to eat is somewhere in Myeongdong. Some of the best K-pop music stores are here, as well. Plus a big movie theatre. You could spend days here and not see everything. When you need a break, sit and relax a while in a tea cafe. And then, as evening comes along, start all over again, because at night, the broad main streets become packed with vendors selling souvenirs, gadgets, and every conceivable kind of street food you've ever heard of. Fair warning: a lot of it can be greasy and messy, and there are very few trash cans. But most vendors will take your discarded napkins and skewers and dispose of them for you when you buy your next treat from them. And it helps to have extra napkins and perhaps hand wipes handy. The digital screens and neon everywhere are dazzling, and people-watching is delightful. Have fun!"
A must try,You simply have to go here if it's your first visit to Seoul. This is a beauty mecca for all beauty enthusiasts. All the big k-beauty brands have several flagship stores in this area. They are side by side as long as the eyes can see. If you buy bundles you can get discounts. And whilst you're there don't forget to try the delicious street food.
Good place to shop and eat,Stayed around the area..did not manage to walk around the whole place but did get to smell and eat the street food. Wonderful experience. Lots of yummy food to taste on..eg lobster tail with cheese..honeyed strawberry and grape..etc. A lot of cosmetics ..souvenir shops. It is really a fashion and eat street. Tried a restaurant which served abalone porridge..chicken buloggi porridge..etc. Yum..porridge served with kimchi..literally everywhere. Will definitely spend more time there; in future visit.
It’s a dangerous place for a shopaholic:),"There’s all kinds of street food, endless rows of skincare and make up shops and shops that sells cute socks and accessories. I actually went there with zero intention to buy anything but still ended up with skincare and socks for family and friends. If you’re looking to purchase Korean skincare, this place is great. There is sometimes good deals like ‘buy 1 free 1’ deals and always ask the sales people for free gifts and samples. Also remember to ask them for tourist tax refunds. "
Not as good as it use to be.,"This place can get really crowded at times. There is an over abundance of shops selling woman’s beauty items. Many Chinese visitors shopping for everything. If you look you can find restaurants throughout the area, but many are on the 2nd or 3rd floors. You get what you pay for. Some of the more expensive restaurants will come with several side dishes which were so common a decade ago. Some street food vendors sell, but have no place to set and enjoy what you have just bought.Still a good place to visit, wear your tennis shoes, bring your camera and have a good time."
"Wonderful, hectic street shipping","You can find almost whatever you're looking for in these streets as well as Shingsae department store. Everything from street food to, socks, t-shirts, electronics, supermarkets, desserts, restaurants, etc.Stroll worth the trip."
Crowded and bustling in the nighttime,"I went back there thrice because of the free face masks and the buy one, take one offers. I was disappointed when I got to the Incheon airport and found that the cosmetics sold at the Duty Free shop were cheaper and that the shop was more generous with the giveaways (They didn't just give away sachets. They gave away bottles of gel and cream!)I went crazy with the food side stalls at Myeongdong as well only to realize that 5 mins walk away at Namdaemun market the same treats were sold at 1/3 the price! But that's a tourist market for you. I don't regret going to Myeongdong but I do regret spending so much money there. Hahaha."
Nice street food,Tons of street food and shopping. Kind of confusing to walk around but we still enjoyed it here. Definitely a must do.
Must visit in the evening,"Walking the main street and the many side streets in the evening is a never-to-be-forgotten experience. The streets are packed with people out shopping and eating at the very many street vendors, all at incredibly reasonable prices. And, oh yes, the main departmental stores are pretty good, too, for example Lotte which covers two blocks."
Shopping for korean skincare,Mainly for korean brands of skincare. Lotte dept store is here too. Streets are lined with all sorts of korean brand. Street food in interesting to try.
Visited Several Times,"Yes, it was touristy, but we LOVED it! We went with a group of young ladies who loved the beauty and clothing stores. My husband and I enjoyed the street food the most and spent our time eating while waiting for them. We ended up visiting it several times on our trip to Seoul."
good for shopping,"From high-end to cheap products are offer in the market.Good place for shopping Nike, Fila, Topten,.. Good quality"
Pricey but worth the experience,"This place is for food enthusiast and shoppers. Nice place to shop whilst eating korean specialty crayfish, or an octupus on a stick... lol. We spend around $50 the first nyt and we keep craving for more stuff.. following night we ate at the resto. Kinda busy atmosphere on the street at night. Worth an experience..."
Myeongdong subway station is the hidden germ!,"As per title, myeongdong street is popular with thousands of fashion line, food,kpop goods and many more. But bear in mind, that these item nevertheless a quite pricey esp if you don't know how to bargain. They been selling almost similar item from one stall to another. But its a fun street to explore thou! But, i found if you plan to shopping and still find it reasonable, go to their myeongdong underground shopping centre! similar items up there slightly cheaper and more CHOICES. hehe. You can buy something for everyone besides keychain, their collections of socks is amazingg. from disney cartoon, nickelodeon you name it.The material is nice and only 1000k a pair. Happy explore!"
Crazy crazy place,Its so crowded but nice place to try some street food although it is not cheap there. Also its good for last minute suvenir shopping :) 
A really happening and fun place to go,"This is definitely one of the places where tourists should go! It has nearly everything.. From shops to stalls. Even cute cafés! For the Muslim travellers, there are also some halal food vendors so there is no need to worry. Best time to visit would be during the afternoon, in my opinion. And the stalls are usually up by late afternoon as well. Its also a nice place to just walk around and window shopping as well! "
Famous area for tourist,"Who doesn't love shopping and eat ? I think most people love this 2 things right ... Myeongdong is the right area for shopping especially skincare and cosmetics, street food hunter and entertainment. Well, there are also some duty free malls which sell high-end brand. Very crowded with tourist. But i prefer Hongdae rather than Myeongdong."
a big market indeed ,"with number of stalls and shops where you could find various local things, a lot of restaurants too, easily spend few hours here, connect to luxury shopping malls that suits all you need, good for all travelers for a visit"
Do you need cosmetics?,"Face masks, feet masks, hand masks and everything else you need to look and feel great will be found here! There’s the odd clothing store and some restaurants, but it’s predominantly cosmetic shops. It’s hustling and bustling and everything you expect of a major Asian city!"
Never ending cosmetics stores !,Fascinating place to visit and experience the overwhelming South Korean cosmetics industry .... briefly.
Great shopping area but watch out the expiry date of product,"A very great location for shopping, where many popular masks, skin care products, bathroom products, foods, fashion clothing, almost every thing you need is available there, including baby needs & supermarket. Only thing need to highlight: bring umbrella along, there is no undercover. No baby chair to be provided in 9/10 restaurant."
Lots of food and shopping around,"It's a place that everyone comes to when visiting Seoul. Long and parralel streets of hawker food and clothes for shopping. Many shopping malls around, too. Its very crowded with tourists, both locals and abroad. You can just eat and eat, buy and buy. It's just so tiring. Branded stuff are found in those branded shopping malls, foreign tourists able to get tax-refund by showing your passports when shopping at some outlets. Conveniently located with Underground shops and subway stations nearby. The beautiful Myeongdong Cathedral also located here."
Real Seoul,"Before my visit, i always imagined Seoul exactly that it looks like in Myeongdong street. When i first time saw this amazing night street view of Seoul I ultimately fall in love with this. People always have some expectations about something. I had about this asian metropolis city own expectations. And when the time has come i saw it, i felt it...P.S.: i think, it is better to visit this place when the Sun goes down. "
Still the best place in Seoul for me!,"Myeongdong is a must visit for us everytime we visit Seoul. We love the food, hype, and crowd here. We were finally able to try the torched marshmallow with ice cream filling! Yes!!! "
Awesome!,Nice area. Everything is there. Food is great! All types of food. Various restaurants and street food stalls. Shopping is all around you. What else can I say? 
Shoppers Haven,"You should never miss Myeongdong when in Seoul! It's a must visit place where you can purchase cosmetics at a very affordable price. There are also ""samples"" in almost every store so do not hesitate asking for it in exchange for a quick visit inside their shop. There are also restaurants, shoe stores, malls, and STREET FOODS! A trip to Seoul would not be complete without a visit to Myeongdong."
A must go when in Seoul,"Bustling place with lots of street food, restaurants, cafes, local eateries, beauty products, etc. A good place to replenish facial and beauty products at good prices."
Shopping,"There is a lot of creative street foods along the street and the street shop at night time. The night time is more alive than the day time. There is a lot of Korean cosmetic shops, Korean fashion, and restaurants."
Shopping and Street Food,Went to Myeongdong in the evening. It was bustling with people and very alive. You have the regular shops and brands as well as stalls selling local Korean food. It has a lot of side streets to explore so be sure you have your walking shoes on. Great fun!
Beautiful shopping district ,"Beautiful shopping district, mixing famous clothing brands with many many local beauty/skin care brands.In the middle, many little area where people cook local food"
"Classy Street Food , A Heaven for Cosmetic lovers","Facial care and cosmetic enthusiasts , this is for you . Almost any available international and Korean specialty brands can be found here. At cheaper prices at that. In almost every corner you will find something. That’s aside from several souvenir shops , convenience stores , mini grocery , and stalls selling knock off designer shirts . Street food kiosks sprout from late afternoon. These items are not that basic , selling abalone , scallops , crabs and lobster among others. Choose your fave food , you won’t be disappointed. But the prices are not cheap. Yet I loved it. Included some photos ."
nice place with its bargain finds,"Shops can be found everywhere. I find this place more affordable than the the other shopping areas i've been in other countries. Beauty products are affordable. Bags, souvenir items are likewise at fair prices. If your objective in visiting Korea is to shop, then this place is for you. Street foods are everywhere, a taste of Korean and other selections as well. "
Beauty Care Product Dream,"My wife and daughter absolutely loved this shopping district. The South Korean women take their beauty seriously and this is a dream street for purchasing anything you need to take care of your desires. The district is chock full of quality stores, the streets are vibrant and clean and there is plenty of street food.Crazy experience when a couple approved me to take a 'selfie' with a Westerner! Had a great laugh."
Good shopping place ,this place is very good for shoppers and for those who would like to experience street foods in Korea. We also watched a funny show in this place where they use kitchen utensils as musical instruments. I would compare it to Ximending night market in Taiwan but more affordable.
Myeongdong Shopping Street,"Myeongdong Shopping Street is a shoppers' paradise especially for skin care and make-up products. The shopping area mainly features Korean brands like Etude zHouse, Tony Moly, Missha, etc. We bought Tony Moly skin care products for anti-aging and skin peeling and also cushion powder. During our visit, Tony Moly was on sale. It was good buy. And we found out that the Tony Moly products we bought in Myeongdong are not available Tony Moly here. At 4 pm, street foods lined up Myeongdong streets. And this made our Myeongdong shopping adventure more enjoyable."
Visitor paradise ,Visited myeongdong. Its a paradise. Street food everywhere. Cosmetic product are everywhere and cheap too
Shop til you drop,"One of the most popular places to shop in Seoul. I like getting cosmetics and skincare here because most of the brands are in this area. Every shop is almost a skincare/cosmetics store which makes it really convenient.In the evenings, the food stalls start to pop up. Walking down and sampling street snacks is always fun. Myeongdong is quite a touristy place especially at night with the crowds."
Shopping & Food Paradise!,Myeongdong is a must visit when you are in Seoul. It literally is a food & shoppers paradise! So many shops to visit and the variety of food is endless. Do go with an empty stomach so you can try all types of delicious food here. You should allocate at least 3 hours to walk around this area. The shops are endless and you can get lost. Have fun & happy shopping & eating!
Busy shopping street,"It is always filled with crowd and during our stay, there was a fan-signing event. This street is always a great place to stop by especially if you're into street food."
Shoppings free!,"Recommended for all ages, cosmetics, facial care, clothes, bag, shoes and street food. Don’t miss the Almond nuts and variety of seaweeds (flavored) snacks. "
Great area to shop,Good luck trying to find a mAp. This area is huge and expect to get lost. Some famous brands...sneakers and make - up/ beauty products are cheap.
AWESOME SHOPPING AND FOOD!,"This is by far the best market in Seoul. Street food AMAZING! Shopping INCREDIBLE! We spent a majority of our time exploring this place, WILL NOT DISSAPPOINT!"
Shopping Street of Korea,If you love shopping this is definitely a place that you cannot miss. There are hundreds of shops in the area. Famous Brands as well as local brands....as usual there are so many skin care shops. And I in the late afternoon until evening they sell street food.
Would always love to come back!,"It is very famous of its street food along the alley ... they offer variety of local dishes, and the tteokbokki was really nice. The one that is super delicious is the freshly made strawberry mochi. Lots of interesting shops along the way to satisfy your shopping needs!"
Enjoy food and shopping ,"Like many, come here, eat a lot of food, like most grilled shrimp. And lots of sales Like most grilled shrimp and glad to have shoes that you likeToliet available in shopping mall beside road"
Shopping spree,"We only had 2 hours to visit this place but its definitely not enough to visit everything here. There are a lot of make-up/beauty stores, street food stalls, food, clothing and souvenir shops in here. If you get hungry, there are also a lot of restaurants here. ATMs, banks and foreign currency exchange centers are also here."
Great Shopping place ,Great shopping place for cosmetics & sports wear. Plenty of food outlets and snacks stores. Spoilt with varieties of snacks in these stores. Do shop around for bargains.Stay on for the nite market where St foods is a must try. Do remember to pack warm clothes for the nite mkt(springtime is still cold at nite).If you are looking for F&B outlets do check out on the upper floor signage since the outlets are mostly on 2nd flr.
Busy Shopping Places,"It is very busy everyday, full of tourists. Restaurants, beauty shops, street food (evening) every way. Can’t speak Korean no problems, the sales people can speak English, Chinese & Thai. Try the banana milk if you are in South Korea, is quite popular among tourists. Also try the ginseng chicken soup not bad. "
Lovely Area to Wander and Eat ,We stayed Nearby and loved the walking in the evenings before and after dinnerA must try is the cheese lobster or fried chicken or tornado potato sticks or even the cuttlefish Must not miss eating the strawberries either in a cup or on a stick with chocolate or cream they are absolutely yummyDrinks walk along and you will have fresh orange or pomegranate juice 
Great Place to Visit!,Variety of choices of beauty products and foods and snacks!Love this place and for sure will come back again!It's a must visit place in Seoul!
Best shoppingn place ,During our stay we went here 3 times to shop. Its a shop till you drop area from restaurants to stalls and boutiques fro shoes and cosmetics. Cosmetic shops will offer you face mask and you just accept it and enter their shop without even buying or if you buy you just have to haggle . I would definitely recommend this area if you want to shop till you drop. Its just 2 stops from seoul station and actually accesible to all stops. They close by 11:00 pm every day . 
Great shopping ,"So many great shops! I enjoyed walking around this area. There are many skincare shops like Innisfree, Nature Republic, Skin Food and Etude House. Uniqlo, Zara, Guess, H&M and Forever 21 are also in the area. There are also 2 huge Daiso’s...3 floors! I also fell in love with Artbox. I also had the most amazing pancake with honey from one of the food vendors! The shopping street is accessible by the Myeongdong station. "
Must go in Seoul,"You can get street food, facial masks, sports apparel here. Zara, H&M, Uniqlo are also located on this shopping street. Lots of promotion for the facial products. Selling one for one - good buy. A must go place in Seoul. The later it gets, the crowded it is so do go earlier to avoid the crowd. "
Seoul Shopping!,"I love shopping in Myeongdong! My boys and I tried their street food and it was delish! The place kinda smelled different tho but it was fine, we had an awesome shopping experience. I wish we had more time spent there. Oh well, always a next time "
A Highlight experience not to be missed,"When in Seoul you should not miss the Myeongdong district for shopping especially the famous Korean brands and also Korean street food. Here you will be flanked by rows of street food some Korean dishes and some international such as Churros, crepes, kebab. I love the strawberry mochi with red beans. There are also many shops for clothings and Korean cosmetics. However it’s very hard to find a dustbin. Therefore if you are going for street food, do be sure to carry a small bag to dispose garbage."
A must visit place for tourists,The place seems to have more tourists than locals. It is a must visit place when coming to Seoul. Plenty of shops and foods in a street maze. Easily accessible by train.
Korean Cosmetics and Street Food!!!,"Highlight of our trip! Our hotel, L7 Hotel is very much close to this area so we had no trouble of finding a place to eat! Every night, we tried different food, from grilled cheese clams to fresh strawberries dipped in syrup! Shopping is pretty much covered also, there are a lot of bargain stores you can get snacks for gift-aways for friends! And of course, face masks everywhere!!!! "
Clean,This place is the same like we have in the Philippines. It has too many people walking around like divisoria but the only difference is its safety. Food street stalls were clean and delicious. Shopping stalls were great. 
Great shopping area with street foods ,"Busy shopping district with many branded stores, skin care, food market. Also got tons of street food stalls to enjoy small bites of Korean food. There are also tourist information staff to ask for directions from, very thoughtful gesture. However keep in mind that the foods may be a bit pricey coz this is one of the tourist attraction."
High end shopping,"Myeongdong is a place for not also for buying a beauty products but also for the delicious street food. We even tried the taiyaki, a fish-like cake with cheese filling inside."
Plan before shopping ,"I love cosmetics and fashion. But I still wish that I had done more research. The area is very exciting-lots of tourists and shoppers. You can get really cute cheap clothes, tourist souvenirs and lots of knock off goods but the focus of this shopping area is cosmetics. With all of the instagrammable spots and street food it is a little bit difficult to actually shop for cosmetics unless you know better what you want. I suggest researching the main brands. innis free. Etude House, Stylenanda, skinfood, nature republic, Artium. These cosmetics houses have real deals that will translate into fun shopping if you know what you like and what products are truly not distributed world wide. Otherwise the appeal for most shoppers is the duty-free aspect. I personally don’t travel all around the world just to fill my bags with items that I can order on the internet or purchase otherwise paying a reasonable tax for merchandise. Olive young is a fine place to buy more Korean cosmetics from the Lines you can find online. Personally I watched a lot of YouTube’s and researched which Korean brands have the least problematic additives preservatives. We figured out that both my daughter and I like “too cool for school” so we just two bought two of everything in the store that caught our eye and then let the staff give us lots of free samples of everything else. I also bought a lot of dr. Jart masks at Olive young only to find that some of the other shops on the street offered Dr. jart masks discounted. There are young college students who volunteer as tour guides. They were standing in the major intersections. We talked for a long time with “ Zoe” who offered us lots of advice and friendly conversation about our travels even though we decided not to take tour. Furthermore we came back to one of the money exchange places closest to the walled embassy of China ( from the Lotte young plaza go down the street to the right of the Zara) more than once as it offered a significantly better daily rate of exchange. Myeongdong was a good place to find korean food. Many good choices for desserts binsoo and chimaek and soups/stews. I would go elsewhere for bbq. "
Pricey,I used to eat one of the restaurant here and it was great even if this is a famous shopping street and a little bit pricey even in the subway market still you can count on this place.I used to widraw here in standard charter that cannot accept on other banks.
Vibrant busy street,"Very busy street but full of people, shops, market stalls and food. Lots of tourists and very crowded but this just adds to the atmosphere. Lots of delicious food to pick from with fantastic vendors very happy to help with non Korean speaking tourists."
Well worth going to have something to eat ,This was a great experience and so glad to go . We walked from our hotel in the early evening so many food stands. I highly recommend the lobster with cheese and the deep fried shrimp. We had to go back three times to be able to try lots more. The Oreo cookie churro is good as well. Make sure to take this activity in on your busy.
Best Street Food!!!,"Amazing selection of Street food! Must try the cheese balls, fish cakes, 33 cm soft serve ice cream, and strawberry mochi (5 stars)!!! I had the cheese scallop too and it was awesome! Myeongdong is best for food!"
Skin care paradise ,"If you are a fan of korean skincare all of their store is available here, not only one but multiple. "
Full of goodies!!,"Myeongdong is the place to be for skin care products. Prices varies from $1- $$$. Morning is better quality time for shopping, night time is super pack with tourists, street food are awesomely yummy and bargain items are everywhere."
Amazing,"There are many cosmetic stores. It’s fantastic. At night , there are many street foods. Roast lobster with cheese is very delicious. Yummy!"
Loved it.... so many shops and foods to choose from,"We returned to Myeongdong a few times during our stay. Mostly for the food and to buy socks. We loved the area, the atmosphere and the sites. "
Busy place,"Lined with cosmetics & skin care shops, one is spoilt for choice. In the evening, stalls are open selling street food. Interesting array of street food available. A most-visit place to load up on skincare products, shoes & clothing. "
Lots of makeup / skincare shops,"If you are looking for korean makeup and skincare brands, just come to Myeongdong.- you name it, they have it. Very crowded especially in the evening with street vendors selling finger food, t-shirts,bags and accessories. A vibrant shopping street worth visiting."
Shop till you drop!,"A haven for all cosmetic & skin-care products! and the local street food in this area is the best, though it can be pricey on some. lol."
My Myeongdong Experience ,The streets were so full of people but it was really clean. Plus it is safe to roam around the streets. 
Amazing market!,This market goes on and on and has even more at night when the street food starts. Just amazing! We found some excellent deals on clothes and cosmetics and enjoyed the unique cafes and foods. This was our favorite market in the city. 
Shop till you drop!,"This is what street shopping is all about. From cosmetics, clothes, shoes and many more! The place turn alive from 5pm onwards. With the neon lights from the shops and many food stalls, you wont leave this place hungry. For Muslim travel, you can eat at Halal restaurant name Busan Jib. The shops is located in small alley on your right side."
Crazy street,"This is the best street in the heart of Seoul. Popular for its street food and shopping. Walking in this crowed street is itself fun, mainly at night. A must experience while in Seoul."
A must-see experience for any trip to Seoul.,"Nice selection of street food in the evening. Small, quaint streets with a lot of shopping options. Best time to arrive is late in the afternoon."
"Fashion, Skin Care/Makeup, and Food all in one place!","Great place to go shopping for cosmetics, skin care products, and clothing. But the best part I enjoyed here is the row of streetfood that line in the middle of the street, which aren't that expensive. Great to go here during the late afternoon to evening. You can easily spend much time and money going around this place and enjoying yourselves."
Cosmetic paradise,"It is a great place for cosmetic shopping but anything other than that are kinda expensive. My korean friend told me even the Koreans themselves don't really come here. If you want to buy clothes, kpop merchandise, or souvenir go to Dongdaemun area or Nondaemun Market."
Worth going for the food alone!,"We only went by in passing on our way to the ""Cookin' NANTA"" show, but wish we spent more time and was more hungry when we were there! We aren't really big shoppers when we travel, but it was interesting enough to window shop and is worth going for the food alone. It was busy and crowded when we went on a Sunday afternoon, but was clean and felt safe even with young children. Even people with food allergies (e.g. my wife is coeliac) should be able to find something they feel safe eating.Tip: apart from public transport, this is where we spent most of our cash in Korea - everywhere else we could use card. Bring at least 5000 won per person for a snack."
Shopping,If you are looking for something you can find it in this area. There were shops and people everywhere. 
Tourist spot,"Good place to take a walk if you're not doing anything else. I would go here just for the atmosphere and the food stalls that line up around 8pm, but there are rich opportunities for shopping as well. "
Amazing!,All kinds of street vendors. Food galore. Clothes. High end stores. Street food. Restaurants. Shops. Flea markets. It is all here.
The shopping paradise for Kbeauty,"This is a must for kbeauty lovers. It`s possible to find anything of any brand you want. There is a ""All mask store"", that sells a lot of kinds and types of mask, facial, hand or foot mask. And there is a lot of street food, that is also delicious. Super must place to go."
AMAZING shopping street in Seoul,"Myeongdong shopping street is one of the best shopping streets in Seoul. There are a wide variety of shops here, including a FILA megastore, Tommy Hilfiger, Adidas Originals, Nike, GUESS etc. Asides from many clothing stores, there are also many face care and make-up stores which have very good deals. Innis free, Etude House, 3CE, and Tony Moly are some of the many make-up/face care brands which have more than 3 stores at Myeongdong.There’s also a ton of street food along the streets of Myeongdong.

Best of all, most of the shops will give you free samples at the counter.There are some food stalls along the street so you can get some snacks if you are hungry. "
Fun place,What a fun place to visit when in Seoul. There are great restaurants all around and the nightlife is great. Easy access by subway. It is most fun at night with tons of street food. Would highly recommend you visit

Nice place to walk around,"Many restaurants and shopping outlets here. Come in the later afternoon and there will be street stores selling food, clothing and snacks."
High Energy Shopping Street- Sea of People,"If you’re into street food, shopping, large crowds, high energy, or traveling with no kids, Myeongdong will suit your needs. If not, you might be overwhelmed and I don’t recommend this destination. This area is filled with tourist crowds all battling for the delicious street food. Each food vendor are $5 to $10 that varies from deserts to seared scallops. If the food vendors doesn’t hit your wallet, the multilple storefronts will. Want to shop for sneakers, clothes, beatufy face masks, or color contacts? This area will serve your shopaholic needs. Bear in mind, this place is very touristy."
Vibrant! ,"Located near Myeongdong Station, the area has many shops and restaurants.you can find most Korean skincare and cosmetics brands here. It’s advisable to check around for prices first before making your purchases. Sometimes, different places offer different promotions. There is an Innisfree cafe that isn’t available in Singapore. I love this place. It’s full of energy. I can easily spend hours here for a few consecutive days."

Shopping and Street Food Vendors,"Sooo many clothing, skincare stores, and street food vendors to try too.

There are more luxury brand stores across the street in Lottte Mall. The streets can get crowded."
Nice shopping ,"This is a must see when you are in Korea! The shopping her is good. Just a lot of people, but it is worth it :)"

So much to do!,"Incredible street food, shopping (don't be shy to haggle!) and the perfect place to people watch. We spent many days here and found some really cool clothes and makeup we'd never find back home. I recommend coming once during the day and once at night- you have to see this place lit up!"
Cosmetics Haven,"Other than that, the night market is filled with vendors selling clothes, street food and souvenirs.The clothes and souvenirs IMHO a bit pricey due to the place being frequented by tourists.As for the street food, you may just want to indulge eventhougg they may not be the tastiest. "
"Food trip, sightseeing, shopping","You decide why you will visit Myeongdong but whatever your reason may be, this is a must place to see in Seoul.Yes, it is crowded but this adds to the vibe of the place. This is also very accessible via the subway line."
STREET FOOD! ,"If you are a food lover, you must check this place out. The vendors starts setting up around 3-4pm and it’s open until around 10pm. There’s also a lot of stores to shop around. "
Lively & exciting ,Love the street food stalls at night though they are not necessarily cheap. There are plenty of skincare & cosmetics ships offering discount. The only watch out is not to be touted and be sure to buy only what you need. The shops will try to throw in all kinds of deals & freebies to encourage you to buy more. There are also many nice restaurants offering a lot of dining options. Great place to hang out at night. There is a street for having Chimac ( Korean fried chicken & beer). 
Myeongdong Shopping Street - Good street food and great shopping awaits ....,Myeongdong literally 'bright cave' or 'bright tunnel' but it is really nothing like a cave or tunnel but it is bright all right. Bright all night with the wonderful aroma of street food and great shops for good bargains for all things under the sun.
Entertaining ,"This shopping street is one of the crowded or busy street in South Korea. Famous for its local cosmetic product where you can get a very cheap price and good offer. They also sell cheap brand of shoes like Fila,Sketchers and a lot more branded product"
Best place ,"I went three times i always stay in this area its the best place for families, friends ,and couples."
Didn't spend enough time here.,"Lots of stores both bright and pokey to gander at. We only had a short time, I had to get back to return the Hanbok that I had rented. I bought a few things here and the prices were affordable and reasonable. The smaller pokey places had better prices than the bright . Also some great street food and people were super nice, though that could be because I was an older blondie in a Hanbok."
Money keep disappearing,"When I arrive at this place, I have money in my wallet. By the time I left I am so much poorer but my wife is very happy"
Lively place with plenty of retail n food outlets,"This place was bustling with people at the night we visited. The crowds went for shopping ( cosmetics, souvenirs,etc) , food ( Koreans n international) and entertainment ( theatre, pubs n karaokes).This place is near metro station and is very accessible, a must for all visitors who want to feel the busy pulse of Korea in the evenings."

Heaven ! ❤ ❤,"My guest house is near from this area, so i came here everyday on my trip. It was a place with korean skincare everywhere, korean streetfood everywhere, and some branded stuff official stores too. It's a shopping heaven !But compare to Ewha and Itaewon, Myeongdong is lil bit more expensive. So be careful to spend your money in Myeongdong."
"In 5 days in Soul, we went here 4 times!!!","I have 3 daughters, 1 son, 1 wife. My wife bought all those masks... masks for ever single part of your body that you can imagine!!! My 2 teenage daughters did the same this and then all four of them bought clothes, blouses, pants, skirts, jackets... a lot!!! Me and my son enjoyed tasting all the street foods that start opening up at 5pm. Delicious!"
Best shopping street ,"This place is very good to shop but a bit touristy . If you don’t mind it, it is very good and you can get everything there. "
Awesome for Tourists,"You can get all your traditional korean food and snacks here. Rows of make-up and skincare products boutiques. They have big supermarket there too, where you can buy local snacks souvenirs. If you want proper restaurants, they have it there too. "
Things are over priced ,"I found things are overpriced compared with other shopping’s street. Well, there still a lot of entertainment for your view. "
Fun Street Market...Pushy Sales ,"Great street market that is located steps away from downtown Seoul. There is so much here that it’s hard to sum it all up.Face masks? You will get “pushed” face masks by almost every shop. Actually gets annoying after a while, but heck...we bought 100 face masks. Our faces better be silky smooth :)So much food options! You’ll have a great time trying the different vendors or restaurants in Myeongdong. We tried tons of different places and all were very tasty...not one bad experience.This is for sure an experience you won’t want to miss! Happy travels!"
One of Those Uniquely Korean Experiences,"We last visited Myeongdong four years ago, in summer, with an adult daughter in tow, who wanted to visit seemingly every single outlet on the street - an interesting but rather exhausting experience.This time around, in much less busy February and with no pressure to buy anything specific, we found it a much more enjoyable experience, just ambling along and watching life going on all around us. There is every conceivable cosmetic store here, sometimes multiple branches just a few hundred meters from each other - just in case they don’t tempt you in the first time - interleaved with fashion stores, shoe stores and sportswear mainly.Many of the stores have ‘Greeters’ outside, whose job it is to persuade you in. There are also lots of people with flyers for such things as massages, cat cafes etc, which are located just offering the main shopping streets. You do need to adopt a firm stance.There are lots of good offers on cosmetics, which are of high quality in Korea. Many stores will give you samples too although, as an ‘Aajuma’ who clearly doesn’t wear make up, I don’t seem to fit the criteria, or perhaps I just didn’t spend enough! When we were here with our daughter she almost had more samples than purchased goods.Obviously the character of the shops within these streets are aimed at particular tastes and interests but, even if you aren’t specifically going to buy something, this is a uniquely Korean experience, and you might just find something that you had no idea you needed."
nice place to visit at night,This area become street food many small stands sell food and other thingsAt night the lights are beautifulat day hours you can visit the shops
Myeongdong shopping,"Myeongdong is an area which becomes lively full of shopping goods and foods at night. There is also a famous church there, the myeongdong cathedral. This place cant be missed when you visit south korea."
Shop till you drop,"Our accommodation was just a walking distance to Myeongdong shopping market wherein every night we go there to eat a lot of street local food, branded items on sale and choose to a variety of skin products. Prices were really affordable and if you shop a lot you, tax refund at the airport is possible."
Food lover's delight - street fair,The Myeongdong shopping area is an open air mall with hundreds of small food merchants in the sidewalk - every kind of imaginable food - very reasonably priced - instead of a meal at a restaurant I enjoy eating a bunch of different small portions from a variety of merchants - delightful
Avoid unless you’re going for something specific,"Tacky, overpriced and overcrowded. It doesn’t seem to be too much different from any shopping thoroughfare anywhere else in the world - it could be Tokyo, New York, London or Beijing, were it not for the korean lettering everywhere. Unless you have a particular desire to spend too much on substandard fare, avoid."
Great evening out!,We took a few hours out to walk the district. Thete is a wide variety of great street food to enjoy and many and varied shopping outlets too. There was a throng of tourists from all over the world this night. We thoroughly enjoyed our time and highly recommend this activity.
All the lights and sparkle ,"Myeongdong is fun, have your wits about you, tourists galore, enticing street food and markets sellars, lots of beauty shops. love it !"
Lively,A great shopping area and plenty of restaurants. A nice walk pedestrians of shopping haven in Seoul. Must visit.
Crowded area where can find pretty much everything. ,"Area is huge. Alleys Cross to each other packed with clothes, food, jewellers etc. This place is kind of must to see f you haven't visit an any other Asia countries outdoor market. One thing catch my eyes, there is also quite many shops for photographers. If you find yourself in Seoul, visit there. It's kind of experience. "
Korean brand lovers heaven,"As an MCM avid fan, Seoul is a must visit, and it's flagship store in myeongdong comprised of 2 floors which will make a fan like me go crazy!As for all d popular skincare brands e.g. innisfree,face shop,saem,etude house n etc, u can find some good bargains for d sale items.All of d best thing here is? Lots of freebies to take home!"
Lots of ladies cosmetic shopping,"Some similar shops around all selling cosmetics and shoes. The night market have many interesting food. I love to get earrings there, they are super cheap and beautiful."
Cheap and good street food finds,Not too crowded til around 11am when most shops open. You just might miss the UNESCO engraving on the floor about 50 steps going to the church base stairs.Some of the oldest Korean restaurants can be located there.
Best place to taste Korean food,"There are numerous interesting shops and good restaurants. It is a wonderful place for you to try the local food and buy something special. Also, If you are a street photographer, you will find it worthy of a visit."
A very busy night market with massive crowds,"We came here during the evening after walking down from the Namsan Tower. The market becomes super lively during the evening with lots of food stalls (similar to those found in Taiwan). The Koreans love their weird and wacky food market items, You'll find something for everyone. If you get a chance - try the mini octopi and the dumplings!Here you will also find lots of 'discount' snack food shops. They are all basically priced the same along the street and all sell the same things. However we did notice later on some of the snacks were being sold at cheaper prices in just a regular supermarket so they might actually be tourist traps! Though - you really can't fault them for their variety!Lots of options for dinner in the area too if you want a sit down meal and also really close to the Lotte mall!"
Great street food,"Walked around Myeongdong every night because the carts with street food were excellent. It was great to explore the different foods. When we were tired of street food, there were a lot of restaurants to cater to our needs."
A must “do”,"Very close to the Myeongdong Cathedral there is this bunch of streets full of shops restaurants and street food stalls. This neighbourhood is beautiful and you may want to visit this few times while you are in town. The place is very crowded at every hour of the day and night. You will be surrounded by smells and flavours while walking along the main streets as well as noise and people from shops inviting you in. Street food is very cheap and typical Korean, l noticed quite a lot of difference between one stall or the other therefore pay attention to details when you pick one and eat there. Personally speaking l could not miss to stare at the frying oil as most of them have been frying stuff for the entire day and it is dark and smelly and unhealthy but that is everywhere and not only in Myeongdong after all. Perfect for shopping and great place to buy some little gifts from Seoul."
Should Visit!,Great place to try different Korean style street foods. Such a lively location with several sneaker and cosmetic stores. Have also tried a few nearby restaurants.
Myeongdong Streetfood,"Visited Myeongdong street food a few time during my family holiday in Seoul in Dec 2018. The street food is very delicious and also expensive. There are many varieties and among all my favourites are the sweet potatoes, grilled prawns with butter, grilled shredded cuttle fish and the fried potato chip. Myeongdong Shopping Street is the best, their sneakers and sport attires are up to date. "
Lots to do ,Lots of food places are located on the street. There are many small shops as well as larger name brand stores together with department stores. Buy an ice cream or beef on a stick while you look around. 
A lot of nothing ,"I guess it is cool to see and visit this shopping street, but do not expect to actually find anything. There is a lot of nothing and actual stores that seems to be legit sells counterfeit goods for original prices, so be aware. "
Lots to aee,"Bustling, lots to see and buy. The street food is good and worth trying. You can snack along the way instead of dinner. There are plenty of shops: cosmetics, clothes, shoes etc, as well as plenty of outdoor stalls with gifts, clothes...."
The best,Shopping + food haven. You can literally find everything and anything here. We spent a good 2 days shopping and exploring the different restaurants and cafes. 
Shoppers paradise ,"This place is all about shopping fashion items clothes, shoes and of course korean beauty items. Street food is also every where. Just have cash handy atms and currency exchange is a bit of a walk from the street but still accessible. "
Endless Shopping and Street Food !!!,"We stayed in the heart of Myeongdong in Dec 18 and it was so convenient for shopping and trying different local food! We could actually run between different shops to compare prices, and return another day to make the actual purchase. Street food was fun to try as snacks for the first 2 days, but after that we had enough of them. Plenty of choices for proper sit down meals all around .. from BBQ, porridge, stews, etc ... just google the ""must try"" lists, read reviews and start work down from there."
"Market, cosmetics, street food","Great place if you like markets and cosmetics. It’s busy and crowded, tons of little shops (some there 2 and 3 times, like Lush and Innisfree). Mostly cosmetics, but also some good restaurants and great street food."
Amazing,Definitely a must visit! The FOOD ARE AMAZING! Shopping is great too! Their sport shoes and sneakers are cheaper compared to other asian countries :)
Shop 'til you drop!,Lots of shops for every taste and wallet. Nice street food at the end in the evenings. Highly recommend!
Shopppiiingggg!!!,"Well known area when it comes to korean beauty products. Hence, you will also find some apparel shops, mini mart, street food and restaurant, hotel and some souvenir items."
Shopping Mania,The absolute epitome of Asian Urban shopping. Many Korean products and crowded but colourful and energetic location.
Shopping Galore,"Can't think of what to give as a souvenier? Myeongdong is the place for you. It has everything - shoes, clothes, food, accessories, etc. Shop til you drop. Shopping haven especially for girls who likes Korean beuty products. If you go here make sure you bring plenty of cash. A must try also would be the street foods every night."
Must see in Seoul,"A vibrant, busy and tourist friendly area in Seoul. Easy to get to by the metro. Lots of eateries and shops. Multiple Starbucks in a small area :-) Lots of street food which is my favourite I must say. Very friendly people."
Suddenly I’m a shopaholic 😳,"I spent most of my time in Myeongdong shopping street. There are lots of eateries, it’s nice to have a quick bite and continue shopping. The ambience is nice especially at night when it gets busier, merrier and the street lights up beautifully. I recommend you all cosmetic lovers to shop at Baviphat cosmetic store as they sell cheap korean cosmetic products. It is an advantage for me since it is cheaper to buy my desired cosmetic products in Korea. Not only beauty care but also footwear and fashionable clothes. "
Bustling street packed with shops at street level....,"...though there are loads of other shops below street level (at the underground sections within Myeongdong station) and at the upper levels of each building. It’s easy to get distracted by the shopfront and promoters at street level who try to entice you with free samples to enter their premises. But learn to look up and check out the store signs where you will discover book stores, CD shops, non branded clothes shops, restaurants and even a meerkat cafe (yes, you heard me right....a cafe where there are real meerkats that come up close to you). The street resembles the hustle and bustle of streets in Asia except that you can feel a really young vibe here very much like Shinjuku in Tokyo. Loads of cosmetic brands (Tony Moly, Etude House, Innisfree....etc) each one trying to outsell each other by offering discounts or specials. Not surprising to see two outlets from the same brand just 100metres apart. This is also the place to get your K-pop merchandise fix where street carts and shops within Myeongdong station peddle all sorts of paraphernalia from key chains to posters to mugs sporting your favourite Korean pop idol. If you need to get stuff for family and friends (or even trendy clothes for your teen), this is the place to be with major shopping centres (Lotte, Shinsegae Department Stores). If you are in Korea during the winter/spring period, you will get to enjoy the Korean strawberries which are a real treat. Just don’t get them from the street carts along Myeongdong....You would probably get a better deal (almost half price) at Dongdaemun Market which is just a stop away on the Korean metro line."
An assault to the senses,Walking through Myeondong shopping street will not only whet your appetite for shopping but will also stimulate all your senses. There’s so much going on! There are shops everywhere and also vendors in the streets. It can be easily an overwhelming place but can also be a fun place to visit.
Haven for Street Food & Shopping,"We simply can’t get enough of exploring Meyongdong shopping street (Go in the night time). There are far too many options to choose, from tons of restaurants, street food vendors and hundreds of shops selling all kinds of things. Apparently this is where most people shop for skin care products as well.Though I must say that this is a HIGHLY touristy place thus the prices are more on the higher side. That said, you have to check out the buzz this area creates in the evenings. It’s bustling with people from all parts of the world. A really cool place to hang out with kids. You can never have enough food here ! Try the Oreo Churros, Grilled Lobster, Baked cheese, sweet corn, Skewered Potatoes, Beef, baked scallops, etc. yummy !!! It’s quite a gastronomic experience.Typical street food snacks cost upwards of US$5 (5000 KWR). Happy eating & exploring ! "
Haven of beauty products!,"If you’re into cosmetics and beauty products, you have to go to this place and you won’t probably finish the whole area in just one night. Too many shops offering different prices of the same product. Sellers offering freebies for you to enter their shops. You can find good deals when shops are on sale but that means you really have to spend time going into each store. So far the most common stores I saw in literally every street are, aritaum, skinfood, artbox, too cool for school, innisfree, clio, nature republic, banila co., and tony molly. I’m sure I miss a lot but really with that many cosmetic shops, I’m lucky I can still remember a few! There are also good street food but not a lot. Myeongdong is very accessible, there’s an MRT that goes straight into the market. If you know how to find your way through Seoul’s MRT then it’s really easy to find places in Seoul. I’m so used to taking MRT here in Taiwan so Seoul was no problem for me.I would recommend anyone visiting Seoul to visit Myeongdong just to experience the cosmetic culture of Korea."
All in one to shop,"Never get bored to visit multiple times Good to try street foods, not really reasonable price...wandering as many shops as possible before you make purchases. Different prices at different shops..."
Lots of street foods + Cosmetic,"We stayed 5 nights at Metro Hotel Myeongdong. The best place if we go for eat and shopping with teenagers. There are many streetfoods around the streets every 4pm until night. We just walked 5min from hotel to find the streetfoods and so many cosmetic store in myeongdong. Ettude, Innisfree, Faceshop, Tonimolly, Olive Young, etc. Odeng = Fish Cake = 2000 won, Pork Barbeque = 6000 won, Tornado potato = 3 or 4000 wonWe also ate Korean fried chicken such as BHC = 18000 won for 1 package = 9 drumsticks. Myeongdong has 2 sunway : Euljiro 1 ( Green Line 2 ) and Myeongdong ( Light Blue Line 4 ). Our hotel is near Euljiro 1 Exit 5 or 6 ( only 2min )."
Street food ,"I went 2 times , i love the street and it was good experience to see the street food and I tried . Also there was allot of makeup shops everywhere."
A truly shopper's haven,"The whole area is just a shopper's pure delight and haven! Everywhere you turn, every nook and corner, every building you enter, every lane you go to, it's nothing but shops, shops and more shops... the place never sleep, I think.....it's literally ""shop till you drop"".... "
Shopping Haven for the Ladies!!!!,"This place has got to be ladies’ favourite place of whole Seoul. You can find lots of beauty products here. I personally LOVE Olive Young store where you can find numerous products for skincare and cosmetics. I basically went into every shops in Myeongdong. The street vendors selling street foods are the best. Do try the fishcake with soup, Hotteok, fried squids, Jeok (savoury pancake). But in winter it can be a little difficult to shop. But that did not stop me from dropping by there every day. Will definitely go there again.P/s: for the ladies who want to buy beauty products, pls do your homework and plan what you want to buy. Because everything in Korean and you must know what you want to buy."
So so outting,I had heard a lot about the shopping here but i was not very satisfied with the experience. It was crowded and your pace will be dictated by the oldest and slowest in the crowds. The merchandise on sale mostly appeated to be generic knock-offs and no-name fabrics. The bargaining was half-hearted at best. The other less popular markets and shopping streets are better so i'd skip this one if you are on a limited timetable or looking for something specific. 
Hectic place but worth a visit,"Crazy place to go shopping as people try to drag you into every store, but worth the experience and you can definitely get some good bargains while you're there!"
Shopping on weekends for great discounts!,"There are many people everyday at Myeongdong Shopping street but on weekends, people flock the shopping area for freebies and discounts. I bought so many buy 1 take 1 masks ad make up on a Saturday! The street has full of activities - shopping, street food eating and light show (Christmas season). It may really get cold during winter however... A must see when in Seoul!"
Pushy sales and exorbitant prices street food,"Myeongdong is known to be cosmetic haven for tourists with most beauty brands having a shop presence and good discounts. Even MCM has a two-storey flagship store there and you can also buy all sorts of snacks/ tidbits from the Korean marts to bring home. 200% in terms of convenience. However, be forewarned. Sales people in the cosmetic shops are very very pushy, not only do they follow you ard, they also try to upsell at every opportunity. In addition, the street food carts do not have displayed prices (I only found out later that this is not the norm after visiting areas like Gangnam & Hongdae where prices are clearly displayed). I am not sure if I was “cheated”, I was charged 5,000 won for a stick of fish cake where it is sold at 2,000 won max at other areas. You are better off eating in the many small eateries/ restaurants in the area."
Very busy street,"Myeongdong comes alive from 4pm to 10pm with the various food and clothing stalls. It’s worth a visit. You get to see all sorts of food items being sold as well as clothes, toys, shoes, etc."
Fantastic value for money,"We all went crazy... great selections, low prices. Cannot really bargain much though. 90 percent female fashion and accessories. Long padded jackets going fr 40K won or less..."
A lot of tourists here,"Stayed away from this place if you don’t like shopping or seeing/being in the sea of people. This is the makeup shopping mecca for tourists visiting South Korea. This shopping street reminded me of shopping malls on Black Friday. There are deals everywhere and ones can get easily overwhelmed. Even when you come in with a specific items to purchase at the makeup store, the sales people will keep trying to persuade you to spend more money at the store by selling bulk items at cheaper price. Sales people will walk with you closely as you browse at the store and it can be an uncomfortable experience. There are plenty of food vendors on the street as well. If you’re health conscious, I can tell you that you won’t find any healthy options because all the offerings are similar to county fair food types. Come here at least once to get the experience."
this street is same manhattan's 5 ave in seoul city,"We got off namsan tower and went to myungdong. the weather was very cold. We came here for decades, wanted to have warm meal. but we could not find a restaurant. we finally met the staff who showed we the place and fund the restaurant location. there was a restaurant in the nearby alley. we warmed body because we ate warm sullung-tang. myung-dong is still the center of seoul."
Shops of Top Brands and a lot of eating options,"A shoppers paradise, one can find every top local and Premium international brands here. The market starts from Myeongdong Subway station and ends at Lotte Department Store. Myeongdong shopping street also boosts of many restaurants serving Western, Japanese cuisine in addition to Korea. And there are carts serving local delicacies."
Family tour in Korea,Myeongdong Shopping Street is a nice place where you can find trendy goods. We bought some pairs of shoes which my daughter only found here. Also the street foods is a nice experience since they offer delicious and tasty food but be careful they are not cheap!!!You might over indulge in here!!! 
A fun place,"The street is lined is lined by food stalls. There are also stalls selling clothes, bags and souvenirs. The mood is electric and although crowded, it is a fun place to pass an evening."
Crowded but fun!,"A lot of people on the street to try the food and buy cheap apparel. Lots of cosmetic shops, restaurant and malls."
Best place for shopping and street food ,Don’t go to this place if you’re in a budget cause there are so many delicious food that you need to try and so many shops!!
Didn't care about the shopping... came here for the food and was not disappointed!,"While there are plenty of places to shop up and down the street, I came here for the food, and I was not disappointed! Even on a cold night (-10C), there were plenty of people lining the streets trying out all the street food vendors. I did a walk to scout out the place first and selected a few places here and there to try out, and wasn't disappointed in any of them. They even had an Oreo Churro cart that I skipped out on, but the hot food really hit the spot on a cold night. Don't know much Korean but was able to communicate with finger pointing and numbers in English (or calculators), which got the job done. Would definitely come back to this place, maybe next time not in the winter though. =D"
Busy byt fun,"This group of streets offers so much to do, see and eat!! There are so many shops, both big global shops like Zara and Nike. However, there are cool street vendors too. The streets are also packed with beauty stores, filled with make up products and all the latest skincare things too.The street food, that opens from around 2pm is also FANTASTIC!!! You can get lobster tails - strawberries on a stick. Crepes to fried noodles or a kebab. They have it all!!Be prepared for the CROWDS though!! It's always pscked!!! "
An amazing place for shopping but pricey,"This is a shopping haven for sure for those who love shopping! I may not just have explored the entire place but the stores closed earlier than I expected (around 10pm). I thought they would be open as late as 2am or so. So keep that in mind if you planned on shopping pretty late at night!I also noticed the prices are a bit expensive here - that's why it was called one of the most expensive shopping districts in the world! So definitely check the other areas in Seoul if you plan to do a lot of shopping because other places like Dongdaemun, Ehwa and Hongdae were a little cheaper!"
Samples galore and great street food!,Make sure to wear comfortable shoes if you head to Myeongdong. Tip: many of the beauty stores tend to give out face masks for simply browsing in the stores.
"Crowded plsce, but a lot to buy","Myeongdong shopping street is nice for buying cosmetics, but I would not recommend going here during the weekends. It's very crowded. The street food here is also very nice. "
a paradise for cosmetic and food enthusiasts,"You will love when you first visit here, cosmetics, clothing and food are spread out in every corner like an area that is partying, there is always a reason to remember this place"
Spend pennies or pounds!,"Many, many boutique shops for everyone. I particularly recommend the traditional caligraphy brush shop, the bag shop with unbelievably low prices, the jade jewellery shop, and the sugar sweets demonstration that you'll never forget, along with the taste that you'll savour forever!"
Population Explosion,"Visiting Myeongdong Shopping Street in December is a nightmare, as it is heavily visited both by locals and tourists. It is difficult to really take in the sights and enjoy the experience, and you have to do the best you can.It does seem like a fabulous Street though and would not discourage anybody from visiting. Just be smart about it.The Street Food is good and a good variety. Worth visiting for just the street food. But there is plenty of shopping and bargain hunting to be done.My favorite was the Uniqlo Store and the Lotte Dept Store close by. Almost a full day allocation."
One of my favorite places in Seoul,Myeongdong is one of my favorite places in Seoul! I love all the stores and the street food is amazing. If you’re looking for Korean Skincare this is the place to be! Missha is my favorite! 
A must! ,Amazing world full of small wendors who are offering great street food. Get lost inside this beautiful place and try all the food! 
Myeongdong is a shopping district,"I always stay at Myeongdong when in Korea, i love shopping, I love make ups , face, body and hair care name it!"
Just keep going there to shop for face masks etc,"The land of face masks is best experienced here where you can go to so many different stores to get hundreds if not thousands of dollars of face masks and when you buy that much, dont forget to ask the free cabin bags to take all of your masks home. "
Best street food in town ,For a first time visitor to South Korea this is a must. We enjoyed the smells and flavours. It’s true immersion in the local cuisine and culture and very affordable. just a few minutes from city hall station. Don’t miss out 
"Fantastic street food, but beauty stores here feel pressured ","Loved this area, buzzing at night Street food was lovely, ranging from $5 upwards for a portion,The beauty stores here make you feel pressured to buy, staff walk around with you like they are stalking you, they keep going on about buying this and that, and buying in bulk like spending $60 for face masks! I hated shopping here, much preferred Gangnam area , same shops but calmer and easier to buy."
A Visit in MyeongDong Shopping Street,"This is a must visit for all visitors and tourists in Seoul. Honestly I don't understand why many people visited this place for products, food and souvenirs. Despite there are many street foods areas in MyeongDong, please be sure that they are all selling the same types of Korean foods. That's why I am confused what is the attractions in MyeongDong."
Big Shopping Market,I don’t need to write very long story for this place because anybody knows this famous shopping market. If you want to eat and shop till drop this place is the best. Some store open until 11 pm even midnight. But you have to selective because too many store there. My fave store is Lala Mart. iIt looks like a mini market with yellow sign but they have many various things that you might wanna buy and cheaper than other store. You can buy various snacks or anything for souvenirs.
Annual couple trip,A heaven for ladies to shop! Wide range of beauty products and clothing for ladies and men. This is a shopping heaven!
Overpriced,"Why would you shop in Korea? Sure you can get Korean cosmetics, but everything else is way over priced because of the taxes. It's a known fact."
K-Beauty lovers’ dream,All the Korean beauty names (or at least a few) like TonyMoly - Laneige - Etude House - the SAEM - Innisfree - Missha - and plenty more! 
Busy area,"I heard from some of my local friends that the prices here is actually pretty higher than other places. It’s always full of people and tourists whether you visited it at day or night, weekdays or weekends. "
Nothing but shopping,A lot of stalls selling different types of things... Usually your partner will spent a few mins in every stores....leaving you outside waiting for her or you can join her....A lot of variety to choose..
Must visit place in Seoul,"Any traveller coming here for the 1st time should visit this place and spend money, that's my kindly advice, you could buy premium cosmetics with acceptable price!"
Enjoy street food!,Very very crowded street. Lots of shops for skin care products and clothing. All kinds of street food available if you are a non-vegetarian. One can easily spend 3/4 hours shopping and enjoying the street food.
Quite Localised experience,We went there for street food and local items. Very good and reasonably priced. Never go to that Lotte Duty Free mall as it is a nightmare and expensive quoted in USD only. But street market is ideal to visit for all classes
Great food. Cheap buys. ,"I recommend some of you to check out the store beside the DeliManjoo. It’s inside the Myeongdong station and offered the cheapest snacks so far (01/03/2019). And try DeliManjoo while you’re at it too! Or maybe if you want bigger and more choices, King Mart will do. I don’t recommend buying at the other places because they were expensive, as per the comparisons we made. We almost went to every shop we can (because it’s cold, and we need to warm up. Kidding.) and you’ll be very surprised to find yourself buying things cheaper as compared to buying it in your country. In our case, it was JPY:KRW which is 1:10.The food was awesome, by the way. The snail was kinda hard to chew, in my opinion though. Some of ‘em don’t know how to speak English though but patience is a virtue. Anyway, I recommend you to ask for the price first before eating "
One of the biggest shopping area but not for Man.,This is crazy..whole street is packed of fashion and skincare shops. U can get any korean brand here. Very crowded. A lot street food but korean doesnt sell cheap street food like other countries have.
Good for shopping & small eats on streets ,"I think good place to shop for Korea cosmetics & eat street foods. Must eat the mochi red bean strawberries, chicken skewers, grilled scallops & baked cheese lobsters, grilled beef steak, etc"
Myeondong Street,"Heaven for the ladies! Street shopping, you can get everything you need here. For skin products enthusiast this street is a must, and your partners can enjoy the foodstreet."
heaven on earth,myeongdong shopping street is truly heaven on earth for people who love shopping. spent the whole day here and still want more!!
Hight street shopping with street food to explore,"Plenty of retail stores to shop for youngsters, local and international brands too. Cosmetics galore and there is a chain store (Olive Young) that house major and smaller brands.Cafes everywhere too."
Cosmetic Shopping Magic with street food!,"I would list in my must-go place. The area has lots of cosmetic shops, clothings, discount food marts and plenty of street food. I came here a tad early at 12 plus in the afternoon. Most of the street vendors hadn’t set up their stalls. The advantage was that a much smaller crowd in popular shops such as the Line Bear; where there’s a giant one-half storey tall bear available for free photo taking. This area also has cat cafe and a good selection of restaurants, coffee cafes. By 4pm, the area was filled with people and most of the streets stall are out in full force. The atmosphere is very different from Hongik University street which is also worthy of a visit! "
Fashion in a budget,"Myeongdong shopping street is a vibrant place where this is a shopping haven for shopaholics. The place is lined with korean clothes and accessories from bags, socks, and souvenirs. Myeongdong is also famous for street foods. Cost is budget friendly in this location. The myeongdong church is also near at this place. It is in the middle seoul that can be access with a taxi or train."
Shopping heaven with yummy streetfood,"You can find anything here, from Korean cosmetics to international clothing chains. But what makes it so fun and special, are all the streetfood stalls that crowd the streets from 3 Pm onwards. Bacon wrapped veggies, fishcakes, shrimpshrewers and chocolate dipped strawberries. It does get crowded so we had to watch our 6&4 yo closely. "
Must see in Seoul ,"This whole street is a taste of what Seoul really is. Full of cosmetics shops and street food, it was one of my favorites during my visit. You really feel in Korea! "
Happy place !!!,This place is the heart of Seoul for us. Shops closes late till 10 pm so after our land tour we can still shop and eat street foods which Myeongdong offers a lot. That’s why I always choose hotel right here in Myeongdong. 
Good shopping areas ,Many varieties of retail outlets and and good food outlets after a tiring shopping. The retail assistant gives good service too. 
good shopping area,the items like the clothes are very nice and a lot of sale. would love to come back again and shop more items
Great atmosphere,"Tonnes of shops for indoor shopping and sales ongoing. Also what makes the place buzzing are the rows of stalls outside selling street food, clothing, etc. "
Must go,Great place to shop and for dining. There are plenty shops for any products. Try the street food stalls. It’s always crowded though. 
Vibrant night life ,"The area was rife with shopping and food and ranged from household names such as Daiso to a huge North Face store. There were sports shops at nearly every turn eg JD sports, Adidas, Nike etc to small stores that sold SGD 1 pair of socks. There are arty stationery shops, massage and nail spas, confectionery stores and lots of shops selling face products from oatmeal face masks to brightening face masks. What was fascinating was the vibrant night life. The area came to life at night with food stores selling butter garlic scallops, beef balls, twisted potato chips, fried pancakes and waffles etc. The list and selection of foods boggled the mind. You just could not eat enough and there was so much interesting foods to try and sample. It was admittedly a little steep in price but it really depended on whether you ordered a chicken fried corn sausage or a buttered lobster. Really worth a visit. "
Great shopping experience!,"Lots of reasonably priced tax-free merchandise (maybe because we went during the holidays) in a wide variety. Street food abounds, too! Must experience!"
Shopping paradise & street food,"This is a great place for Korean beauty products, clothes, sports wear and accessories. The road traders will setup their stalls around late afternoon till 11pm. Lots of street food, it is a must try when in Seoul. All the food are simply delicious. It’s pretty busy here but a few of the roads are closed off to vehicles from 10am to 11pm, so if u have young children just be mindful else the place is pretty safe and tourist friendly. The traders can communicate in simple English and i was kinda surprise that many of them speaks mandarin too. Love this place and look forward to our next visit."
Packed like sardines,"If its cosmetics, clothing and shoes that one is looking for, look no further. We were here on Christmas day and the narrow streets were literally shoulder-to-shoulder walking space. Not enough space to stretch out your hands let alone swing a cat!Cosmetics are cheap (So says my wife). Its worth a walk thru and there are lots of street food vendors around. "
Great atmosphere but crowded! ,"If you enjoy a crowded street market type atmosphere with lots to see, hear and taste, then you should enjoy this area. Lots of stores and stalls, the area is a bit of a maze that you can wander around. Stall prices are ok but not the best (example, Dongdaemon’s Migliore have generally better pricing). Easily accessible by Myeongdong Station. "
Shopping Paradise for Cosmetic Lovers,"If you would like to pick up different type of cosmetic products, this is one stop for all. Do note that the push cart on the streets are retailing more expensive than the underground stalls. You can also pick up a map so that its easy to move around. Can spend easily half a day here. "
All about k-beauty here! ,"Must visit if you love Korean skincare products. They are selling it so much cheaper here, I especially love their facial masks. Less than half the price compared my home country. Good brands such as Laneige, AHC, Iope, Sulwashoo and many many more. Definitely will be back here if I am visiting Seoul again."
Fantastic experience for food and shopping!,"Really enjoyed our visit here and fantastic if you are into shopping. Also so many street vendors so go hungry! A great experience, would recommend. "
Eat and shop till drop ,This is the best place on earth which you can eat and shop from morning till night. This is mainly for tourists so the price are slightly higher. But they have everything you need there. 1 stop place if you only have 1 day in Seoul.
Great area to stay!,We stayed at The Grand Hotel Myeongdong and loved the festive atmosphere right outside the hotel. The shopping and street food were amazing!
Crowded place.,Crowded place. You must know what you want to get from here and stay focus on your objective. A lot of small lane have similar shops. Always ask for sample if you are buying cosmetic items. A lot of street food but too crowded to stay around and eat.
A great shopping street to visit... even if you buy nothing,"The Myeongdong Shopping Street, and all the associated side streets and lane-ways, is a great way to spend at LEAST a couple of hours just walking around this primarily pedestrian shopping area. There is so much to see, well-know (and not so well-known) shops to browse, and a plethora of restaurants, and street food vendors. I just love to sample street food wherever I visit, and I just loved being able to sample some of the very tasty and generally inexpensive street food that was on offer in this shopping precinct.While it is referred to as a shopping street (implying that it is a single street..) it is actually an entire area of primarily pedestrian streets that all seem to ""hang off"" what is generally accepted as the main ""shopping street"".A visit to Seoul is definitely not complete unless you have spent at least a couple of hours wandering around this area. Fortunately for my partner and I, our hotel was only about 10-12 minutes walk away, and so we passed through this area on a number of occasions, and enjoyed the experience every time... daytime OR night-time. Thoroughly recommended."
A must visit for food and shopping ,"Stayed near Myeongdong due to food street and underground/street shopping.A must visit place for tourist and it’s so crowded due to Xmas/festive season.Plenty of money changers around so in case you need to TOP up more Korean wons. Lots of cosmetics, shoes and snacks to buy!Line friend and Kakao are there too"
Awesome and Cheap Buys !,Alot of cosmetic products are avaliable at affordable prices here ! not to mention the numerous dining options avaliable. A great place to visit if you want to buy everything under one roof.
Shopping and eating !!!,"When come to korea, you won’t miss this place especially with teenagers. % tourist place and you have lots of shops for bargain and street food was lining up at night to sell all kinds local street food. Very crowded and you can imagine the night is packed with local and tourist especially at night. Many tourist guides standing around to provide you direction and hence very convenient to walk around . "
Love it! ,A must visit if you come to Seoul. Abundance of street food & also Korean skincare products. I was in heaven! 
Night Market market ,"I love the place. Crowded and busy but beautiful. I love all the bargain products. Easy to talk to the staffs. I also love the street foods and especially the dessert, icecream! We love going during night time."
Very famous and must visit by a tourist,"When I was in Seoul for the business visit, I checked with the local people about places to visit for the shopping, this name was taken by every one. Yes, the place deserve. If you are having sufficient time and you want to enjoy the shopping specially clothes, shoes and anything, you will enjoy this place. Thanks"
Great shopping area,"Great place to shop during winter. Many choices for teenagers on clothing and make up and skin care.At night many street food line up for hungry shopper. But there is lack of toilet nearby for shoppers to use. Also some skincare shop pressured you to buy, i find it annoying."
Very interesting and no wonder it is an Unesco site!,"Almost every well known Korean brand can be found here and Main Street branches into side streets. Lots of F&B outlets - from cafes to restaurants to tea house ...At night, the street is lined with Hawkers selling local snacks like Potato tornado, dumplings, cheese and rice cake on stick, fried chicken, maize, strawberries, bbq seafood etc .... Really safe environment with a police station right in the centre of this area. Clothing, accessories and skincare are easily available. Sports shops like ABC Mart etc"
Interesting place,"Many food stall along the way. Recomended food and lots of variations too. Do please try the egg bread, pork bbq satay, japchae, strawberry coated with mochi, bungeopang, and many more. You could find souveniers too here. They also sell socks, t shirts, and cosmetics. Recomended night market. "
Stock up on K Beauty products here,"Worth a visit for the street food and shopping options. There's a huge Zara, H&M, Uniqlo and MCM store, along with multiple branches of k beauty stores, offering discounts and duty free shopping. "
More Hype Than I Expected,"Maybe it is only because I am a guy but this shopping area was nothing special for me. During the day time it is a bit more leisurely but at night the streets become much more narrow because of the food vendors and it seems busier. I did find that there are multiple shops from the same company located in this center which kind of confused me but what the heck,....I am a guy. I also found out that there was no haggling over prices there. You don't like the price, goes elsewhere. Street food vendors were ok but a bit pricey. Had grilled lobster from one of them that ran around 15,000 won which is between $13 to $15 US. But what the heck is cheese on it for???? I would rather have had butter!"
"Cosmetics, street food, nite market","U can find almost everything here, halal food is also available at this street. Stay near by this street walking distance, stayed at Skypark Central Hotel. We visit this street every nite for food and on my last day I shop for cosmetic and shoes. "
"Lots of night life, food and buzz ",It’s a tourist destination. Lots of street vendors. Food and stuff. Mainly tourists but a good place to soak in the culture and atmosphere. We sent the kids to the arcade while the adults shopped. Arcade’s great. Payable by the hour with some free games for young children. Lots of virtual reality stuff. 
wonderful strolling,I love this shopping district in Seoul where all items you want are available from high end items to mid range goods and products and street foods. Stay at this area for your unlimited exploration of this area. I love Myeongdong very much because of the many coffee shops here and restaurants offering Korean food and other international cuisines. This is a must see when you are in Seoul. Stay at Ibis Hotel Myeongdong because it is very near the area.
Nice shipping street but BEWARE OF PICKPOCKETS ,Nice shopping street and eateries. Beware of PICKPOCKETS. Wife was targeted. Swift and fast when the culprit/s would blend in the crowds. Have all your pockets tightly buttoned. My friend was a victim too last year. 
Combi of Shopping and line delicous streetfoods,"This place amazed for how the crowd can have enough of everything from shopping to enjoying the sumptous streetfood. There a line of street food vendors in every corner of the street selling japchae,ttbeokki , stir fried chicken, galbi, pancakes, seafood skewers, egg muffin and a lot more.We keep ong visiting every night for the duration of our stay to make sure we tried most of it but our time wasn't enough."
Myeongdong Shopping Street,"Before my trip to Myeongdong, I read that it is like the Orchard Road of Singapore. I was there the week before last and found it to be more like Bugis instead. It was not a good time to visit South Korea at this time of the year. The biting cold made street shopping unbearable and undesirable. Anyway, the shops are repetitive and the street food pricey. And although there are many cafes, the quality and vibes did not meet my expectation. The people there are also generally less pleasant.Twosome Place seems to be the local version of Starbucks. Huge place with nice and cozy seating areas but the cakes are not the same as those from Starbucks. The Paris Baguette in South Korea isn’t quite the same as the one here. I had intended to have my daily breakfast at Paris Baguette but ended up spending every morning at Tous les Jours instead. The latter offers a variety of interesting and palatable bread and pastries. A little more pricey though - a bun and a cuppa sets you back about S$8/9.Do make a point to eat their Ginseng Chicken stuffed with rice in chicken broth. I had it at the first and original restaurant near City Hall Station Exit 10.As for the touted Korean Fried Chicken or Chimaek, I tried Kyochon (Sinchon) and Twotwo Chicken (Myeongdong). I must say I prefer Kyochon. It was good and slightly less pricey than Twotwo. The chicken are fresher too. For ladies, it’s probably a haven for all sorts of mostly low to mid range beauty and skin care products. I feel that Myeongdong is a little overhyped but if you enjoy the vibes of bright lights, and the sound and sight of being in the crowd then you’d probably like this place. As for me, just once is sufficient. If you have been to Japan, then you might want to manage your expectation a little just so that you will be able to see Korea in a more positive light. What surprised me was that, other than beauty products and clothings, things and especialy food, including street food, generally cost more than those in Japan. "
Bustling streets !,Lots of shopping and Food streets with many stalls. lots of tourists and locals. Can find almost everything there. Open till 10+ and absolutely loved if 
Wow! just wow!,"I spent so much money there .. the street food in the evening was amazing and the shops came alive at night, it was like two different places during the day it's a normal town .. a fair few people going about their day. . And night/evening it becomes a hustle and bustling place with thousands descending on the streets, it was amazing to be there while the Christmas lights were lit. Truely is a have to be there to understand the two different faces of seoul. Without a doubt I'm going back very soon"
Great,"Years has past since my last visit in 2014 & before that but Myeongdong still remain a great attraction, great shopping street & a local food street at nite, full of tourists full of noise full of ambience...Like best still the food stalls at nite, u will definitely find something nice. Tried quite a few - Korean fish cake, grill prawn, fruit juice, chestnut, Gimbap etc lots of varieties. It's freezing in Dec so the food stalls really warm up your tummy!Great to stay near Myeongdong, so convenient to subway, airport shuttle bus stop, bakery for breakfast, restaurants, departmemt store (run out of time to revisit) ....& Rolling Pin, found this nice bakery near to exit 5 or 6 of Euljiro 1 station on way to hotel, it's quietly at a corner. We had our breakfast there every morning after we found it, the bread is so nice, great coffee & ambience! If u have limited time in Seoul & want to experience nite shopping street with local food stalls, Myeongdong is the place!"
Well worth a visit if you are in Seoul,"This place appears to be a “must visit”. There are many stores here selling clothing, etc. There are also many eateries and street food in the evening. The place is so vibrant and crowded with both locals and tourists. Well worth a visit if you are in Seoul. "
Butter prawns!!,"Had the absolute best buttered prawns here. Don't be fooled by the street market appearance. Some of the food sold by the stalls here can even qualify for a Michelin star! So much variety from seafood, to pancakes, to traditional Korean food. Lots of cheap, imitation clothes too."
Tranforms in evening,"I would recommend visiting this street towards the evening when the streets get closed to vehicular traffic and instead get lined up with apparel, accessories, souvenir shops and food stalls serving myriad Korean dishes from seafood to sugary savoury delights.For those of you who want to haggle on prices, good luck with that since the shopkeepers here have a union of sorts where they don't charge any less than the price marked. To that end, the prices here are already very competitive and hence bargaining isn't really needed. For those of you who would still love to bargain, should head to the nearby Myeong-dong Underground Shopping center where the shopkeepers are more willing for some bargaining.Expert Tip: For beating harsh Seoul winter weather, going Underground will be a much more comfortable stroll in the endless matrix of alleys."
Vacation ,"This is a must visit place in Korea. There are lots of choices of cosmetics for you to choose from. But too many tourists means lack of attention from the staff and they can be rude at times. It is a also a good place to shop for sports shoes. The prices are better than back home in Singapore.There is a variety of street food if you get hungry after shopping. I won’t recommend you to cab home as we realized that the taxis don’t go by meter in the night. Best is to travel by train, cheap and easy. "
"Love, love, love the Sights and Sounds of Myeongdong Shopping Street","Our hotel was just at the end of the Myeongdong shopping street, which was PERFECT for a nightly stroll through all the stalls and snacking. Every night we selected our favorite delicious Korean treats for a late-night snack. Favorite Snacks:* Korean pancake with honey and cinnamon inside..mmmm...* Kimchee dumplings* Lobster (Pricey at USD$15, but so worth it!)* Shrimp and butter....yum* Egg on bread (bread was more like cornbread. simple snack)* Spiral potatoesIf you like congee, you've got to try the Congee House at the end of the street (31 Myeongdong 8ga-gil, Chungmuro 2(i)-ga, Jung-gu, Seoul,) The abalone congee is to die for! We ordered the ""take out"" and it was packaged so well."
"Shopping, eating street foods.","If you wanna try Korean style street foods, visit here.Clean and interesting.Also, bunch of fast fashion brands is here."
Shopping heaven,"You can get everything here. Food, souvenir, beauty product even friends. It's a must go places you should go when you visit Seoul. Try the street food. Some are quite expensive but it's a once in a lifetime try."
Ultimate Shopping Street,"MSS has got everything you need covered, from cosmetics to street food. The vibe during the day and night are definitely different. I spent the whole day here and still haven't finished shopping (haha). The guides wearing red are located at the entrance of the shopping street so do sought out their help. Sock shopping is best done in Myeongdong. In my experience, exchange rate is highest in Myeongdong, particularly the one inside Migliore."
Let go your money....Shopping and eating,"I stay at Moons Hostel, 8 minutes to Myeongdong shopping area. here you can eat halal food at the street and restaurant named Busan and kampungku (Malaysian Rest). Beauty products everywhere cheap and many mask gifts if you buy. And also socks with many designs with 1000won. If you can't find places you can ask Tourist person there. At Ishadong sell key chain, magnet and handmade bags inside and outside the building. Please buy wood spoons and others made from original wood and beautiful. At Namdaemon market sell brooch, shirts with comfortable price but I think closed 5.30. Please book on line to Nami Island and Everland, it's cheap. Beautiful area for family and couple."
Shopping Street,"If you are looking to spend your hearts out, come to myeondong street to shop. Big brands boutiques on sales which can go as low as 70%."
" Boon for women, but possibly a bane for the less metrosexual men","Huge shopping area with shops selling beauty products and fashion stuff. Generally beauty products are cheaper than back home. Also a wide variety of local Korean products that women (and some men) just love to get their hands on. Be prepared for lots of walking with little chances for sitting unless u are having a meal in one of those many restaurants dotted around the place.There's also many street food stall, but mind you, they are franchised, so much repetition.Access to the place mainly via Myeongdong station. Close proximity to Shinsaegae Departmental Store and Lotte Departmental Store."
SHOPPING!!!!,Love love love Myeongdong. You can go crazy shopping here haha so much good food and cosmetics!! Must try: - Aori Ramen- Kang Ho Dong Baekjeong - BHC Chicken Must go: - SPAO - All the cosmetic shops (hahaha)
The youth vibe is strong here :),"Just walking around is fun. Of course, shopping and eating makes it even more fun!I like Myung In Mandoo, because I can sit down to eat in peace at street food prices."
Anything you want.,"Cosmetics valley.Foods be it street foods, restaurants or just a cafe's. Looking for Korean Seaweed, they have KMart."
Vacation in Seoul,"The place is great for shopping. Big discounts are offered by various merchants. Street foods are delicious, but a little bit expensive. If it is your first time to Myeongdong, make sure that you bring a map with you. Same business establishments appear in different streets. There is no public toilet with in the area. You have to enter in a coffee shop or dine just to use their toilet. Definitely this will cost you."
Amazing food. Cosmetic shopping. Restaurants,"Walking along Myeong-dong Street, the first thing we would notice is the food stalls selling mouthwatering street food. We went there on a weekend and there were lots of people. But, as a family with kids (we were even using a stroller), we were able to maneuver easily. We tried almost all the food they sold. And they all tasted good! Just for you to have an ideo of how much the food are, here are the food prices i remember: takoyaki with baby octopus is 5,000 won, vegetable omelette is 3,000 won, lobster with cheese is 15,000 won, and their soft serve ice cream is 2,000 won . Most food are priced at 3,000 won to 6,000 won each. The lobster is expectedly expensive. There are cosmetic shops at the side of the street. Some of them give free face masks to entice you to check out their shop and buy from them. There are also stalls selling coats, souvenirs, socks, gloves, etc. "
Exciting and Fascinating,A Seoul must-do! So many street vendors selling clothes and food. Surrounded by several shops and cafes. So much yummy stuff you'll want to try so go with an empty stomach! it gets very busy. Also amazing at night time when it is covered in light
visit once,"the first time was great, all the food seemed tantalizing and yummy, shops all around abound with goods, as well as the ubiquitous korean beauty products.the second time, we explored more of the alleyways connected with the main shopping row, thinking we might discover something new, did not happen. food stalls sell basically more of the same: hotdog with batter, fish cake, skewers, cheese lobster, fruit juices, milk tea, crepe, twisted potato, strawberry chocolates, egg bread, and cheese clam.even the stores are repetitive: ABC Mart, Innisfree, Oliver Young, Lesmore... it got stale and boring pretty fast.there are a few gems like Mother's Touch which sells mainly fried chicken and maaan so goooood. they're located on the 5th floor of a secluded building which you will miss if you stick to the middle of the road.basically it's one big tourist trap. visit it once just so you can say you've visited. come back if you forgot something, other than that, it's an expensive and crowded place."
All Global Stores and shoppers paradise ,Myeongdong Shopping street is very easily accessible from City Hall as well as my train. There are several subway entrances to the main street. The Subway is well marked in English.Besides the usual shopping some of my recommendations are as under: 1. Visit this Street during the weekends - it's phenomenal 2. Don't just check out the shops at the ground level but also look out for good restaurants and shops on Level 1 & 23. Sample all the street food available on the street especially the local bun and egg baked and the prawns cooked in tempura.4. They have a huge contact lens market with plethora of color options.Hint: jus go empty handed as you can really shop a lot.
Bursting Modern Korean Culture from Souvenirs to foods!,"Myeong to the Dong! Wow! The single word that could describe this place - wow. From the signage on the road which marks the entrance of the shopping area I was already trapped in its ambiance. I've read and watched a lot of blogs and vlogs about Myeongdong before coming to Korea. So seeing it in actual is really something. Street foods lined both sides of the road along with different stalls of souvenir items, shoes, socks, chestnuts and all sort of things. Shopping buildings and restaurants are also everywhere. It seems like a never ending stretch because it extends horizontally and vertically. I really loved shopping for souvenirs there because its cheap! Also the selection of food is really nice from hotteok to gyeranpang to odeng. Along with friend chicken with tteok etc.It's truly a heaven for foodies and shoppers. Great place to visit!"
Very crowded and things are more expensive,"Very crowded during day or night. Many store selling cosmetics and beauty products. Street foods are more expensive compare to Hongdae, dongdaemun and namdaemun. Overall a very good experience to spend sometime here."
Tour trip,Quite a huge shopping street. Just grab anything you like because the street vendors are just selling the same thing. Only extra precaution as street is super crowded
Great Place for street food and shopping,"This is a very famous shopping street, great varieties of street food, mouth watering food, shops for great shopping experience"
Street of shopping & eating ,"I heard a lot about Myeongdong before my trip, not knowing what to expect until I visied the place for the first time. Lots of shops, especially skin care products. The pricing is cheaper than my country. Must buy facial masks, very cheap. This place turns alive in the evening when the people pushes out the street cart and it becomes food street. Tasted a few, not bad but not fantastic. Good for experience but I won't eat again. It is a tourist place."
Good shopping spot for Korean skin care and novelties,"Korea is known for their sheet masks and skin care products, that are part of the famous Korean 10-step skin care program. You can find all major brands here and then some - including Innisfree, Etude House, TonyMoly, etc. Try to visit the Line Friends store with the famous photo opportunity with their giant bear. There is also a muti-story Daiso (kind of like a Korean dollar store, but not everything is a ""dollar"") and Lotte Store (department store).Definitely try the street food for some fun food options. Korea is also known for their character socks (like super hero socks, Snoopy, Mickey Mouse, etc.) that are sold for about $1-3 USD (or about 1,000-3,000 Korean won).This a good place to wander around for a half or full day. Also a good place for some Korean souvenirs. "
Language Problem,The price moderate. Difficult to communicate. Crowded at night but a lot of things we can see and buy. The environment nice and clean.
Nice place to eat and shop,Myeongdong is a very busy area. Good place to eat and shop. It’s very crowded but it’s worth a trip. 
Packed shopping & Street food spot,I walked around the area with a friend on a Friday night. There are lots of food stalls and restaurants in the area as well as many shops of different kinds - even underground shopping too. There are some bars as well but definitely more known for its food and shopping.
Having a gander ....,"A buzz of activity - with loads of food stalls, shops and restaurants. Also seemingly more organised than Taipei’s night markets and better spaced out - ie you still have some personal space. Depending on what you are looking for this could either be a treasure trove of noises/smells/shopping/people watching or it could be boring. I dare say that if it’s the latter you wouldn’t be minded to venture to this district. I would hesitate to call it a shopping street as that sort of implies a single street - it’s not - It’s a sizeable shopping district. "
Exciting night market!,Walking along the streets during the winter nights among the many street vendors selling different delicacies invokes excitement. The market is different fr the ones in SG. Beauty and branded sports shops and cafes lining up the streets adds on to the exciting atmosphere. There’s something foreveryone!
Average,"Even though it's a long street, the shops are repeated so essentially it's just a really short stretch of shops. Mostly beauty and make up products. Their main targets seem to be Chinese tourists, and they sell things in bulk (e.g. 80 face mask sheets). Some decent street food. "
KR street food,"Ranging from 3000Won to 8, this street is the ultimate experience on street food. Too bad no blood sausage or other traditional stuff seen in KD dramas but I think this is the best place to start. Foreigner friendly and accessible.Toilet is in one of the malls unless you are dining in a restaurant... clean but a bit out of the way, so try not to drink too much :)"
Korean Holiday,"Myeong-dong is Seoul’s shopping mecca and is a must-see for tourists, but it is not just a shopping destination; Myeong-dong is also a hub of commerce, banking and culture with a daytime population of 1.5-2 million. For shoppers there is a mixture of street stalls and retail outlets selling everything from high fashion to casual attire, as well as many Korean cosmetics stores offering high-quality products at competitive prices. Myeong-dong is very popular with international visitors and fills with Japanese and Chinese tourists during the holiday period known as “Golden Week” which takes place in spring and is called golden week due to the week-long holiday period that takes place in Japan and China. Part of Myeong-dong’s popularity stems from relatively affordable prices here, especially compared to the other shopping meccas of Apgujeong-dong and Cheongdam-dong."
Street food! Shopping! Restaurants!,I think there is full of review here! I am glad I stay here and we enjoy very much! Everything you need is just walking distance. Something to take note is that Korea subway it's just not very kids friendly if you have a stroller. Will be a nightmare for you! 
Super bargain and freebies! ,Korean shopping at Myeongdong is a totally different experience than that of other cities! The Koreans are very accomodating and friendly and they give so many freebies when you purchase an item. Most of the items are negotiable so its good! And they are very honest in doing tax refund which is “unheard of” in some countries! A great experience for sure!! 
Our favourite shopping area in Seoul,"Firstly the underground station Myeongdong houses a huge shopping mall.The area is filled with a huge assortment of food shops, shops selling clothes, cosmetics and to numerous things to list.Great street food and the whole area just buzzes with excitement.Restaurants and entertainment are plentiful.A must on your list of places to see."
Everthing you need is all at Myeongdong...,Everthing you need is at Myeongdong... I was staying at Hotel Price which just across the street. I suggest you spend at least 2 trip there( I went Myeongdong for 3 night straight) as the 1st Trip...check price before buy...next trip buy all you can carry.
Super ,"Place full of cosmetic products. Every corner, the same brand, street food is all around. Great to walk around even one is not buying. "
Late night market,It is safe with easy access by train or cab.Lots of shops selling the famous Korean masks.Stick with the brand Innisfree.Lot of food carts around. Not so good for vegetarians.Spoken English is limited.Good bars too.
Be overwhelmed.,"This place offers various stores. A lot of beauty shops most especially. Offers a variety of street food! My fave part, just wish there were trash cans cuz so many people would leave there trash. So many people, if you're claustrophobic and you just hate crowds, not a place for you. But if you love shopping and food, definitely worth it! Lots of cafes to getaway from the crowd from time to time when shopping."
Shop till you drop!,"Needless to say, Meyongdong is a shopper's heaven. Husband and I did, what's called a 'K-haul' from here and Hongdae. Best beauty brands have multiple outlets. We spent a lot of time at Olive Young, a drug store where you can find most brands! Innisfree, Cosrx (at Aland), Tony Moly, Etude House, Missha, The Face Shop are among the countless beauty brands we shopped for.We got there early the first time and spent almost the whole day, taking food and drink breaks and dropping shopping bags to our Airbnb which was only one station away. The area starts to get alive only after 6pm though. Lot's of vendors come out on the streets and the crowd starts to get thicker. A lot of shops don't open till 10 am so no point getting here too early."
"A Fun Place To Visit, Especially At Night","Myeongdong is actually a district or a series of streets rather than only one. It attracts residents and visitors because of the shops, upscale department stores, restaurants, amazing street-food carts at night, underground malls and more. I recently stayed for 10 days at a hotel in the area and really enjoyed the location because of the activity.The district has two main streets, one that starts at the Myeongdong subway station and the other at Lotte Department Store by the Euljiro 1 subway stop, exit 6. Though shops offer everything from clothing to jewelry, Korean cosmetics and beauty creams seem to predominate with hawkers sometimes standing outside, offering free samples to entice passersby to enter. Side streets seem to go every which way, so it is easy to get lost. When that happened to me, I would look for two people in red uniforms. These signify men and women available to answer questions and give directions. At least one member of the pair speaks English. There are also tourist information offices around, where employees speak English, Japanese, Chinese and Korean.When night falls, neon signs brighten the streets and food carts appear. Crowds descend on the area and walking almost comes to a standstill. Food items for sale include noodles, freshly squeezed pomegranate juice, kimchi pancakes, lobster, dumplings and the list goes on. Hundreds of people stand there and eat in the street. For those not into shopping, consider coming here at night to sample the food."
Good place to buy cosmetic and skin care,"Great shopping place for tourists to get cosmetics and skin care products. Same street with various stores selling same brand same product but the promotional package might offer different things, take your time to explore."
Vacation,Myeongdong definitely a must do. Clothing and food really affordable and the atmosphere is fabulous anything you want you can get.
Overpriced from street food to idols merchandise.,"For me, I will not buy or eat at Myeongdong shopping street, I rather walk a few hundred metres away to Namdaemun Market to shop and eat.The different of the prices are 2000-3000 won for eating in a shop.And you can still bargain for shoes,clothing and idols merchandise stuffs here at Namdaemun.But of course if you want branded things you should go to Myeongdong"
Overpriced streetfood,"The streetfood is definitely overpriced. And the stalls are repeated, so you see different people selling similar food items in the whole stretch. With the amount of money we spent on streetfood, we could have had a decent meal in a proper restaurant."
Ready for street food,Myeongdong is not just a shopping area for beauty products but known for its street food. We taste various street food at pricey amount. Some store give free face mask but others if you dnt purchase any in their store they will get again the face mask
night life,this place is noisy and busy and colourful at night. Hawkers set up portable carts on the pedestrianized street. Lots of street snacks but prices are ridiculous. 6500W for a juiced promegranate! 25000W for a pack of strawberries. 
Organized chaos,"Definitely an active shopping experience, not for agorophobics. Shops of all kinds and sizes are side by side on narrow streets with colorful sings and throngs of people. Clothes, cosmetics, knick knacks, food, brand names and unknown brands are on display. "
Nice streetfood and shopping experience,"Nice place. Interesting experience and good street food. Went for the second time in 2018, first in 2017. "
Lively and fun,"Myeongdong shopping street is fun, lively and bursting with energy. There are all kinds of shops, department stores and restaurants. There is also a great variety of street food. Several of the local cosmetic shops offer a free sample face mask if you come into the store and browse. There are free concerts sometimes. I happened to see two very different but good concerts on two separate occasions. "
Biggest Shopping District in South Korea,"This is the biggest shopping district in South Korea. Things are not that cheap so think twice before buying.Easily accessible, lots of street food and restaurants too."
Very crowded with the same stores over and over again.,"First of all, I know it’d be crowded cause it’s a tourist area, which isn’t the issue. The problem I had mainly was the entire shopping street was just the same stores over and over again spread out. Like 6 Tony Moly, Etude House, Clio, etc makeup brands store just scattered throughout the street. So it’s not like the entire street is different, it’s like the same stores. Kind of overrated. "
Lots of food and shopping around,"It's a place that everyone comes to when visiting Seoul. Long and parralel streets of hawker food and clothes for shopping. Many shopping malls around, too. Its very crowded with tourists, both locals and abroad. You can just eat and eat, buy and buy. It's just so tiring. Branded stuff are found in those branded shopping malls, foreign tourists able to get tax-refund when shopping."
Shopping Paradis,"Who will miss this place? Lots of street foods, cosmetics and clothes. Not forgetting, there are cafes and is right above the subway!"
Walk Shop Eat Photos (Wasep),"This place just shouts BUY ME. The streets are literally lined with shops! All the cosmetics, clothes, and great food! What's more, there are guides posted in specific areas where you can ask questions. We asked what food would be good to eat and what restaurant. They give you a map which is veeeery helpful too."
Shopping sensation,"Tons of shop selling skin care product, clothes and restaurant. Street food cart normally start operating on late afternoon. The place can get real crowded especially at night and weekend. One stop paradise for those who likes to shop and eat."
Beauty product Heaven for Man and Ladies,"Be ready to be accosted by free sample giving shop assistants and be ready to be wowed by all the products on offer. Before you buy anything, do check out this shop Baviphat, they have good discounts for some of the popular brands. Sometimes even 50%, I know, amazing right? Obviously I bought a lot :)"
Cosmetic Heaven,"Cosmetic Heaven. This is the phrase to describe it. You will be spoilt with plenty of cosmetic products such as facial cream, facial masks and so on. There are lots of promoters offering discounts on their products. At the end of the day, it is more of a question of preference and good bargain that will influence your spending. There are also lots of other shops around such as fashion boutiques, sports boutiques such as Nike, Adidas, New Balance, etc. Overall, the place to be when you are in Seoul."
My Myeongdong Experience,"Myeongdong was the first place we went immediately after we checked-in from our accommodation, as it was so popular Seoul destination among tourists. Since it was a Friday, there were many tourists and there were lines of different street foods which are yumny and appetizing. Hence, we tried some of those and they were delicious but a little pricey compared to some delicious street foods we have here in the Phil. Shopping is fun as there were great items specially beauty and skin care products, where stores give lots of samples when you purchase. Tourists get to enjoy tax refund when you present your passport. Restaurants are all over, hence you can't go hungry while shopping. We had so much fun and enjoyable experience in Myeongdong when we splurged some money we saved for our Seoul trip. It's a happy place which we would definitely go back to in Seoul."
Highly Recomended,"Thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Great food, great value $$ shopping, fanastic beautiful autum scenery and safe environmental local exploration.. "
Meandering through Myeongdong,"Myeongdong is one of Seoul’s main shopping and tourism districts – so as you walk around, you’ll see many makeup stores, clothing stores, coffee shops, and restaurants.As night begins to draw closer, people will begin setting up food stalls, so I highly recommend you stay to experience the food (I had my first Korean sweet potato at one of these food stalls! GOOD LORDY LORD WAS IT EVER DELICIOUS!)."
Huge ,Now this place takes markets to a different level it is spread out over a few blocks and it’s has just about everything from fresh produce to led lighting and some great food stalls try the mungbean fritters their great and you don’t get hassled their are also information people here and around certain parts of the city dressed up in red outfits to help you 
Nice shopping with eats,"Was there almost everyday on all of our stay in Seoul for past 8days, really lively shopping streets and like never ending fun and excitment. altho most shop selling same stuff, like cosmetic and accessories, the other street vendor does provide another revenue of excitment. theres a middle lane that sells food, of all kinds, but personally felt the price was steeper than other place, so we just try soe on our first day, like cheese lobster, garlic prawns (fav), pancakes, promogrenate drink, mixed friut drink, 21cm ice cream etc. but the most interesting is the small lane after that eat street that turns into another lane of chicken & beer joints, that feature 5-6 joint in one lane, plus DTF and 2 other western cafe, so we chose 1 on each day, do try out the 678 chicken, BHC and TwoTwo. oh and dun be afraid to que, coz its fast going."
Packed and Lively Street,"Myeongdong must be the busiest street I have ever visited in Seoul. There were so many tourists and locals. Eating your street food might be quite a challenge especially with a stroller in tow because there's almost nowhere to stop.There are many shops, street food stalls, restaurants. It is good to sample the food here but the prices are more expensive than in Hongik or in Ehwa."
Much the same,"If you have been to one market in Korea you have been to them all. Don't get me wrong it is fun and a wonderful experience, however, they are all much the same. A ton of people, food, and your typical carts. The food is wonderful and you can get some good prices on things."
Great food(street and gourmet) and shopping!,So I went to myeongdong area with a friend to shop fall/winter clothes!! We took the subway which is a very fast way to get to myeongdong! Also uljiro1ga station leads you here! We went around 3 pm on a Sunday and had brunch at myeongdong goya!! Michelin guide dumpling place!! Not expensive which was good!! The stores were a bit crowded but it was not bad. Also the street food is kind of expensive and they only accept cash so that was not very convenient. Almost all stores’ staff speak English Chinese and Japanese which is convenient for tourists!!
A MUST PLACE TO GO,Shop till you drop here. A lot can be shop here. From cheap to expensive range. A must visit for travellers
"Shop, eat, sleep","A few tourist attractions are easily accessible from Myeongdong. There’s also the convenience of the subway and the airport bus. If you are into K-beauty, this is the place to shop for beauty products. There’s the Night market, plenty of street food, restaurants and cafes’ and shops.Lotte and Shinsegae are two major shopping / dept stores. The food court at Lotte is great!"
Bussy Street with lots of shop,I enjoy staying in Myeongdong. Hang out and try lots of food along the walk.My friends said that you can get lots of sample of beauty product when you walk in Myeongdong Street . Actually it is not really true.The way they gave you their product promotion is like not sincere. They ask you to enter the shop not just giving away the product to try. I dont really like the way . I dont really need the beauty product anyway heehehehehhe.
Shopping,"This is every woman's paradise when it comes to make up and beauty product shops and clothing as well. Every where you turn there is a shop for you. Lets not forget the street food, you must try all they have to offer. From potato tornado to baked cheesy scallops. Every travellers must visit in Korea"
A Bustling Place,"Shops in this area cater to all genders and opens late into the night. From cosmetics, clothings to sportswear, from locals to intl brands. There is a food street full of mouth watering seafood and local food. Many good coffee shops and local restaurants around. The underground shopping is the best among all. For high end shopping one can go to Lotte and New World duty free. Service there was good and can get tax refund on the spot. This place is a must to visit when in Seoul."
A little piece of heaven,"One can find all types of cosmetics here as well as tonnes of local restaurants, cafes and a few western restaurants. There are also street food stalls mainly open at night."
Get ready to eat & shop!,Get your stomach ready for all the street food you can eat! Not only that but you can shop for everything you want and more!
Visited Myeongdong with my friend,"Few months ago, I went Myeongdong with my Korean friend. We went Myeongdong fr bought some products and eat delicious food. In Myeongdong, there were so many kinds of street food such as chesses, Grilled Lobster with Butter, and juice. Also, there were so many cosmetics stores. In there, we can saw alomst kinds of cosmetics stores, restaurants or clothing stores. If you want to buy something during stay in Myeongdong, you can buy it immediately. Howvere the one thing that I was sad was there are too many people to do sometimg. For example, if you want some restaurent which is famous, you have to wait or reservation. Except this one thing, Myeongdong was the one of the best place that I played."
Go in the evening,"It’s mad busy with lots of street food. I’m not into shopping, but it was fun just to soak up the atmosphere - and then escape as it was soooo busy."
Myeongdong Shopping Street,This area is food and shopping haven. Besides the street foods there are also lots of cafes and restaurants around. Lots of different brands of cosmetics to choose from. Each stores have their own ways to lure people inside to do some shopping in one way or another. Lots of cosmetic brands have more than one outlets. it seems like they are all over the place. Most tourist never miss this place when visiting Seoul. It's like a must visit place when you are in the area. Just bring lots of cash because it's hard to resist the aroma of foods.
Foods and Shopping,The street that famous that you can read it up everywhere introduction Seoul. A must visit for all your cosmetic products and a food haven by night. One visit might not be enough for some. 
"bright lights , large crowds cheap eats and fun street","myeongdong was only 10 min walk from my hotel , so i went there immidiately after chk in . it is super busy !! large crowds, neon lights and so many food places and bars to choose from . its great just for people watch and carnival atmosphere. i had dinner in a korean restaurant chicken galbi only $6 us so cheap and so good , they cook the food right in front of you chicken, rice , and kimchi . i went back there every night to hang around and eat , its good for shopping and also many money changers with reasonable rates !do not miss when in seoul ! "
Cosmetics Paradise and Street Food Heaven,"If you love cosmetics, then this is paradise for you. But what if you don't care about cosmetics? The street food will come to your rescue. The food stalls start setting up as early as 2pm. Either way, cosmetics or street food, be prepared to shell out a lot of money. Cosmetics are cheaper here but you will be tempted to buy everything that the salesladies offer to you. The top of my hand where they slather samples of the moisturizers, swatches of makeup, actually misses all the attention it got there. As to the street food, you think you're getting a bargain just having it for dinner. But before you know it, you've bought from 5 stalls and spent 30,000 won trying everything out. Good luck if your accommodation is in this area. You'll be broke by the middle of the week. Thank goodness I can charge the cosmetics to my credit card."
First time in Seoul!,Full of street food and cosmetic shops! Conveniently located near train stations. Vibrant and bustling!
Shopping,We stopped here after Insa-dong and it was much busier but the shopping did not disappoint. Some of the souvenirs are a little more expensive than Insa-dong but a lot is comparable. This place gets pretty busy with cars driving through crowds of people. The street food is amazing! Definitely worth stopping to!
Awesome place at night,"Went here twice while i was in Seoul, street food heaven, plenty of sweets, seafood, meats and baked good available. surrounded by cosmetic shops and shopping centres. watch out though some hawkers use the halal sign without even knowing what halal is. but plenty of choice, defo worth a visit when in Seoul."
Good for a one off visit,Our hotel was about 1km so we walked easily to this location. Went twice in 10 days. We felt that one walk through was adequate.
Interesting street food and shopping experience..,"Good experience, haggle well. Nice street food. Quite a lot of interesting stuff being sold by hawkers."
Street Food and Shopping Heaven,"Street food! Grilled squid, prawn and lobster, baked chesee, egg bun, steamed corn and sweet potato, tteokbokki, steak, tshirt, shocks, shoes, beauty products, what else you're looking for? just name it!Restaurants is all over the corner, international brand and local just right at the same area!Strolling around this area and you will find anything and you'll never get bored! Well this is truly tourists area where you'll be happy to get lost here just make sure you empty your stomach and bring the cash!"
Enjoyable Shopping Experience,Nobody does street shopping better than Asia and the Myeongdong was not exception. And the big plus is that the shop owners and shoppers are very considerate (with the exception of a few ugly tourists). And at night the place really lights up - don’t miss the experience.
Exciting street filled with food and shopping,"Fun area to take a stroll in the evening. Everything from high-end shops to streetcar boutiques. In addition, a nice variety of delicious street food at low prices. Definitely worth stopping by if you’re in the area."
Awesome selection of Korean street food!,Spend an evening walking down Myeongdong Shopping Street. Eat and shop. Very creative and tasty food selection. Must visit when in Seoul. 
Myeondong food street,The best of korean street food can be found just as you stroll around the streets of myeondong shopping market at night.
Lots of street food,"I love the street food. Its yummy and cheap, well cheaper than restaurant food. Lots of shopping also."
Loving Myeong-dong!,A tourist friendly shopping street at the heart of Seoul. Glad that they have this to tour around for free. Free cosmetics is a must!
Beauty products and street food,Plenty of shopping and eating. I went with the rose gelato and fried shrimp. Also purchased a few beauty products (without skin whiteners). A few hours seems enough.
Superb Night Market!,"If you happened to visit Seoul, this is a must visit to those seeking local snacks, beauty stuffs like masker, lotion, etc or looking for the best specialty coffee in the country. This is a must visit place."
"Shop for your skincare and make up here, but not for street food","This street is full of beauty product. You can find korean cosmetic product in this street. And sometimes they offered you free sheet mask if you enter the shop even if you end up don't buy anything. For the street food, there're a lot of it. But beware, it's so expensive. For the lobster with cheese it will cost you 15.000Won, for an octopus satay it will cost you 10.000Won etc"
Shopping spree,The best place you should go if you looking to buy cosmetic and enjoying the Seoul best cosmetic company.
Must Visit,"A must visit place. The whole Myeongdong area is huge. There are boutique shops, restaurants, coffee shops, dessert places and more in the whole area!"
Beauty product shopping paradise!,"It is the highlight of my trip to S Korea. It has all the popular beauty product stores on the street. Great selections. Also has a lot ,a lot of. delicious food on the street. A must visit place if you are travelling to S Korea. I will definitely go back again."
Plenty of streetfood,"Plenty of streetfood, some are a bit more expensive than stalls you find near the university precincts. "
Busy street with lots of shopping,"We came here to visit the big UNIQLO store, which was great. There are heaps of other shopping options. There's a subway station right in the heart of the area, lots of street food and good pedestrian areas, so it's certainly a shoppers paradise. We came at about midday and it wasn't crowded yet."
Shopping shopping shopping ,Perfect place to shop till you drop. You will find everything you need here within the several blocks of stores and restaurants.
It is an exciting experience,"To walk in the evening for this place is to find a living city site, calm people, food of all types and open stores for hours until late at night."
Shut Up,Just a busy high street except though it appears pedestrian friendly it's not it's down right dangerous. You will not hear the traffic be it truck or moped because of music blaring away from outside the shops and people trying to get you into them. It's difficult to know whether you are being man handled into a store or rescued from a speeding car behind you. Good luck.
Shopping heaven ,"Beware for ladies! There's so much of skincare products and masks for you girls to dive in. You can go broke by just spending 1 or 2 nights at this area. Of course, besides skincare, there's a lot more retails in this area. Various of food choices to choose from; restaurants or street food. "
Amazing shopping street,We went here specifically to go moderate price Korean cosmetic shopping. There are many shops with good prices. The thing that surprised me most is all of the street food and it all looked amazing.Very safe area
Busy Shopping street,"Myeongdong is a bustling and colorful shopping street. You will find a lot of local brands like Top 10, Innis free and other cosmetic stores. Big brands like Zara, Adidas and Nike stores are also there. Street food is common in the area and a lot of restaurants can be found in the area as well. Worth your while to go around the this area."
A great little area,"Well worth visiting as there are loads of shops should you ever need to buy anything. Lots of food stalls around to have a nibble whilst walking. Very interesting street, well worth spending a few hours here."
Crowded shops along the entire street,Call it the main cosmetics street of Seoul with all kinds of brands lining the street. It was too crowded so it was not really my type of area.
paradise for shopping...heaven of korean cosmetics world...,"As i m a boy i m not interested in cosmetics but it's a good place to buy cosmetics coz so cheap in wholesale price...But as a street food lover,let's say it's a paradise... I really love this place for street foods... Good place to do window shopping as well... Anyway u should visit there..."
Face mask!,Get off at Myeong-dong Station exit 6 and you can start shopping. There’re Korean brand beauty shops every 5 steps so you know one of the items you must get is face mask and make up. Besides that there are brand and cheaper stores selling clothes and few shops selling Korean snacks - great for souvenirs. Restaurants are plenty too. Tourist assistants are walking around to assist.
Food trip were Great ,just went their for street food trip and dog cafe ... it was nice though walking around the street ... food were really good and affordable... 
The food is why you go,"There are lots of stores, clothes, cosmetics, shoes, but the real appeal is the food carts.Ranging from cheap ddobbki to real lobster tails there is something for every price range and food preference. Dont like street food, there are plenty of restaurants from K-bbq to McDonalds"
cosmetic center and more,"myeong dong street is a place that you must visit to see and buy the cosmetic requirements ( face masks/ shampoos/ skin care creams) you will find a lot of shops along the street. also there are a lot of clothing shops (brands) near the Main Street. the street design and shops location with the music surrounded will let you stay there forever. you can reach this location by using the bus to myeong dong station or you can use the metro. recommended time to visit (before sunset). time needed there 2 house for singles, 4 hours for married."
Great street food ,"Near to myeong dong train station. Always fill with people, tourists and locals. Many different street food available. Together with many cosmetics shops nearby. Great place to kill time. "
Delicious street food,"A must visit street for tourist. Great food variety but pricey in some stalls. Must try the Egg bun, lobster roll, and cheese scallops!"
Nice place,Super nice place.. after 5lots of streetfood... made it super crowded sometimes.But nice experience overall 
Cosmetics everywhere,"This shopping area is quite big but definitely can be covered within a couple of hours. There are many restaurants throughout but they are more hidden within alleys or up the stairwells. There are many repeats of the same stores over and over again, so I’m not too sure if it’s necessary to cover the whole area for some. At about 5-6pm, food stall vendor will line the Main Street. The food is excellent and there’s a huge variety, but it is slightly overpriced for certain items."
Fantastic ,"Our hotel was just at the end of this street, Amazing food and stalls. So much variety you can wander and try things for hours. Everything was clean all the vendors had fresh clean equipment and produce.There is a police station close and tourist police if you need them.It felt very very safe walking around at anytime and there are volunteers who speak English to assist if you need.Most vendors had a little English and we could make do with buying.If your in Seoul don’t miss out"
The Myeongdong Experience,It was our first time in Korea so the Myeongdong area was a treat for us with all the various shops plus street food variety. Be prepared with a budget for the things you may buy or the food you want to experience.
Vacation,Very nice to spend s dayLots of ShopsLots of foodCoffee shopsIndoor. Outdoor. Expensive and inexpensive
Good street Food and lots OF shopping.,"The street is for walking only which is very good because OF all The crowd and street Food stalls. IT is a long walk and The side streets are full OF restaurants, shops, pharmacy etc. IT is a complete place for almost everything. A must place to Go in The City."
RAD!,"One of our most amazing travel experience! The street becomes more alive around 4-5pm. Locals and Tourist conglomerate in the area for some shopping and or a taste of probably the best street foods! This is a must if you visit Seoul. Very diverse shopping with all the skin care products ( be careful not to get sucked in when they dangle a carrot to enter their stores), high end shopping, street cart shopping, luxury, knock- offs and best of all the array of very innovative food from Pajeon (Korean pancake), Gimbap, dumplings, rice cakes, barbecues on a skewer, egg bread, spiral potatoes, lobster with cheese and many more.... just packaged or handed to you with delight! Just go and experience it!"
Heaven for girl(shopping),"All shopping you can get it here, from street to mall, especially fashion and cosmeticsStreet food also good to try , especially the egg bun and squid bbq.Money changer available here, dun worry you dont have money to shop"
One long street market,"Unless you are into shopping, this is just another average shopping place so many locations around Seoul."
Food Stalls are Must Visit,"With a plethora of food stalls, each with its unique flavor and decoration, come hungry and with cash! There's endless shopping, everything from imitation Supreme gear sold on the street to the Louis Vuitton and other designer stores across the street connected to the Lotte department store. There are beauty stores and restaurants.You don't need more than 2 hours here unless you're really trying to do some serious shopping. Two hours is enough to get the gist and fill your belly. Myeongdong tends to be super crowded and as with the rest of S. Korea trash cans are limited so save a plastic bag from your latest purchase for trash"
Great street!,"Many shops! Many restaurants! Sure have what you want! If you are done with the street, there are a few malls there too."
So tempting to shop and make all your money drop!,This is a good place to do all your shopping spree. But be mindful of the money you have. The food is expensive so as the clothings but it's all tasty and fashionable.
Was staying nearby ,"Lots of shops selling facial products/ cosmetics , shoes , clothing etc. the food stalls are clean. I bought my sandwich at one of the stall when Isaac was closed "
Shop Shop & Shop,"DDP is good to shop clothing and Myeongdong is for you to shop cosmetics. There are a few good hotels inside the shopping street, it is very convenient if your aim is to shop until the last second. Plenty of F&B outlets for you to chose and lots of cafe too. Street food are also available but I found it not cheap.... "
Just okay,Okay shopping. It seems there are at least four of every store in the relatively small/short shopping area.
Great shopping experience ,"Myeongdong shopping street is probably the most famous amongst tourist.Very lively in the evening and nights. Most of the shops close by 11pm.Loads of beauty product shops. Do your research before buying any of the face mask. Like brand, your skin, which mask will suit you. Pricing in different shops, sale discount etc. Another place to get a good bargain for the beauty products is lotte shopping centre which is another area.Myeongdong shopping has got some good street food so definitely try them. "
The main shopping hub~,"Come here to get your fix of cosmetics, skincare, street foods! Full of tourists so there are also plenty of restaurants around here. But now, the skincare brand shops like Tony Moly, The Saem, etc are so pushy where if you take the free mask that they offered on the street, they literally push you into the shop :(So rude. So if you are not interested in the brand, dont take their freebies offered."
Good introduction to Korean street food and shopping.,"Our first day in Seoul was at Myeongdong and it was a very interesting site for visitors like me who loves food. The streets were lined up with carts and carts of street food, and different kinds, as well as shops selling clothes and a lot of cosmetic products. Sampling the street food was a very enjoyable experience, and filling too. Again, wear comfortable shoes (and bring lots of money)."
Stayed here in Myeongdong street,"It has a lot of cosmetic shops, you get free cosmetic samples and a lot of eateries/ street food. A must visit for street food lovers/ street shoppers. Also currency exchange rates are good here."
Great as far as Shopping Street go!,"Stayed for 2 weeks near the Myeongdong Shipping street. We only made one purchase (mostly b/c we still had 3 more months of travel ahead of us and didn't want to carry the extra weight around). Is a great place to visit for all sorts of shopping, especially K-beauty. There are literally 3-4 storefronts for the same beauty shops scattered throughout the shopping district, so its easy to get lost. Make sure you have the Naver app to help you navigate the small streets. "
Definitely a must,"A huge shopping area for street food, cosmetics and sneaker brands. Its a definitely must visit place when you are in Seoul !"
Beauty Heaven & Delicious Foods ,"one of the main reasons that I wanted to visit the city of Seoul was for the beauty products that the country is so famous for. The shopping street isn’t actually just one street - it’s multiple that veer off from the main one. You’ll find tons of different brand names, some you’ll recognise and some you won’t. I would heavily advise that you give the brands you don’t recognise a chance as some of the best products I picked up where from these places. My advice would be to take a bag with you as you’ll end up with a ton of samples simply for looking around a store you are usually handed a free face mask or moisturiser sample and these can stack up pretty quickly. You’ll also as a visitor be eligible for a tax refund on products if you spend over 50,000 won as well as being given samples from the stalls for purchasing products. At night while the beauty stores remain open, the night market comes to life with various different types of vendors. There’s some pretty amazing food on offer (the eggy bread was amazing) but you’ll also find some bags/phone cases / T-shirt’s etc. There was an abundance of knock-off supreme and off-white items available on the stalls."
Good place to shop cosmetics and street food,"This place is a heaven for people who love to shop cosmetics and eat street food. Here you’ll find good deals of famous korean stores such as missha, etude, laniege. My friend found a lower price for cosmetics around Busan but when in Seoul, shops here are of reasonable price. Also try to roam around first when buying other souvenir items (like socks) as some stores offer better deal than others. "
Must visit when in seoul,"If you are looking for street food and skin care brands, come to Myeongdong. Other stores such as jdsports, abc mart etc. Alot of restaurant along the main street and also in the alleyway. Come at night as it is very lively with the street vendors."
Bustling night market,"The usual bustling of night markets can be found here. All types of Korean and top brand products can be found.The food stalls line the streets as you walk by, be brave enough to try a bite when passing the food stalls it is a must when there.Lots of facial products and other cosmetics for the ladies.A must visit when in the area."
This is THE shopping paradise!,"We spent 3 days and 2 nights shopping here. Night food sold on street stalls are goid experiences, DO ask for the prize before ordering!There was no price tag on a FROZEN Smore, my teen ordered without knowing the price. (The price 2000won was only for the egg tartlet besides the FROZEN SMORE!) It was a whopping 8000 won for FROZEN smore which is actually marshmallow covered icecream (LOL)Beauty stores= Prices are all displayed. 1! Show your passport for tax free purchases2. Make sure you ask ""may I have free samples?"" when you are at the cashier. They grab a bunch of facial products into your bag of paid items (Freebies)Same as clothing stores and others, ask about ""tax free"", they will have options, instant tax refund (scan passport) , refund within store (ABC Mart), documents to claim tax refunds at airport or Lotte outlets.. Eat your hearts out, Myeondong Kyoja noodles since 1966 is still our best choice"
Really weird,"Hyper activities: a myriad of stands, restaurants, shops.Immerse yourself for some time, but plan to ""escape"" after some time..."
Bustling indeed!,"As we stayed in the heart of Myeongdong for 6 nights, I can say without a doubt that Monday was the least crowded - also because the food stands were mostly on a break! On Tuesdays from 5pm it gets pretty packed and crazy again!This is the place to pick up all the main cosmetic brands and also a chance to snack on all the “local” street snacks. What I liked about it was that you can find all the big korean brands here so it feels like a one-stop along with sportswear. It’s like the “in” thing right now so there are many sneakers/sports shops at each corner from Adidas to JD to New Balance etc. Highly recommend for all who are visiting!"
busy and lively place,"a lot of famous cosmetic brands, shopping malls which attracts visitors of different countries to go here, eat and shop"
Bustling Wonderland,"Myeongdong is not a quiet place for serenity.This is a popular area about ½ square kilometers in size with a plethora of shopping and restaurants along narrow streets that still allow cars. There usually are only a few vehicles traveling slowing amongst the crowd. There were many street food vendors when we were there, but I personally was not too impressed with the quality of the food. It’s a good place to be when you want to feel the bustle of lots of people out and about. We didn’t notice any rowdiness and felt quite safe."
Never tired of Myeongdong Street,"In the 5D4N in Seoul, we were at Myeongdong almost everyday and never tired of it. Each day we see something different. My son and I enjoyed our time shopping and buying at Myeongdong - my second visit to Korea."
Amazing- forget bangkok,"There are 1000's of shops in the area. from reasonably priced to expensive.Name it ,it is there. On the weekends the streets transform into a night food market. I'm sure there were over 500 food stalls. If you are there over the weekend ...you must do it.."
Heaven streets for skincare,"Mostly all kinds of cosmetics and skincare products. Apart from this some shops employed very rude sales girls. When they try to speak to you in mandarin and you could'nt understand they will turn you away and also if you don't buy from them, they will snatch back the gifts from you !"
Only for shoppers,"The whole street is bout shopping shopping and shopping.U can get cheap beauty products but make sure do survey a few shops.When evening come , there s a lot of street vendors selling local food and souvenirs.I find it on the high price but still i did try some local delights"
Shopping galore,If your main hobby is shopping then this is a heaven for you! A lot of things to buy and see.. street food is also everywhere..
Huge shopping and street food area,"Myeongdong is a really huge area full of shopping streets and street food. The place literally comes alive in the evening time and gets crowded with both locals and tourists that come here to shop for beauty products, clothes, souvenirs and to eat some of the amazing street food that can be found all over the area.We visited the Line Friends store as well as many beauty product stores for my wife and toy shops for our kids. We tried many types of street food as so much of it looked delicious, as it indeed was, and even managed to visit the McDonald's for our kids.This is definitely one of the liveliest and most exciting places that we visited in Seoul and is an absolute must visit place to anyone planning to visit Seoul."
Cosmetics,"We had so many choices of face masks and creams. Good prices but walk with your passport for tax free options, credit cards accepted. Some stores give samples if you are buying a lot."
Lively,This was a great place for night market for food. There was a huge array of shops there too. I ate there a few nights. I especially enjoyed the gimbap. I think South Korean sushi is lovely.
Similar products,"Even the night markets are somewhat not as exciting, especially so, that this is my 2nd visit within 6years. The stores selling beauty care products are aplenty, but was told by Korean friends that these aren't the cheapest. Nevertheless, one can find a few good eateries like abalone porridge, soy bean noodles and a few good deserts like Sulbing."
Worth a visit ,"Get immersed in shopping hustle and bustle in this location. If you don’t like crowds, this may not be the place for you but if you like vibrant, fun locations then this is the place for you. Keep an eye out for the green tea coffee/tea places.. they’re full of pleasant delicious surprises! "
Shopping central,"The shopping epicenter of Seoul. You can find all the cosmetics, food, clothes and gifts you want all in this one area. Very crowded and noisy, but that's to be expected."
Good place for shopping,We could stay half day in Myeongdong because there are various of shops and restaurants. The currency exchange rate in this district is in good rate. We could buy clothes and souvenirs here. 
"Street Food On A Stick! Shrimp, Scallops, Abalone, Potstickers and More!","Sure, there is plenty of shopping to be done on the myriad of alleys and carts and small shops, but I'm going back again tomorrow night for the food. If you are a lover of street food, meat-on-a-stick and anything that can be fried or torched (see the pic), this is the place. Plenty of mom/pop/solo carts and, in the easily missed alleys within the alleys, are innumerable places to eat locally. The skewered dishes we had this even were in the 2000-4000 Korean Won range, making the evening greatly entertaining and a great value."
Great streets for Korean cosmetic and make-up brands,"These streets (there’s one main street with smaller ones off to the sides) were close to the hotel and we strolled around one evening, browsing the many cosmetic, make up and health shops, boutiques and sports shops. The area was buzzing with people and it had a lively atmosphere. A great place if you are looking for niche Korean brands; you’ll definitely find them here. "
One of the best places for shopping in Seoul,"You can get everything you need here : clothes, make up, accessories, get some yummy street food or go to a restaurant. Always crowded, noisy, but fun :) Always kpop music playing out loud for the mood too. Great place to hang out."
Wheelchair...yes can but,There's a lot shooping shop and place to eat. But not every shop and restaurant friendly for wheelchair. 
Everything You Need In One Place,"Shopping, food, relaxation. All in one place!All you need is to stay in a hotel around this area and you get all your needs fulfilled."
the market place to visit at Seoul...,"this place is full of things that you need for a traveller, food, street food,nanta show, shopping street, and high end stores.complete package...."

korean night market,must visit place in seoul since they sell local food and surrounded with beauty shop around it. nearest uniqlo store. if u dont have night activities u can consider this place in your itenary.
Everything you need,Everything you could be looking for can be found in these markets. Stall holders are willing to barter for the best price. Food is freshly cooked while you wait. Amazing experience
Something for everyone.,"Primarily a cosmetic shopping hub, it offers a wide range of restaurants, cafes, clothes stores and marts. A bunch of pop up eateries come up in the evening with amazing street food. Almost all major make up and cosmetics brands have outlets here, lots of freebies and samples to take home too! "
OVERWHELMINGLY GOOD!,"I have to admit, it was drowning with people and shops left and right that I was so shookt I ended up not buying anything, not one single thing the first time I was there! It had that effect on me. But when I went back the next day, I was finally able to grasp the situation and enjoyed my time there! :)"
" Nice street, ","Nice street, a lot of things to see and buy. I bought a lot of cosmetic products for my friends and colleagues. You also find nice Korean foods here as well and make you you try their grill beef and hot pot. "
First Class Adventure for Shoppers,"We took a taxi to Myeongdong and since it's in the center of Seoul it did't take long to get there. The shopping begins the second you get out of the taxi and doesn't stop until your purchases become to cumbersome to handle. There is so much to see, so many things for sale. There are plenty of interesting food stalls with many different varieties of snacks and drinks. The collage of sights is fantastic and a photographers dream. Don't miss this attraction."
Myeongdong,"Like many commercial street in Seoul, Myeongdong has the same structres. It's okay to go there for eating street food and buying something. I love the Church here. It's a nice Church where you should travel at least once time in your life. The picture is at the end of Myeongdong."
shopping,"if like shopping this is the place to go to, good products with reasonable prices. ladies will love it."
guided tour throu seoul ,i went with a tour guide (hyeyoung Seo ) who gave me an insight to the korean tradition history and culture ....she was verrrrry well informed ...loved this street and went back to it a day later ...i would say you can spend an hour before you head to insadong ...

Cool street markets,"Day and night this place is full of people, stalls of food, clothes and heaps of other stuff to buy and try...Anthony.D"
Busy Street,"Our hotel is in Myeongdong. Thus, we are able to go for dinner and shopping merely by walking distance. Its very near n safe to walk during night."
Eat and shop!,"If you like walking bazaar sort of streets, this is the place for you. Lots of snack push carts and little items along this whole street. If you like, you can also walk into the shops and some are on level 2 or 3, so make sure you look for signages."
OK but nothing special,Lots of shops but none have anything special. I would rather shop at home. Why would you want Turkish items inKorea. Nice place for a stroll but we did not buy anything.

Good street food. ,We went on a weekend and there was a lot of options for street food. Easy access from subway. Lots of shopping and cafes to choose from. Fun to see the lively neighbourhood. 
Always busy,"We stayed close to Myeondong so passed through the main shopping street plenty of times during our stay and regardless of the time of day it was busy. It's easy enough to get disoriented especially if you are looking for somewhere listed in Korean (try using photos in TA listings or google streetview instead). There are plenty of shops to spend your money in (particularly cosmetics/beauty stores) including large fashion stores such as Muji. You'll also come across a number of street stall selling fashion items, and there is a vast array of street food on offer, so make sure you do try a few as they will suprise you as they are superb. It's a great place to observe local life."
"Energy and fun,... with some shopping around","Lots of positive energy, people, street stalls with great finger food to allow you stroll through the bustling pedestrian streets and enjoy it non stop. Lots of young people around, some tourists and plenty of shops with some interesting designs, known brands with a twist if you stay window shopping long enough to realise that there are some exclusive articles to grab,... very worth visiting, even if you are not looking at buying anything. A must place to visit if you want to grab some trendy stuff, or very trendy stuff!"
Fabulous nightlife in Seoul,"It's obvious that it's going to be crowded all the time but the vibe and atmosphere of the nightlife is fabulous. There's delicious street food, shops, and cosmetics galore as well as plenty of restaurants if you'd rather sit down and enjoy a meal. Highly recommend visiting Myeongdong when in Seoul."
Crowded and huge shopping street,"Myeong dong is famous for shopping haven in Seoul. So many choices of food stall but expensive, Korean cosmetics, famous Korean restaurants. It becomes crowded all day long. "
Vibrant,"this is very vibrant. Good area to shop around, cosmetics, clothings, shoes,street food, restaurants, cafe and etc. The place is crowded with people. From here you can also take the underground passage way to Lotte duty free shop."
Hub for Korean skin care products,"Best place to shop in Seoul. Food, clothes, shoes, accessories, toys, cosmetics, souvenirs almost everything can be bought there. If you are a fan of Korean skin care products then this is the place for you. You can also find many number of money changing shops. Quick Tip: 1.

A great place for cosmetic lovers!,"There are hundreds of cosmetics shops of different brands in the area in which you can find everything you need! If you are a fan of Korean food, you will definitely enjoy the food both in the restaurants and from the stalls as well!"
Hyper Shopping Street,"I spent every evening here with ample dining selections and so much happening, sales in every corner of the street.Don't missed out this area if you are shopping for all K-cosmetic, clothings, shoes, etc. You can claim tax refund in Myeongdong for purchase value of 30,000 won."
4th TripTo Seoul,"It's a fantastic feelings to be visiting Seoul this time of the year.First week of October is probably the best time to visit. Weather is nice and cool without being too extreme. This is probably the best and relaxing trip. Seoul is the place to be if you enjoy shopping and eating. They have street food for your in between bites. Fantastic choice of BBQ restaurants to choose from. We are staying at the Grand Hotel near the Miyeongdon station. The rooms are nice and clean. The amenities are great. The location is just within walking distance of the shopping belt. You couldn't ask for more. Too bad , when you are having fun, it's time for us to depart for home.Goodbye Seoul and see you real soon.CheersBarry"
Shoppers and Foodies Mecca ,"Arrived at the area around 11 am , was wondering what was all the fuss about. By noon droves of people started appearing within an hour place was jammed packed. There are more stores selling cosmetics and skin products than anywhere I have ever seen . Every 3rd or 4th store was selling skin products.Food carts and hawkers started appearing on the streets. Literally every street had at least 8 to 10 Restaurants .Must for any visitor to be here."
Fun place to get street food!,Myeongdong is a great place to shop but it’s an even better place for street food! The main crossroads are lined with stalls selling delicious treats!
aw-mazing!!,"i feltin love with korea but not the price lol. i like being at this place and it made me forget the time. all famous korean beauty product was in here, fashion street yeah, street food yeah, here is the place, i had been told from my friend that it closes very early, at midnight. anyway, its good place to spend you money lol"
Great atmosphere and convenience for shopping and food,Tons of popular clothing stores and beauty product stores in close proximity! Delicious restaurants too. Currency exchange booth in the 7-11 store has the best rate. Different variety of delicious street food carts you can try.
Been there at Myongdong,"The place was so crowded, passing pedestrians, street vendors and so many small restaurants here. Very nice."
great shopping and food,The steet food was the best part! There are a great deal of shops but most are the same as you would see anywhere else. The street food however was fantastic. I tried several different things and it was a great experience. 
Crowded and Vibrant Shopping District!,"This place is one of the iconic shopping streets in Seoul. From designers shoes and bags to facial products, you name it they have it. Prices are not entirely cheap but the sheer variety of products will make you go crazy so get ready your wallets and shop till you drop!"
Shopping heaven ,"This place is RIDICULOUS - so many shops, especially skincare and beauty, plus loads of cute stores like Line Friends and ARTBOX. I saved up my shopping for the last day! There are loads of little side streets and turns you can take and it would be easy to get lost but it’s shaped like a grid so it’s actually not that difficult to find your way back to where you start, only problem is there are multiple sites for shops, like there’s about 3 branches of Tony Moly within the same area so don’t use a brand like that as your signpost! I recommend getting cake at Billy Angel while you’re there... "
The shopping place ,"Wow this is the place to be in Seoul , good street food and great shopping , all The masks and skin care , jewellery, clothing, shoes I love this place "
Shopping haven,"If you are looking for shop for cosmetics then you are in for a treat. If you are looking for shoes and food, then you can find them here too. Shops offer instant tax rebate and you can shop to your heart's content. "
I love this place,Myeongdong was my main place when I was in SK. I really love this place. People were so nice and all the stores are always open that you can buy almost anything. I also love the street food. It’s not so cheap but most of them are really good 
Great shopping area where can spend a day.,"Myeongdong tends to get crowded after 1100hrs until midnight. Lots of shops selling cosmetic, clothing and restaurant. A lots of movable stall selling Korea sttreet food but most of the never stated the price. Tourist tend to get cheated. Beware of one stall selling Oreo Churo by one Chinese women, one small oreo churo cost 3500won."
Food and shoppers heaven,"Simply the best, an amazing place to shop non stop. So many gift and allsorts of food stalls many variety of restaurants and even designer wear shops. The list goes on... love it love it love it. Its a must visit for those who travel to Seoul."
Cosmetics heaven!,"If you're crazy about Korean beauty and cosmetics, this is the place for you. Lots of shops like Innisfree, The Faceshop, Etude House, Olive Young, All Beauty Mask, Laneige, and many more. There are also lots of korean street foods and some halal foods as well. However, if you go there with kids they're gonna be bored following you around to find beauty products."
Shopping district + food hawkers = Myeongdong,"Once getting out of the station, therr will be scene of shops lining up the streets. Each shop would play different playlist - some would sound familiar, some would not. This place is best for buying beauty care (there are too many brands to mention, but I would like to recommend nature republic which is next to station exit). In case you need new clothes, go buy one at either Uniqlo (the biggest branch store in Asia) or a shopping mall next to nature republic. The shopping mall has 3-4 floors: men's clothing on first floor, women's on second floor. There are gorgeous clothings to find in there though some might be in low quality (I am saying this because the one I bought was not sewed tight enough. It might be damaged if I am not careful enough). About the food hawkers, the price might vary depends on what you eat and in which hawkers you buy. Take an example... One gyeranppang (Korean egg bun) costs 2000 won while roasted lobster tail with melted cheese costs you 15.000 won (I actually doubt the price... Was not it too expensive? I need to cross check about it)"
Mixed feelings.,Visited it in late evening. Shopping was great. Street foods were great. But we still expect to see more.
Great shopping and excellent street food,"I am not a shopper but enjoyed looking at the wares. I think Myeongdong Shopping Street had the most food vendors than any of the other street markets and the food was delicious. We loved the Hottoek, grilled shrimp, pork on a stick... actually, loved everything we ate there."
Boring if you aren’t a shopoholic,I found this area boring. It might as well be Tokyo or Paris. Same brands everywhere. The only thing which is different is that there is a lot of cosmetic shops. Since I don’t use that I found the area boring. Many other things to do instead.
Shops and street food ,Shops and street foods galore. Don’t have your meal before you come here. Stuff yourself with the delicious street food that fill this place. Clothes are cheap as well. 
Superb Market,"Loved this market. It was vibrant with tons of actions. I felt alive and ready to devour each and every street. Loved the restaurants, the shops, the cafes and many more little corners. "
Shopping city,Just wow. You could get lost easily as streets after streets are shops of all kinds. There's plenty of food to try as well.
Best shopping ever,"I am a huge fan of korean cosmetics and skincare. This place is heaven for shoppers because it has all the important shops in the same place, sometimes even 2/3 shops from the same brand in one street. And they give lots of free samples. In Myeongdong you can also find an underground shopping center with lots of clothes and not expensive at all. A must do in Korea"
Food street,"You will find lots of street food here, cheese lobster is a must-try! Many choice of cosmetics brand, and we also did enjoy Nanta Show at the Nanta Theater, located in the street itself. I explored the street twice on my visit recently, well its a tourist spot anyway."
A Heaven For Food and Shopping!,"When you go here, make sure that you have enough money to go on a shopping spree because you will spend on a lot of street food and a lot of skincare products! especially if you go gaga over those Korean trends."
Myeongdong Shopping Street,This is a very busy street yet. Everything here is a bit more expensive than in other cities but the shopping center is more complete. Same goes with the food. It is more expensive here but there are more food choices. The lobster stand is a mush try!
Amazing Shopping And Amazing Food,"Thus area us a ""Must See"" for visitors. There is endless shopping, tons of resturants and coffee shops, countless street vendors. Prices are great...it is safe and friendly. Loved it!"
Too many cosmetics stores,Walked arouns for several hours and took in the street food scene. The street food was much better than the shopping as the was an abundance of cosmetic stores. 
Wow,It was an amazing experience going to myeongdong had foodtrip with the sumptuous street foods i really love it specially the fish cake..i also love the cosmetics shops with a lot of freebies 
Mid afternoon best ,"Some nice shopping to be had here, lots of cosmetics, but be sure to hang around till 5pm,, when all the street food vendors fill the streets! Delicious, authentic Korean food and delicacies cooked on the street. Yum! "
Full of street food,Tourist hideout...Retail therapy HQ... Full of Chinese tourist but you will get what you need for fashion and beauty items ...Food is in abundance too 
Amazing,Very fun place to walk around and look at the street food. I wasn't brave enough to have a taste of any of it though. If you are visiting Seoul you have to visit Myengdong.
Pricy cosmetic products,There were a lot of choices for cosmetic brands but they're quite pricy. Street foods quite pricy too.
Lots of cosmetic shop,"so many cosmetic shops, branded shop, food street, the best about this street, lots of cosmetic shops and you will get lots of gift from them to compare to other places of shops. food street usually starts in the evening."
Great Street Food,"Loved walking up and down the streets sampling the delicious street food. It seemed reasonable to me. The honey garlic shrimp was amazing, also the chicken, shrimp and cheese bowls. Lots of people so very crowded."
shopaholics place to be,"Love this area soo much! I can spend hours in every store. Food, cosmetics and clothing all in one place. "
Great shopping!,"Myeongdong is busy, but has everything you'd need from a Korean shopping experience, from beauty products to cat cafes to international brands, with great street food along the way."
Very nice ,Best place to do shopping in Korea Many shopping malls with different level of goods Cleans and safe Sure you will not go out with empty hands 
Shopping,"Loved the shopping, real buzz to this area, quite small and compact, but had 3 days here. Street food fantastic, but more expensive than I thought it would be."
Amazing experience,"Loved every bit of it..Lotte young plaza and lotte plaza are 2 of the bigger malls in this area. But you do get multiple other malls as well.You must visit the underground shopping center which is situated near the lotte young plazaIn the evening the area bursts into life with action stations of delicious street food. Craving for some of it right now!Shops are open till 10pm but the larger 2 malls close a bit earlier than that.Ooh and if you are a k-pop fan.. loads of merchandise!! Including pop up stores..I stayed at the sotetsu hotel, the splasir myeong-dong. Which was nice and cozy. However, there are many hotels around that area that you can try out as wellOverall.. a must visit. Im definitely visiting again!"
Excellent ,Alot of shops there. Alot of variety of shops especially make up and clotes for females. Food too. Recommended 
Shopping! Shopping!,"I was prepared. I knew I was going to buy many facial products. In fact, I pre-booked extra 15kgs going back just for my new goodies! My 2 friends who weren't sure what to expect also ended up shopping as much as I did.Myeondong is full of skin care brands left and right, as far as your eyes can see, as much as you can carry or afford. I really didn't notice much else like clothes, shoes, etc. I love all the freebies they give you for every purchase and how every sales personnel knows how to use the products they're selling. Prior to my trip, I watched some YouTube videos on skincare products. I also read lists and blogs so I was armed with screenshots of what I wanted. I found most of them without much effort. I could've tried harder to find the others but I got distracted with Artbox and Daiso so it's all good. Let's just put it this way, my 2 friends who were not as crazy with beauty products as I am said: We live in Innisfree. They're literally in Innisfree every day (we were in Seoul for 5 days) and sometimes, 2x a day. You can't help but consider, look, buy, consider, look, buy. Repeat. :-)Be prepared. :-)Tax refund until 1M Korean Won on each passport. Refund at the airport was very efficient (unlike in EU where there are long lines). "
Nice little shopping area to visit,"Myeongdong is definitely crowded as it is a tourist area. You can find just about anything you'd want to buy here from cosmetics to food. The price of the street food can add up, so don't plan on having street food for dinner unless you don't mind the cost! You can get great reals if you know how to pick your shops or if you know how to haggle with the vendors. Definitely a nice place to visit in Seoul! "
Great Lively Shopping Area,"It is easy to get to Myeong-dong by subway, there is a station right there. The streets are buzzing and you can buy just about anything!"
For all your shopping needs,"If you want to shop for clothes and cosmetics, this is the place to go. It also lined with street food stalls. You must try the different types of street food that they have to offer. It is very popular so it is often crowded. "
Shop till you drop if the streets aren't to crowded,"despite only staying 10 minute walk away from myeongdong I only seemed to be brave and go about twice during my whole 3 month long trip as i couldn't stand the constant crowds of people at all times myeongdong just seemed to be constantly busy. there never seems to be a quiet hour or quiet street. however, the shop are amazing and the amount of free samples i got just walking up and down the street was amazing i didn't even have to go in! "
Shoppings,This place is full of vigrancy. Street stalls neatly lining up the streets. Starts on after 2pm. All sorts of local Korean delicacies. Expensive though but clean and delicious. Tons of beauty shops everywhere and speaks beautiful mandarin. Simple to locate. Cannot get lost.Recommend to go early winter as it was rather hot.
Really the worst place in Seoul to spend time.,"This area is heavily populated by Chinese tourists with large suitcases who sit in shops sending photos of items to their friends on Wechat. There's street food, but nothing you can't find in a less touristy area. My advice: avoid myeongdong like the plague - There's better places in Seoul for literally everything on offer here."
Heaven for make up lovers,"Shopping at its finest! We planned to stay here for only 3-4 hours but when we went there around 1pm, we didn’t left not until it time to go back to hotel to sleep. Aside from so much to shop, from make up to souvenirs, trying out different street food will take up so much of your time. Given the chance, we could stay here all day long. And the photos will show how shopaholic we all are."
Pretty touristy but also very nice for shopping ,Myeong-dong is a pretty touristy spot but also perfect for shopping. There are department stores as well as small stalls with local food or souvenirs.The mix is pretty nice and even though it’s very crowded it’s not hectic at all.We liked it there a lot.
Best place to be at night!,"Get your street food fix at the alleys of Myeongdong. Lots of food and dessert options around. Prices can be a little bit higher as this is a touristy area. Tons of roadshop brands here, too. Don't forget to bring your passport so that you can avail of the tax refund (for a minimum single receipt purchase of 30,000 won). Also, I found that Myeongdong is the best place to exchange foreign currency. There is a currency exchange shop near the Chinese Embassy that has particulary good forex rates. From the embassy, walk 20-30 steps along Namdaemun and look for a shop located at a basement (not the one right across)."
Shopping for beauty products.,"If you are interested in beauty products, Myeondong Shopping street and the nearby streets/alleys is the place to go. However, my advise is to bargain a lot, as not all the shops has fixed prices.You can also find a lot of good restaurants in the area."
Myeongdong mania,Myeondong is just fantastic to walk around with street stalls crazy shopping of all kind. Just love it!
very crowded. lots of skincare options,"I felt a bit overwhelmed at the start.but its got everything here.definitely worth a visit, especially if you want to get skincare products"
Very deceiving!,"We took a nice hotel in this area after hearing about this ""wonderful"" shopping district. The hotels and surrounding areas are quite nice and elegant, but those shopping streets are more like a flea-market that is run mostly by Chinese... Location is still nice and central, but there is nothing particularly interesting to buy here and no decent restaurant for regular tourist. Seoul is a beautiful city and there are much better areas for tourists."
Wonderful time ,"We were in an apartment very close to the market. Very easy to access and on Friday full of life. We went on Saturday and closing at 23:00 so be careful. You can walk and smell and taste a lot of street food. Need cash for this. Everything is between 2.000 and 5.000 KRW, except the lobster 15.000 KRW.Try also the 32cms ice creams at 2.000 KRW.In one of the streets, you also have a Cat Cafe where an admission fee is required (KRW 10.000) with a drink included. It is an experience ."
Crowded but fun,"Any kind of food, shopping and nightlife you want. A must see coming to Seoul. And definitely worth the effort to get there. "
Beauty/cosmetic central ,"This place is a must see if you want to experience cosmetic/beauty shopping on Korea.The shopping streets are filled with various beauty shops, all offering 50% off or buy one get one free on skincare products, especially face masks.They even have suitcases you can buy at the till if you want to buy a lot of stuff.They all try and get you into the shop by offering you a free face mask.The face mask they give you for free, is being sold for approx 10000 won inside the shop. Once you take this mask, the shop assistants inside follow you around like a lost dog. It is a good experience, you just need to be clear as to how much you want to spend because it can get a bit out of hand as there is so much to choose from!Otherwise on the street, there are the general shops: Zara, H&M, a very cheap pharmacy, restaurants etc.Taxis are also plentiful in this area, and are very very cheap. "
a must go !,"If you're into Korean skincare, make up, fashion and snacks, you must definitely go to Myeongdong ! They have the whole area full of shops and stores."
exciting shopping centre,"being here with some friends during the time in Korea. Many shops, many tourist but the air is still clean and fresh at night. The street food is great, especially strawberry.The next time going to Korea, will be here again."
Hyper shopping?,"Hyper shopping? It was ok, but nothing that special. Nice to 'window-shop' and walk around for a bit."
Shopping spree,"We enjoy shopping and there are entertainment on the street, enjoy eating street food lobsters and other korean food"
One day is not enough,"In my view, Myeongdong is the must-visit place for the hundreds of restaurants, shops and night market stalls spread across 99 HA of land. From the exit of Myeongdong station, one must remember the route taken, not so much as not to be lost, but to explore every nick and hook of this shopping paradise in Seoul.Street food served by night market stalls is expensive but not unaffordable. This is after all a popular and famous tourist spot. One advice is not to gobble up every food that intrigues you so that you won't regret not having any more capacity for delicacies 1 hour later.The streets are straight and they criss cross one another. Many shops are duplicated selling cosmetics and skincare products, worth a buy since they are generally half the price compared to the home country of the tourists.Myeongdong - one day is definitely not enough. "
Shopping and street food!,"Good place to walk, shop and eat the street food. Feels relaxing although it was quite crowded. If u r buying the skin care and beauty products, this is better than Lotte Departmental store by far in my opinion"
Seoul,"Myeongdong is very a nice. A lot of Korean street foods , restaurant and not to mention the Shopping. "
Amazing Myeongdong,"I have just returned from a 10 day trip to Seoul, we stayed within 15 minutes walk form Myeongdong and I have to say it was fantastic! The area has all the large high end fashion boutiques and department stores (Lotte Department Store) you could ever want as well as a huge range of high street stores, some I knew some I did not. In addition to this the array of food eateries was wonderful! I have to say that hand on heart my most favorite part was the street food vendors that set up every afternoon and are there until the wee small hours. Absolutely amazing range of food to choose form and the smells as you pass the sweet and savory selections are wonderful. My son and I went there one evening to just try everything we could in place of going out for dinner. I highly recommend Tornado Potatoes and he particularly loved the Octopus and Lobster food stalls. I am going back again early next year as I had the best time!"
Busy Shopping Street,"We stayed at Namsan Guest house at Exit 3. Myeongdong Shopping Street was located at exit 6 and 7. There were many cosmetics shops like Nature republic, innnisfree and many more. We bought bundle aloe vera and masks with reasonable price. A must visit place were Artbox, Line friends and Lala Mart. We watched Nanta Show at Unesco building.The people with red shirts were there at the entrance to help you with the direction. There were many food stalls. Most of all for muslims, find the Busan Jib restaurant at the alley (trademark ABC mart and Apple signboard). We tried a lot of street food like tall ice cream, spiral potato, egg bread, gimbap and red bean fish cake."
Shopping,You can buy everything here specially facial products of Korea. They offer buy one take on or in a package. There are also restaurant around the market where you have something to eat. 
Shop til you drop,"Everything you want for skin care, make up, clothes and more!Top names as well as local bargains. Sheet masks a particular winner."
Great place to visit ,"Lights, sounds and smells will make this a memorable place to visit. Go of an evening for the full effect and make sure to sample some of the street food. See more of my adventures here by checking out @footballfoodpackaging on Instagram. "
"Great area for walking, browsing, and tasting street food!","Wow; we had the best time sampling delicious street-cart foods in this area. Great sit-down restaurant and stores there, too. If you are intimidated by crowds, this might be a bit much, but we LOVED it! Most interesting street foods included scallops grilled with cheese, grilled octopus and squid, and tasty eggs grilled inside a small toast slice."
nice night market,Situated in the centre of Seoul. The place is very good for street food. lot of shops to do household purchases and fashion products including cosmetics.
Good place for shopping,"This is a good place for shopping in Seoul City. We all know that as tourists we are looking for places where we can find a wide variety of goods to buy, and Myeongdong street is a must go for tourists. Here you will find many international and Korean clothing stores like Zara, H&M, Uniqlo, Adidas and more, or if you are looking for the latest trend in Korean skincare and beauty products this is the right place for you. You might have heard how important appearance is in South Korea. Make a stop in Myeondong street and treat yourself by buying some good Korean skincare products. Here you can go into the skincare and beauty shops and you can get free samples, and if you are lucky enough the staff of these stores will let you try the products on site.In Myeongdong you can find food although. International and Korean restaurants are everywhere, but one of the most popular foods in this area is the street food. I highly recommend you to come to Myeongdong street after 4:00 pm, you will see street vendors taking their small food trucks out and you'll find them in the main street and alleys. Bring some cash with you because you won't be able to pay with your card if you want to buy their food, I think that most of the prices of the food are reasonable but I am gonna dare to say that some others look a bit expensive compared to what they are selling."
Must for shopping,"If you want skin or beauty products, this is the place to visit.Opens till 9-10 pm, lot of bargain products.Most of the brands are available."
Crowded street with tons of shopping ,"Very crowded street, full of shopping, particularly full of shops that sell beauty products, Innisfree, Clio, Etude house, skinfood, u name it they have it. When it is evening, the whole street become alive with all the street stalls set up, but personally I find it expensive. An egg bread costs 2000 won, a beef cube stock costs 7000 won, a stick with rice cake and sausage cost 4000 won. A fish cake cost 2000 won. There are also shops selling clothes, socks and accessories. You can also find theme cafe like cat cafe, also other cafes like coin cafe, osulloc tea house. There are many popular restaurants here as well, like running man haha bbq shop, wangbijib bbq as well. The underground mall at Myeongdong Station, you can also shop over there."
Shopping central,Super close to Insadong area where I was staying - constant buzz about the place and packed with clothes and cosmetics stores - also great street found around 
great to do shopping ,Provides more avenues for shoppers with garments and personal care items. Easy to move around the city. 
Very nice ,"You can found everything, from some littles markets or restaurants and the bests boutiques. It is a really cool and fun place to go shopping. "
Myeongdong street,"Everywhere is small shops for tourists, you can find anything you want. Chinese tourists everywhere.."
Great shopping,"A great place to visit, the shopping is amazing, plenty of street food to try. Recommend the chicken skewers. Movies here go in morning, only 8000 won. Got some new glasses here, ready in one day, 1/3cost of glasses in NZ. Well worth a couple of visits. Open till early morning."
Must experience the night market,"A must see and experience if you love shopping, meandering and people watching. Street food is good too!"
Great place for street food and shopping,This is a must visit! The place is packed full of street food and shopping outlets. Coffee shops of course are there so there are lots to choose from. There can be lots of people in that street and on a hot day may be uncomfy to some especially if you have a baby or a toddler. Better go there on the late afternoon so it's not too hot.
Street shopping,"Everything you could think of is here. Gives you a flavor of Korean cosmetics and street food. Busy and hot in the summer, take an umbrella. "
Must Visit!!!,This place is beautiful at night however you have to be patient and enjoying shopping at busy shopping districts otherwise it could be too much for you.Most famous cosmetic and skincare stores located here.
"very busy street, lots of food, cafes, and cheap shopping","This is a very busy street with lots of tourists. If you are new to korea, then I would suggest visiting at least once because it gives you a good idea of what busy, young areas are like in Seoul. Theres lots of options for shopping, ranging from small privately owned stores, lots of chain stores, malls, and even a more high-end department store. Try a restaurant (its a chain so you can actually find it in many neighborhoods in korea) called You ga nae (chicken galbee). all my friends loved it when I introduced it to them."
"Fun, fun, fun😁😀😃","Check it out, and you will like it! There are ton of shops, restaurants, and shops..and many more. At night, this place was so lively....small food kiosks showed up...Check it out!"
"lots of restaurants, street food, shops","very busy street with all the stuff. every evening the streets are full with street vendors, and packed with tourist. lots of restaurants, shops and cosmetic shops"
Amazing ,My favorite neighborhood during my Seoul’s visit. Lots of street food places to try Korean food. Good place to come to on your first day in Seoul. 
Shopping paradise,Just bring along cash to shop till you drop. Wonderful place to get all the Korean drama gadgets here. Most of the shops are managed by young Korean.
Fun for tourists who love to shop,"I love to shop and I gotta admit that it was really fun and exciting exploring this place in the beginning, but it got REALLY boring and repetitive after like two days because the stores were all chain stores so they just kept repeating itself... the chain stores didn’t have much variation and options either so it gets boring after looking at the same stuff all day. Also, the only deals that are worth it are the ones that are like “buy one get one free” or “buy two get one free” deals, otherwise everything else is sold at retail price and it’s not worth it. "
Heaven!,If you love skincare/cosmetics/make up here are the right place. U can buy mask at cheaper price and also I in love with the saem liptint!
Cosmetics heaven & great street food,"If you are first time in Seoul and looking to browse for some Korean cosmetics, that is where you should go! There are plenty of shops there. My advice - do not spend all money in the first one! Also, always ask for free samples if you are making a purchase. They give plenty!There are quite a few restaurants in the area, I would recommend grabbing some street though! "
Loads to do,"We love this street - especially in the evenings when the weather was cooler. There's plenty of street food - name it; it's here: whether it's chicken or octopus, steak or crepes, it just seemed to be an endless supply of food and shops. "
Superb Shopping and Street Food,Go for some excellent shopping and food. The food carts offer great variety and there are plenty of sitdown restaurants and cafes too
Great Shopping District but beware of petty thief!!,"This is a shopping heaven especially for street food, cosmetics, clothing and shoes. You will find many shops packed during Saturdays. However, we had a bad experience where we were cheated by food seller who asked us to pay twice, once during the ordering and they made us pay again when the food was prepared. We were shocked that there was such a petty ""thief"" among those sellers who use this trick to get more money from foreign visitors."
Evening delight,"Fantasic street food available after 6.00pm. Good selection of shops, streets seemed very safe and clean."
Shopping,A fantastic place to spend an evening and the church close by was beautiful.. excellent street food and fun shopping..the make up stores are so many it was sad for my husband as we three girls were going crazy
My favorite spot in Seoul!,"I'll be honest, I'm not usually a ""shopper"" on vacation but I think this street converted me. It's a haven for anything and everything you could imagine - seriously, anything you're looking for at any price range, this place has got it! I personally found myself more drawn to stationary/home goods/Korean skincare stores. Even in the intense rain that was happening during my visit, this place was a pleasure to visit. Also, if you don't try the street-food (there is a street dedicate to this) you're missing out on one of the best experiences Seoul will give you. I tried out some tteokbokki, kimbap and found an organic milk based soft serve stand and they were all heavenly."
The SoHO of Korea,"This place is probably one of the best places to shop. Uniqlo, Zara, H&M, Dr Marten, Adidas, MCM.Actually, I found a review on the Korean masks here. I went to Innisfree and discovered that their products use ingredients from Cheju -do (Cheju Island). There is a hand lotion that smells delightful (black tea) and also from Cheju-do.There’s also Nature Republic as well. Public bathrooms are on the 5th floor of the building that has Forever 21, and the basement of Caffe Bene and 1st floor of Daiso.I found another cool store called Artbox which has all sorts of cute novelties, ranging from lens to your camera, adorable umbrellas, pill boxes and masks to cover your face when you are sick.Last and a must for people who have never been to Daiso. It’s like a 99 cent store plus Sanrio store plus Bed Bath and Beyond. There are these store in Los Angeles, but tiny. This one is literally 8 floors and I checked."
BEst shopping street,"If you are looking for a cool shopping experience, go to this market area. Check beforehand for the hours as sometimes it changes. "
Crowded cosmetic heaven,"I love cosmetic, so this is heaven for me. I was there in August which was too hot n humid to shop during day time. Stores have AC but I prefer to shop at night time especially they have street food. Foods are not cheap IMO. And I am not sure if we are suppose to bargain for beauty supplies? Because I feel they are not that cheap compare to if I order online. Most store lures you with deals like buy 2 get 1 free and throw in bunch of samples. Or if you buy 500k krw they give you a small carry on, 1 million krw they give you a medium luggage to carry your purchase (I think that’s a great idea). And you see lots of people carry luggages around. I wish they have a beauty supply store where they sell beauty machine like derma pen, needle roller, LED light, etc.. .. because I couldn’t find one. Oliver young has blackhead removal machine but it is weak. I bought and tried once I got back to the State. It didn’t work well. Otherwise I highly recommend going to myeongdong shopping street."
"Bustling district, lots of cheap street food ",We loved this district on our short stay over in Seoul. The street food was to die for! It’s easily accessible by the metro.
Food and Shopping Experience ,Catering to all types of travellers! Great street food and quaint restaurants to shopping! A must place to visit in Seoul. 
An experience to remember,We booked a hotel in this area so that we can make the most out of exploring every nook and cranny of Myeongdong shopping street. There are a lot of tourists and can be overwhelming especially on weekends. But the shopkeepers are nice and there are a lot of things to see (and eat). 
Anything you are looking for you’ll find!,"Busy, lively, interesting, good bargains!You can find anything here from a hairdressers to a school books store, big brands and no brands. Total fun mix of people and shops!"
Shopping and Eaten Haven,Love love the night market. Went there every night for food and the crowds. Even saw a live drama filming and saw a famous actress. Also a place to shop especially for women who loves makeup. So a must visit in Seoul!
Myeongdong the best market to go to when in Seoul,"Too nice a place we went there everyday after lectures for SNU.The cathedral, blouses, toys, babies accesories ,food ,socks.The church is a must see as it is the first Catholic church built in Gothic style.Doota duty free with Line products for kids.Food is good esp at Migabon near the carhedral with their porridge n chicken soup."
Myeongdong Shopping Street Seoul Korea,This is really a wonderful shopping place... you get all sort of brands and bargains... Also there are many eateries to choose from... A must place to visit.. 
Must Visit in Seoul!!,"A very busy and lively area in Seoul. A must visit whenever you are in Seoul, most eatery and good food can be found here. There are plenty of cosmetics shops. Suitable for shopaholic and tourists. There are also many nice hotels around which most of them can go directly to the airport. Myeongdong can offer a vibrant part of the city!!!"
 Lots of great finds,"Shoes, clothes, skin care, toys almost everything is here x3! Many stores u wont often see in malls. "
Shoppers heaven ,If you are a shopperholic than this is the place to be. Massive in size and selling almost everything that has to do with fashion. Late afternoons are best to go 
Vibrant part of the city,"Probably our favourite part of the city, a mixture of shopping malls, shops, restaurants and street food. Plenty of free wifi hotspots from shops. Most shop assistants speak English to an extent and you can purchase tax free if you take along your passport."
Fun Shopping Area,Fun shopping in this area. Lots of cosmetics stores. Low cost clothes and shoe shops. Some fun shops for kids with toys. Lots of food vendors on the street. Inexpensive restaurants.
A lot of Korean Cosmetics Shops!!,"you can find in this place the different South Korean cosmetics brands such as innisfreeworld, etude house, nature republic, etc. and they give a lot of ""service"" which are gifts for whatever you buy such as free face masks, anti aging products and others which I use whenever I travel. There are also street food but I have not tried."
Great shoppingarea,"This is a great place to do your shopping. Especially for cosmetics. However, it is very crowded with a lot of tourists."
NICE STREET FOR A WALK & SHOPPING,This is the only STARBUCKS outlet in the world with change in language. Nice restaurant's from different countries.
A must visit place for shopaholic <3,"There is a lot of shops that offers variety things like korean cosmetics , Albums, Shoes, Clothes & many more . There is a lot of cafes & restaurants. Don't forget korean street food at night too! Shopping heaven in Seoul"
Tourist trap,"Lots of shop with cosmetics, souvenirs, Korean BBQs, etc. Very lively with thousands of Japanese and Chinese tourists. Personally quite disappointed by the place and overall not really interesting. On top of that, expensive prices. "
Must go hopping and eating place for tourists anytime during your stay,"A must-go place for tourists. On the first day, you can come here for money exchange. Many shops with better rate than other places of Seoul but the best one is still the one the opposite of the embassy, although very minor than the better one in Myeongdong. On the last day, you can do shopping for comestic or sports shoes. Anytime you can come here for food with famous restaurants. They may not be the best but are above average."
Must see,Great place to visit for shopping and dining. Try both day and night as it is a different experience.Must see!
Happening shopping heaven,"U could get almost everything you need here.A street full of shops selling cloths, masks, snacks, coffee and so much more.We spend entire day here and we still yet to finish shopping! Literally a heaven for shopaholic!Cosmetics is something you shouldn’t miss. High quality products with reasonable price."
A must see place for spending money,"Great place to kill the time and everything there looks so attractive. Nice place to shop around. Also, they have some nice restaurants nearby, just google them. "
Check discount coupons for shopping and restaurants!,"Be sure to get a map from your hotel or the tourist info guides before wading into Myeongdong. You definitely get a sense of deja vu as you see nearly the same stores every way you turn.Shopping: 1. Have a shopping list (with prices) before you go so you do not easily fall into sales traps! 2. There are discount coupons on a few Myeongdong shops and restaurants in the Visit Korea Committee site. I think the offers change regularly, and can be redeemed in specific branches. I've seen 10% off coupons on Banila Co. and Missha on the site. This is in addition to the tax refund you get once you reach the 30k won minimum. 3. The Myeongdong stores do not give out as much samples as I expected; I had to ask the cashier to give me samples as my purchase was being wrapped up. 4. Compare items/offers at the main street stores with items/offers at stores by the outskirts. By main street, I mean that road with the street food stalls that has Uniqlo at one end. I've seen discounts offered at an outskirt store that wasn't available in the main road store. I've also been allowed to choose items that went into a BuyX/GetX offer at an outskirt store, whereas the main road store only had pre-packaged bundles.5. Read up on Korea tax refunds before your visit. Check the tax refund provider of the store before going in, or if the store directly gives you a tax refund after you present your passport at the cashier. It would be most convenient if the store gives you a tax refund directly; next convenient would be if all your tax refunds would fall under a single provider such as Cube Refund, Global Blue, etc. 6. For tax refund claims less than 75,000 won, getting refunds through the airport kiosks is a pretty quick process. 7. For shopaholics, there may be better offers in the duty-free store at the airport. There is also an online duty-free store where you can have packages delivered at the airport.Street food: Our favorite was the egg bread stall! Location kept changing for the 3 nights we went there. Not all of the street food were hits: the gimbap stall was a disappointment. Bring cash with you before hitting the stalls. The first night, we looked at most of the stalls before choosing what to try, and took note of stalls where locals lined up.Restaurants: As stated, there are discount coupons on a few restaurants available online. There are a lot of restaurants in the area. We didn't encounter any lines in well-known restos, but we did come in during off-peak hours.Souvenirs: There's a stall selling character socks that would make a great souvenir!"
Busy shopping street ,"This is one the busiest shopping street in Seoul. Lots of shops selling cosmetics and restaurants. Very busy and lively area.We came in the evening, so there were a lot of street food vendors around. A good way to experience the local food."
Very Good Place to Stroll,"Shopping Street is very nice to walk around. There are many interesting shops, most of which have products not sold overseas. Restaurants are in every street with a wide variety, and have many currency exchange centres if in need of exchanging cash."
Awesome place,Big tourism trap but many goos earieries and shopping variety with street performers. Very interesting for the tourist.
Good area for shopping especially Korean Beauty Products,We love Myeongdong at night. We went there 3 times when in Seoul last July. Love to shop in this area. We can even bargain at the street seller. My kids love the street food. 
Great shopping and even better food vendors,"Myeongdong shopping street is the Mecca for cosmetic and skin care but also has all the regular shops such as Uniqlo, Nike and Forever21. The best bit has to be the food vendors who set up at 4pm every day and serve long into the night. Everything from ice cream, scallops, chicken, noodle dishes and lobster for very reasonable prices. An excellent dinner choice."
Shopping delight,This is so cool. It's a food frenzie with outdoor vendors cooking on the street. Shop til you drop here too. We went several times.
Shopping with my daughter,Great fun. We came for skin care. Make sure you research and know what you want. The sales people work on commission and are good at selling you what you don’t need. I have way more than I will be able to use this year!
all you the korean cosmetic you coud wish for,"if you are looking fo korean cosmetics, all brands are there. from high end to more mainstream. great food booths in the street; better to experiment in the evening with all the lights and the crowd."
excellent shopping,You can have good shopping experience. Almost all the branded shops are there. Street food were amazing
Shop till you drop,"A shopping area where there are lots of food stands selling dumplings, shrimp tempura, noodles etc. Can be very crowded. "
Nonstop cosmetics,"I think personally when shopping here must be smart to see promotional programs. as most of Etude's brand examples, have many stores and are located in every aisle. do not rush shopping. I have experience when cosmetic shopping in myeongdong, it turns out the price is more expensive than in the online shop. so we have to be smart in shopping"
Best Thing to do in Seoul,"Budget street shopping galore, bring cash for the food stalls. Staff are always very friendly, and you can get free things like facemarks and hand mirrors just for being a foreigner. "
Absolute Must!!!,"This place is what made me fall in love with Korea!!! It has AMAZING street food to try, lots of streets to explore, and tons of stores to explore. Myeongdong was the highlight of my trip!!"
Lots to see eat and buy,"About a 20min walk from Seoul train station or 2 subway stops. Bring good walking shoes. Lots of shops, restaurants, things to see. "
Wow your food senses,A very busy street market with a lot checking out food & other items. Little shops & restaurants dotted the streets. Get a sense of the local food etc.
very busy and exciting,if you like shopping then Myeongdong Street is the place where you must visit. even if you didn't buy any thing then you will enjoy the busy place. good for walking around and grab something to eat. many local and international brands also cosmetics
Good shopping street,A lot of shop and various food can be found in this shopping street. You have to bargain the price in some shop in order to get cheap price
"SHOP, SHOP AND SHOP","This is definitely the place for shopping and more shopping. Great for people watching and towards the evening the night street food and market stalls brings live to Myeongdong.You have gyoza, pancakes, baked eggs, lobsters, prawns, scallops on shell, Oreo churros, Middle East stall, teobukki, fruits, juices. Already our third day and cannot finish trying all the food.Cosmetic haven for Korean brands that you have never even heard off.Restaurants are aplenty too.Unbelievable!"
Shopping and street food,The street market have many Korean brand cosmetic shops and sells various local street foods. A place definitely should visit when you are in Myeongdong.
Beauty products,By far the highlight of this shopping area was being given free sample beauty products just for going into the store for a 10min browse. Bulk packs are easy to buy here and make great gifts for friends back home. There's lots of other clothing stores but they don't cater for Western sizing. A great place for people watching. Many different types of food to try. I had both the 32cm ice cream and the flower gelati from Milky Bee. The Rose flower ice cream is unmissable!!! Check out Art Box whilst you're there...it was a great shop full of everything and anything. Take your passport for instant tax refunds whilst you're here. Kpop merch available in the underground subway mall. 
K-POP fans must go,"Easy to navigate and safe to walk around. A good place for teenagers to do shopping, no matter you’re looking for cosmetic or fashion, this is a place to visit."
Exciting But Just One Visit Will Do,Street market from clothes to accessories to food to gadgets! A must visit but only once if you in Seoul. 
Messy shopping area,"This shopping area is lined with a large variety of stores, from luxury stores to snmall shops. It is impressive how many cosmetics shops are gathered in a small area."
Shopping and Street Food,"Best location to shop and shop till you drop. Also, a place to eat delicious street food. Great outing"
Paradise for beauty products shoppers ,Paradise for beauty products shoppers. With lots of different brands shops. Nice place to stroll around.
Fantastic Street Food,"We absolutely loved every bite of street food in Myeongdong! Some of the vendors had similar food items but my favorite was the cinnamon sugar filled fried pancake thing. We didn't do much shopping because we were enjoying sampling different foods, but we did go in a Cat Cafe in the area which was fun. The streets were busy with people but this was definitely one of our favorite places in Seoul."
very big market,"visit myeong dong market is must, thousand of cosmetic shops. almost all gives out samples to lure customers. loved shopping. "
Place must go when in Seoul,Busy streets with plenty shops. You can find everything you want including cosmetic and gifts. Many restaurants there which provide various local food. Also some money exchange shops give very best price for you. Don't miss it!
Utopia for fun shoppers,"If you are looking for cosmetics, trendy clothes at a bargain price, this is the place to be. There are also the latest gimmick items and shoes, t-shirt shops, etc. Oh, and the street food stands are abundant, selling variety of Korean finger foods at a very reasonable price. And, it gets very crowded at night."
Great vibe!,Awesome place to shop and find the famous cosmetic Korean products. It also offers and a variety of foods! 
Shopping and street food,Visited April 2017. Enjoyed shopping here and especially the streetfood. There were so many choices even clothes and anything they can sell in the street. There are also freebies when you buy at the shops. Make sure to check out the promos first before buying so that you get the best deal.
Nice district ,Nice district for shopping and eating...can take up an entire day if you’d like. A couple of malls in the area in addition to the more local street shopping 
Nice place to shopping and eat ,"Shopping center, whether for the cheap or cheap. Some gifts can be obtained here. Places to eat are also many choices. Easily reachable by subway or taxi."
Shopping but everyone sells the same things,"very touristy, basically every shop here sells the same things and every restaurant sells the same food, many times at the same price. "
Busy Busy,"this place was full when we walked around on a hot summer day, very nice to walk around, a lot of shops and great restaurants. Definitely enjoyed myself here, watching local koreans shop and eat at their favorite places."
Chaotic and funky smells,"My first impression was the chaos of too many people. This is to be expected, as in any other shopping street, but what was really annoying and shocking (at least to me, as a person who has been to a lot of other shopping streets) were the cars, trucks and mopeds speeding through the really narrow and crowded main street. You constantly have to look behind your shoulders to avoid being run over by 4X4 cars, because Koreans do not stop for anybody! I was excited to try some Korean food from the food stands, but I was put off by the strong sewer smell that kept hitting me everywhere in the street. Not to mention the pigeons and flies that were around the food stands, and meat just lying unprotected in the heat of the sun and out in the open. (Also, lots of Korean men hocking loogies in the street). My excitement for shopping in Myeongdong kindled away when I realized that there were at least three of the same brand stores spread around Myeongdong that sell you the exact same things. Store clerks made me feel awful and like a thief, because they followed me around. At one point I turned around to look at something, and almost knocked down the store clerk because she was literally breathing down my neck. I found it really annoying and inappropriate that people working in the stores stood in front of the them, clapping their hands in your face when you walked by, screaming and shouting trying to sell you something or give you ""free"" samples. Also, if you're (specifically a white) female, you might have old Korean men coming up to you asking for ""massages"" with their wallets out ready to pay you. Not as great as I thought it would be - as a matter of fact, very disappointing."
For the beauty and fashion lovers,"Amazing shopping street with a variety of clothing and beauty shops. In the evening the street vendors come out so you can get a taste of the delicious street foods, Korea is known for. "
Myeongdong street and area to shop and hang around !,"This is kinda street that full of stores, international and Korean brands, also some culinaries along the street. Car and motorcycle still pass this street, this is uncomfortable for visitors. The highlight for us is Line Friends store, we can shop.and take photos especially on the 2nd floor."
Shop and eat,Is very suitable for teenagers.Sell so many product of korea. And culinary (street food) also very delicious.Must try!! Trust me the price is cheaper than other
Skin care paradise ,"We were advised to shop around the Metro Hotel area. I found all sorts of new skin care products which I now use with good effect on my maturing skin. My beauty routine will never be the same. My sons bought clothes from the street sellers, and they’re of good quality. It was raining on and off and we did not stay long."
Best Tourist Place,"This is the best place for people who like shopping. There are so many stores from make-up, clothes, jewelry, bag, and even food-street. In here the brand is not just Korean brand but also International brand also available from Booths (UK cosmetic store to H&M and Zara).For the food street, bag, jewelry, and bag, they required you to pay using cash only. So please be prepare to bring your cash here. But for the make-up store they can receive payment using card and cash."
Lively area!,"Visited this area almost every night during our 8 days stay in Seoul. Lots of very nice street food, restaurants and cafes in this area. Very lively and happening especially after the sun goes down. Must visit! "
Shopping stopover,Went twice in the day and once at night..... bustling area with so many shops ..... but cater mainly for young adults and teens.Nothing interesting for older folks to browse.Food outlets are good and cheap.
"Bring cash, patience and wear tennis shoes!","I go to Myeong-dong once a year. Summer here can be brutal: crowded and extremely hot and local people are impatient and they push, shovel and spit regardless of age and gender. People here mainly for the street food and souvenir marts. I am not too sure about the street food because I walked through the whole areas noticing they are all the same - deep fried seafood (6000w/cup), grilled cheese (3000w/stick), fruit juice (4000w/cup), fried noodles, grilled shrimps (6000w/stick), & shallow fry dumplings and rick cakes, etc. During the weekends, they start setting up around 2pm. If you do not like too many crowds, go during the day.If you cannot take the crowds, you can try the restaurants in the malls on the top level (not food court) and find some peace there. Apart from the street food, restaurants on the sides of different alleys could be a good choice too but make sure you compare prices as they serve similar food.I personally do not like it too much. Its too crowded, too noisy and too dirty (from street food)."
So fun,"We loved browsing the fun things sold on the street, and the fact that it runs into the food market is a huge bonus."
SHOPPING FOR DAYS,You’ll go in here in the morning and end up leaving at night cause they’re about to close already. Time passes by quickly because shopping here is absolutely heavenly 
Lots of fun places to shop ,"Really fun to pop into the stores in this area. There are also sometimes street vendors selling food or t-shirts and colourful socks that make great souvenirs. There are also a lot of of K Beauty shops in this area, so stock up on your face masks! Try not to get lost while you are having fun shopping!"
Many many shops ,"You’ve got all your favorite cosmetic shops there, so keep an eye open and look for the best offers! They change all the time, even from one day to another so make sure to around before you make a decision to buy something! If you are a Kpop fan, there are a lot of kpop stores but kinda hidden so keep and eye open for them! (They are in basements or upper floors!)"
Lots of neon and shopping,Go at night for the most action. Street vendors in addition to the big stores. Will be crowded but a fun stroll. Lots of food options. 
The place to be for beauty-products!,"As we lived just in connection to this area, we walked those streets on a daily basis! Loads of beauty shopping.. masks, skin-care, make-up you name it! I would recomend you to read up on brands in advance and decide approximately what you are after ;). It is very easy to get ""sucked-in"" to the stores and get things sold to you that you weren't going to buy :D. No matter if you are male or female, there are masks for everything! Beard? no problem, there are solutions for that too :P. Among all beauty shops, there are plenty of food places and in the evening, the street-market-stalls comes out!"
Good for everyday walking,"We visited regularly during our trip to Seoul, almost everyday. The street food is amazing, ranging from light snacks to almost full meals. Although the crowd is huge, you don't feel like a foreigner while walking the streets due to the diversity of people and goods."
Crowded yet very entertaining,"It was Sunday when i went to this street to look for souvenir for my family and friends after i found out that Dongdaemun Market closed on Sunday.Very crowded place with tourists and locals. The food were amazing to look but if you not into Korean taste, i won't recommend you to buy or eat it. The taste might disappoint you. I love food! Love to cook too. So it was not as i expected to taste and i waste money on it. But if you just don't care about money then go ahead and buy the food streets. "
Cosmetic is the majority there,"There are many many shops there such as cosmetic, street food, clothes and so on. There are many variety of cosmetic products. My wife really enjoy her shopping there."
Great place to shop and eat,The best place to shop and eat whilst in Korea. Best experience of the nightlife in Korea too. You can get all your souvenirs from here.
"Lively shopping area, get a map","Came here specifically to look for cheap glasses, which I did not get, but it is a lively area to eat some street food and do some shopping. Before you start, get to an information office, there is one near Boots on the main street, and get a Myeongdong guide map of the area. Apart from the streets it tells you where different types of shops are, restaurants, toilets etc. They also have a Seoul Official Tourist Map, which I had not seen before, which has street maps of different tourist areas, very useful. Try and get it elsewhere at the start of your holiday if you can."
Fun place to be,"Excellent place to be with teenagers, shops catter to all tastes but mainly youngsters. Very good value cosmetics and restaurants. Definitely a must in Seoul! "
"Great food, great shops, great street stands, can't be better","If you are looking for a place with concentrated great foods, great shops, and great local street stands, then this place is for you."
Hidden treasure - Free hanbok trial,Busy place with lots of shopping for cosmetics. The Information centers offers free hanbok trial for 10 mins but you need to register upfront. 
Fun night market street,I love the crowd of fun people & all cosmetic brands that are available there. Fun place to shop & eat. Will go back again tonight
The heart beat of Seoul,"This place is so lively! Several streets lined with boutiques, skincare products, famous branded shops, restaurants, cafes, groceries, money changers, etc..... and by 2pm in the afternoon you start seeing food vendors and all sorts of products wheeling in their carts! They last till around 1 in the morning! The place is so alive! The street food is too awesome to describe! From bbq’s, kebabs, sushi’s, scallops, lobsters, etc..... this place sells the best street food in all of Asia! They are very clean! When going to Korea, Myeongdong is the place to stay! Metro is also near by."
Street food!!,The shopping is plentiful with many clothing and cosmetic stores. You can get free face mask samples if you look through the stores for a few minutes. During the day it’s pretty normal streets and stores but at night all the street food carts come out with really tasty and traditional foods for only a few dollars each. Most vendors speak English or get by with pointing. Many sit down restaurants are located on the 2nd floor or higher so don’t forget to look up. It’s very safe area and gets busy but not overly crowded. Accessible by the metro train. 
Seoul vacation,It was indeed a shopper’s paradise for cosmetic products which Korea is famous for. The small streets were a little confusing but it was fun exploring the shops. A trip to Seoul is not complete without doing any shopping in this area.
SO MUCH FOOD,This place is a foodies paradise. All of the foods that you see ppl on YouTube walking down these alleys eating are right here cooked right in front of you. And the prices are only a couple of bucks an item.
Beauty Products are everywhere,"Good destination for shopping of beauty products. Street foods are good, yummy but not that expensive as you think, :-)"
Beauty and skin products ,"This is by far the most amazing in place for shopping and window shopping skincare and beauty products.You can get there by metro and get off in the Station with the same name.You can also find restaurants and bars to go during, after or before shopping.Locals are crazy for this type of products, foreigners have a difficult time to decide whether to spend all their money thereOr not.Such a wonderful experience for men (set up a business) and women (makeup and skincare products). U can’t miss it"
Very hot but good shopping,"Visited this district during my stay. There are lots of shops underground and above ground (don’t forget to look up). There are shops for everything from clothes, pharmacies, food, banks, electronics, high-end, low-end.If you are a price conscious for clothes then go window shop in the brand name stores and then head out to the street or underground and by a similar looking style for much much less."
Major shopping time!,Great place to shop for facial masks! Lots of shops. Street stalls start to set up for business in the evening. 
Mecca for cosmetics,Has all the recent cosmetics in the shop with new and innovative products. Also had dinner in one of the famous soup places nearby.
a MUST SEE in seoul! ,"If you are visiting Seoul, take your time and visit this street! Especially in the evening. Go there hungry and taste the greatest street food of all time. Sooo many things to choose between. The only thing I can warn about is that buy anything from the little street sellers.. too expensive for Koreas street selling "
You have to see this area,"There is an obscene amount of skin care stores, which is kind of obnoxious. That said, there are a zillion things going on and a lot of interesting things to see. You could certainly be occupied here for hours just people watching. I like it and will probably go back. There is a small concentration of obnoxious religious zealots with megaphones, and pushing pamphlets on you. They seemed kind of concentrated to a certain area, so it's not an overall issue. "
Bustling,Really bustling street .. you can find just about everything here. The street food is amazing but you need to to be there after 5pm .. that’s when all the street food vendors start operating.
K-products shopping spree,"Get yourself a map before you explore the place as it is VERY BIG and can be quite confusing and daunting for first timers. You can find almost every brand possible here, with one brand has several stores spread in every junction.Great place to look for cheap clothes on their outlets, too. Visit the LINE friends store to take a picture with giant Brown.There are some street food stalls and restaurants. The recommended one is Myeongdong Gyoza with their famous guksu (noodles) and, obviously, gyoza."
heaven!,umpteenth times here and i am still not satisfied haha u definitely can bargain more if u know more korean and if u buy a lot! #makeupheaven #skincareheaven
Great base ,Stayed at Myeongdong both 2 years ago and on our last trip. It's a great base to be as it's so lively and happening. There are also a few exchange places so very convenient. I am not big on shopping so wasn't interested in the cosmetic shops and the street food is quite samey and overpriced. The best thing about it is the vibe and convenience in getting to other places- the cable car to Namsan park is not too far away and it's a short walk to Namdaemun. It was nice to step out of our guesthouses and step straight into the energy of the area!
Best shopping and street food ,"This is a place to go for cosmetics. Huge variety of street food stalls, don't miss tempura shrimp. Lots of fashion shops and restaurants. "
South Korea Vacation ,Stayed in area. Very fun and interesting. Lots of different shops and restaurants in walking distance. Convenient for airport shuttle and subway. 
Have fun and get lost,"You can shop here day or night, fashion, name brand Korean cosmetic, shoes, plus many other surprise things to find, if you get hungry, there are many street food stands here, grill lobster tails, grill scallop, bar-b-que beef and shrimp on a stick, fresh fruits and juice, plus many other goodies to enjoy, to shop and to eat or just looking, sure be a fun evening to experience."
Omg so much shopping! ,"So many stores! Lots of skincare/cosmetics stores, jewelry, cheap clothing, knock off designer goods, souvenirs and tons of street food and restaurants. Still active at 11pm."
"Shopping in day, eating at night ",After 4:00pm a lot of street food stands will be open and you can enjoy different types of Korean food. Shopping at Myeongdon is also very convenient. 
heaven for cosmetics lovers,"so many cosmetics store (mostly korean brand), like innisfree, etude house, nature republic, holikaholika, tonymoly, and many more, and every brand has more than 1 store so if you found that the product is sold out in one store, you can try to find it in another store. overall the beauty advisors are helpful, esp in Lush store, they spoke english fluently.In myeongdong u can find not only cosmetics, but also restaurants and street food. the street is clean and at the most of time is crowded, especially at night"
Your search for Cosmetics ends here!,"Cosmetics, cosmetics everywhere on this street. Great place for sampling cosmetics and getting great deals and discounts on cosmetics.In the evenings, this place lights up and offers a variety of street food options, which are a must try.There is also an undergrund market here, which also is quite good.Moreover, the best part is that you can claim your tax free refunds right here, as the office is located inside BOOTS Pharmacy on this main street.Overall, a must visit place in Seoul"
Best shopping area,SHOPPED and bought soooooo much korean products that we had to send a 50kg parcel back to SG from Seoul. Amazing place to shop till you drop! Lots of quaint cafes and street food! 
Shopping delight,"A variety of small shops as well large retail shops the likes of Zara, H&M, Spao, Uniqlo, Forever 21. interspersed between them are food and market stalls. You can choose from a variety of cheap as well expensive stuff. A whole galore of cosmetics shops selling good quality korean cosmetics.Lots of restaurants offering authentic korean foods - BBQ, bibimbap, Galbi, Gimbap and many enticing looking foods at reasonable price. Easy to get to - Myeodong station on the blue line. Nearby departmental store Lotte is just across the road. You can also walk to the nearby Namdaemun market which is about 25-30 mins away. You can a whole day there and still have more to shop the next day."
Sugar Spice and Everything Nice!," Here, even if you pass by the store the salesperson will give you 1 face mask or free facial product sample. I was actually not intended to purchase skincare. But, end up I got offered at Holika Holika for a good price for caviar facial set. Tips to bargain, remember to ask for promotion as they don't tell you unless you ask Street foods are generally clean, reasonable and delicious. It's a vibrant place especially at night. BTW, before we hit the shopping heaven I managed to stop by at the cathedral for prayer."
Great shopping and eat,"We came here twice. 1 in the afternoon and once in the evening. It is much livelier and fun to go evening after 5pm. The stalls are fully opened and yes there are crowds but thats what makes a night market special. I was travelling with a 4yo with stroller and I can still move around comfortably. And that was on friday night. Managed to get some muslim friendly and halal street foods. Also some good bargains for skin cares, shoes and clothes for the teens girls. We spent a few hours here shopping. About same price a Bugis St in spore. We got jeans at $16 or so. The lobster tail was 15,000won per oc was so WORTH IT. Give it a try once. The Cheesy scallop was 10,000won but lobster was better! I love the fried cheese which was mildly sweet. The 32cm ice-cream was 2000won each. Some say its icy but it was good as not too sweet not creamy. Great place :)"
Shop til you drop,"Myeongdong is where you want to shop when in S. Korea, there are alot of good stuff you can buy for a reasonable price. What I really love about this place, aside from the variety of things it offers, is the freebies most specifically beauty products."
Lively shopping paradise,"Traveled June 2018. Great street food, but expensive. It's cheaper to eat in the restaurants. Some stores have salespeople in front of the store to encourage you to come in. Don't take the things they hand out unless you plan to shop in the store and it's not free. It's good to learn the phrase ""I'm just browsing"" in Korean so the salespeople will leave you alone when you're in the store instead of aggressively trying to sell you things. Korean salespeople are quite aggressive. They'll pounce on you as soon as you glance at an item. The cosmetics are cheaper at the airport, but not all items are available at the airport. The street vendors don't come out until after 4PM. Much livelier at night. Bought prescription eyeglasses and frames at Kaist Optical. For transition glasses with protective coatings and frames, it was $190. The eye exam isn't as thorough as the U.S. but if you don't have major eye problems, it seems sufficient. My son has a heavy prescription with astigmatism. Much lighter frames than U.S. frames. Cheaper than Costco in the U.S. The savings are from the frames and free eye exam. The lens is the same as Costco. Milky Bee and 32cm ice cream was only good for pictures. They're icy, not creamy. I liked the Dragon's beard candy. It wasn't as sweet as american candy. What I liked about Korean fried chicken is the sauce and crispiness."
shopping and eating,"This place is wall to wall cosmetics and beauty stores, a big line store is there and also shoe stores and restaurants,the place tend to be crowded at night less people on the day time.. a good place to visit for the experience "
The Orchard Road of Seoul,"As the name suggests, this place is a shopping street that is very happening day or night. Numerous places for shopping as well as dining options from street food to restaurants. Highly recommended!"
korean crowd,"Lots of cosmetics, and street food. Street food is very very interesting though but its a bit pricey for street food."
Good food,"So many choices of food here. A good options for halal food too...Since we're on budget, this was the place we spent our money on rather than a good restaurant. There are a lot of shopping mall around too..."
Shopping belt but quite disorganised,Overcrowding shopping belt and signages quite poor. Not much resting place for people to sit after tiring shopping. Not much shades and hot especially in summer.
Cosmetics paradise,"If you like face products this is the place for you. Basically the same stores show up on every block, it is amazing they can keep all the stores in business in such a small area. Food carts come out in the late afternoon."
night market a must-visit Seoul experience,"Lots of stores and restaurants in this area ranging from local brands to international mid-tier. Street food is a bit pricey, but good variety and small portions so you can try a lot."
Great place to visit,"Cosmetics haven for the interested. Many roadside stalls selling street food, bags, accessories etc. Many restaurants and cafes too. Isaac toast and Nanta theater nearby. A great place to hang out and chill if you like crowds."
Endless shopping,"If you have never been to Seoul, Myeongdong is probably the most happening shopping street you should go to. Getting there is easy by subway, and you could make your way out of the station from exit 5-7. Exit 5-6 is where Shinsegae dept store is and it will lead you to the walking streets in Myeongdong as well. Along the streets, there are many beauty brands, sports brand, fashion labels as well as accessories shops. The shopping is endless and after awhile, you probably noticed that there are more than 1 shop for each beauty labels at different parts of Myeongdong. So if you cannot get what you want at 1 shop, move on, you probably see the same brand again later. There are also many food options, and by late noon, hawkers will start setting up their mobile food stalls along the streets. Saw cheese lobsters going for 15,000 won, which i think is overpriced. There were roasted chestnuts stall, king prawns stall and fishcake stall as well. Actually, Myeongdong is connected to Namdaemun market. In the past when I visited Seoul, I used to walk through Namdaemum market to Myeongdong and things at Namdaemum is slightly cheaper than Myeongdong. For those who have alot of time on hand, try walking from Namdaemum to Myeongdong for a better shopping experience. "
Beautiful street with lots of shops for every taste,Very crowded but amazing and a must do in Seoul.you will definitely enjoy especially at night.also a very good place to test the various foods and beautifully designed fruit trolies. There are also some skin care stores where you can buy face masks with reasonable prices and bonus gifts.
You will never be hungry ,"Lotsa and lotsa of street food. However I find that sales staff from those mask shops are a little rude. They like to give you free mask to entice you to come into their shop. However, if you decide not to walk in, some of them actually curse you( I am assuming from their tone and body language). After a few incidents, i refused to accept any free masks given unless it’s a shop I want to check out. "
Coming back tomorrow,"While walking to our dinner, we passed by. Had some grill lobster, eggs cake, boiled top shell, grilled squid, Oreo churros, orange just before we even reached the restaurant. The girls has so much fun shopping that we vowed to come back tomorrow. It’s so vibrant even on a weekday!"
Shop till you drop!,"They say that Korea is known for their cosmetics and that anyone visiting Korea should pop by the area for some serious shopping!Indeed, I spent quite a fair bit of money on masks and other products. Other than that, theres a lot of good food available in Myeongdong area! Street snacks too!You may/ may not find your way around easily but every area has its own beauty!Definitely a place where you can shop and eat till you drop!"
Shopping & eating,This street is bustling with activities from morning till night! If u like Korean Street food and shopping this is a good place to go. Try strawberry mochii & the tornado potato. The things are not that cheap though. There is a cat cafe there and many restaurants to try too!
Shopping,"Great shopping and delicious street food worth trying; lobster cheese, ice cream honey, cheesy fried rice etc etc"
Good food and shopping with great cafes ,Great places for foodies. Looks of places to shop and eat. Price are not cheap. Good atmosphere and super crowed 
The tourist quintessential.,"The tourist must-go on their visits to Seoul to get their cheap makeup and skincare. GO CRAZY OVER THERE!Pretty good with bustling crowds - adds to the atmosphere. Street food carts pretty expensive. Do not recommend you getting food from there, don’t be lazy, use your GPS and take a short walk over to Namdaemun market for cheaper and authentic Korean food (daaaamn those dumplings, hotteok and bibimbaps)"
Worth a visit,"A lot of food vendors at night. Great for shopping, H&M, Forever 21, Adidas, a lot of stores for beauty product (which stay open very late). Couple of bars around. Overall a chill place to walk around and taste the different foods and do a little shopping. "
Must see and do,"True, there is nothing that sets this shopping street apart from any other in Asia, but I had nice strolls at different times of day. The street food was tasty, I felt safe, and enjoyed watching the people. I treated myself to some Korean lipstick as cosmetics are all the rage. You can find almost anything there and in every price point all around this area."
Lively and exciting street,I walked downtown through Seoul and ended up in the smallest but most interesting street in the city. A great way to finish my trip after a long day of meetings. Lots of people. Lights. Energy. Food. Shopping. It will be my first stop next time.
Relax n Enjoyable shopping n coffee in Garosugil,"This is located at station Sinsa (subway line3) exit #8 - go straight until you get to Dosandaero 13gil and J tower(very high building) will be opposite side in front of you- take Dosandaero 13gil which is Garosugil Where is less crowded and lots of nice shop (local, chain, highend).Loads of restaurants, rooftop cafes! We can spend whole day there. "
Crowded Street Market with many Fake items,"This is a fun market to visit, however the prices need to be negotiated. They tend to be a bit high for fakes, but still worth a visit"
Best cosmetics delas for you ladies,"very animated open air market and shops along the small streets. Sportswear, cosmetics, food and otehr attractions are there. Music and free wifi almost everywhere. Recommended for good deals and discounts. "
For young generation,One of the popular place in Korea. Before I also consider to stay here but in the end stay another place. The card cannot get in to this business street. There's some hotel are just right upstairs of the shop it really look like very convenience for those traveler. Might be I will stay in that hotel next time when I visit Korea.
Great street food,"About shopping, it's a typical shopping street with typical fashion shops. However, there are a lot of food stalls with delicious street food as well as restaurant with local food. Highly recommend to come here for eating instead of shopping"
A to Z,Though i was told it was only for electronics .. i foujd almost all i meeded here.. from electronics to cosmetics to food ..
Great for sightseeing and to try korean street food!,"A great place to experience one of Seoul busiest tourist spot, you must try the night street food here. This place is also the center of korean make up and skin care, but I don't recommend you to buy them because it is more expensive than other places. If you want to find cheaper make up and skin care, go to express bus terminal station or Ewha Univ. Station!"
Clothing stores and lots of skincare stores,"The place is huge with lots of skincare stores. It is almost a one stop place for whatever skincare products that you are looking for. You can find the same brand in every corner and if you miss one, not to worry, you will find another one just round the next corner. To get good bargains, it is probably better to go during weekends as it seems to have more good bargains such as 1 + 1 or 2 plus 2. One tip is to if to their main store as you can find better bargains. One gets easily lost in the maze of shops. It will be good to identify a few landmarks to help you get your way around. At around four to five, there will be street stalls selling various food."
Vibrantly chaotic ,"- it was only 13mins walk from our hotel- it was vibrantly colorful but a bit chaotic as when we were there some campaign for elections was ongoing with so loud speakers - the street shopping was a bit expensive as a simple shirt will costs a minimum of krw8,000 or about usd8, even the street food costs a minimum of krw3,000 for sweet potato Anyway we enjoyed strolling around as it’s very lively especially at night "
Shoppers heaven 😁,"If you are looking for a good place to spend the money, here is a must! Long walking street packed with shops, restaurants and vendor's carts. Lotte department store also located at the same area. Totally recommended to wander around even window shopping "
Great shopping trip,"This place is what i have in mind when I visit shopping street. Lots of shops shouting for attention, lots of street food. Yet there is still sufficient space to stand and look at what is for sale."
Shopping experience,"If youre looking for cosmetics and street food, then, this is the place that you should visit.Lots of stores are open until 11pm and food stalls offering wide range of food types: lobsters, steak, ice cream, dumpling, churros and so much more. I recommend to try the lobster. A bit expensive but tastes sooooo good For the shopping part, most stores give small freebies such as face masks, facial cream. You get a little something even if you dont buy anything "
Lively area,"Like any other big city, the shopping district can be a rather interesting experience and the Myeongdong area in Seoul is not different. In my opinion, this is nothing special - there's a ton of people and stores selling everything between heaven and earth, most of which seem like rubbish quality. In terms of safety, Korea in general is a plus. Not at one time, did we fear anything and even when crowded, it's a safe place. "
very pleasent street,I love this place it was so lively. with ppl and it had every thing you can ever ask for in a place like this. food is great. shops has a lot variety. a really pleasant place
Eat and Shop,Its a nice area to be there especially in the evening when the weather is cool. The place is busy and there is alot of people. There are many street stalls selling a variety of food and its nice. There are also a lot of shops to do your shopping and restaurants to eat.
Brole Market :-)))),"Like to lose myself in that crazy market :-))))You can find everything you want as little presents, souvenirs..."
Touristy but Variety ,Def stop in to grab your Korean skincare (Ennis Free) but no reason to hang out unless the street food vendors are set up.
Free trade takes hold!,"I have been to multiple international shopping zones in my 50+ years of traveling... this is incredible for the diversity of vendors, bargains, and products.. the ability to negotiate is crucial to having an awesome time... this is your prime location in South Korea make sure your shoes are comfortable and that you are prepared for wonderful options.."
Shopping heaven!,"Countless shops! Tourists, please bring along your passport and you get a refund right away. There's uniqlo and daiso in addition to your popular korean brands such as Innisfree, Etude house and laneige. Across the road there is Lotte duty free department store."
A must!,My husband and I decided to stay in Myeongdong and we loved it. At night the streets are full of street food and the shops open till late. Best place to shop for cosmetics and face products. A few of the shops are actually tax free too.Do not forget to buy the cute Korean socks for cheap. I also enjoyed the Korean fried chicken street where you have a range of chain restaurants specialised only in Korean fried chicken and beer. 
Every thing for sale,Very exciting place to visit take your time lots of shopping malls but do take time to look around the back streets this is the best part. 
"Loads of beauty products, shopping and streetside food","My 2nd time in Seoul and Myeongdong is still a very busy and crowded shopping street. You can find many beauty products here and they are cheap! Look for this one shop that sells all brands, it is cheaper than most places! "
Lots to shop and eat,Myeong-Dong becomes really crowded and busy at night. So much to see and eat. Prices aren’t exactly cheap and not everything you see is delicious. You can’t go wrong with the desserts and the takoyaki balls but the egg toast and gimbap aren’t that delicious.So many Korean beauty and skincare shops. Many are repeated. I didn’t enjoy people trying to give me ‘free’ face masks. Some can be quite aggressive. Don’t take them unless you want to go into the shop to buy.
Our frequented shopping place,"Been to other Asian countries for cheap street shopping but Myeongdong is one of the shopping areas that you would always want to go back. Here you would find several good finds for cosmetics, accessories, clothes, bags, toys, Korea merchandise, etc. Along the streets you will also be tempted to try different kinds of street foods and drinks. The area also have several restaurants, coffee shops and dessert places. Some shops close at 10pm while the rest closes at 11pm so better go there early night time. Our family went there for about 4 times in our 6-days in Korea and we still can't get enough."
Nice street at night,A place you need to go while visiting Seoul. It looks like things at starting in the afternoon and end very late at night. Eating in the street is the sport here. 
Good street to shop cosmetics,Lots of cosmetics store along the street good for women to shop. And at night time lots of food vendor with good food to try. 
A place to shop,"My favorite shopping place, but if you want a dress better try to buy from underground shopping centre it is much cheaper. We were new at this place we bought one dress from the first shop we saw and found out it was quite expensive than other shops. There are a lot of free mask samples in beauty shop products like etude house which i think they have 3 or more shops here. We tried many street foods here from ice cream, lobster, steaks and many more. If you dont like spending a lot dont go here hehehe."
Bustling street with lots of shopping and street food,"A must visit in Seoul! These narrow streets are packed with tons and tons of cosmetic & skin care stores, clothes stores and street food. It seemed endless and it's easy to spend one whole day just wonder around this area. Pro tip: there are a lot of hidden away gem above the ground floor shops, so look closely! "
Street food and shopping heaven,"Lots of interesting street food ranging from Turkish ice cream to all sorts of Korean delicacies, the while Myeongdong area is a street food and shopping paradise (particularly for the ladies interested inKorean cosmetics). Very busy till after eleven but still manageable crowds in early June; could imagine things getting a bit out of hand at peak season or when Chinese tourists return in force. Spent a couple of enjoyable evenings there!"
Love it,"Must visit for all beauty lovers. Even if you're not interested in the cosmetics/skincare, visit if you have the time just to soak in the ambience. Would say beauty products are cheapest here, often with masks going for Buy 1 get 1 or Buy 2 get 1 with lots of freebies!!! Nice street food though I'd say they can get a little overpriced... Come with umbrella because when it rains, there is no shelter besides the shops."
What a Fun Place!,"There is a total diversity of shops and people in/on this street in Seoul. The heartbeat of Seoul is very evident there. We visited in the daytime and then the following evening. So many people, just happy to be there...as were we. The pulse can definitely be felt."
"Lots of things to see, buy and eat",The shopping area is not too large and is manageable. Take a slow walk in the morning as some shops open as early as 8 am. There are plenty of good restaurants here and after 6pm there are also many street hawker serving delicious food. Fruits sold at the fruit stall here may not be fresh so I would rather get it from the supermarket. Other than that non appetite and happy shopping!
Bags of Beauty,"This street is not only for women but also for men who loves skin care products at a good price. Make sure to bring a large bag for convenience of carrying your products. Tip for first timers: Tax refund is available for purchases KRW30,000 and up. So cut the retail mentality for a moment and buy all the products you need at a single receipt.Some stores deduct the tax on the purchase but some give you a special receipt which you can encash at the airport. Credit cards are accepted. You have the option to buy in your local currency or in KRW.There's forex fee if you ask them to charge you other than KRW so buy in KRW and let your local card to the conversion . Some stores are hard to find like 3CE and Labiotte but with Google map it's easy(Just like playing Pokemon Go). Street foods are also a must try.Prices are reasonable. I like the hotcake w/sunnysideup eggCosRx,Klairs and other known products can be found at a special shop ALAND. RTW outlets like Uniqlo, Adidas and Nike are present. If you're into socks there's a large store where you can buy everything at KRW1,000each or 11pcs for KRW10,000(it's somewhere at hidden corner ). Cute stickers and stationery are inARTBOX at a good price "
Popular Street For First Timers,"It is still popular to be mentioned for all 1st timers to Seoul. The area (Myeongdong 8-gil) fill with cosmetic products, accessories and local street food. The food stalls will starts at 5pm and if tourists reach there earlier, one can walk to MyeongDong Cathedral for some nice photo taking of Korean Catholic Church which located up the hillside (less than 7mins). "
Lively Street Day and Night,This is the Seoul version of Ximending in Taiwan.Streets full of people night or day. Plenty to see and shop but prices are pricier here at this touristy place. Vibes are good and exciting full of young people and tourists.
Great location!,"Famously known for good shopping, all the good brands are here, along with smaller market stalls and unique places like gun ranges or cat cafes to keep you entertained. Be cautious when on your own, I had a man approach me asking for ""donations"" for a hospital he worked at, and when I said no, he and someone sitting next to me got up and walked away together. Otherwise good food, a LOT of skincare and massage places, and a nice vibe. The Namba theatre is also here which I would 100% recommend going to if you're in the area. "
Street food craze,"Lots and lots of street food. Loved the lobster, pork skewer, kimbap, octopus ball. Did not like the s’mores. Trying to hard to copy Dominique Ansel and it’s not cheap!! Very difficult to find rubbish bin in this area but each designated shop has their own rubbish bin. "
Great dining place & interesting stalls ,"A variety of street food to feast on. Simply too many beauty shops to choose from...giving out free sample of masks etc are some means of attracting customers to go to their shops. There are also stalls & shops selling interesting stuff like socks, clothes, souvenirs etc. Love the dining there..so many restaurants & cafes with nice food. "
Shopping in the local economy,"This is a must if you want to experience shopping for gifts for friends and family. So many different stores and vendors. However, put on some comfortable walking shoes. Glad I did. Ended up waking about 3.5 miles, but worth it! Also, price compare, cause some items will be cheaper in some stores or vendors. Also they have some really cool traditional street shows with traditional dancing in traditional attire. Other fun places are the tea houses. Enjoy!!!"
Overpriced food at a tourist spot,"We spent one evening here, had shaved ice and some street food. Shaved ice was KRW 7900, a simple toast KRW 4500. Some simple chicken skewers KRW 3000 and cheese sausages KRW 4000. Fried idon KRW 5000. Small miserable portion. Didn't buy any beauty products or any souvenirs. We came here a day before our departure, because everyone says you haven't been to Seoul if you don't go to myeongdong. Nah, I wouldn't return to this area again if I'm back in Seoul. "
"Interesting, busy, great street food","We stayed in Myeongdong for our week in Seoul. Gull of action day and night. After exploring many other parts of this huge city we’re pleased we made Myeongdong our base. Very busy Fridays and Saturdays. Well worth trying some of the amazing street food vendors. Great fun, good memories from spending time in this part of Seoul."
Nice area,It could be a nice area to hangout so many shop especially cosmetic If you’re are fan of skin care you’re on a right place 
Fire!,"This was day 3 of our famtour - the place is a shop a holics’ paradise! So many shops and stalls where you can buy practically anything and everything! Just our luck, we suddenly heard sirens and firetrucks coming our way, theres a fire on one if the restaurants! I counted 5 firetrucks making there way to the very busy and crowded streets. Good thing the people did not panic. The fire was out quicks and with no casualty. "
Another memorable place to visit in Seoul,"This is one of those must visit places in Seoul. There is a variety of street food and other stalls, as well as an overwhelming array of cosmetics. Surely a great temptation for all"
Wide variety of items,There's so many beauty products you can see in every corner of the shopping street. There's also a nice selection of clothes and shoes.
Overrated area,"There are a lot of cosmetic shops opened by Chinese, which might not be selling authentic products. Most of the time, the price is slightly lower than the authentic products, while the quality is not on par. Thus, the best place to shop is still the duty free area, instead of the shopping street."
Nice to walk,When you walk around in seoul it is advice to pass by this street! It's crowed and nice but still fun for a walk. 
Shop till you drop for Korean cosmetics,"Myeong dong is where you could get all the K-beauty products, then after tired of shopping, around 5 pm all the street food and some clothes vendors will start lining up on the main street. Nice to see all is happening in one place! The shop staff could be quite pushy offering free mask to get you to their store and buy stuff. Some of food vendors not happy if you just take pictures without buying. "
So much fun ,We love this place myself I been here so many time good place to shop and eat street food ! The price is good but remember you pay what you got for ok !! This place day or night the same attraction with a lot of local and tourists walk and shopping!! You will be there in June 5 can’t wait! 
The perfect place for K-Beauty lovers,"If you are looking for Korean makeup and skincare this is the place to go. It is reasonably priced and chances are, if you can't find what you are looking for in one store then you can walk around and find it in another. It is located conveniently close to the station and there are usually food vendors around if you get hungry. You should aim to go early as it can get busy in the middle of the day. Would recommend to anyone with an interest in K-Beauty."
Makeup & skincare shopping,"Myeongdong shopping centre is convenient to access, because it's close to the station, korean makeup and skincare are everywhere. "
A good shopping center in Seoul...,"If you enjoy shopping a lot surely this place will be your first destination. Aside from this, you can also explore Korean street food during afternoon and appreciate korean its unique taste that savors your day!!!"
"Came for the shopping, stayed for the food","My wife insisted, ""There will be skin care products!"" And there were. If you're in the market for cosmetics, clothes, and the full Korean 10-step skin care routine, you cannot miss out on Myeongdong. Although quiet during the day, the place really comes alive from early evening. It's not too expensive either - you can definitely get some good deals, some which are announced loudly by trendy salespeople standing outside their designated shops.If you're not looking for a new concealer, maybe you're like me and looking for some good food - luckily, the street has a lot of this as well! There are many street food vendors with delicious food, whether you want spicy chicken, fried octopus, tasty ice cream, sticky strawberry mochi, or something else. There are also a lot of restaurants down the side alleys, but since a lot of these will only be advertised in Korean, my advice is to do your research from home and have a few noted down before going. Else you might just end up living on street food. Which, to be fair, is not a bad way to end the night. It's good, and it's cheap."
Main outdoor shopping are of Seoul,Many shops located in a maze of streets and side streets. Lots of outdoor food stalls. A wide selection of stores and eating places
Variety of food but crowded,"There are dozens of stalls selling several food items. While the quality varies it's nice to try several items. Furthermore, there are about a million stores selling cosmetics and clothes. It's crowded at night and especially on weekends."
"Crowded on weekends, less busy week ights","Fun for everyone but make sure you that together as easy to get lost in the crowd. Shop after shop of clothes or cosmetics. Don’t forget to pick up your goodies here! Every shop almost gives out free samples upon purchase and some of the deals are REALLY GOOD.Then there’s the street food. The street is lined with food carts selling mocha, strawberries, ice cream, sushi, grilled meats and seafood and other yummy items. there’s also big brands like Zara, H&M, ABC mart, Boots and uniqlo. Definitely worthwhile to spend a few hours here to get all the shopping done!"
Good place ,Cheap place to shop just like Namdaemun Market . I love the area. You can find fake designer stuffs here. Lotsof cheap stuffs. 
Cosmetics Paradise!,"If Ciosmetics is your thing dont miss this area. A huge trange at very affordable prices and most places will throw in some sample material on top of your purchase. However, dont be swayed by each store telling you that their product is best. Do your research first. Also, try to avoid visiting on a weekend due to massive crowds. It is much quieter on weekdays."
Awsome street with amazing food,"A lot of amazing and tasty street food there, in every single corner of Myeongdong. You should try some, especially the original fish ice cream. The night market will be more crowded, so be careful with your belongings. "
Skin care Shopping ,"Myeongdong is the best place to shop, a lot of skin care brands are located here, many good food also available along the street. Nearby shopping area u can find 2 department store (lotte and shinsegae), that have duty free inside too. Easy to shop when u stay in this area."
Go Shopping,"Nice place to enjoy street food, fruit juice, ice cream and lot more along with your shopping. Place is full of cosmetic shops. Enjoy !"
Great traditional food options,"Spend a few days in Seoul, lots to do and Myeongdong district should definitely be on your list of to-do’sThe food stalls stay till late and offer a great variety of traditional items over and above the many restaurants scattered all over the area. I would recommend to rather snack from the various stalls as opposed to filling up in one stop - you will regret if you did as you walk along!A few great rooftop bars around as well. "
Street Food at its best,"I was staying at Courtyard Marriott Namdaemun (see my review for the hotel). It was a 15 minute walk to Myendong. It is a very inetersting market with lots of shops, specially a lot of skin and make up products for women.What amazed me was all the variety of street food. I tried a few and they were all delicious. I highly recommend strolling through this great shopping area and be adventurous and try some of the street foods. You will be surprised.You can also take Subway line 4 to Myendong Station, snd the market is steps awayAlso Walk 15 minutes to Namdaemun Market for super Cheap stuff."
Shopping spree for makeup and skincare,"If you’re a fan of Korean makeup and skincare, make sure to set at least half a day aside to shop along Myeongdong street. Various brands like Innisfree, Holika Holika, The Face Shop, Banila Co. and more can be found. Though the stores repeat, the prices are the same and all the stores offer immediate tax refunds upon spending a certain amount. Combine your purchase together with friends to get more refunds."
I'm not much of a shopper,"I don't like to shop much but this place is massive and pretty interesting. It has a bit for everyone....but then again that's what most shopping areas cater to ya? I guess you've got to come at least once. Especially for tourists. It is VERY touristy, but hey - I'm a tourist so let it be!There are quite a bit of food places around for you to indulge. Street food on the whole is not very attractive in terms of pricing to me compared to Taipei, this place is a rip off. But we're not in Taipei are we? Transport wise it's very accessible. Metro, buses or cab - take your pick. We had a hotel shuttle that operates in this area so it was even easier."
Good place to shop but there are lots of places with better experience,"Myeongdong is known to be the top tourist destination for makeup and skin care shopping, but I think because of the fame, a lot of shops doesn't treat the tourists right. Often times I got someone reached my hand, handed me a sample I tried to refuse, and pull me inside their store, it's hard to resist. I'm getting better at saying no as time passes, but still, not a really good experience. Price wise, I don't think it'll be any different to any other chain store those brands have. Also their street food is like, super expensive compared to any other places. I suggest to just go to Sinchon or Hongdae for a better shopping and hangout experience. Unless you're in a tour group, or you're coming with a big party, probably Myeongdong will be the wisest choice, because at least, it's English friendly."
Shopping,"This the place with the product so cheap!! For foreign like me, i love it so much! I can find all of skincare that i want"
Best Food in Seoul!!,"This place is seriously one of the best things in Seoul. All the shops and the hustle-bustle feel to the place is contrasted nicely with the nice quiet Cathedral in the back corner. Make sure to come hungry, the street food here is the best and most unique stuff you’ll find, plus it’s CHEAP! Great for vegans, and vegetarians"
Lively street!,"Definitely a place to go for food and shopping, the street have alot variety of food, good mix of retail shop."
Unpleasant experience,"I had good experience when I visited Myeondong 2 years ago. This time, I re-visited this shopping street and was totally disgusted and disappointed! The shop staff were hostile and rude. Their customer service were bad too, especially when I asked for more of the same items. They were so unwilling to get the products which I wanted to buy and simply threw them into the basket I'm holding. Terrible service! Even the street stalls also with the similar attitude, and worse! I was choosing some items and the owner simply asked me not to touch it and chased me away! Goodness, I wanted to buy the items yet being chased away! My friend had the same experience too when she asked for new pair of earrings she wanted to buy from a shop and the staff don't even bother to look for it and told my friend that was the last piece. But when we return the very next day wanting to get some more earrings, we saw the same pair my friend bought displayed on the shelf! Will never buy stuff from those shops and from the street stalls again! Terrible experience and shun us away."
Good Mix,"This street has a good mix of retail stores, marts, restaurants, cafes and street food carts. A must go to place when in Seoul. "
Ready to shopping ,"Spare your money here! I love myeongdong! Cosmetic & skin care shop list never end. If you looking for COSRX & klairs go to Aland shop and for tax refund go to Wonder Place shop level 3, nearby Aland. Other brand like Uniqlo, Fila, spao and the list goes on. Happy shopping!"
Korea trip,"When I was in Korea I went to Myeongdong it was around 4 pm and the street vendors were starting to set up. There was a lot of food, makeup and clothing stores. The food and clothes were relatively cheap, however the makeup could get a little expensive. Be prepared to walk nonstop."
Action Packed,"We stayed at the Hotel28, which was perfect if you want immediate exposure to Myeongdong District. This is a very large, active shopping area with many street vendors offering freshly fried potato chips, shrimp, sausage, pastries, etc. While we here, we had the unfortunate timing of extremely cold weather (0 degrees F or -18 C); however, the markets were always packed. Wherever we went, the streets here (and all over Seoul) were well maintained and exceptionally clean."
Excellent shopping for cosmetics & fashion ,Visited the shopping street where myriads of cosmetic items and fashion trend wear are available. My only challenge is the non English speaking sales people and the description of items only in Korean. 
"Good for street food, less good for shopping to me ",Great street food (although not cheap at all because Korea is not a cheap country) but a bit disappointing for shopping as it misses variety and value for money overall. Worth doing for sure for the nice atmosphere. 
Be prepared to barter,This is a fantastic shopping open market! Be prepared to barter! Best tip I can give has a bit in mind what you are looking for and price prepared to pay maximum. Have it translated into Korean and when you see what you are looking for show them your translation? Korean's are not for the most part English speakers! Look for shops are not afraid to show pricing. If they don't they have 2 prices 1 for locals and the other for stupid tourists. Many shops show we speak english. Have fun !
Worst customer service I've ever experienced ,"I was travelling in Seoul the first time and had the worst shopping experience I've ever had so far. I was shopping clothes in one of stores and there were some problems I was trying to ask the lady behind the counter. She got impatient and annoyed at me very quick because she couldn't understand English well. The harder I tried to explain the angrier she became. She eventually told me to get lost of her shop as she can't be brother to deal with me. I was shocked and humiliated. I've never been treated like that. I don't think I want to go to the place anymore. If you'd like to shop, try somewhere else besides myeobgdong. They don't care about customer service cuz they all know you as a tourist won't be a return customer anyway. "
Fun..fun..fun,"My family had so much fun strolling around. So many shops, korean made or big brands. Street food stalls along the way."
Nice spot,This is a great place to walk for shopping. Make sure and find the area with the street foods. You can get a great lobster sandwich made fresh for you right there in the street there. Best street food I’ve ever had
Great Shopping!,"This was my favorite ares for shopping in Seoul. Large variety of stores from big brand names, to little stalls. They also had a large variety of food stalls. There are a lot of beauty/skin care stores, but there is so much more. Check it out!!"
Shopping and eat,Good place for shopping for stuff like women make up item and shoes. Lots of street food that you can find local are eating as well. 
Madness ! ,Shop till you drop! And also the street food is beyond-delicious and not expensive at all! Amazing just amazing ... 
You won’t go hungry here for sure;-),"Much nice and clean than most of the asian shopping streets. Lots of underground stores too, they are not all connected. Be aware since it’s easy to get disoriented as which one you get out of the underground outlet."
Street market,"Myeongdong is a hype place to shop cheap things and to buy souvenirs and eat halal street food at the street marker itself. Also, along Myeongdong walkway at the train station itself, you will find shops that sells just about anything, traveling bags, travelling clothing, inner wear, souvenirs etc. A good plc for a good bargain!"
Late night shopping and supper!,"Great shopping district especially for those who love fashion, Korean street food and late night desserts! Lots of choices and prices are relatively reasonable. Gets really crowded at night too. Staying at a hotel in this district is great as you can go back and unload your shopping bags and take a rest too! :-)"
BEST location for Cosmetic and kpop shopping,Satisfy ur cosmetic and kpop need in this area. Full of cosmetic road and go to myeongdong underground to shop kpop things.Really crowded in evening to night because a lot of food stall.loveee
Busy shopping streets ,"I think this area is worth your time exploring. You likely can find what you wants to buy, from this place. There are plenty of shops selling clothing, bags, shoes, toys etc etc. Plenty of street hawkers as well. You will be spoiled for choices. Try to move around comparing prices if you have the extra time and energy, as the same item can be going at different prices at different shops. Can be quite crowded so please take care of your belongings when there."
Tourist,If one loves shopping and food Myeongdong is the place. We went there in the evening and noticed that it was a very well lit and lively area. A happening place with crowds of people. It had both locals and tourists. One could shop anything from there famous cosmetics to clothes shoes artificial jewellery Shops like Uniglo Zara H&M Nike were also flooded with shoppers. You get immediate tax refund in some shops if you are carrying passport with you. Myeongdong is the place for food lovers. The streets are lined with all food stalls. I loved eating roasted chestnuts and the berry juice was amazing. There were hardly any dustbins and one is supposed to carry your junk back with you You could even choose small restaurants to fine dining restaurants If you ran short of money there were many money changers there giving good rates It was easy to spend a few enjoyable hours here It is easily accessible by subway
"Great shopping area for local foods, facial/hair/nail stores","Had a great time in this densely packed shopping area. Lots of places to eat, shop, and visit.We were there during spring break and the weather was nice, crowds a bit less, and the prices were excellent."
Hailing,"We witnessed hail for like 3 mins. That's the first one we saw in our whole life. We're here for the skincare products since Myeongdong is known for that. But aside from skin care, you can find lots of stuff here including massage place, restaurants, Korean mart, accessories and many more."
its all here!,all you need for korean beauty products are here! endless choices and helpful staff. they can converse in english too contrary to what i was told before.
Early trip,"A lot of stores, quite a bit of western branded stores with a mix of local. More commercial than local but still worth shopping here. "
Everything in 1 place,"If you have visited Taipei's ximending, i would say this is much bigger compared to it. You will find many brands of cosmetics, fashion, restaurants, coffee places, cinemas and also duty free shops. Many of the cosmetic shops offer direct tax refund. At night you can try all the korean street food along the roads. Careful that you will get lost. They have map to make your shopping experience easier. People tend to visit here more than 1 time. Well i personally go there more than 5 times during my 2 week visit to Seoul. Famous restaurants like myeongdong kyoja, yoogane, aori ramen until Chinese ding tai fung are there. Of course , you do not wanna miss chicken and beer restaurants. You also can find fashion like H&M, uniqlo, zara , forever 21, spao, top ten etc. It is a great place to shop and dine."
"Crowded streets, plenty options of street foods and shopping ","Heaven for shoppers, especially ladies who love Korean cosmetics and skincare products. I also like the street foods alot"
Every man and his dog ,"This is a great area to get the best of everything - shopping, street food, restaurants and even massage places : be sure to get a foot rub. We had one after a long day on the feet for 18000 won for 40mins.Also recommend going at night.This place is not for you if you don't like crowds because this area is humming with people both foreigners and locals which makes it all an amazing atmosphere."
Ok shopping street ,"Shopping street is ok especially for cosmetic products,the good thing are many great Korean restaurants around if you like to do shopping and have a nice Korean meal "
Great place to buy beauty products,"I took my teenager and toddler shopping here. You can sample all the products. The store clerks do not mind. There’s so many shops selling makeup and facial masks. I needed to do some research before we started. We like Etude House and Too cool for School. If you purchase a lot, the shops give you samples. Which is a great idea, since trying some of the facial cleansing samples, I went back to buy more products. There’s a Forever 21 and two h and m stores here. We just popped in but didn’t buy anything.There are also two Daisos in the area. One is in the basement of the Boots building. This one is small. The other Daiso is on the Main Street in a big building. I believe there’s 7-8 floors. You can get makeup brushes, stickers, nail glue etc at Daiso. The quality is pretty decent.Tons of street food vendors. They come out after 2 pm. We didn’t try anything since the prices were a bit steep.We really loved shopping here."
Shopping myeongdong yeay,"Myeongdong best shopping of the year hahahahhaha.. make up, shoes, clothes dll you must come myeongdong"
Some much shopping and street food,"Clothes, food, clothes and more food! If you're looking for street food, this is the place to come and do it, while clothes and trinket shopping. You have massive options, and the portions are small enough that you can go from stall to stall to try other things too. Theres very few rubbish bins about to be wary about that. Some of the stall owners will be nice enough and take your rubbish, even if it's from other stalls :)"
Street Food at its Best,"Sent a week in Seoul within walking distance of the Myeongdong Market . Although the market area has lots of stores and shops that are open during the day for shopping, the magic of the are is in the evening when street vendors roll in and setup and offer street food. It’s fantastic! You can find all kinds of creative offerings. There’s lots of color, food,and people. The spirit and energy is terrific. Check it out!"
Shopping Heaven,great place for those looking for makeups as they have lots of shop lots here.. street food was great as well.. 
"Mask, shoes and food!","Definitely a place to checkout, even if you don't intend to buy anything, somehow you'll end up with something. Street foods are generally clean and reasonable delicious. Walk out of the main street and you'll find plenty of restaurants, convenience stores."
Busy but fun,"This is a very popular area to shop. There is a large variety of stores, but I would recommend going to Uniqlo for great quality and unique every day styles. Be sure to get street food, but skip the waffles. I found them to be too sweet and not worth the hype. Little pastries in the shape of fish filled with custard or red beans are a much better choice. "
Bad experiences with salespersons/promoters.. ,"The shopping street was crowded but I had managed to purchase my favorite cosmetic products.. However, occasionally we had experienced some unpleasant salespersons/promoters along the way.. They use free mask samples as bait, force you to enter their store & then pressured to purchase their products.. Beware of their attitude, these people are short fused & really rude, especially if you'd decided to leave without the purchase anything.. More than one incident, these salespersons gave us a loud sigh & annoyed face, when we enquire something as simple as for an expiry date or a tester..Another incident where the promoters blocked us from leaving the store until we returned the free samples.. These people leave a bad taste in our mouths & we wouldn't be going back there ever again.. "
FOR LOVERS OF KOREAN BEAUTY PRODUCTS,"A must place to be when you so much love the Korean beauty products. You will love all the highlights and sale items. Especially love the friendly store clerks. I was able to shop in SkinFood and Etude, got me great finds."
"Great vibe, very cool place","Very cool place, lots of shops and restaurants. Literally shop till you drop! In the evening, lots of street food too, very cool vibe!"
Love the street food here ❤️,"Yes, Myeongdong = street food, make ups (beauty products), accessories and clothing. It's a vibrant place especially at night. Hip crowd, bright lights. This place is just beside our hotel (Loisir hotel) so it's very convenient and great! "
An outdoor mall - garish,"This is an overpriced tacky place where people go to look the same. Many of the streets have the same shops on them, so you can look exactly like everyone else in Seoul. Shudder.There are some cool street merchants and the century old Catholic Church on the hill are a nice diverting highlight."
"Extensive range of street food, souvenirs","A trip to Seoul would not be complete without a visit here. The night market offers a variety of street food, many of which are Muslim friendly and some even labeled halal. We enjoyed the grilled seafood and roasted yam"
Myeongdong!! Where shopping is an art,"The streets and alleys of Myeongdong is an organized maze of clothes, shoes, accessories, make-up, skin products, and street food for all kinds of budget, mid-price to high price. With the popularity of K-pop, comes the popularity of Korean clothing styles and Korean makeup.This is the place to be! After hours of shopping and you're craving some Korean food - don't go any farther. The streets are lined with food stalls and fancy restaurants. It is Seoul's No.1 shopping district."
Excellent street food + shopping ,One of the best street food experiences I’ve ever had. Everything was super hygienic and tasted incredible.We had cheese baked lobsters and Friend Prawns and Oysters and BBQ Chicken!Also the cosmetics shopping was insane.I feel its a must for anyone’s trip to this awesome city! 
Visit on your last day,A lot of beauty products and clothes were on sale. They give free sample of their products in exchange you enter their shop weather you buy or not. Visit on your last day as it will take all your money if you cannot control buying You will not get hungry nor thirsty as local foods were all around
Shopping at myeongdong,"The street comes alive in the afternoon with all the streets hawkers. Their price is the same for the same items so no need to bargain or compare. Many shops like fila, adidas, nike, uniqlo, spao, abc mart and many more."
Skin care and food ,"If it is skin care you’re after, you’ve come to the right place. Major fashion brands live here as well as good eats for good prices. "
Amazing Local Experience,"This place is very alive with loads of different things to do. Loads of shopping (all kinds) and food. I ate in a small very local place in the sides streets, with local Korean food much cheaper than the restaurants in the main streets. Its very easy to reach my metro/subway and you can spare at least 2 h around the area. worth it! "
Shop and Eat,"Amazing outdoor market close to the Myeongdong station. It seems to cover the whole area where you have a series of food stalls as well as clothing, souvenir or sock stalls sprinkled among them. The shops line the edges of the street which can sell plenty of things like beauty products or clothing. There are also restaurants hidden around the area if you were wanting a place to sit down and rest for a bit.There were plenty of people so it was quite lively. It was a really enjoyable experience and came back a couple of times to just look around, shop and eat."
shoppping,"its a shopping area but sometimes it gets crowded, you can also find restaurants there or you could try the street food"
Crowded Place,You can find a lot of street food and cosmetics in there. Full of people! Fantastic actions are everywhere!
Cool Shopping Area,One of the center of city’s business area.Heaven for fashion and clothing lovers.Food places everywhere and food are considerably cheaper and tasty.Walking distance from Seoul Tower.Easy access from anywhere in Seoul via Metro and busses.
Eat & Shop,"There's a lot of things to eat at Myeongdong. It's quite crowded especially at night with the street food.There're lots of cosmetic shop and some even pull you into the shop. Remember to ask for promotion as they don't tell you unless you ask. My sister-in-law bought some cosmetic and before she paid I went over to check out what she bought and during our conversation then the Salesgirl told us if she buy above 30k won then it'll be 1 for 1. To our surprise, she would save half of what she bought if they told her. Luckily she has not made her payment at the cashier, so she went to look for some more stuff to top up."
Heaven of cosmetics and foods,"Instagram @oppakulinerThe best night market here i guess, i spend my 3-5 hours here to eat some great foods (their gingseng soup and chicken are so good) and accompany my friend to buy a lot of cosmetics. The crowded can be handle because the place is so spacious"
The best place to get all your cosmetics and skincare. ,"You'll find multiple stores of common korean cosmetic brands including Banila Co.Brands like Cosrx can be found in Aland.For foreigners who spend above 30,000krw, you can get immediate tax refund when you produce your passport at payment. They may not always ask for your passport so you're better off producing it anyway.The street food can get a bit pricey but it was enjoyable! "
Very crowded but great place for shopping ,"The street is super crowded. Be prepared with many people pushing you around.The street food is very expensive. We recommend you to eat at some proper restaurants rather than having street food.It is a great place for shoppaholic. You can find many great items from cosmetics to skincare, clothes to contact lenses, souvenirs to jewellery in this street."
Cosmetic shop,"If you like to buy Korea cosmetic, you can go here. If you are fans of ft island, cnblue, AOA and the others artist of FNC, you can go to the fnc wow, they sell cake and latte and others."
Amazing Nights/Strange Venues,"This is a place that has everything for shopping - even a Cat Cafe. It is certainly busier at night, so be prepared for the crowds."
BANG FOR THE BUCK!,"this is the shopping haven of all shoppers!everything is cheaper than those sold online - from shoes to cosmetics to clothing. everything is here. oh wait, did i mention FOOD? as you walk all three blocks of the district, you'd always get hungry. so whenever you go, wherever you look, there will always be food that will suit your taste. from lobsters, oysters, skewered beef steak or chicken, sweet and spicy chicken, fresh fruit drinks, and the infamous egg bread!! OMG all of you must try the egg bread. i can't describe it. it's just too good! ofcourse they have ice creams, and bingsu and all. they also have several restaurants and bars and cafe's (dessert and coffee cafe's) that will cater to your liking. everybody that goes to south korea always goes to myeongdong."
"Touristy, but super fun!","I love Myeongdong. It's super touristy, so don't go if you're looking for an authentic cultural experience. But if you love shopping and street food, this place is definitely for you."
"Eateries, Cosmetics, KnickKnacks",There’s never a boring moment here. A must visit - and visit over and over. Saw other parts of Seoul but this is the happening place.
Cosmetics galore!,"We were staying in Lotte Hotel Seoul and the Myeongdong market was right opposite the hotel. We went once in the evening to enjoy the street food stalls which start from 0500pm and enjoyed the atmosphere. We had also reserved the last day for exploring gthis market, but turned out that there's not much for those like me who are not into cosmetics and beauty products. I would have preferred to spend the time elsewhere, especially when we had already visited all other other popular markets in Seoul by then. Comparatively the nearby Namdaemun market has more character to it."
It can be extreme,"Myeongdong is always a good location for tourists due to its proximity to city center, many shopping and restaurants, as well as plenty of money exchange with best price.It is a paradise for girls/women as there are many skin care and fashion shops. The shops close late at night so there plenty of time for making choices. The apparent good side is exactly its shortcomings. There is nothing else to do from shopping skin care. It is actually small and one can walk through every single alleys within one hour. If shopping skin care is not the ultimate purpose, Dongdaemun in fact has a design complex which adds a bit more cultural content. For vibrancy and youth culture, area around Hongik University is my first pick."
Cosmetics!,must visit place for shopping especially cosmetics. cheap and so many discount here! bring your own bag here for shopping! for the streetfood i dont recommend this place cause its expensive and the taste just so so. 
Everyone must experience at least once ,"A bit touristy but you must experience it at least once. Beauty products, food an people everywhere! Shopper's paradise "
Shop till you drop!,"If you're up to shopping, this place is a must. Well for beauty products, this is very a must. I still find some buys in Philippines are cheaper but in here they give you too many freebies if you buy just a single item. As for the street foods, the egg bun is way cheaper in Insadong than here. KPOP albums are cheap in here too!"
"A Pleasure To Wander, Eat and Shop","There’s a wide variety of snacks you can try, from octopuses to lobsters, kebabs to steaks, egg cakes to scallops in shells. There are stalls selling socks, home decor products, suitcases, clothes, etc. You’ll definitely find something you’ll want to buy. If above ground shopping is not enough, you can check the underground mall. "
Great fun,"There is so much shopping to be done in Myeongdong especially if you are a K beauty fanatic. Every major brand is in the area so you can really stock up on all your favourites. Also, there are enough restaurants and coffee places to keep you entertained. Very touristy so if that's not something you are into, then this isn't the area for you. It can get pretty crowded and chaotic but thats part of the experience."
"Best place in Seoul for shopping, money exchange, eat and eat!","If you do not want to travel much for shopping, eat and money exchange, this is the BEST place to stay and go in Seoul!Things might be a little pricey due to this is the most tourist population place but you can really get almost everything here.There are lots of food to choose from as well. From street food, to restaurants...As for money exchange, so far the best rate I found is the 大使馆 (As shown in my photo). It is located just in front of the ambassador where there are many police outside, so very safe as well. There are also shinsegae, young plaza and lotte department store opp the start of the long stretch of street food.NOT TO BE MISSED! The Line Friends store which holds the biggest Brown! (As shown in the photo)"
Shopper's Paradise,"For those that absolutely need to do shopping whilst on holidays in Seoul, then this is definitely the place for you.Don't worry, you're not alone since virtually every other foreign tourist out shopping is here too - yes, it gets very packed!"
Lively ,We passed through here by default whilst going from a to b. It was certainly lively If you are in to shopping site you would enjoy this areaSome street food
Shopping And Food trip,"Shopping haven, dont miss out the small groceries on the secret alleys you may want to check out their food souvenirs around. "
Tour,The best place where you can find all what you are looking for... starting from Korean beauty products to street food & clothes. I was lucky to have this market just on the other side of my hotel ‘Lotte Seoul’ 
Must Visited,"The busiest market in Seoul (comparing to Insadong, Gwangjang, Itaewon, Namdaemun). Visited this market several times during my five days in Seoul. Myeongdong Shopping Street is the best place for make-up hunter, and popular brand products. Will be better to visit at night when the light envelopes the crowd. Very recommended."
Korean cosmetics heaven,It is good to buy cosmetics from here. There are many popular brands and many choices of seller who offer discounts. The food is killer too. Would be here sometimes again
"A bit of a tourist trap, but still worth seeing ","Busy shopping area near the center of Seoul. You can find good deals there. After 4pm, the street food venders come out. That is truly worthwhile. "
Fabulous Street food ,"Shopping countless shopping and Countless people back and forth, lot’s of shops and the street food that start’s at 5 pm, good tip is bring or buy lot’s of water to have with you while going all trough the street food vendors and eating them. Bring a trash bag with you and lot’s of tissue or wet tissue to clean your hands in between vendors...and enjoy this area..."
Cosmetic street,Filled with Korea cosmetic shops. All products are cheaper compared to Singapore also. They have different sales promotion like 1+1 / 2+2 
Beauty and food street ,Best for beauty and cosmetics here.. each shop is slightly different.. there are alot of restaurants here as well.. the street come to life about 6pm with many street goods to choose from but at a price.. the food is not cheap..
Neat shopping area,"Cool shopping district in Seoul. Close to the subway. All kinds of street food vendors from chicken on a stick, egg bread, crepes, octopus. This seems to be the spot for beauty items. A lot of options in that category. Plenty more besides that. There are also a meerkat cafe that has a raccoon, cats, Arctic Fox and wallaby. Just have to be 14 or older. 12,000 won. 5th floor next to the savoy hotel. Couple tips there are multiple of the same shops, so if you are using a shop as reference you might get turned around. No public restrooms we could find, so if you need one you will have to find most likely a restaurant to find a restroom. Also recommend looking up when walking though the streets, there are stores stacked on top of each other. You will need to take the steps to the 2nd , 3rd or higher floor to enter the stores. If you can’t find something most like it above another store and easily overlooked. Worth the experience. "
Spent all day here ,"You could spend pretty much all day here since there are so many shops, restaurants and cafes. The vendors start to set up shop around 4pm in the middle of the streets. That’s when it starts to get crowded and people are lining up for street food. My favorite was the lobster tail but you have to find the right person that takes his time to prepare the lobster tail and make it right. There were about 5 lobster tail stands spread throughout the shopping street. This place looks nice during the day as well as night. It’s less crowded during the day but you wouldn’t get as much street food as evening and it dies down around 9pm which is probably the best time to go to avoid the crowds but still get to try a little bit of each of their foods. "
Everything!,"Food, clothes, cosmetics, music... there is everything! Around 6pm the streets start to be really full of people. Went there 3 times in 4 days!"
Shopping & Eating Paradise,It is a shopping paradise for shopaholics. However the streets food here are not cheap though. And basically you will keep passing by salesperson from the stall trying to you into their store by giving you freebies. Do not go in if you are not interested of the products and do not be enticed by the freebies. Cause they will only give you the freebies after you have bought something from the store. And the salesperson attitude will change 180 degree if you do not buy anything from them after entering.
Cosmetics again!,"When you came to Korea, it is a fun place to go. You can buy good cosmetics at very reasonable price. You can go to the department store, Lotte, I personaly like 新世界departmentstore. I love shopping on the basement floor at the department stores. good food, and easy shopping. But if you are an experienced visitor, Myondong might be little bit tiring."
Streets of Goodies,"Myeongdong, a shopping district heaven I would say. This is a must-go-to-place when you are at Seoul. From fashion to food, to cosmetic and cafes, this is like a one stop point!Had the latest trend food - Issac Toast as part of our breakfast and there are 2 outlets at Myeongdong. The one which is always long-queued, is located near Days Hotel, facing road. So we headed to the one inside which queue is 3 times shorter. Had porridge as our breakfast at 多味粥 and it is located at a basement storey. We had our lunch at 明洞饺子 and their noodle is really yummy. These restaurants you many use google map to find them. Do remember to bring a bag pack with you if you have a long shopping list.CheersJazlyn"
"Cosmetics, Street Food and Nanta","This is really a place for skin care or cosmetic fans. A lot of the big brands have a handful of their shops scattered in each direction. There is a lot of street food available so it feels quite festive. We enjoyed watching the Nanta show at the UNESCO building. I wouldn’t recommend it for food or clothes. Lotte mall is nearby but prices are really steep. Cosmetics and skincare is good though, lots of discounts given, freebies and you are likely to find sales people who can speak English and Chinese. Do your research before going on what you want, not all shops have all products, just go in show the picture and if they don’t have it, they tell you immediately and you don’t waste time. For the same brand Clio, we bought two Kill Cover cushions in Myeongdong for much cheaper than a similar cushion we bought in Busan."
Not cheap for street food for some of the stores,lobster cheese krw15K。sweet potatoes at myeongdong food street selling @3k/piece vs at 7-11 krw1.7k. 
Tons of cosmestic and salesperson waving freebies,"there's many of the same cosmetic shops in all over myeongdong. Some of the quieter ones don't got salesperson outside waving freebies - so you might wander a bit further to another outlet of the brand u are looking for. There isn't much shopping for clothes to do here, and some of the eateries vicinity feel more of Chinese-ish than korean-ish. So if you are looking for authentic Korean food, choose wisely. "
Shopping heaven,"Many cosmetics shop with very reasonable price. A must go place when you are in Seoul as we can try many local food as well. For muslims tourist, there are many Halal food stall along this street. "
Fun place to be day and night,During the day it is relatively quiet. You can easily stroll through the streets and browse in the shops. At night it becomes a street market with numerous food stalls and street sellers. Great atmosphere but super crowded.
fun street! shop til you drop!,"This is the main place for shopping, tourist-trap kinda place, food everywhere!!! During the day, it looks like a regular street with lots of shopping stalls, then around 4pm to late at night, the street food event happens. On average, street food costs $4-5..The stores are the same on the next few streets as you walked through the entire Meyondong areas, lots of cosmetic shops, they are offering pretty much the same deals. There is Paris Baguette, McDonalds, Daiso, minimart, H&M, Forever 21, Line Friends, lots of restos and more shops within shops!!!"
Great deals,"Great atmosphere, friendly vendors, smaller than I expected but still great place to get gifts for ALL price ranges. Great deals all around!!!"
"Expensive street food, but with great restos and shops","This places offers a lot and can be a one stop place if you like shopping for shoes and skin care products. At night, a lot of stalls come around, but their food is expensive! $3-$6 is expensive for street food, but well... had to try what they have because I want to a gastronomic adventure. If you are in a group, I suggest you go to restos around this area because their food is better abd you can comfortably sit and put your food on the table.There are also a lot of other shops for shoes, clothes and beauty shops here and there. Overall, this place is definitely a must visit. It's also near Namdaemun Market if you want to go. It's also packed with tourists btw and when the weather is cold, come to this place because there's a lot of people = heat. lol"
Shopping ang delicious local foods street,"It is the famos shopping place in Seoul who visit to Korea, recommen to shopping here. It is the center of various popular products such as cosmetics, shoes. All the streets in Myeongdong, fashion for men and women The clothes are the most popular brands in Korea and from abroad. I was very crazy to bought 3 pairs of shoes here and many cosmetics for souvenirs for my friends. I thought going back to shopping here again soon. It is cheap and good quality. Ah! don't miss to eat many local foods at Myeongdong food street. Very delicious. "
Great shopping & street food area,"I really enjoyed this area for 2 reasons:a) great shopping for Korean cosmetics. the choice is amazing, and there discounts/offers/loads of free samples everywhereb) street food: really really yum. my favourites have been - chicken dishes and lobster with cheese and finally, the vibe is very special also, stop by Line & Friends. huge brown teddy bear is very cute"
"Fashion, Food & Cosmetics","THE place to find a good bargain of cosmetics and fashion. If you are willing to walk and explore this huge complex of shopping area, you will definitely find good stuff from fashion, bags, and snacks / Korean food. Just walk around and enjoy the lively environment. Local snack food are available abundantly."
Street of fun,This area was so lively. Everything is in it already. The shopping experience plus the best food in town and beauty products. Cheap and good and so clean. I fell inlove with this very busy street. 
Beauty Products Galore,"Great place to buy beauty products. They give a ton of samples with each purchase. Beware though, as some items are much more expensive than Hong Kong. There are also some trendy street wear shops. Mostly went there to enjoy the street food. After a while the stalls just keep repeating with the same offerings. The grilled lobster with cheese, baked cheese and egg bread were our favorites. "
"Cosmetics, Fashion and Food","This is a place to find a good bargain of cosmetics and fashion. If you are willing to walk and explore this huge complex of shopping arena, you can find some good stuff from fashion, bags, and snacks/korean food. Its a mixed things you can found here. Just walk and enjoy the environment.Try the local snack food, it is good and delicious. "
Shopping ,"According to my search and read reviews the one and only decent shopping street of Seoul. Lots of cosmetic shops, local street food stalls , import and local brand fashion and clothing shops etc "
Ain't cheap anymore,"Visited the night market of Myeong-dong and found that food and goods are no longer cheap like before. And the food offered are just repetitions, u can see the it repeats every 10 stalls..... It's getting boring in Myeong-dong"
Food Trip and Shopping Mecca!,"Getting to Myeongdong Shopping Street is fairly easy, just get off the Myeongdong Station and any Exit will lead you to it, some nearer than the others but just look at the directions from the subway and you won't get lost!You need to come here HUNGRY...my cousin and I strategically planned :) and that means, eating whatever we can on the first night then come back on the second until we have exhausted everything..well, guess what, we never did tasted everything, but I am sure we did abt 98%! What we did was buy one of each from stall and shared that way we're able to taste a lot in one go, we came back for the next 3 days and still wasn't enough. we keep coming back for some like the pastry shaped like fish and had red bean or sweet potato inside..so yummy!! the steak and veg was so good too! it's an experience and a real good one at that. one tip or maybe two:bring water and bring a bag for your rubbish. stalls doesn't always have bin bags and if you're like us who likes to walk whilst eating then dispose of your rubbish well.Myeongdong just doesn't stop with the street food..it is littered with shops,,anything you want can be had here, most specially skin care...and don't just buy from one store, shop around coz you'll see some deals in one shop that you won't see in the next! and when you see it, buy it because going back is chaotic...there's so many shops of the same name and the streets are quite confusing most specially at night when a lot of people are roaming around!Have good fun and eat plenty!!"
Nice place to shop in Seoul,"Definitely one of the best shopping and eating area in Seoul. You can find numerous shop here. And some cosmetic shop give customers free mask sheet to invite them into their store. Some good bargains can be found here.There are many famous and traditional Korean restaurant here namely Kyoja, Sinseon Seolleotang, Hadongkwan...However, I didn’t see any bar or pub here."
Busy but you can find almost anything here,The shopping street plus all the street food sold along this street made the area so unique. You can try the street food sold - they are quite tasty especially the bake sweet potatoes.So many shops that sell souvenirs and beauty products. A good place to shop.
Shopping haven for beauty and skincare products,"Myeongdong has everything from food to shopping. You'll find every possible thing for beauty and skincare routines, through all price ranges. The street food there is amazing.. a mix of sweet and savoury. It is the most lively during evening, around 6-7pm.. and most shops are open till 9 or post 9pm too. It was one of my favourite places in Seoul!"
Women’s Shopping Heaven,Cosmetic shopping is a must when coming to Myeongdong!! Passageways are also filled with restaurants and cafes. It is litterally my favorite place. I almost went there to shop every night after my day trips!!
Busy place,Lots activties but roads are not even and i had a sprain.Lots of street food to try!Don't feel it is an ideal place for elerly.
Much to take in!!,"Shop to your hearts content while taking in the sights of an amazing experience. A busy city with bustle and hustle all over, this area can provide you with cheap souvenirs to upmarket items that will tempt the hardiest shopper. Definitely worth spending some time here if you are visiting the city."
Great,Amazing place to walk around and try all the crazy streetfood...HUGE variety of stands! Interesting to go people watching
The nice place to enjoy ,"I love this market the most. I’ve been to all recommended markets but Myeongdong is the best for me. I really enjoy shopping there. There are many cosmetic shops, clothes and also restaurants. In the evening you can find lots of the street food. The price is reasonable too. You can spend a day there!"
Good place for street food and shopping ,"Although it's a bit touristic but it's a good place for Korean street food and nice place for shopping too. You can get your best deal on cosmetic, fashion and phone accessories here. There's also many restaurants and bars. "
Beauty products galore,"Lots of shops and street food. Shops that sell beauty products are aplenty, and I highly recommend trying out their products. Keep an eye too for discounts! There are also clothing stores, from reasonably priced to expensive. There are also good restaurants here, both Western and Korean."
Good place,The area is good you can buy small thing as cap and phone cove .. too many thing to eat .. I will recommend the place 
Street food,Had a taste of fried milk which was nice since I hv never tried that before. Lots of street food and Korean skin care products
Food Food & More Food,Love the many varieties of food and the buzzling of the night bazaar! There were just so many food ard and shopping that we kept coming back!
dont waste your time,"If you have been to Thailand or Taiwan night markets, this will be an utter dissappointment. Street food is average at best. Type of food sold was fruit, fruit juices, potato, noodles, chicken, beef, buns, biscuit, cheese, repeat - all throughout the market. Of course there were pockets of the typical souvenir stalls but you could get better bargains and selection elsewhere (eg. Namdaemun). I find that Lotte Mart (at Seoul Station) gave a more authentic 'Korean' culinary and shopping experience compared to this place."
Busy and merrier shopping street,shopping district for lady who want to shop for local branch of cosmetic and skin care. Many shops will lure you to enter the shop by giving samples (but they will only give you if you enter the shop). 
Love the energy,"During my 7-day stay there wasn’t a day I didn’t get to buy anything. Food, cosmetics, clothes, everything a girl needs is there. My husband enjoyed the street food although he got tired of seeing all the girly stores. We were even able to watch a movie at Noon Square which isn’t crowded. What I like most about the place is its energy—it’s so alive and vibrant. The only place where it’s okay to get bumped at I think. Please make sure to buy from the older street vendors with smaller stalls so we can help them in a way (grandma who sells toys and grandpa who sells strawberries stationed at one of the corners near Zara)."
Awesome street food!,"This place is simply awesome for street food. Lobster tail, potato twists, shrimps, scallops, chicken skewers, you name it. Vibrant and lively, but full of tourists. Must visit nevertheless!"
Eat and Shop to your heart's Content!,"One of the prime shopping streets in Seoul. At night, great varieties of street food available and they are delicious! Do drop by when in Seoul."
From skincare to street food,"You will find many things what u need here. Beauty store, shoes store, street food and many more. Mostly tourist will come here. Too good walk here. So crowded"
Amazing Street,Myeongdong Shopping Street is shopping haven and also street food heaven. if you looking for cosmetic shop or skin care shop or even newest trends of clothing you'll find it all here.
Excellent night shopping market,"Great place to come shop, specially during the evening. Happening market with decent open food market and Shopping ( for ladies only though) available. Even a stroll during evening is worth its while. DO NEGOTIATE HARD otherwise move on to next shop. full chances that next shop will reduce prices on bargaining. Enough shops available for similar brands."
Crowded,I dislike crowded places so this was one of the places in Seoul I do not want to go back ever again but the proximity of the beauty product shops ranging from Nature Republic to Skin Food and tons of other brands is astounding. I love the Lush Store here.
Must go,Easy place for shopping.. one stop shop!! But it is somewhat crowded since everybody aants to go there but definety a place to go.
For the shopper in you,"Been here countless of times, mainly for the street food. Most of the street food open late afternoon onwards so don't come so early if you're there to eat. It's known as a shopping paradise for korean cosmetics but honestly, you can skip it. The shops available there are available elsewhere in Seoul, with lesser people. Only come if you're a shopping junkie who don't mind the hustle and bustle with other tourists."
Skin care haven,"If you’re target is skin care, this is the place. Not a lot of clothes here. Also some great street food."
Shopping and Street food,"This place has a lot more to offer. Food, clothing, beauty products, shoes and etc. you can find here. Its easy also here to exchange money from PHP to KRW with competitive rate. I love the strawberry with chocolate which you can buy in one of stall in the street."
Cultural experience,"What a trip, you could just people watch here all day long. You get true local prices here, a long walk around and you’ll find just about everything, and then some"
Second best market in Seoul ,"Spread over huge area. Mostly cosmetics, clothes , pharmacies and accessories stores. Starts by 10:30 am and open till 10 pm. "
Loved it.,Nice shopping. You can buy clothes to food to jewellery to make up products. Will be going again soon. 
Capital of street food,Most interesting neighborhood in central Seoul Great shopping area with most impressing street food options 
The best place in Seoul!,"During a week in Seoul, every single day I visit this place.During the day, you could find a lot of fashion shops in this area, not to mention the cosmetics shops. If you are a man, shopping with your female partner, hold her hand tightly. Or else she might go wild and spend all the money.This place also has lots of local restaurant and snacks. By 17:00, the locals open more stalls. Most are traditional food. I insist not to leave the market until I try all of them. I gain at least three kg and have no regret at all.The prices are all the same. A grilled lobster tail will cost you 15000 won, whether you buy it in front of the market, or far inside.They also have Oreo’ churros, grilled steak, ice cream with honeycomb, sweet potato, mixed seafood satay, strawberry mochi, twisted potato, and so on. Will be back for sure!"
Food and shopping haven ,"I enjoyed Myeongdong area because I love eating and shopping. It’s a good place to find stuffs for yourself and your family. From branded items to local brands you can find it here. You can visit huge malls in the area particularly Lotte Department Store/Mall. You can also find souvenirs especially at the Underground shopping center. If you get hungry then it’s not a problem as well because there’s a lot of restaurant, coffee shops, food stalls, and a lot more to choose from. Everyone who’ve been there loves it and I’m sure you will too. "
Awesome Street Food,"I love the street food here but its full of mainland china tourists and i believe because of that, the locals avoid this area. What puzzles me is the sheer number of multiple same-brand shops in this area. I think i saw 3 Zara shops, 5 Innis Free & about 10 shops with more than 2 stores within each corner of the street. I wonder how they stay in business."
Place for the Shoppers!,Myeongdong shopping street or streets is for those who love to shop for cosmetics especially. Although there are stores selling clothing and shoes. Several cosmetic brands are found all over the place. Nice place to spend your time even just walking through the streets. You can just eat street food or try the restaurants. Worth visiting.
Shopping district for beauty products,This place has a lot of beauty shops around the area and branded shops. You can also enjoy the Korean street food which I really enjoyed and I recommend you should try. Try going around and see the prices before you buy. But I think all shops around offer good deals.
Great Place for Shopping and Eating,"Myeong-dong is known for cosmetics, but there is all sorts of shopping available. In the evening, expect the area to be crowded with people walking around and food stalls. There are all sorts of options available. In addition to street level shopping, there are numerous shops underground. For those in need of glasses, you can have your eyes tested and glasses made in less than 15 minutes."
Memory,Happy..happy. Enjoy shopping at this place. Many things can buy with reasonable price. Almost every night come and visit this place
Exciting and fun,"Loved the street food there. And girls enjoyed shopping cosmetics stuff, and they had good prices. Very bright and beautiful at night with all the colorful lights. Very safe. It was very close to Marriott at Nandamen. "
A must Visit for tourist,"This is a compulsory place to visit especially for a tourist to get a souvenir, best foods and various choices of cosmetic products. I manage to buy a bundle of face mask with a affordable price and I really enjoy the food there. The food was scrumptious and I can even asked for more. Will surely visit this place again."
Worth going for the experience and the food,"Its a very busy place with local people and tourists but it is definitely worth a visit for the experience. The stores are the same as anywhere else, but there are some market stalls and in the evening lots of food stands to try (prices are reasonable and tend to be similar at different places selling the same thing). Take cash and be sure to have an empty belly!"
Shopping,This is the street of high fashion for everyone including fancy retail shop selling skincare and cosmetics. 
The mecca for cosmetics and street food for every budget.,"Korean cosmetics are king in this area. Streets are dotted with shops selling every sheet mask, treatment and moisturizer imaginable. People hand out mask packs to try to entice you into coming in. If street food is more up your alley Myeongdong is also your place with stands lining all the large streets. Cars and motorbikes can travel through here with little regard to pedestrians so be careful walking. Tourist police walk around this area so help is typically not too far away. Many restaurants here are tucked away above street level so they can be a bit difficult to find.This area has so many dining options it will be pretty hard to get bored. "
My Daughter went crazy 😊😊😊,"We arrived 15 March 2018 and as soon as we have checked-in and rested for about 30mins, we then went out and checked out the neighborhood. It was a good 7mins walk from our hotel and when we arrived, it was already very busy. A lot of street food stalls and things to buy. My daughter went crazy with the number of things she can see and even though it was raining, a lot of people are outside and going about with their shopping. The rice cake covered with cheese that we tried was soooo good although not cheap (6000won), we also loved the fish cake (2000won). There was a store which sold 500g strawberries for 2000won and it tasted so nice!!! After two day we went back but price already went up to 3900won,,,still low compared to the 5-6000won price along the myeongdong streets. We will definitely go back!!!! This is not to be missed ❤️"
Being forced to enter a shop is a NO-NO,"Me and my sister were just having our time, looking at shops and walking near them. Suddenly a guy handed me free mask sample and pushed, literally PUSHED me inside his shop. It's not even a well-known brand to start with. Decided to buy the hand lotion because the salesgirl keep on following and talking in complete Korean and didn't even try to make us understand. After that, we walked in the middle of the street to avoid being hassled anymore. Other than that, Myeongdong is definitely the place for cosmetics, clothes and shoes. Recommended for young people, since the loud music and environment might not match with older people."
"Ok for one visit, but nothing special","I have been there many times, so feel like this place is for Koreans who want to see many foreigners. If you want to feel Korean natural vibe, then this place is not for you, even though it is quite fun to visit this market."
City that NEVER sleeps,"Wild and crazy. Tons of lights, people, food, bars, action and SHOPPING! So much to do and see. It's packed with K-beauty products everywhere you turn. Much better at night than the day time."
Great experience,"Visited the area over several days and found the area had a lot of choice for both shopping and restaurants. The staff selling face masks at every second shop can be a little daunting as they can be aggressive. They offer free samples but if you don't go into the shop, they take them from you.You can find many beauty product shops here as well as all the international branded chains.In the evening the food stalls come out and these are great and offer a variety of cuisines and all relatively inexpensive."
Busy,Shopping heaven for clothing and cosmetic. Lots of restaurant and street vendor as well. Very busy at night time.
Beauty products' heaven,"Myeongdong will definitely be a place that you will return for their beauty products (mask, make up, lotions, beauty tools and etc) if you buy in bulk it will be cheaper and they always have promotion for all the brand there."
Vacation ,Really enjoyed Myeondong. Love the street food especially the egg bun. So so yummy!!!! And love the shopping in the cosmetic stores. 
Be prepared,"The streetfood selections are abundant. Clean because we've been here twice and never had diarrhea. Some are affordable and please avoid the 10,000 won clam with cheese not worth your money. But their 1,000 won sweet potato and 3,000 won gyoza was super worth it. Be prepared to go against a throng of people. Not stroller friendly, make sure you have a sturdy stroller and keep an eye on your children, they could wander. But overall good. Your seoul visit would not be complete without this. "
You shouldn't miss this,"Heaven for shoppers and food hunters. I think you can find all Korean cosmetic here. The street food stalls are numerous charging from 3000W. You may also get some souvenirs. Go try two two fried chicken, and Yoogone, very delicious. Also, you may watch the famous Nanta show here, very near to Myeongdong theater. "
Many shops and restaurants,"If you want do do some shopping and eat, this is place to go.You will find many of them, and you can spend hours there.The best thing is the street food (see my pictures). You MUST try it."
A Shopping Haven,"You dont go to Seoul without going to Myeongdong and experiencing it. What a dynamic place that is teeming with shoppers, tourists, vendors all seemingly at their most vibrant when in Myeongdong. The prices are reasonable and a whole range of stuff to buy. It is a widely known fact, in Myeongdong, one doesnt just get to bring home all the cosmetic goodies that one buys. You get loads of freebies as well. "
"Shopping, Street food, Tourist Area","Variety of street food (corn, spicy rice cake, fruit, etc.). Great place to buy socks, makeup, etc.."
Be prepared to be push nudge because of overgrowded streets,People are always busy pushing and nudging you in the streets also be prepared for pick pockets stealing from you because of the overgrowded streetsThe shops are great with all types of items to buy but they will follow behind you every ever you go in their shop and then force to sell you the item you are interested in
Beauty enthusiasts unite!,"If you are a boy or girl that loves food and all things beauty, then what are you waiting for! This place is a must! I spent a whole day here and also put a bit of dent in my wallet but it was well worth it! There are many of the same shops just down the street from another but that doesn't bother me. This place is a MUST! and just typing this gives me post Myeongdong depression. I will definitely be back!"
Happy Shopping...Happy Belly too...,"For cosmetics, beauty and skincare lover - this is the place to be. There are hundreds of shops and choices of mask, cosmetics, skin care and clothing too..Eateries are plenty around this area so one could shop till you're tired - head to one of the cafes or restaurant for a meal and continue shopping! Street food are all lined up around this area too for those who fancy local street food."
Probably a highlight for many people,"If you came to visit Seoul for the shopping, this is a must-see area for you. Shop til you drop and enjoy all the delicious street foods as well. Plenty of restaurants, souvenirs, and prime shopping stores that line the streets here. Glad there were a few Starbucks here since it was cold out and had a much needed coffee break to warm up. The Starbucks was 3 stories I believe so plenty of space to kick back and connect to wi-fi for a bit. While there are definitely some gents shopping available, the VAST majority of shopping you will find in Seoul will be women's fashion and cosmetics. In any case, the food is cheap, but be sure to bring a few extra bucks to spend so you don't miss out."
Shopping Galore,"I love Korean cosmetics, thats why I went to seoul to buy at Myeongdong. All skin care products are there, they also go on sale almost 50% off so prepare your wallets and credit cards. And dont forget the street foods, try everything! Everything is yummy!!! "
Eat and shop and eat and shop,Plenty of shops for everyone in the family. Many shop selling cosmetics and beauty products. Even the hotel we stayed gave beauty mask to use during our stay. Street food was interesting and fun. 
Shopping heaven,Nice place to shop for cosmetics and sports shoes. Restaurants are mostly fried chicken and Korean food. Do not try any leg or body massage. The money changer in Myeongdong has the best rate in town. 
Good shooping street,I had a good experience with lots of food and shopping area. the street is really crowded and lively. 
Great for shopping and street food,"Wonderful street to check out. Lots of delicious street food in the evenings. If you love cosmetics/skin care, go crazy here! Do be warned about taking “free” samples though. Only do so if you’re ok with the shop keeper following around you and hard-selling you items for 5 mins. (I accidentally took 1 free facial mask at a shop and didn’t dare take anymore!) Other than that, the atmosphere for shopping and eating and soaking in the Seoul life is great! :D "
Shop Til You Drop,"If you love SHOPPING, then this is the place for you. Indeed, Myeondong Shopping District is heaven for those who loves to shop. You can find anything and everything here. From shoes, clothes, K-Pop K-Star memorabilia and of course BEAUTY Products. Cosmetics Power Houses such as Face Shop, Etude and all over the place. Tip, if you find yourself falling in love with the prices offered in one Face Shop, hold yourself first and walk further, look for other Face Shops they might offer cheaper prices of their face masks and make-up. Same shop but offers different prices. What I love about this district is they offer plenty of samples for free to shoppers inside the shops and even on the street. This place is crowded but safe and clean. If you are a tourist, don't forget to bring your passports with you. The shops here offers discount to foreigners just present your passport."
Everything is here,"From Kpop, Kdrama and of course the K Beauty products are all daunting in Myeongdong. A lot of sale offers in different stores that can result to hauling. Also try out the variety of street foods espescially the beefsteak."
Fun fun fun,You can find cheap stuff in here. Expect crowd. There was a plenty of resting area if you get tired for all the walking and shopping
Interesting and must visit,"At night, different stall for food, you would really try different food. You will also shop around. Must visit in Korea. No souvenir shop, mainly clothing, shoes, makeup."
Love ❤️ shopping here ,"We came around 11am Sunday morning , it's not crowded , two tourist information people dress in red to help you and guide you where you want to go which was very helpful of them and save my time looking for the shops like Aland, adidas, olive young,artbox ,Myeongdong kyoja noodle for lunch . Spend almost the entire day here which was worth it . So many boutiques, cafes , cosmetics stores etc . Didn't try the street food here though as I realized the price at the higher range . "
Loved our time here. ,This market is large and a great place to walk and enjoy the area. The food carts when the come out later in the day create an experience second to none! We loved trying all the different food and seeing all the people walking through the market. Kids loved Fried milk and many other cool foods!
Shopping Heaven for Ladies ,"Awesome shopping street. Lots of street foods (halal options are available), souvenirs, restaurants, sports brands, and lots and lots of women’s make up accessories. All u need to do is to bring along a bag load of cash and credit cards. "
a Best Place for shopping lover,"shopping paradise. from fashion, cosmetics, street food. and if you are a korean cosmetics enthusiast, visiting myeongdong is an MUST. they offer a direct tax refund at the store with a minimum of 30000 won. get free samples of cosmetic products from many stores."
paradise for shopping,"best place to buy nice korean make up and cute clothes. i love the face shop brand, innisfree, forever 21 for clothes and even outside they sell some clothes which have a very good quality and nice prices. must visit street in korea, seoul. "
"Chaotic Area, worthy of a few purchasers",Never have I seen so many beauty shops in my life and the even wierder thing was I'd heard of none of them. There are lots of food stalls serving an array of food. You need lots of money for your shopping lol.
The night is young,most important one must know the night market starts at 4pm..there will be many stalls selling street food and souvenirs tshirts etc.uncountable cosmetic shops here eg face shop innisfree and missha etc..all giving great promotions and free samples.the concealer i bought from etude house there cost 7sgd cheaper than in spore..can buy face masks as gifts as there is always buy 10 plus 10 and price is filthy cheap.
Busy and fun,"This shopping district is full of shops and vendors. I found there is a huge emphasis on beauty and makeup products but also clothing. The street food is amazing - definitely try the pastry fish filled with custard or Nutella! If you prefer a really busy, crowded area I recommend going to this area after 3PM as that is when it really picks up. If you prefer less people, go before 3PM but the street food vendors usually aren't there until after 3PM when it gets much busier."
"Beauty products galore, food stalls, shoes, clothing, shopping.","It is a shopping haven for women who love beauty products. Other stores like H&M can also be found here. There are food stalls serving the local Korean cuisine to grilled lobsters. You will also find many variety of sit down restaurants along the strip (no cars are allowed, but, a motorcyle may pass in certain areas). Also, there are smaller malls or squares they call it with local Korean designer clothing, shoes, etc. If you are looking for designer products, go to Lotte Department Store also nearby and you will find Chanel, Louis Vitton, etc. here."
Not my cup of tea,"If you are into asian food, this street will be your heaven, if you are not a huge fan like me, then not really recommend. Crowded street with lots of street food carts"
Good place with good vibe,Myeongdong is well known for tourist for their street food and cheap cosmetic facial product but infact u can get cheaper street food if u are out of myeongdong.There are alot pf variety of street food and there are halal option too. There are alot of facial product on sales in the shop if u are into it.. 
Bring cash and go hungry!,"This place is hopping all the time. Many street food vendors selling delicious foods-eggbread, sausages, spiral potatoes, dumplings, fruit smoothies. Good place to get souvenirs and facial snail masks and creams. There's a Cat Cafe and a Dog Cafe. I think the Meercat and Racoon cafes may also be nearby. It's shoulder to shoulder at times but a lot to look at and entertaining. Remember where you started so you don't get lost. One side of it ends at Namsam Seoul Tower."
Busy busy busy,"Amazingly dense shopping area with mom and pop shops as well as international chains like H&M, Zara, Aldo and uniqlo"
Nice place to people watch,"It is very bustling at night with so many people, a lot tourists. Street food is good but need more variety I think. Shopping is a must-do and there is sale everywhere. Beauty products are a must-buy."
Great shopping,It’s always lively throughout the day but the real fun starts at night with Street food and crazy shopping at every corner
Should check it out,Even if you don't shop you should go check out the cool stores and street food. If you are shopping it has everything you need!
Cosmetics shopping haven,We spent wayyyy yo much time here. It's a busy area with lots of cosmetics and clothing stores. I do find that some prices (mostly clothing) are slightly higher than other non-touristy areas. Lots of street food and restaurants too. It opens till 10pm. Definitely a good spot to hang out at night after visiting all the palaces during the day. Be ready to receive free masks/samples ;) 
Rferreras,Great buys and great food. There are so many items to see and buy for a cheap and reasonable price while enjoying the diversity of street foods.
STREET FOOD AND SHOPPING AT ITS FINEST!!!,what ever you need you will find it here!!( clothing wise). and while you shop you can visit the cat cafe or a game or movie room where you can play games or watch movies in a secluded room. food is no problem here!!! after 4pm there are lots of food vendors on the whole street. from french fries to lobster tails you will find it all food tastes amazing.
Interesting,Good chance to see and taste the local way of life with many outdoor entrepreneurs with local foods and goods
Lively street,I loved going around this street because there are lots of different band cloths and lots of street foods too for those who love trying street food like me Also you can get free face pack...who would refuse if it's for free 
Busy street ,"Busy street with lots of cosmetic Brands... Similar items sell on the street, would gotten lost without a map. A lot of restaurants. Could spend a whole day here ... "
Myeongdong Shopping Street,"Shopping here is great, lots of shops and great variety. We managed to go through most of the shops and found some very good bargains from certain shops while others were rigid. The staff at Nature Collection and Sea n Tree win the excellent customer service award!"
Shopping is awesome,"If you’re not careful, you could break the bank on your first day. Myeongdong deserves at least 5 days of exploration if you are into shopping. The quality of the Korean clothing brand are awesome. You will need to do a lot of research with the skin care and cosmetics, though. Otherwise, you’ll end up buying everything you see. There are lots of restaurants to choose from or you can opt for street food. We were hungry all the time, so everything tasted awesome to us. "
Shopping!!,"This place is my favorite because of the cheap korean cosmetics and products. Street foods were also worth the money. The street foods will start at around 4pm (it gets crowded). If you just want to shop, I suggest you come earlier to avoid the crowd. "
Shopping street,Myeong-dong shopping street is the place to go for everything you may want especially in brand clothing. This is a very modern area of Seoul and not where you would typically go to see a traditional street market. The fashion can be a bit on the higher end but a definite place to go to shop for clothes.
Bustling are of Seoul ,Go there and experience the small alleys busy with local shoppers and you might even find a great deal for you! Great street food also in some of the alleys from early to late in the day. Fun experience 
A lot if good clothes,"Korean is known for beauty products and fashion, when it comes to clothing. I like their style, a European and American inspired clothes. Their taste of clothes quite similar maybe because they have the same 4 seasons in a year. There's a variety of clothes to choose on, can bargain as well but don't ask to low. Don't forget to make an spectacles for yourself also, coz they do it very fast and a variety of choices for frames for their fashion taste. Give yourself a try!"
Most happening place in Seoul,"At night, this place is lined with all type street food vendors, you can shop for garments, cosmetic, skin care products and all sort of things while food hunting. Other than street food, there are lots of restaurants as well, that's why i love this place. Try not to have the jajangmyeon from the street vendor, you can have a better one from Hong Kong Banjeom 0410 which is in Myeongdong as well.Just in case you can't find the place you're looking for or you're lost, look for people in red/orange suits with ""!"" symbol on and they will be happy to guide you through."
Everything in one area! ,"Myeondong Shopping Street is a MUST place to visit where you can find everything from name brand clothing, make up, knock-off goods and some really good street food. Excellent place to take the family for strolling around especially at night time. "
Amazing street food at night all the shops you need,"We stumbled across this street because our hotel was around the corner and we found our selves coming back several times just to try all of the street foods. I would say in the late afternoon 4pm onwards the street vendors come out in droves and everything is delicious. Highly recommend the chicken and leek skewer, the fish shaped pastry stuffed with red beans(very sweet) and the grilled cheese with rice cakes. This street has many small bars and cafes on it as well as loads of shopping. Ladies this is the place to go for skin care, there are many stores dedicated to skin care here. Fun tip, they will give you a free face mask if you walk around the store for about 2 min. with no obligation to buy! You can not bargin on food prices here but can bargin on goods. Excellent way to spend the early evening."
"Great food market at night, veggie options too!","There is alot of choice at this market and while not many there are some veggie/vegan options; roasted sweet potatoes, corn on the cob (grilled with flavor or plain/steamed), fruit cups, herbal teas, yaki noodles, deep fried 'tornado potato' and there is one stall- a young guy with three big soup kettles- bean/rice porridge, pumpkin porridge and veg porridge; these are really good!There is also a dumpling stall that has 3 options- veg, pork and kimchi, DO NOT EAT HERE. I asked for the vegetable ones, took one bite and tasted meat, I went back and asked her if they were vegetable and she said 'well they have a little bit of pork in'"
Beloved by both of tourists and locals,"Myeongdong is the most popular modern street of Korea.There are lots of shops, hotels, restaurants and food/merchandise stalls. The main avenue of Myeongdong is one of few broad pedestrian way in Seoul.Also, the connectivities to other touristic areas such as Jong-ro(Jong-no), Namdaemun and Cheonggyecheon Stream are good as well."
Cool place to shop!,It's easy to access Myeongdong and it's a cool place to shop. Almost everybody could speak English or Japanese and it was easy to communicate.
Worth A Visit,Lot of shops to choose from ranging from high end to more affordable stores. We enjoyed the experience and lots of restaurants nearby for a rest in between shopping.
This is a shopping and food heaven!,"Loved this place. Went here everyday for 5 days! This is the best place to get your beauty products. And best of all, I love the street food! Everything is here and you should definitely go!"
Just wonderful !,"My wife loves it here because of shopping, while I eating ! Both Korean brands and international ones. Go there at night time and enjoy street Korean food, and feel the bustling and excitement of the place."
A must,If you stay in Seoul this is a must to watch. Bring with you money and shopalong ;). The place is totally crowded and the smell of Corean food and culture are all over the place. A great and interesting experience for my son and I. 
enjoy your day here for sure!!!!,"a street market from day to night, large area dont get lost. lots of cosmetics, clothes, apparel, cafe, hotel, hostel, snack, drinks, souvenir along the area.find myeongdong cathedral for your kind ref."
Loved every min of it,"Shopping shopping and more shopping . Was a great stop for shopping street food , souvenirs, bags , clothes and basically the whole works . The people are friendly and very interactive."
Can't understand,I don't get why people like it. It's super crowded and the same stores with the same prices are all around the city. Really don't get it.
Fun!,Walked around this area a few nights in a row to pick up street food/go to dinner/look at shops/people watch. Lots going on. Plenty of shopping if you're into that. Great subway access.
So much to take in,"I was staying in the area, so I walked through at many times through the day. There are many places to shop, get a coffee or get a bite to eat. It’s also very convenient to the subway, so it’s easy to get to from anywhere in the city.I am not much of a shopper, but there are tons of places to buy face creams and the like. I was more interested in the street food, which is varied, plentiful and open late!"
Food Heaven ,Cheap and really good food;) my favorite is the fresh strawberry in mochi ;) tge rest are simply amazing
Love this place ,"Convenient with everything in one place. Lots shopping areas, lots of good foods, from restaurant to street food. Amazing market at night. Come visit at night, more street foods like grilled lobster and clam, squid, etc... "
Shopping street,"Like so many shopping street in seoul, this street is offer so many option. You can see alot of street hawkers and also alot of cosmetic stores. You can find the same cosmetic shop in every block. So dont worry if you forget to bought something from your favorite store because it will be another one around the corner. You should try the street food its really good (maybe due to winter weather, i got hungry very often) Slightly expensive since it touristy area."
Not just an ordinary Street,Myeongdong in Seoul is one of the many streets in the city that instantly becomes a shoppers paradise as the sun sets in the horizon. As the evening progresses so as the number of shoppers grew to astronomic proportions. It is a place to enjoy and satisty one’s craving for traditional food and shopping. You can see from the faces of the crowd the enthusiasm and eagerness to find the best piece of item they are looking for. My friends and I arrived in that famous street one cold evening this February just in time to join the frenzy and excitement of the different nationalities of people walking and bargaining for the best available price all around the place. It was exhausting but definitely exciting.
Love to shop in Myeongdong,The boutique sales cheap clothing and plenty of cosmetic to buy. There are plenty of restaurant to eat plus there is a food street to taste the local food.
Shopping haven,The street that never sleeps ! everywhere you get you'll find the same shops like a hundred of them in each corner the shops streetfood are amazing! definitely keep coming back to this place.
Shopping ,Enjoyed eating street food and shopping but expensive . We found other places cheaper food but far. Myeongdong area has lots of things to do.
Some lovely shopping in the heart of Seoul,"Myeongdong is famous for its national brands and shopping centers as well as various food courts. You may find everything you need here varying from phone cases and souvenirs to face masks, clothes and electronics. Prices in the street shops usually decrease by the end of the day, so evening is the best time for some profitable shopping. "
Just a regular shopping street,Not so atracctive for me. Like other cities Seoul doesnt have only one shopping street. There many places u may shopping and may taste street food. But the Myeongdong is the best known 
Loved Myeongdong !,"We chose to stay in Myeongdong for our first visit to Korea. Glad we did since there’s a ton of action here and everything else was close by as well. The shopping street had everything you could imagine, but prices were as expensive as they were in the states. There are tons of street food vendors, but none of them were truly that great. "
A good place for shopaholics,"We stayed at a hotel near Myeongdong, so we went to this street everyday. There were variety of shops in this area. At about 4.00 pm, they opened the stalls along the Myeong-dong 10-gil. There were a few halal stalls where Muslims can taste the local food. There were also a few halal restaurants in this area, but I think they were overpriced. Anyway, it is recommended to shopping during sales season. We got a lot of discounts plus tax refunds. "
Buzzing,Buzzing for most of the day. Don't expect any nightlife late on Friday though - it's dead. Otherwise plenty of shops and restaurants.
Chat an adventure!,"What a fun way to spend a few hours while in Seoul. Something there for everyone.. Street food, clothing, or anything you may need. A bustling place to be."
Shops Galore,Tons and tons of shops both brand name and unheard of. Many restaurants and cosmetic stores. The best part was the street food carts which set up mid to late afternoon and into the evenings. Plenty of coffee shops too.
Shopping Paradise! ,"I think if you planning for shopping and eating, you should spend a day here! This is the shopping paradise of seoul! The street are awesome, i can’t stop eating! Quite hard to find toilet, so ask the seller where’s toilet, and they will help! "
Shopping paradise,Very busy area but safe at night with police every corners. Prices are the same all stores. Dont need to bargain prices. Lots of street foods and eatery places too. We had fun!
Interesting place for foodies and shoppers,"What I like about this place: (1) street food starts in the evening - enough variety for you to sample local dishes. I particularly enjoyed the sweet corn, chestnuts (the best I'd tasted so far), cuttlefish, fresh strawberries, dried persimmons, kebabs, Oreo Churros etc, price ranges between W1000 to W7000 (2) cosmetics etc - so many stores to choose from. The aggressive salespersons need to ease off a bit though. Bring your passport along so that you can claim VAT refund immediately if you spend a certain amount onwards (3) there's a fast food joint called Mom's Touch - famous for it's chicken. Tried it's Shrimp Burger, it was yummy (4) caps, mufflers, belt etc - you can get some of those cheaper at the neighbouring Namdaemun (5) a great place to just people watch"
Must see in Seoul,"Lovely place to visit with its busy shops, hawkers selling their wares and food, can get quite busy during afternoons with a wide variety of shops."
Street Food Galore,Really enjoyed this street. Plenty of street food - come with an empty stomach and a pocketful of cash!
Food,"You don't have to go far if you're hungry. This is the place to go. Variety selection of food stalls at night, rows of cosmetic product shop along the street. Too many options. Lovely."
Mey!,"Why travel all the way to South Korea to see all the international stores that you probably have at home? Myeongdong is interesting as a cultural event, given that culture is how people live now and not just in the past, and the area is a people watchers delight, especially with the lively street food stalls. Lotte sells baseball boots for around $250, so watch, have a coffee, freeze (we are here in February!) and enjoy being part of a massive hive of activity, but keep your wallet or purse tightly shut!"
Too many foreigners,"My friend and I recently visited the famed Myeongdong shopping district.There was a ton of people outside despite the bone-chilling 5 deg (F) temperature.We had greatly looked forward to exploring the street food scene, but came away somewhat disappointed.First, the prices were not as cheap as we had imagined. The food, for the money, was just okay.The main reason for the price inflation was the number of foreigners meandering the streets; most visitors and street vendors either spoke Chinese, Japanese and/or English.In order to find more authentic Korean street food vendors, you will have to go else where.Regardless, Myeongdong is something you should experience while in Seoul."
A must see,"One of the busiest street in Seoul ...you can enjoy the amazing korean street food (tornedo potato,grilled shrimps,...)Very alive area and specially during night...great vibes and great people.Korean are really nice and friendly."
Lively area ,It's a very high and lively area since morning till late at night. you can find alot of skincare brand and cosmetic along myeongdong area. But it seems to have same brand branches in the same area. The street foods are very expensive comparing to other places. We had taiyaki for krw2.000 while you can get it only krw 1.000 in other place. Not a good place for food hunting for sure but good for shopping. 
Rude Salesman All Over,"We initially thought it was the bad cold weather caused the bad mood in their salesmen, but we finally agreed it was their attitude towards tourists needs to be improved.. if you are a tourist who wanted to buy something, but you ended up didnt buy anything be it due to their miscommunication eg language problem, or you didnt find what you want, they simply scold you..some of them really were bad tempered..u ll be surprised!!"
Food and shopping,"Almost a one stop shop, this place is wonderful to shop in or even stall-hop food tasting. We love being able to share small portions and trial our street vendors at this street. This street is super close to the myeong dong station and conveniently open til extremely late at night. "
So much to see and eat!,"Myeondong is a place I would recommend for people who want to shop or eat! There are s many stores from high end to forever 21! The streets are lined with food carts serving fruit, chicken, lobster, sweet potatoes, shrimp screwers, to more traditional Korean delights. There are also restaurants that you can sit and dine. There is underground shopping here as well. "
Shopping time!,Myeongdong is not my favorite. It is too crowded.. But it offers you so many foods you can try.. their pop up store is a thing
Very fun experience!,"Lots of food and clothing to buy! There are some clothes that are as low pricing as 5,000 or 10,000 korean won and they are all made in korea! A lot of cosmetics shops as well. A really good place to visit especially if you're after clothing and cosmetics! :) The street food were super tasty as well."
Never get bored here,"Every time i came to korea, i would stay near Myeongdong shopping street. There are simply many eateries and retail shops around that you will never get bored here. The eateries closed quite late too and tones of pharmacy, convenient stores and money changer around. So you can practically get wherever you want here. And coming here once throughout your trip will never be enough. It is just wonderful."
Fantastic!,"Absolutely a must see and do in Seoul. Make it a night. Eat on the street, shop for cosmetics, feel the vibe, get a fashion upgrade. Strictly an evening affair, the later the better. We thought the best market, a bit more upscale than the others. The most fun we had in a very great city. "
Interesting market,This market has a lot of different things to offer...ask at the tourist booth if looking for something special...also do not forget to check underground shops
Shopping Avenue,"Korea has large beauty product marked that expanded in all over country. All beauty korea make up brand you can find it here. Not only make up, you’ll find fashion store, restaurant and also street food here. So here is the best place for one stop shopping."
I have absolutely no idea why people come here.,"I came here because of a meeting. The streets are filthy with trash, it’s crowded, every stores are overpriced. Would not recommend."
Varieties,"A vibrant place to be for shopping. These streets have endless choice of beauty products, clothes, shoes, street food, restaurants to choose from. Very close to Myeongdong subway station hence very convenient. Only I find lacking of dustbins."
Shopping and Street Food Heaven,"Tips - only goes for the stores that give free samples. :-)Try all the delicious street food here such as egg buns, busan fishcakes, grilled octopus, rose ice cream,etc.There are many halal food here for Muslim and a Gurkha Restaurant.The Myeongdong Shopping Street is so alive from morning to night."
Heaven for people who like shopping!,There are so many stores there!! Cosmetic stores are everywhere!! Many good restaurants here too! This is really a heaven for you who like shopping!
ECITED!!,"I do really loves shopping, while i was in Myeongdong i just can't get lost by myself because i just want to shopping. And so many shop that we can find with the same shop maybe. example you can find 3-5 of Nature Republic store. Besides that, it was so enjoy being there because so many street food in every single road and very cheap it's about 1.500 - 3.000 won. "
U need to bring a suitcase here,"You won't be able to resist a lot of skincare/cosmetic promos here, better bring a lot of money and extra suitcase :))"
Shopping street,"Myeongdong Shopping Street is the biggest shopping center in Seoul. Lots of fashionable clothes, shoes and other equipments will be found from Myeongdong"
Lots of Stuff......Not so Cheap!,"I found this shopping area do have everything a typical tourist would need. However, I found their prices are way too expensive. You can definitely find the same items in other places: subways, student districts, even other lesser known tourist area. As for the food stands - they do have any choices; but mostly cater to Chinese tourist."
cosmetic paradise,along the way you can find all cosmetic you need here. every store push 1 or 2 of their employee to offer a merchandise to attract customer to visit their stores. you can easily find a brand have 2 stores here.
Seoul Food Street,"The street is lined-up with Seoul's street food. By the time you visited the whole area, you will find yourself full with all the hard-to-resist food being offered. Oh and you get your fill of fashion and cosmetics. Definitely a place to visit again."
"Street food, restaurants, cosmetic lovers, good money changer, downtown tax refund, happening place ","Staying in this area made us explore this place every night. This area was filled with cosmetic shops, restaurants, cafes, street food, downtown tax refund, and any other stores. What we loved most was the street foods. We tried all kinds of street foods. If you want to exchange the money, you can find it in area near Chinese restaurants or Chinese embassy. "
Happy place for ladies,"I was amused by all the cosmetics brands. Manage to get a very good deals from laneige and skin food. But what i love most is the Innisfree Green Cafe, i love the concept and every detail of it. I wish we have more time to chill there."
Shopping central with great food options,"Myeongdong is every shopper's must visit in Seoul. Almost (if not all) can be bought here. Cosmetics, clothing, shoes, all things KPOP, for those with limited time, shopping in Myeongdong will already get you far. All cosmetic brands are here, stores for clothing for signature as well as reasonable options are also everywhere. Personally, I enjoyed shopping and going around in the evening since so many food stalls are set up for the evening market. This gets the shopping crowd really going and it can get very crowded with lots of tourists and shoppers everywhere making the experience even more interesting. After a long and tiring exploration of the sidestreets, it's good to relax in the restos or cafes that are just as numerous as the retail outlets or sample some street food along the main street."
Good stores but poor service at some store,"Anyone who loves Korean cosmetic know this place, a lot of blog mentioning them as beauty street in Seoul. Nice place for sightseeing and quite lively.But we have bad experience shopping here. The staff greet me in English (she also can speak Chinese with other staff) so i explain what I want, but she didn't listen what I said and rude ! She even mumbling 'whatever' in Korean when she pick the wrong product (she think I didn't know simple Korean eh?)Next store are not much different. Compared with other tourist who bring big suitcase & buy bunch of product, we shop only for our personal stash. Why treat us differently? And again I get nasty treatment from staff who can speak (mostly Chinese speaker). So we just grab what we want, not even bother to try then leave asap ! Then i learned from friends that they're not Korean,...hmm Ow-kay ~ The Korean staff are nicer, not rush you when we test the product, but they not speaks English well. Still, i prefer to be served by them. Advice : For shopping peacefully, better go to another store chain such as at Ewha Women University, or anywhere but here, some stores are bigger and friendlier."
"Lots of shops, can be overwhelming at times","Myeongdong shopping area is huge. With a large concentration of shops, first time visitors can be easily overwhelmed. The streets can start to look similar and getting lost is easy. First time visitors should not try to do everything in one day. Have a shopping list and address and picture of shops you want to visit, it will easy to ask for information with those. Address if possible should be in both English and Korean.The place really become alive in the evening as food vendors start setting up food carts along side permanent stalls. Do beware of eating from these food vendors as you are still trying to get use to the food as a tourist. Overall Myeongdong shopping area can be enjoyable if you come with an open mind and try out the different food and shopping experience."
love it,there are 2 mrt station located at the front and behind the shopping street. There are a lot of street food and also restaurant. You can buy souvenir at lemon mart. A lot of skin care shop to choose and branded clothes shop.
Lots of fun,Must do shopping visit. Lots of cosmetic shops so be patient. Good food too. Wear comfortable shoes.

Girls' heaven,"The land of cosmetic shops, fashion brands clothes and cute stuff. The street food here is also interesting and tasty. "
Buzzing shopping in Seoul,I enjoy shopping here. Variety of Seoul’s Street food are available. Of course they are yummy. Plenty of shopping choices from clothing to ginseng tea and many more.
DISCOUNTS and Street Food,"Great place for cosmetics - more often that not, products in stores at Myeongdong are buy one get one free - so make sure you ask if that's the case with what you are buying. It never hurts to ask for a little extra discount - sometimes, you can get up to 18% just for asking! "
Shopping!,"Busy at all times of the day, Myeongdong is a shoppers paradise. Bargains, variety and more. Everything you need for a day of retail therapy!"
Superb! ,Best for fusion streetfood! Many food to choose from. Various food stalls and shops for skin care products!Opens until 12mn
An awesome destination for shopping!,"You can find lots of beauty brands, luxury brands and even departmental stores there in Myeong Dong. It is also a great place to get beauty products as souvenirs for your friends and families. There are many cafes with great ambiance and interesting themes for you to rest at when you get tired from all the walking and shopping! Your heart will literally fly away the moment you step into this crazy shopping district. :)"
Skincare Paradise,"Bring your passport you will get tax refund in almost skinscare stores with minimum purcase 30.000 won. For each stores have different promotion sometimes. Not only skincare stores but also Lotte duty free mall. Otherwise, you can find many street foods. My favorite is gyeran ppang which is pancake with egg. It's so yummy. You can find halal street food or vegetarian food also. There are halal restaurant also.You cand find Line store but the store is smaller than in Itaewon branch. Then, it is more expensive than in Line store, Dongdaemun Plaza. Almost store in Myeongdong is closed at 11.00 PM. Don't missed last subway if you stay faraway from Myeongdong like Hongdae area. It because the taxi was very expenssive arround 20.000 won-40.000 won. But if you know Hangul you can use bus for other alternatives."
"Shopping street, like others",it is just a shopping street... like others. and you can hear people screaming Chinese to attract Chinese customers.
Shopping for facial products,"If you are looking for facial creams and products, this is the place to go to.

Fun evening,We walked around here eating some of the street food. There are several things to try. The retail consists of a lot of beauty product stores and a few clothing stores. There are also a lot of restaurants to choose from. When I have gone in the evening or the weekend it has been really crowded and difficult to walk.
Great shopping,"Good for those who are looking for facial products and stuff. Bad for those who dislike crowds. In general a good place to spend the night, shop closes later here as compared to other areas"

Shopping,"The best place to shop particularly for make up. A variety of branded boutique, exotic street foods and ice cream shops even during winter.."
"As an intro course, class was very friendly","I appreciate the attention-to-detail the class offers for foreigners and feel that for newcomers to Korea that are interested in cooking, this is one class that you should consider for getting to know Chris, Korea, and of course cooking with Korean ingredients."
Too crowded and noizy,The seller from the shops are trying too hard to get you into their shop! Even grabbing by the hand. Didn't like this area at all.
Must go,Vibrant and you will be spoiled by the varieties of food and shopping plus the UNIQLO flagship is there next to the subway!
Insane beauty capital + added street treats,"This part of town is insane! You can find any and every beauty product known to man in addition to nearly any kind of street food. Blow torched lobster and clams, anything fried on a stick, chocolate covered fruit, things you have seen before and things you have not. Definitely worth a few hours to eat and shop your way through these streets. Bring cash!"
Cosmetics paradise on earth,"If you are a shoppaholic and one of your desires is cosmetics and skin cares, then this place is yours! You can find the number one quality of Korean skin cares and cosmetics in this shopping street. Don't forget to get around all the alleys.There is a point to consider: If you are a brunette or black skin person, then there is too difficult to find the best color of foundation! In Korea, foundations are more suitable for pale and yellow skins!"
Shopping Heaven ,"Each shops have different promotion. So be ready with the promo temptations. Visit to Olive Young is a must, there's several outlet here. There's the biggest Olive Young outlet in the area. "
Face mask central!,"One after another, the cosmetic shops line the pedestrian streets. Young salespeople entice you in with free samples. There is so much choice, it’s hard to choose, but at these prices, it’s worth trying everything. Makes for great gifts to bring home! Lots of fun shopping here."
Come once and you'll love it,"This place is happening at night with street food stalls along the street, pubs, cosmetics shops, cafes, major fashion brands & all you could ask for. We ended up stopping here every night to take a peek at what might not available the day before.. since it's winter, some stalls might open some might not because it's freezing"
Like night market.,"Heard so much about Myeongdong so i stayed in one of the hotel there on the last 2 days of my 10 days trip in Seoul, but was disappointed. The area with alleys of shopping but mostly skincare and cosmetic shops are like night market because of all those repetitive food stalls outside. Too crowded and DIRTY. Not my type of shopping experience. Not to mention prices are not cheap but certain items. Next time I will not stay in that area anymore. Prefer to stay in Gangnam. *The hotel I stayed in Myeongdong was GOOD though."
Myeongdong Shopping Street,"Alot, alot of things here. Very crowded and this place is huge! There is a metro station so it is very convenient to get there. As this place is so big, there are many exits to this station. You will find alot of shops/cafes/restaurants at this place. At night, you will see hawkers setting up stalls to sell street food"
so much to see and buy,"love this place spend hours looking at all the amazing shops and people, and buying a few things. great eating places"
very big market,i love to buy in here because it is cheap. i bought a winter clothes and i never regret of having it even if i cant use it in the philippines because it really helps me a lot in my stay here in korea. 
Seoul Korea,"Since it was January it is cold, We did the hop on hop off two different routes, very informative and I highly recommend this to all travllers to get there bearings around the city."
Visit to Myeongdong ,"My wife and I visited Myeongdong to browse the various shopping areas. This place was full of brand name shops that anyone would want to visit. We ended up eating at California Pizza Kitchen. Additionally the best time to come is Friday, Saturday, Sunday nights was there are numerous food stands. "
Shopping haven for anything Korean,"We stayed in this area because it is a one stop place for all of the Korean cosmetics and shopping. The street food comes out after 5-6pm on weekdays, they are quite repetitive but good to try here and there."
One of the hottest place in Korea,You can do everything in Myungdong. There are every kind of stores. But it’s always crowded of people. I recommend you to try sstreet food!
Place to buy your cosmestics,"We visited Myeong Dong in early Dec 2017 and it was very cold. Even though it was freezing, the crowds did not stay away and the streets were full of shoppers. This is the place to get your cosmetics, and some shops also offer on-the-spot tax refund, no need to do so at the airport. My children enjoyed the street food, particularly the 30cm long ice cream, because it did not melt cos'it was cold. It was an enjoyable experience."
Best place to buy face/skincare products,"Be prepared to lug back bags of face product. Face masks are usually 1 for 1.Also heads up for sneaker fans, i bought 4 pair. I should have brought more money there "
Shoppers Paradise,Great shopping area! Very expensive though! Many stores have multiple shops throughout. Great restaurants and street food. Very festive atmosphere.
It was a fun experience,"I visited Seoul when it was -15 degree so I didn’t really take my time to walk around. But I like the vibe. You can eat street food, shop at the stalls on the street or go to the shopping center on both sides of the street. "
Shopping street at Myeongdong today,Shooping Time at Korea myeongdong Shopping Street. Many food many kosmetic lotion etc anything ok in here. Minus 10 celcius very cold. But many people in here. Yummy resto in here. Jacket winter ok in here buy and lipstick anything in here. I like shooping street at myeongdong Korea south
Lively with lots of choices for food,"I visited in November and went to MD at around 4pm in the afternoon. You can find all sorts of food here from japchae to deep fried oreos. I would recommend coming later in the early evening when all the stalls are open, but mind you it's also peak hours for the street so it will be fairly busy/crowded."
Great for make up lovers,"If you have a wife who loves wearing makeup, take her Myeongdong Shopping Street. Kind of heaven for them. For others, nice shopping street but pricy. Close to Seoul stLine 4 (light blue line) - Myeongdong St - 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10"
Nice place for shopping 🛒 ,"Very interesting street for visiting. A lot of shops of famous brands with sales, cafes, restaurants, massage salons and pubs. Also there’s a street food . Mmmm. Delicious ! Try to eat some desert with strawberry ! And don’t forget about VAT refund. Good luck "
Heaven for shoppers,Perfect place for shoppers who loved cosmetics products! They sell it much more cheaper than in my own country (Malaysia). There’s a total of 400 pieces of mask I bought! 
Always a great shopping experience !,"If you are a shopoholic and into Korean shopping experience, this is the place. The local cosmetics, fashions, specialty stores, local hawker foods to restaurants are all here. "
Great beauty products,"Good shopping for cosmetics and mid range fashion products. Great street food, go early to avoid the crowds."
Shop until you drop,"We went to Myeongdong during the sale season. So many shops offering real sale from skin products, shoes, bags. Enjoy the street food as well as restaurants offering superb Korean food. Experience a visit to a dog cafe. Amazing dogs."
Street Food Street Food Street Food,"Seoul has numerous shopping streets but I personally liked Myeongdong the most. I dont think it was the biggest one but it believe it had the most choices of stalls and branded boutiques in all the shopping streets we visited so it was quite crowded. To me the best part of the experience was the variety of street food available! From grilled lobsters with cheese, grilled giant scallops with cheese to steaks and sausages, bread, ice cream and desserts and lots more. Oh of course the ever present fish cake soup! It was awesome! "
"Make-up, clothing, and street food!","This area is a constant hustle and bustle of activity! It spans a couple of streets and is filled with fashion and cosmetic shops. The vendors set up at different times, but I suggest going during the early evening for the full experience."
Fun and busy,"We stayed at Lotte Seoul which is about 5 minutes away from here so we came here every day. There is so much to buy and see. Make up shops everywhere with good quality cheap makeup which is made in Korea. Restaurants everywhere, we had lots of really good cheap meals here everyday. Korean BBQ is so delicious and so good for you. Especially when it’s -7 outside and you’re inside a restaurant eating delicious beef stew.Early afternoon they bring the market stalls out with vendors selling everything from food to phone covers or doggie costumes!We loved it. Very safe with lots of variety. A must visit."
Shopping & Food Street,"We came here on Christmas day morning. It's already crowded even at about 11am! I see the food stalls are already opened but it was too cold for us that morning that we went in to Young Olive instead. The Young Olive there is big (two-storeys), with lots of stuff from moisturisers, face masks, cosmetics, hair & beauty products, and even a cafe upstairs. I wished I came here on my own instead of with my 2 kids!"
Interesting Shopping Street + Street Food,"The street food and surroundings are cleaner than other shopping streets I've been to. There were countless beauty and apparel stores. Heck, even the street vendors sold clothes. You'll find plenty of restaurants and branded Korean and foreign goods.We came here to watch a popular tourist show called Nanta. Since it's a dance comedy, you don't need to understand the language to understand most of it. Pro tip: book the show yourself to get discounts. Don't go to the tour agencies. Heck, for a promo, I got a premium adult seat and the whole thing was 1,000 won cheaper (69k) WITH a gift box that without a gift box (70k). Minors can get discounts if they bring their passports or an equivalent ID.This street is a few mins walk by train. One of the nearby bus stops is near the largest Uniqlo in Korea. As a foreigner, you can get by on commuting using Google Maps (for bus & train), the Korea Subway app, and a T-money card with load. You can get a T-money card at a convenience store or the airport. For walking or driving directions, the Waze app can helpWe went during winter so some of the alleys were really cold when the wind came. I suggest bringing cold protection for your face if you're weak to that."
A must for a K-Cosmetic lovers!,"Great! They have whatever brands that you want! They always have this buy 1 free 1 promo which i always fall for...LOL. However when the time we went there it was raining and later snowing. So, i suggest you check the weather forecast before you go there as there are no shelter - unless you go in one of those cafes or restaurant..."
Amazing ,"When you go there make sure you bring cash with you or have your foreign exchange already done. There’s lots of options of tasty street foods to choose, it was an awesome experience especially the shopping part .. If you use card often it is very accessible, you can use your visa card or debit in paying and you’ll get a tax exempt or refund thing that they called if you show your passport paying with your card ..and they will give you a percentage sale also.it was a wonderful experience indeed I want to experience it again. My Korean friend help me understand and explained stuff while I was there. And people are very nice and friendly."
Great for young adults shopping,"Myeongdong, Seoul's oldest commercial district, is not for everyone, but for young adults, it can be wonderful - particularly in terms of boutiques and street vendors who aim at the younger demographics. There is an undeniable high energy along its streets and its stores that appeals to largely people younger than age 30. There is a very large range of restaurants in variety and price ranges.Historically, the district was the first modern commercial district, developed by the Japanese during the colonial period. For decades, before the development of the large Gangnam communities on the south side of the Han Gang, Myeondong was THE shopping district of Korea. Today, it is more focused on the young."
Best place to shop,"So many stores and lots of music everywhere, everything is super cheap, so be prepared to go crazy!!"
Get a feel of the area,Lotsa shopping for fashion and stuff. Ample street food along the way and mini marts to stock up your fridge. Bustling crowds and its is safe and welcoming.
Superb Shopping and street food!,"Superb Shopping location especially during Christmas. Lots of great deals up for grabs! The place is fun filled with many activities. There was a night where we saw a few locals holding up signs which says ""Free Hugs"", how Christmas spirits should be :). What's more the ever famous Nanta show is located here. Definitely a superb place to visit."
Exciting streets of food and goods,"We stayed opposite Myeongdong Street and every night, we would be walking the streets enjoying the snacks. Surprisingly, I find it is cheaper to buy some stuff in the underground shopping than on the streets."
Shopping Area for Ladies,"This is a shopping area for ladies. They can enjoy great discount. Almost all branding has a branch at here. However, the tasty of food just so so, no matter shop or street food. Suggest traveler just shopping here and go to any place for traditional foods, such as City Hall etc."
Great shopping area!,There were many skin care shops...almost too many. The food carts on the street were great! They were set up in the evening with huge variety of food and snacks. Yummy!
"Lots of street food, and knock off brand names","It is fun just to walk around. If you like street eats, it is definitely a place for you. Knock off stuff is very reasonably priced."
Lovely place to shop with a good atmosphere,"The place was lively both in the day and at night, with a good atmosphere. There was a wide variety of food options (porridge, barbequed meat, chicken soup, noodles, street food etc.) and products (although mainly cosmetics and clothes based). There were quite a few shops with open wifi networks which allowed us to access the internet easily.Do take note that many shops offer instant tax refunds (but you need to spend a minimum amount first). So, do remember to 1. Bring your passports 2. Check how much the minimum spend is (in our experience it was 30,000KRW). "
SOOOOO lively and beautiful especially at night!,"This is the place you dream to be in if you're a natural shopper and a foodie! The street can be full of people especially at night and it's so easy to get lost but no worries! There's a police station at the centre and tourist information just beside Boots and Olive young (the biggest one). There are also many banks here like Woori, Shinhan, and Standard Charter. There's also wide array of money exchange. We usually go to the one right across from the biggest Olive young store or to the one near the Chinese primary school. So many stores shoving their free masks to you while you walk BUT don't ignore it! It's your chance to try their mask and you there's a possibly that you'll love it and buy some more! And go try the local foods! Most of them are unusual for me but there are some that I loved! ENJOY MYEONG-DONG!! I sure did! "
Good place for shopping,"It will be a good place for shopping of skin care products, sport goods, accessories, closed to Sinsegae and Lotte Department store, with quite a lots of restaurants, but I found the staffs at restaurants that provide the traditional Korea food service are in general much better than the ones in the chain coffee shops or fried chicken restaurant (with any smile).."
Family vacation ,"This place has the most shops from foods, clothing, cosmetics, electronics and entertainments. The street foods have many varieties and the Koren cosmetics are reasonable priced. The best place to shop in Korea. "
Shopping Paradise for ladies,"Cosmestic everywhere, bags and shoes everywhere, accessories everywhere and also - food everywhere. Come slightly later in the afternoon for the stalls to be operative, earlier would only have shops. "
Myeongdong Shopping Street til 11pm.,"This is the place for ladies to shop for makeups and street food for the men. Many cafe's and restaurants. The shops and streets vendor close at 11pm. so you can shop til late. The hotels I recommend - Prince Hotel, Pacific Hotel, Loisir Hotel, L7 Hotel and Sejong Hotels. These are the nice good hotels near to Myeongdong MRT station. Tour company will tell you to meetup at this station if you engage them for the land tour. The meeting place landmark is the Prince Hotel and the North Face Cafe. Very easy to find. For Muslim there are few halal street hawkers and only one Halal restaurant which is the Busan Jib located at Myeongdong 8gil.this is the street name. I was told by the Busan Jib staff that another similar Halal Korean BBQ restaurant will be open in Myeongdong in Jan 2018. So lookout for it. Busan Jib Korean BBQ. Its Halal. Note: Dresscode depends on the season. Extremely cold in winter and about 35Deg high in summer."
Vibrant street!!!,A must go place to go.Unlimited abundances of shopping.Unlimited abundances of food.Unlimited abundances of tourists.A place not to be miss!!!
What a great outside market and shopping,"I went there 2 or 3 times during my visit in Seoul. As it was in december, it was a bit cold but always very crowded.You can find numerous items from bags, food and clothes.If you want to feel what the life is in Korea, i would say this is the place you need to visit.At the same time, so many different Korean BBQ to try..I would like to go back at summer time to fully enjoy but was really good, even in winter."
New Years stroll,"After hearing the early evening Mass at the Cathedral, it was a nice walk with a number of street food. Might be a bit pricey at first glance but all the prices of street food are the same wherever you are in this district. Grilled lobsters, shell fish, corn on the cob, strawberries, waffles etc. "
A must to visit,"Being to Korea for the third time and this is a place we will not miss out. A place with tons of cosmetic retail shops, restaurants and street food. Over the years, prices of the street food increase tremendously. I will recommend more on patronising little restaurants serving variety of great food along the streets which is more worth it. If you love this place. You can choose to stay in one of the hotels there. As it is very centralised in the heart of Seoul. "
Myeongdong street ,Best place to try korean street food . Happening place to be with lots of things to shop . Definitely will not leave myeongdong empty handed.
Cosmetic deals and food,Can find good cosmetic product deals at the streets. Also a nice place to taste great street food around the area. 
Skin Care Heaven,"Rows upon rows of Korean cosmetics shops. Plenty of clothes shops too. You can shop your heart out here and when you go hungry, there are also plenty of restaurants nearby. At night there are food carts which add to the lively vibe of this district. When shopping for cosmetics, do compare prices even between the same brands. Most brands have multiple branches in this district and some are even opposite each other. Some branches have deeper discounts than the others so look around before purchasing anything."
"Food, jewelry, clothing","Wow - loved shopping here! There is something for every one. I felt very safe and there were couples, solo people and families all having s great time. Just a block away from Myeong-dong train station so easy to find."
Endless amount of shops!,"You could get lost in Myeongdong, there are rows and rows of streets lined with shops. Myeongdong is also host to amazing + cheap street food (I've tried the crisps on a stick and the ice cream that's about 2 feet long), but make sure you go in the evenings for the food."
Shopping is not my thing but...,"I don’t have the shopping gene. My hotel in Seoul is in the heart of Myeongdong though, so I thought, when in Rome. Aside from the big name stores, a lot of street stalls popped up, as the sun went down, selling some delicous street food and lots of cheap gloves, coats, bags and the like. The area also has lots of phone covers, K-Pop swap cards and gifts to take home that are sometimes required when you’ve taken a holiday. You should be able to kit out the relatives and friends, co-workers etc. here while also buying some quality stuff from the Doc Marten or Adidas or other named brand shops. If you must go shopping this is a pretty painless place to do it. "
Good shopping area,Its a good shopping area. Many shops for Korean cosmetics can be seen here. There are lot’s of other stores too for shopping.Lot’s of street food stalls can be seen. One can enjoy all kinds of Korean food here. It is a very crowded & lively street.
Must visit attraction ,Walked along the streets. A must visit location. Good streets food. However quite expensive. Clean area. Full of cosmetics shops and most of the time pack with visitors
Busy Area - Shopping Mecca for K Beauty,"We stayed in the Myeondong area and selected out hotel based on the proximity to all the K Beauty shops. You will find at least one store front for every brand you desire. Also, Lotte Duty Free and Shinsegae Duty Free are here as well.At night there are stalls and stalls selling street food. It gets so crowded you can barely walk. I didn't like the cars being able to access the same road. I wished they would make it pedestrian only."
Bargain,"Lots and lots of bargain. We got some pair of Adidas Stan Smith at ₩59,000 per pair or around US$55 only."
Cosmetic paradise,If you're into makeup and stuff. This place has every possible Korean brand you can think of to stock up or replenish your makeup.It's a street food paradise at night and has several good cafe and food located all around the area.
Myeongdong for the Soul ,"Ideal place to stay. Food, shopping all in the same place. Kyoja, BBQ, fried chicken, ginseng chicken.. Making me hungry again. "
If you're into night markets and people watching,"Myeongdong is well-known for its street food and shopping and we were keen to experience what is unique about street food and shopping in Seoul. There was no shortage of: - restaurants (chimaek, bingsu and otherwise ... cheese hot pot anyone?),- street food stalls (selling the same food items, what turned us off were the dumplings which was bulk-packaged more so that the touristy prices), - cosmetic shops (if you miss one brand, fret not, there are potentially a few more down the street)- souvenir shops (whether its S.Korean snacks, life products or clothing/apparel) Despite the atmosphere and abundance of what was stated above, it felt somewhat materialistic and unoriginal compared to other shopping streets in Seoul. Perhaps come for a quick stroll otherwise there are better areas to explore in Seoul that are also friendlier on the wallet."
Shopping mecca,this place is all about SHOPPING. you can get anything from here. lots and lots of makeup though. they offer freebies for you to get inside the store. once your there they would definitely be in your face for you to buy and buy. soo beware. the temptation to buy another pair of lipstick is just too great. but overall it was a nice experience to try when your in Seoul. visit it amd see for yourself. 
Great shopping experience!,"Myeongdong is perfect if you're looking for good places to shop and eat til you drop! It's especially great if you're into kpop as they have an abundance of shops rammed with kpop cds and merchandise. Food is reasonably priced, and street food is delicious! The cathedral is also worth checking out. There's a great vibe in the area, and the shopping centers are also lively and great for high end goods :)"
Dominated by cosmetic store,"If you are not in for cosmetic, you can give this place a miss. Otherwise, it is an great place for shoppers with everything in a street."
Facial products galore!,The place to go for all facial products you need! You can of course get it elsewhere too but it's a hotpot of all the brands you will know of. 
Must go when in Seoul ,"You can find everything in this shopping paradise, but wait for around 4 pm when the food stalls open and taste a variety of fantastic Korean Street food! "
Used to be better,"Great place, especially at night if you don't mind tons of people. Used to be so much better, still have memories of good old Myongdong. Now it's flooded with tourists and locals, shops are mostly Korean cosmetics (Etude House, Nature Republic, Skin Food, etc.) and popular international brands, not so much of Korean clothing or accessories. Street food is hugely overpriced. Again, the main problem is that it's too popular and too crowded at night. Daytime, it looks like any other street in a Korean city. "
Loads to buy,"This is basically where you can do all of your shopping at. There are so many shops selling skincare, masks and cosmetics but the crowds make this place a little too overwhelming at times. As it was snowing in December, the ground was very wet and slippery so it was a bit cumbersome having to watch out for dried ice on the ground. The atmosphere was nice on the whole but you would have to take care not to overspend here."
Excellent street food,Myeongdong is a great place for great street food and shopping for young adults. Kids loved going there for the twisted potato and the 32cm ice cream. The street market usually gets setup around 3pm and is open till late. The vibe in the area is great. Must visit place in Seoul. 
Great for last minute souvenir shopping,"The entire street is packed with the bigger Korean brands that makes it very easy to grab souvenirs for friends back home. A lot of service staff here are Chinese, so language-wise, apart from Korean this is an alternative. Very crowded and touristy though, don't expect to come here to experience the ""real"" Seoul! "
Want face mask or Comsetic,"This is the place for all ladies to young girls. You can find all types of House own brand to world class brand in Myeongdong. You will never want to leave this place early after your shopping. Because there is plenty of nice street food after dark or before 5pm. I should say. This place is so lively from morning to dark. Do your homework first before searching for your products. Otherwise, you will feel lost in there. Too much to choose from. "
A great buzz,"Can be crowded but a good place to hang out. Maybe not as fashionable as several years ago, and has a lot of competition now for socialising and shopping. Have bought watches and clothes there. Walkable to and from many places, and a subway station too "
Avoid especially with kids. Better service at Hongdae,"Was there on 18th Dec to look for gift packs. Sales personnel was not interested to entertain questions on products. They were eyeing customers buying in bulk and did not bother to give samples due to sales period. One shop even attempted to keep the special gift packaging for the products i bought. When i insisted on it, got is reluctantlyStreets were packed and the little one got hit by back packs a few times. Street vendors were pricey.... KW3,000 for a small baked potatoe!Sales personnel at Hongdae was more pleasant and have the time to explain product details and happy to give sample."
Leisure wife fav country.,Look for Beauty of Corea in myeongdong subway shops for cheaper n more varieties of facial products. The Ahjussi is such a friendly Ahjussi. My wife spend lots at his shop everytime.
"Lively, full of food and shopping choices ","Highly recommended for a snapshot of the food and shopping choices that Seoul offers. There are food carts, local food restaurants and lots of international choices eg Nepal There is also a wide range of shopping choices, from the really inexpensive to the end. A must go if you are on vacation!"
Lively place,"We were there on Christmas eve. The street was full with street food vendors & it was very crowded but everyone was minding their own business. It’s a very lively place and loved the walking on this street, never felt unsafe. "
Love Shopping ,Lots of shops that offers great deals. But mostly I enjoy the street food. Clean and the atmosphere is very lively. There is a cat cafe too and my kids went twice and enjoyed them! 
Recommanded visit,It is recomanded to take a tour around the streets. A lot of shopping and nice environment including street food and restorants - big market. I was in Uniqlo and buy some products where they provide imediately tax refound. Go for it.
Street food heaven!!,"You have to try various street food in Myeongdong. So many different types of food, mostly cheap. Wonderful and happy experiences just walking by and browsing!"
Night Market in Seoul,Very nice Night Market with lots and lots of food variety. Almost everything is available here with lots of variety. Its basically a Street market and bargaining can be done for shopping. 
Great shopping!,Recommended for those shoppoholics. Everything in one place! Skin products everywhere but also restaurants and clothes.
Shopping Heaven for Beauty Lovers!,"Here is the place for every beauty lovers...you can see the famous beauty brand names like Innisfree, Nature Republic, The Face Shop, Etude House etc everywhere! There were malls like Lotte Mall & Shinsagae also for those who are into high end stuff. We love this place...easy to get halal food to eat. There were a lot of things you can shop here from souvenirs, day to day stuff etc. You can't miss visiting this place if you are in Seoul."
Nice place to visit,"A nice place to visit and buy souvenir, a lot of street food and some of the are halal for muslim. A lot of cosmetics item to buy. Dont forget to visit the cat cafe and the hello kitty cafe there. "
Heartbeat of Seoul but too many repeat stores,"Myeongdong is the mecca for skincare and cosmetics for shoppers who crave for masks and beautiful skin. If you are looking for something unique or creative, this not the place for it. However, here you enjoy the vibe of being in Korea and feast on its array of street foods. However, I would not just eat anything as the quality that can be dubious. Generally, the steak there is the best while the other street fare is just mediocre. "
Food delight,"If you're a budget traveler like me then better go to this area. Trust me anything you want to eat you can find in Myeongdong. Delicious and yet affordable. But when shopping for souvenirs, then i recommend Insadong. Its much cheaper there and many unique and authentic things to choose from."
Good walking street,"When you visit seoul, this is the another place, you must visit. It is like siam square in Bangkok. But at night there are heap of food stalls along the street. You can grab any foods, snacks as you like. There are some good restaurants and Bar for groups of people. A good time to visit is from 17.30-21.00pm. "
Worth a visit,"We've been to Myeongdong before and still find it interesting with its F&B n shopping. Especially when one goes during the cool seasons nice walk for sure. Street food rice cakes, fried chicken, ginseng chicken soup, BBQ,caramel pancakes, Dragon beard candy (must try w/almond my preference) yummy! Fresh Strawberrys at low prices in season. Hahaha. Worth a visit foe sure."
Less crowded due to lesser prc tourists,Went there 2nd week of Dec 2017 and my 3rd time visiting Myeongdong. This time lesser crowd and easier to navigate. Really enjoy it to the max !
Vibrant,"Great great great. But if u come in winter all are winter clothes. Because i come from a tropical country, i didn’t shop for clothings but other things else..A must GO! "
Great place for shopping,"The place is really great for shopping especially for fashion shoper. As the place has many famous brands here local to international and the products are from foot to toe also this place offering the Korean culinaries, that is become the place is very special for the tourist.One stop shopping for everything, really really really great.You can’t amazing this? Please come to Myeongdong okay , cheers"
Enjoyable maze!,"There are many restaurants and food peddlars here. Try the giant yogurt softserve, it's delicious! There are also lots of clothes stores like Forever 21, H&M etc...and places to buy food and snacks, not to mention a few street stalls selling purses, sunglasses, bags, shirts so you can bargain with them. It's generally very busy most of the time but the atmosphere is good."
"Very much a tourist hotspot, a lot of street food options. ","For sure there's tons and tons of places for you to shop for yout skincare requirements. There's a huge Olive Young where you can get almost everything you need there, as well as Boots. Some shops will treat you better than others, and most shop assistants would be able to converse in Chinese or Japanese but very very little English. Usually if I need to buy stuff, I'd come early, like 10am or 11am, when it is less crowded. 4pm onwards, and the people starts coming in droves. Food options are aplenty, but I feel the food is bit overpriced and underwhelming in the two shops we tried. The small Cafe's are pretty worth a visit though. "
"Great for Skincare Shopping, But Street Food not so much","Great for Skincare and Cosmetic Shopping! You can find any make-up/ mask you want in the area and it is much cheaper! Street Food was overpriced compared to other areas, and the taste was only mediocre."
Only cosmetic store left,The whole area is just filled with cosmetic shop and a few foot wear shops. I donlt really enjoy to shop there.
Shopping haven,The great place to shop and enjoy street food in Seoul. The best time to enjoy all of that is started at 6 pm
Great place for skin care shopping,"This place is very famous for its skin care. It's so much cheaper. And if you buy a bunch of skin care, please ask for their sample."
Lots of face masks,"This place sells face masks and street food. Some of the brands are: innisfree, beyond, holika, nature republic, the face shop...many more . Also, the famous sandwich place Isaac is nearby. There’s a lot of street food ☺️"
Interesting and exciting shopping experience!,"Many skin care products boutiques in Myeongdong area and almost every street in Myeongdong, you can find at least an outlet of the the common brands such as Etude House, Innisfree, etc. Most of these brand has many indoor promotions on their items which changes almost every week. It was interesting to walk along the street as many of these boutiques promoter will give free mask or samples to attract passer-by into the store. And many free skin care samples were given when you purchase items from them."
Love Myeongdong,"I love love love Myeongdong! All it’s stores, the night market and the streetfoods!!!! I cant wait to go back here as cold as it was when we were there it still was so super enjoyable!"
Chaotic but fun!,"Too crowded at night and weekends but you will never get hungry while you are walking along the street though :) korean streetfoods everywhere! :)And too much cosmetic shops trying to make you go inside their shops :)And what I didnt understand was, why was Myeondong street colder than most of the streets we went too and its even super crowded! "
Crowded but has a lot of good deals for shoppers,"Place is crowded but beautiful. Has a lot of restaurants, clothing and beauty stores that offer great deals, souvenir stalls and street food stalls. Street food here is a little bit more expensive. K-Beauty fans will enjoy shopping here (I did!)"
A place to spend time either with or without money,"A lot of shops of all variety, restaurants, 7-11s, stalls by the roadside. It is best to stay nearby so that you can easily commute to places in Seoul either by foot or MRT"
Nice place,Great for street food lovers like me..and the food is just awesome..certain things in the street you can find it cheaper in the subway station shops etc souvenirs..
Shopping ,Most people will go there for shopping. Check out the little alleys. The street food is an attraction by itself l..
Must See and Must Shop!,The energy of this place is incredible! So much to see and experience. So much to buy and much more to buy! Make sure to go by at night time when all the food carts are lined up too!
Good street food,They have lot's of good street food vendors among all the beauty stores. There are several department stores nearby.
Busy night market,Worth a visit. However the street food and souvenirs are more costly. Great place to get beauty products and get many freebies
More good shopping,"OK, I like to shop. I rank Insa-dong my favorite, but this nearby quarter is good as well, and since it's a short walk away, why not wander it as well?"
Good place for trying seafood ,Lots & lots of Seafood options. Scallops with cheese were yummy. If you love seafood....this is a place to be. Variety of shopping also available. 
Street for eat,"Despite the cold wintry Dec weather, managed to enjoy this street with the various eats! Want to change money?- head to alleys near the China Embassy. Want to look for a short rest stop - head to ""Inn-is-free""....great eco ambience. Just buy something to eat or drink lah."
Place of Korean MakeUp/skincare heaven ,"Every few step, you’ll find an Etude house, Innisfree, face shop, laneige. It’s basically the heaven of Korean MakeUp and skincare shopping. All of the masks are on permanent discount as well.Contrary to believe, they are much more stingy with samples already.Most of the sales assistance speaks Korean, Chinese or English. Will definitely recommend coming and stocking up on masks. Need an entire day to shop here. "
Excellent exchange rate at myeongdong,"Found this place off the myeongdong shopping street no 2.Look for #43, go inside the corridor and the counter right inside the building. The exchange rate very close to the bank rate.Look for pictures that I attached tosee building of currency exchange."
Good shopping place,You can find everything in a small place. Branded clothing as well as local sellers will be on the same street.
Busy but must visit,"Myeongdong shopping street is very busy with lots of shoppers, but other then worldwide brands it also has lots of market stalls with local street food and clothes for sale, you should definitely check it out "
A must in Seoul,"This is definitely one of the best places in Seoul, the street is just full of energy, you can get to feel how active Seoul is.The street offers endless options of shopping stores, both delicious and cheap street food, a true paradise for the gourmands among us :)"
Good for shopping & meals.,The best shopping place & eateries in Seoul. Prices are cheaper than other markets.Close to Lotte Mall. Many train stations available. 
Great Shopping,If you are looking for skin care or beauty products this is the place to go. Lots of great shops and plenty of food. Would come back!
The reason i visit KOREA twice,"I can spend hours just to walk around and visit every shop. Too much attraction in here. The food street definitely good, all of it. And if you want to buy some snacks, you may visit the LALA MART, it’s has the cheapest price so far and you may find anything there. Korean cosmetics, yes you may find all the cosmetics brand here, etude, innisfree, nature republic, the saem and so on. If you have enought time, you can visit more than one store of etude in here because in my experience they have different stock on each store. Myeongdong also a place for sneakers hunt :) besides the ABC mart, there’re some other sneaker stores. Also, it has the big LINE store with the huge brown doll in the front of the store, where you can take photograph but you have to stand in the provided queuing line first. "
Street Food,"I don’t usually like shopping streets. Shopping is not in my DNA.Myeondong Shopping Street was for me more of an eating street with plenty of roadside stalls, than shops.I tried the lobster - nothing fabulous. Can skip.Egg bun was delicious!Children found the sausages too peppery.Strawberries were incredibly sweet.But I had to say that my spirits were dampened by the sight of a disabled man crawling on the streets. It was a pitiful sight and I wonder why there weren’t more people who donated?"
The most happening place in all of Seoul,"This is THE MOST happening place in all of Seoul, where crowds in their thousands, local and tourists, throng the area picking up goods, cosmetics, street food etc. Your senses will explode with the vibrant music emanating from the various shops you pass by. Do note though, that street food prices aren't exactly cheap vis-a-vis what you can get at the restaurants, but hey, you are in Myeongdong, so just do it!"
Nice street with lots of food,"Nice street, lots of food however a lot of common stalls. And the weather in Dec is cold to be on the streets if you r not dress for winter. "
A must go in Seoul,"My favourite shopping area. Shoes, skincare, street foods, snacks, clothes, etc. You can find almost anything here."
Jam Packed with shops and restaurants ,"This is the place to come if you want to feel the hustle and bustle of the city! Lots of facial masks, clothing, roadside food stalls around here. "
So many skincare shops... ,"My daughter loves the area, I don't mind it either... Always vibrant and fun with some interesting street food. The restaurants in the area are hit and miss, so I have stopped eating there and move on to get food. "
Favourite shopping area,"I think Myeongdong offers a bit of everything; exciting, varied stores, the cultural, beautiful cathedral and entertainment galore. Shopping options are endless from the big brands to lovely small iconic individual stores. You can buy any electrical or clothing or handmade item along tyese streets and of course makeup."
Fun shopping ,Fun shopping place. A lot of activities going on but we went mostly toward evening time. So not sure if it’s the same during the day. Street food. Lots of beauty and cosmetic brands can be found. There are restaurants and also cat and dog cafes to keep the young ones entertained. But dog cafe will only allow older kids (8 and above) to enter. We had a lot of fun. 
Cool place,We like the green coffee house. Shopping is nice and fun but clothes is not cheap in Korea. We had fun.
a true gastronomic experience,one of the best must go to places in Seoul! merchandise abound as well as street food of all sorts from lobster to shrimps to scallops!!!! the choices are endless! go there when your hungry and carry lots of money!!!! ill be coming back soon!!!!
Streets of skincare shop and Korean food,"It’s a place to go for various Korean food it’s like one stop center where u can shop for various skin care product plus the famous restaurant. A must go at Seoul, better if u stay nearby. "
Suited for Chinese and Japanese visitors,"This place is rather suited for Japanese and especially Chinese tourists, with cantonese menus and signs in the street. Street foods are nice and fun, but the price is relatively very high and they don't accept credit card payments. Still a fun place to visit."
The Market that you must visited in Seoul,This is the market that you must visited in Seoul. Dont miss it because you gonna love it and will miss it when you leave Seoul.This is a very unique market with many delicious foods that they offered. You never imagined to find rare food elsewhere and you will love it. Other than food they offer also many unique things. This market is an example of a success market in attracting tourists all over the world. Visit Seoul and you must experienced this Unique Street Night Market. Never miss Myeong Dong whenever you are in Seoul.
I love this place!,"For those who are into shopping, Myeongdong is perfect for you! From cosmetics and make up to garments and apparels, you can get it in Myeongdong. The prices are from cheap to okay, but you can haggle, except maybe on cosmetics and beauty boutiques, but they always go on sale. you can also find some tasty street foods around. "
Great place for shopping,"Many shops and restaurants in this pedestrian area from local Korean to foreign international brands, nice place to walk around with many side streets and attractions to visit. "
Myeongdong Shopping Street,"When we visited Korea last Oct I browsed thru the internet about the best area to book a hotel and Myeongdong is on top of the list. Yes it exceeded my expectations. Not only the neighborhood is alive, everything is there - from traditional Korean restaurants, bars and most specially street foods to the hundreds of make-up stores, clothes, shoes, food and accessories that you could only get in Korea. What more a lot of sales are at stake when you visit this bustling street. We were there on the Golden Week and it's a public holiday in Korea but Myeongdong is an exemption although there are stores closed a lot are very open and people from all over Korea are there eating, drinking and shopping. The street is also very safe but just be ready to squeeze in to heavy crowd. You could also Myeongdong via one of Korea's largest station - Myeongdong Station. Just FYI if you need disability access need to locate the Elevator so this station is not readily accessible - a lot of stairs and escalators and not frequent. In the station itself there are a lot of food stalls and shops to buy at your own covenience. The street also connects to Namsan Park where the famous N Seoul Tower is located as well as the enchanting and holy Myeong-dong Cathedral. Our hotel is located near the Namsan Park exit of Myeong-dong in the Seoul Animation Center. Another tip is the walking so better prepare your feet for a good sightseeing. Truly I enjoyed my stay here so it's definitely worth a visit!!!"
Must visit in Seoul,Lots and lots of facial product stores to check out. Get free facial masks that are given out as free samples. Many food stalls selling all kinds of local delicacies. Many restos also to choose from. Must visit when in Seoul.
Women will go Gaga there ," if you are crazy about the make up and cosmetics , I think you are in heaven ... a great place also to experience Korea’s most delicate and creative street food."
Just one 'no good' dining experience,"A shopping paradise lined with restaurants, street foods, beauty product, sports & fashion shops. Free masks & samples giveaways have been largely reduced but you can still shop around for the best bargain. On our first night, we dined at one of restaurant on the 2nd floor which showcased ginseng soup & chicken stew. Big Mistake. The food was bland & tasteless. Service was rude & the crew keeping pushing us to order more dishes with larger portions. When we decided to order medium portion which turned out to be more than enough for the 4 of us, the staff sneered while taking our order. We noticed there were no locals dining at the restaurant, all were tourists lured by the pretty signboards downstairs. On our remaining days in myeongdong, we tried other restaurants in the vinicity & enjoyed great dinning experiences. Just this one that we did not enjoyed. "
Cosmetic Paradise,"A lot of cosmetics brands here, but some of them you haven't ever been heard before.Cheap price. Good place for who loves Korean cosmetics."
Shopping Heaven,"This area is always crowded. We visited Seoul during Chuseok holiday and thought it would have a smaller crowd. Well, we were wrong! Even on Chuseok holiday, it was filled with people. Myeongdong is a shopping heaven for women. There were beauty shops, clothing stores, shoe stores, accessories, specialty shops, a few men shops, restaurants and lots of food carts. I love the food carts the most. Beware of beauty shops that sells mask as they lure you in to make massive quantity of face mask purchases. We were victims of one of the shops there. Long story short, just be careful! We got a lot stuff from Myeongdong. However, the prices weren't cheap. We got some stuff cheaper from Hongdae and near Ewha Womens University."
"Great for women, not much for the guys but street food","Nice street to walk down and do some shopping. Some of the cafes and restaurants are pretty good and are good value. Check out the Myeongdong Koja. It's really good value/proportion noodles. Street food was also fun to try. I liked the deepfried fish cake covered sausage/cheese, etc. stall. Not much shopping for guys. Nice place for women and couples. Ther're some neat shops to check out though so I wasn't bored. Just don't expect to buy too much as a guy."
Shopping Paradise,Another shopping paradise in Seoul. You can find almost everything here. There are so many store for you to choose and so you can compare the price for a similar product to get the best price. You need to be intelligent shopper here because the price for a same product may be vary with another place offering the same product in other store.
great place for street food and shopping,Happening street every night. A lot of street food and restaurants. Must visit this place if you visit seoul.
Shopping paradise,"It is nice street to sight seeing and purchase fashionable items. There are many shops that build closely one another. Its ""make-up"" paradise for girls and women.Less option for Men.."
Shopping paradise,"All kind of stuff can find here. But not cheap, compare with dongdaemun . Must be intelligent shopper. No negotiation here. What i found out there, Uniglo sold the cloths more expensive then malaysia. "
"Many shops, lots of peipke","Many nice shops, but beware of all the people! In the evening the streets turn into food truck-Mecca with many nice flavors. "
I’m not into beauty products so it is just a place to go and have street food for me!,Lots of big department stores and small stores too! Most are selling beauty products which is not my thing. Great street food all around and had fun trying most of them too. 
Brilliant Vibe!,One must not miss this shopping street. The vibe in this area is exhilarating! Best way to enjoy street food while shopping around for their some facial mask
Must Visit,"Nice ambience with a lot of street food. Spoilt for choices when it comes to shopping for clothes and beauty products.Try to go in the evening, that's when the street food vendor start their business."
Favorite Place in Sepul,"I spent many nights in Myeongdong while I was visiting Seoul. They have tons of shops, food carts, and restaurants. It’s one of the busiest and most crazy places I’ve ever been and I loved it. "
Great shopping haven,Good place to shop especially if u r looking for streetwear n korean facial products. Lots of cafes and nice authentic korean cuisine restaurants too. Remember to visit in the night where the streets comes alive with lots of street vendors.The beauty products store assistants can be aggressive to pull u into their shops at times. Be firm!
Best shopping paradise!,"Shop till your arms break! The skincare and cosmetics are definitely the cheaper than anywhere else! Buy your cutie socks here as well! 10 pairs and 1 free for 1000 won. As for skincare ans cosmetics, you notice they repeats after awhile. But NOTE! Not all same brand has the same offer. Some do not provide on the spot VAT and some hace their own in house promotion.. So if you think it is cheap just get it first. Also try to look for shops that does VAT on the spot to save you the trouble to go to airport and do the VAT. Hope it helps and have fun shopping! "
Food stalls,"Great atmosphere and choices! We had the glass noodles, spicy rice cakes, sweet potatoe, fermented honey and nuts and more noodles! Something for everyone!"
Cosmetics and Food Everywhere,"You cannot go to Myeongdong and not visit its famous shopping street. It's lined up with lots of boutiques and restaurants. Tourists and locals alike flock the area. There are also lots of good street food but watch out, prices of a quick bite easily stack up and you'll usually find eating in a restaurant instead is cheaper.When buying cosmetics, I suggest to buy in bulk so you can take advantage of the tax refund."
Browsing the Modern stuff,"Nice place to browse and shop, street food here is excellent, many bars and restaurants also available. Clothing prices often the same in different shops, reasonable selection of international brands."
Myeongdong Food and shopping street,"This is where the tourist pulse in Seoul beats the hardest. And why not, it has everything. Walking distance to some of the city’s attractions like Deoksugung palace and Namsan Tower. It is replete with retail shopping, cosmetics, streetfood, and the latest in K-fashion and did I say market of Namdaemun? You can go underground shopping, do hotel bar hop and feast endlessly on Korean dishes whatever suits your budget."
Myeongdong,"lots shops and restaurants in the Seoul, Korea. You can find anything you want from food and clothes. "
Shopping and food,If you're around Jung-gu or Chungmuro area and looking to see what the night market is about. Take a short walk to this place. There are tons of shopping and plenty of restaurants. If you're adventurous grab something to eat from the street vendors. 
Girls it is Mecca of Cosmetics,My wife went out and bought enough of skin care products to last a while in just an hour. She is not a cosmetic person. Worth a visit for ladies. Prices and variety is the main reason. 
Not for me,"Interesting to see, but not for me. Loud, touristy, expensive (at least the street food), cramped. If you like shopping and kpop merchandise, you may like this!"
Best place to get street food,This is the best shopping street to get street food even the halal one. The hawkers speaks English well so no worry about that. It lively in the day and even better at night. This is the best place to haul all those Korean makeups as well.
 Good place for shopping and street food,"Lots of international fashion brands. Countless shops selling facial and skin care products. The street market and food stalls open around 4pm to 10pm. You can find interesting food and snacks here. There are many street stalls selling clothes, toys and fashion accessories. "
Lots of shopping,This shopping area was good. It had lots of skin care stores and many large retail chains. Insadong had more boutique and art shopping. Myeongdong had unbelievable food vendors come out at night. It was fun to try all the food. If you are looking for the famous Korean skin care products this is your place for sure!
Great way to spend the day in Seoul,"If you want a touch of home for the day while staying in Seoul this is the place to go. When I mean home , a little American enclave as practically every store you would find at a mall back home is in this shopping area. Also, there are plenty of eating options if you are tired of eating local food. That being said , there are still lots of great local restaurants and street vendors to fill up on while shopping. "
A touristy street ,This street is filled with tourists. There are many street food stalls and also many restaurants around this area. There are many shops selling cosmetics products at affordable prices. I would think this is a Must visit for any tourist for its food and shopping. Interestingly we cannot find a good souvenir shop for the basic memory keepsake which a common tourist would buy. Highly recommend: A street where you will be spoilt for choice of food. 
good ,lot of people .. kk nice sercvice and lot of shops . everything i can find from here . really good place for travelers . ♡ 
Overrated,It was so many store and people.Price is expensive compare to other places in Korea. You can get cheaper price for the same product in other places.Overrated.
The Seoul Experience,"The sights, smells, sound. It truly is an essential fabric of any visit to Seoul and would strongly recommend for anyone. Food is amazing quality, and obviously cosmetic stores are everywhere. Make sure you have Won though!"
Night shopping and street food,"I suppose this is the tourist go-to place for everyone. Tons of shops, bars and food options. Should visit here if you in Seoul for the first or second time. Other than that, it gets a bit boring and repetitive."
Cosmetics Hub,Local Cosmetics are easily available at a Great Bargain.Good Showrooms like H&M | Zara are also available. Main Dept Store - Lotte is also around this area.
Totally new shopping vibe,"You just don't get the Myeongdong vibe like you do here compared to the Western world. The lights, the street foods, free samples and the hundreds of people just give of a different and unique shopping experience. Definitely a must visit place when in Seoul"
Access to a lot of destinations,"Don't think it's only a shipping zone for Chinese people. There are lots of tourists destinations around. Nam San, Seoul city hall, cathedral, shinshaegae are all nearby. The surrounding area deserves at least two days walk."
Shopping + street food = happy tourist,It was fun going there. We went to a lot of make-up shops to buy the things our family and friends requested us to buy. I enjoyed checking and trying their street foods.
Cheap Shopping,Great if you want to find a bargain in clothes and accessories. Many shops selling cheap clothes from children to adult. Many nice uncles and aunties selling stuff. Some shops even open until night time as in 1am 2am. So much fun!
A good place to explore ,"It's a heaven for fashions and skin care products lovers.You can find almost all the Korean brand products here. We realized that the stuff Myeongdong are more expensive compared with Hongdae and that's why we didn't do any splurging here.As for foods there are a lot of choices, ranging from street foods to restaurants but again it's a bit pricey. "
Street Food!,"If nothing else, come to Myeongdong for the street food. Walk through the streets and try them all!! If you are interested, try entering shops and they might give you free stuff. Just take them :)"
Superbly amazing street,"You can find a lot of interesting items here, especially skin product Not only that, the street food are also amazing.."
Don't miss out,"If you are fond of street food, shopping and night strolls in busy markets, this is the place for you. Street food in Seoul has its own charm, it's not exactly cheap as compared to street food in Europe or US, but it's worth trying. Also being a vegetarian you will have decent options to choose from. If you love seafood, try the butter garlic shrimps here. You can easily spot some unique food stalls that can startle you with the food stall owner showing off his speed skills."
Shopping and Street Food,For both expensive and affordable (underground market) for shopping. CDs/socks/memorabilia of your fave actors you'll find it here. Street food stalls open after 3pm/4pm.Too quiet in the morning.
Shopping/street food heaven,"I absolutely love this place, it really comes alive after 14h (after the food stands have settled). Most of the stores have promoter with free samples to lure you inside, and have sales girls fluent in English and Chinese. Every weekend (Fri-Sun), most of the stores will have additional sales, so even though it will be swarmed, during the weekends you'll score the best deals. During my shopping, my boyfriend enjoyed himself with eating from all the nice food stands. Exit 2 of Myeong-dong station now also has a 8-floor Daiso, ideal for your gadgets, souvenirs and gifts."
great for shopping,"plenty of cheap things to shop for. there's a variety of cosmetic or skin care products, clothes, socks, shoes, souvenir items, etc. but its the street food that i get to love. i should say its a must visit place for tourists especially during night time. a lot of money changers in the area too. near bus stops and the Myeongdong Cathedral."

From the traditional fish cakes, dried squids,roasted chestnuts and corns to the more upscale grilled lobster, shrimp and scallops .....In addition to the name brand cosmetic stores, there are lots of side street with hats, clothings, handbags, accessories, etc at cheap prices.

Too many food options to choose from at night. Just amazing! We stayed at Aloft Holel Myeongdong which is less than 5 minutes walk away. Super convenient."
Food and shopping heaven,"A very heavy tourist-populated place, the area is very accommodated to tourists having workers speak various languages (to some level of expertise).Plenty of food options here - price is higher than the markets but I guess it attracts the touristsDespite how packed it gets, I come here to shop as most places is immediate tax refund which I prefer - the tax refund at the airport can be tedious so having it being immediately done is A+"
Ladies... your wallet will be hurt,"if you're into beauty products, this is a heaven. even though there are a few similar chains of the same brands they give different discounts and free gifts."
Nothing mind-blowing,"Just street food that you can find in other streets. I bought a pollution mask with a smiley face on it for 5,000 won. That's about it."
Best shopping street in Seoul....,"Of all the shopping streets in Seoul, in our opinion- this is the best.Its huge, lively, great atmosphere, always crowded & have wide& good mix of products & food outlets. And it is centrally located in Seoul with easy access everywhere. There is a big & nice Lottle Mart nearby as well. We always stay here in our visit.For ladies, this is a paradise for cosmetics. All the Korean cosmetics brands are here. Each with multiple shops as well ( believe they are franchises as prices/promo do vary from store to store here). There are alot of street food & street vendors as well. Loved this place."
Street food!,"There are so many options of street foods along Myeongdong. We walked along once just to see what there was! We tried the twisted potato, the 32cm ice cream and a few other things during our time in Seoul. Great for a quick bite."
Myeongdong shopping.,"This part of downtown Seoul is quite the best area for shopping, with up-market, mid range and basic shops, with even 7-Eleven shops thrown in for good measure!There are eating stalls everywhere along the streets, and restaurants galore, catering to every taste.An absolute 'must' if visiting Seoul."
Myeongdong Shopping Street,This area is incredible for shopping! There are so many facial beauty products available. Rows and rows of shops. The prices are affordable too! Look ahead of time to see if you can get the foreign traveller discounts for some shops - it will save you some money...and save some room in your luggage when you’re packing for all the stuff you’ll buy!
very happening area,a very happening area with numerous shops as well as stalls selling street food. A very lively neighbourhood and worth going just to experience the surroundings even if one has no intention to shop
Street food galore ,"Myeongdong is the best place to stay if you want access to street food and beauty road side shops till 11pm. Lots of restaurants too. Love the crowd, the vibe and interesting things to see. The area for people watching!"
Terrible experience for me,"I stayed in Myeongdong neighborhood because I was told it is the best in Seoul but I strongly disagree with that.Myeongdong wasn't that good for me, I prefer Hondae, Ewha university street, Insadong, and Itaewon than it, why? Because it's terribly crowded and dirty, I mean yeah I expected it to be crowded but to a certain degree.I couldn't eat in the restaurants there, I got disgusted by them honestly, I visited cats and dogs cafes there but when I saw the similar cafes in Hondae I really wished that I didn't do it in Myeongdong.Seoul is a crowded city in general but my point is, I hated that only in Myeongdong shopping street."
Vibrant,"The whole area and side streets are full of high end shops, restaurants, cosmetic stores, food street vendor. At night the food vendor experience is truly amazing, not only in flavours but also in optics. Food presentation is amazing and makes one want to try everything. "
"Three Things - Fashion, Food, Females","Myeongdong is the shopping paradise in Seoul, but it's not for everyone. Unless you're looking for shopping that appeals to women or for street snacks at night, you'd be better off spending less time here except for a cursory visit. The famous duty free emporiums are in the area as well, with Lotte and Shinsegae attracting even more women.Having said that, the place does have some interesting attractions too, it's within walking distance to the cable car up Namsan Seoul Tower, you can also visit The Cathedral Church of the Virgin Mary of the Immaculate Conception, or simply known as Myeong-dong Cathedral. The world famous Nanta Cooking Show (don't let the name fool you, it's not really about cooking) is a daily feature in the Nanta theatre at the Unesco building.So, do pay it a visit and see if you'll stay..."
Street food,"There are plenty of shops here and the area seems very safe/clean. Great atmosphere, but the most impressive thing was all the street food stalls that popped up at about 16.00 ish. Such an impressive array of high quality street food. Must have went to 7 different stalls in 1 go. Watch out though, there is room for bartering as they seem to up the price if they see u are foreign. Amazing food and very pleasant people. A must visit for the food alone. "
Best place for accommodation,"Myeong-dong is one of the primary shopping districts in Seoul. The two main streets meet in the center of the block with one beginning from Myeong-dong Subway Station (Seoul Subway Line No. 4) and the other from Lotte Department Store at Euljiro. Many brand name shops and department stores line the streets and alleys. Common products for sale include clothes, shoes, and accessories. Unlike Namdaemun or Dongdaemun, many designer brands are sold in Myeong-dong. In addition, several major department stores have branches here, including Lotte Department Store, Shinsegae Department Store, Myeong-dong Migliore, Noon Square and M Plaza. The department stores carry many premium labels and other fashionable goods at reasonable prices.A must see in Seoul."
Shopping & Eating Paradise,This is the best shopping & eating paradise. Everyday Myeongdong streets will start with long stretch of food stalls from noon till late night. We love to come here for shopping and foods. Their street foods are marvellous & cheap
amazing place for shopping and eating,myeongdong is a shopping mecca ...everything you need you can find here particularly Kpop merchandise..ive been to myeongdong 5 times during my last trip and i still end up buying a lot after each trip..the shops here offer a lot of discounts and freebies so one really gets enticed to purchase... myeongdong at night is different during daytime but both are worthy of visit. myeongdong has been used as location for korean dramas and variety shows and i got excited seeing those.... never leave seoul without going to myeongdong
a great city,the myeongdong street is a great place for shopping. a wide area for shopping malls and restaurants. street foods are also present everywhere. 
Many of the same shops located around the area,"This has got to be the cosmetic capital of Seoul. There are literally hundreds of beauty shops (many of the same) located throughout the area which can be confusing especially when you're lost. Lookout for the folks in RED are helpful guides who speak English who can point you in the right direction though. If you're Asian looking, the chaps outside the stores will try to speak Mandarin to you and lure you with their free samples. Do not resist the inevitable. Be careful that some areas have vehicular access. And try the street food. it's amazing. "
Must go for girls!!,"There are lots of shops selling facial product like laneige,innisfree,tony moly,saem etc and they do have lota of offer and the price are much more cheaper compare to my homecountry. You can also try their local street food here too. But it only start to open in the afternoon. There are choicea of restaurant in the area too."
A Multispeciality street!! From tick racks to great food!!,This street comes alive at night. You can get all sorts of stuff. From souvenirs to high end clothing!! Best part of the street is the the delicious street food one can get here. And the milling crowd at night with its multicultural hues makes it worth the visit! 
Busy shopping area,"My hotel was located about a 15 minute walk from Myeong-dong. It is one of the main shopping areas in Seoul. There are two main streets – one from Myeongdong metro station (line 4) and the other from Fuljiro which meet at the centre. The area is full of shops and restaurants, cafes and street food stalls.There are many shops selling cosmetics. This is the place to buy good quality cosmetics at reasonable prices. Branded designer goods are sold as well. I am always a bit wary of buying such goods at prices that are too good to be true.There is a big department store – Lotte Department store in this area. Prices for designer goods are more or less reasonable.Myeongdong also has a number of good restaurants. In addition, there are fast food restaurants as well as eating places serving Korean, Japanese and Western cuisines. Many restaurants in Myeongdong specialize in kalguksu (noodle soup). You will also find banks, theatre and beauty and hair salons."
Beauty products and streetfood,"If you want to shop, go to myeongdong.If you want to eat streetfood, go to myeongdong.Its a very lively place, there can be a big crowd in the evening. Still a must visit."
Too touristy,This place is too touristy that prices are double or more than other places. Food and beauty products etc. are readily available outside this area too at a cheaper price.
Awesome,"Awesome, fun, beautiful. Great night life, great for shopping.. would love it visit again. Best place for street food: Fried baby crab and Shrimp, cabbage egg omelette, scallops in butter and cheese, foot long cone ice cream, roasted lobster."
Busy,"Mix of international brands, Korean household names and market stalks selling everything you could ever need"
Definitely the highlight!,"Being a shopping trip of course, we have to do shopping! Masks and beauty products are cheap here, you can see big brands having several branches even just across the street, it may be confusing so do get a map before heading into the streets and alleys!The street food stalls are also really great as you get to taste the south korean street food while doing some shopping!"
Greta Shopping,Always crowded with shoppers jostling around looking for bargains and souvenirs amidst plethora of shops trying to outwit their competitors by promsing each one to use their cosmetic products and look most beautiful .Amidst them are street food vendors doing brisk business in evening hours .
Makeup free samples,"Shops give you free samples to come take a look at their items inside, just go look, no need to buy and you get to keep the free samples. You also get rebate if you pay more than 30k krw. So bring your passport. "
Not For The Shoppoholic,"Loads of brands, loads of choices, loads of items .... loads of street food and loads more. Its a combination of high street fashion and a street shopping for the common people. Latest fashion on apparel, shoes, tshirt, branded or even local items , all are here. If you are up for it, loads of street food traders will be just around every corner. Baked lobster, Baked Muffin with eggs ( this is my favourite item) and local korean street food are amongst the many many choices being offered here.As for cosmetics, it is a heaven for those who loves to shop for skin care, facial care and anything to do with make up. Women will definitely loves it here.Its a must if you come to Seoul , Korea."
Bustling,"Super bustling street that comes alive at night. Wifey spent loads of time in the cold browsing through the street carts of jewellery. Apparently, earrings at 1,000 won is REALLY cheap. Other than that, eat the street food and get all your beauty stuff along this area. "
Shopping paradise ,"On here can say that you have strayed into a shopping haven with the busiest streets there are many shops, especially cosmetic stores can discount program extremely attractive There are also shops for clothes and shoes are very nice and the price is also very good If the tired and hungry you can enjoy great street food or visit a cafe to rest Very excellent"
Myeongdong Shopping Street,"We only had 2 hours to get some shopping so this was where we were brought to by our friends it was a fabulous place all lite up at nigh. there were so many small shops selling souvenirs of all descriptions and food sellers selling all kinds of snacks.But alas to all the Men out there this is a Makeup paradise for woman there are so many shops that are selling all sorts of products for the ladies, my wife was in her element.Luckily we managed to find we needed."
Helps to give some life to Seoul visit,"This street will help keep the visit to Seoul alive. The street has great shopping, whether it is street shopping or mall shopping. Street is filled with great local Korean street food - which are clean, hygienic and tasty. Never a dull moment walking along this street."
Great place to visit for make up ,"Do come here to try their street food. Ask about the price before ordering so that you won't be surprised. MUST TRY is the fried cheese rice cake selling at ₩3000 per stick. We ordered the pomegranate drink without checking out the price and was slapped with ₩7000. Seriously it's not worth!!The fried Mandu was good too. Good for sharing is the steamed corn with cheese powder sprinkled with plum. Do eat it while its hot. Bbq lobster was overly priced at ₩15000. Those with sweet tooth, do try their 32cm soft served ice cream and strawberry mochi stuff with red bean paste. The red bean fish shaped pancake is crispy and caramelized rough puff pastry. There are plenty of make up stores. Etude house has at least 5 outlets within the same vicinity. Innisfree has about 4 stores and 1 main double storey branch with a cafe. Prices at Myeongdong outlets are the same as other outlets in Hongdae. We managed to get better discount from Hongdae though. Ask about tax refund before you buy. Bigger outlets are able to do tax refund on the spot as long you spend ₩30000. More rebates will be given if you spend ₩50000. "
Place to visit 100%,You can spend here all day and still it wouldnt be enough.It is streets full of small shops offering all possible suvenirs and more.Lots of places to eat near by with local food.Dont miss this place it is amazing.
Make up heaven. Not for men!!,"It’s really good to come here at night. A bit crowded but it’s really fun. There were plenty of street food and a lot of make up shops!! And make sure to bring your passport to get tax discounts. Nature republic staff are so helpful,.Accessibility- bus from incheon is available.Safety- safe but too crowded.Must try- sunde!!! For girls,make sure you have enough luggage capacity coz it’s where you can buy cheap but good quality cosmetic and lots of free samples!!!!!"
City girl couldn't cope,I LOVE SHOPPING and live in a big city in the uk but I could not cope with the amount of people and shops however I did find everything I needed. Also side note boots in Korea is so expensive £8 for something the costs me £1.50 at home lol
Lively but just another shopping street,If you like shopping this is your place. I knew what Beauty products I wanted so I was in and out. Prices are cheap but I found other outlets or even in subway is cheaper. Kids really wanted the 23cm ice cream which we later realised you can't find anywhere else. So we had to come back to get it here. We ate in Lotte Mart. 
Shopping galore!,"Best place to eat street food and one of the best place to shop for clothes, shoes, make-up, socks, etch"
Perfect Place for Women,"You can probably call this as make-up or beautification heaven for women. Beauty shops in every corner, even with multiple branches for one store. Shopping for clothes, shoes and apparel can also be done here, but I would say, it has same price in the Philippines. So you should buy things that can't be found in the Philippines. The night food market is a different adventure in itself. You can taste all their street foods in this place, that will be you dinner already."
Crowded and a maze but exciting!,We went at night and the streets were quite crowded but the experience was nice. You can find almost anything to buy!
Freebies Freebies,"Better to go around 2pm onwards. street foods will just start to prepare by this timing.. you can enjoy both street foods and shopping...Tip 1: Dont buy on Mondays&Tuesday price are normalTip 2: dont get fooled of sale by wednesdayTip 3: thursdY is the best day to buy, %off are much higher compared pn wednsdayTip 4:with above tip you will assume friday will be the best day to buy. but its a big no no. Price will start again to get highTip 5: dont buy during sat and sun, price will go up again since its weekend.....So better to go shopping by thursday :) Happy shopping"
Great Shopping in Seoul,"This area is fun to walk around and offered the best shopping that I saw while on a recent visit to Seoul. The remarkable thing is that after a while, you're seeing the same 4-5 categories of stores (often you're seeing the exact same chain-brand store over and over e.g. Innisfree): cosmetics, luxury brand apparel, coffee, art/ceramics, kitschy souvenirs, and food. That being said, it's fun and a good place to wander and grab souvenirs."
Meet the locals,"The best way to have contacts with locals is walking down this main shopping street in the center of Seoul; here at least you will not see the classical shops you will find everywhere in Europe but all genuine shops where nearly everything is available, main things being ginseng and ... mobile phones of course."
Overrated ,"The most overrated shopping street in Seoul. It’s only great if you are a Korean beauty product & Korean big names fashion fan. There are many fancy street food at night but they overcharged. It’s 2-3x more expensive than other place. If you are looking for bargain buy and souvenirs, I would suggest Namdaemun Market which is just 15mins walk from Myeongdong."
Very lively,"As we stayed at a hotel less than 10 minutes away, we visited the shopping streets twice. The streets are hustling and bustling with lots of beauty stores, clothing stores and restaurants. We had BBQ, Korean dessert, then chicken and beer all in the same night. During the evenings there is also a small night market with some clothing vendors and mostly food vendors for a couple blocks. We loved walking around and people watching in the area. "
Fun engaging street ,"Beware of stalls trying to rip off your $ though. Otherwise u will find all sort of food, shoes, fashion staff here. Must see place when u visit seoul"
Most touristy part of Seoul we saw,Lots of free stuff if you are willing to be hauled into the stores by staff. Bring your passport to benefit from onsite duty free.
What a great place,"If your looking for something, anything, you will probably find it here. Huge variety of clothes, souvenirs and pretty much everything. Be sure to go into some of the buildings for lots more stalls and shops. Found they don’t barter much, maybe 10-20% but prices reasonable anyway. Leave enough time to explore. "
"OK street food and nice shopping, shop clerks hate you","Myeongdong is an amazing place for shopping (especially beauty products) and the evening vibe feeling is so good. There are banks if you need to withdraw money, tax free refund machines and counters so you won’t need to do in at the airport, restaurants and street food everywhere and very many people but no worries about getting pick pocked. However, most of the shop clerks (not street food vendors or street sellers) acted like I murdered their dearest pet and gave crap service. They barely gave response or tried to communicate, did not look at you when talked with, no smiles EVER. Imaging a shop clerk acting like you are a burden they are trying to get rid of. "
Tourist trap,"Myeongdong market street is the ultimate tourist trap in Seoul. Nothing is cheap here. But go to the backstreets and you may find some steals. Nothing compare to Hongdae prices however. Nonetheless, people still shop here for the experience that makes Myeongdong as a must go place in Seoul."
One of the must go places if u visit Korea!,If u 1st time coming to Seoul then u should stay around this area. Great atmosphere during night when there’s a lot of shops and stalls selling great stuffs and foods also! U can try all the street foods here while shop til you drop. 
Busy always,"If you like to see the crowd, this is the place. Shops are thd same for every corner. You can try street food in the evening."
Delicious Food,Street food is undefeated! Shopping is great. Watch out for the pharmacies! They will scam you! I purchased medicine that is by prescription ONLY in the USA from the pharmacies here. They are scam products. They don't work. I wouldn't purchase any products from the pharmacies in the airport either.
Street food,This shopping area is great for street food and skin care products but not too much else. They have several stores on the streets that are just repeated throughout the section. 
A maarket for beauty products and massarge,As Seoul's markets go it's OK but not great. Many beauty products with street food and clothes and shoes. Other markets are better but if close to your hotel it's worth a visit at night.
Good to shop,I shop at myeongdong almost every night for 5 nights. From fashion to skin care to food. I can get almost everything I want here. Especially lots of free gifts for skin products. Love this place sooooooooo much
"Nice street, crowded with people, lot of shops and food.","This is a good place to visit, especially if you like shopping and eating and to be around lot of people. Like in many areas of Seoul there is a great design all around and if you like this area at daytime you probably like it even more at dusk. The merchandise and prices? - I do not know, did no buy much except for something to eat."
Just another shopping street,This is just another shopping street with the big box stores. Nothing too special unless you are specifically going for shopping.
Good tourist spot at night,"Myeongdong area has lots of shops, about half cosmetics, quarter clothing, the rest are various other shops and restaurants. Everything is very close together, so you can comparison shop. The area comes alive in the evening and at night, as street vendors setup along the streets. The merchandise is standard night market fare, cheap trinkets and such. You will probably find better prices and selection at the Namdaemun market right next door, during the day, but much more crowded, rustic, and with less English. There are also street food vendors that setup at night, if you want to sample some portable local bite sized fare. "
Myeongdong Shopping,Brilliant The food is Outstanding Local Western Street Fine Fast Food it's all hereThe Lotte Supermarket Restaurants Shop Young and Trendy Branded Bargains are All here
Over-rated,"Over-rated is how I would describes Myeongdong Shopping Street. It's very crowded at night and on weekends. Make up store employees will chase to come into their store. There are Plenty of food vendors and restaurants but not all good. Food wise, food was okay, nothing to write home about. Don't get me wrong, you can find everything at the Myeongdong Shopping Street and that is it. If you want to do shopping and grab okay food, then this is your place. But you want good shopping and good food, go to GoTo Mall (Bus Terminal) which is way better. And there is another mall that is next to the GoTo Mall under the Bus terminal. Better food better shops, No make up stores to bother you. And there is a Lemon mini supermarket in the Myeongdong shopping area, STAY AWAY. Their employees are rude and horrible."
Vibrant & Fun ,Came here every night during our stay in Chongmuro. The street food at night is great and the lobster tail s a must try. Lots of shopping day and night and plenty of currency exchange shops.
Good selection of street food but more touristy and expensive,"My hotel was right here so the street food was most convenient. It seemed to be the most touristy area and thus most expensive. They seemed to have more touristy foods like the chicken skewers, meat balls, fried chicken pieces along with some of the more traditional things. I think I liked the chicken skewers the most here. Go elsewhere if you are looking for more traditional stuff or cheaper food."
Not for everyone ,"Good: Tons of skincare and cosmetics choicesRestaurants, coffee, and Street food galore. Bad:Wall to wall people at night. NoisyFree for all for both pedestrians and trafficDepending on your personality, you'll either enjoy the lively atmosphere or hate the crowds and chaos."
Make sure you visit in an empty stomach,"We stayed nearby so we visited the shopping/food street almost every night during our 5D4N stay. There are plenty of food stalls available starting noon till evening, so plenty of choices to try out.If one is not keen of street food, there are also plenty of highly recommended sit-in restaurants. Do a general search on Myeongdong best food to fish a few restaurants in the area.The place could feel like a maze and sometimes every street could get rather crowded during peak hours.Nevertheless, it's a definitely a place to check out if you are in the area. It's also easily accessible via subway.There are also volunteers stationed at certain areas to help tourists with directions. They dress in red vests with various labels on so easily identifiable."
Loads of yummy food,My favourite street to walk and snack! Lots of yummy Korean street snacks and many cosmetics stores! 
Great Place to Get Lost,"Myeondong has several shopping stores and vendors for all tastes and ages. The street food vendors offer a variety of quick, easy, and cheap eats. There are a few high end places if you're looking for a proper sit down. However, eating on the go is much more fun. A must see area if you're around."
For food explorers and beauty product lovers.,"We thought Myeondong would be a bit overrated but we still put it down to our must-try food hunting list. No regrets. I wont deny it was fairly crowded but it was one experience worth going for.As fellow Muslim travellers, my husband and I managed to find few halal stalls out of many that is available. Although there were few non halal ones (selling meat) majority were just seafood and one selling halal kebab.We went twice and took our time to try them out while some were quite delicious some were so-so. I particularly love their sweet delicacies namely the sweet peanuts with eggs hot cake. However out of the two stalls i tried, one of it tastes better than the other. So look out for the ones that has more patrons, lol. The street is full of beauty product shops as well as clothes so you may want to check it out. These beauty product shops will always include sample giveaways too. Majority clothes were quite small but I manage to find bigger baggy tops to fit."
A galore of beauty shops and street food stalls ,"Myeongdong, where the night is always young. Somehow time stops as you troll the streets and lanes of beauty shops, fashion outlets and food carts. The bright lights, the food smell, the touters' chants, the hawkers' showmanship, the heavy human traffic - the experience is multi-sensory! Landmarks don't quite work here because there are dozens of the same beauty shops at every lane that the streets all look almost the same as you turn the corner. Worth visiting for the multi sensory experience but it doesn't mean the purchases (including the food) are gentle on the pockets."
Great for ladies to shop torture for men,If you want to shop for brand nane clothes or cosmetics this is your area. Tons of shops big and small. Mix in a nice sampling of restaurants and you have it. 
Great fun ,"Very easy to walk around, has all the main shops that you would want to find in easy walkable distances and best part of it is that it simply has a great feel to it. On the weekend and many week nights the streets are filled with food vendors so it’s great fun walking around having a local snack and taking in the sights "
"More shopping, and it isn't cheap ","I'm not a big fan of shopping in the first place. It is fun to see the busy streets full of people, but for Americans, the goods are very expensive. I must say, Seoul is a beautiful and clean city. The people are respectful and very well mannered everywhere we have been. Even in the busy shopping district."
Place to purchase beauty products,This place would be a shopping heaven for ladies who are fascinated with beauty products. There are many shops selling beauty products at a price that is way cheaper than Singapore. The are also make shift street stalls selling traditional Korean food at night.
Check this market out. Yummy food ,Great food. Street food vendors Only starts at 2 pm. Good selection and speak enough English to get by. Worth waking around this market. 
Interesting ,"We go there for street photography mainly, many cosmetic shops worth going and different brands shops. There is halal restaurant offers good taste"
Shopping,"Very good bargain shopping and also branded shopping,especially clothes and shoes.Too good for street food too"
Well...,"To be honest?!? Nothing special. You see these places,shops ect hundreds of times next to each other. They have the same stuff.. so really nothing special."
It's a cosmetic heaven,"You can almost find cosmetic shop in every steps you make. Cosmetic shop from alley to alley in miles away. All the Korea local brand is here. Korea street food heavenly too. Some western brand like Zara, Guess, H&M also available."
Vibrant with many places to eat and shop!,"This is the place to visit in the evening. We first went in the morning and found the shops just opening up and not many people mingling.We returned the following day but in the evening, and wow, what a difference. The lights are flashing, the street vendors are out, and numerous people from all over the world walking and enjoying each street and alley.There are restaurants on street level, on the second floor with elevators that open directly just to one restaurant, and of course street food! You can find everything from fish cake soup to lobster with cheese topping.You can spend more than 2-3 hours just walking around, visiting shops, and eating on the streets or in restaurants.We ended up visiting twice, and found each experience different. If you're not careful you can lose sight of which street you are in.This is a definite tourist destination if you're in Seoul"
Nights at Myeongdong Street,I love to stay at Myeongdong area because I love to spend my night walking around the Myeongdong Shopping Street. Lots of street food you should try here. So many cosmetic shop to look at. Believe me you will enjoy its too. Enjoy shopping here. 
Cosmetics shopping,"Probably best place for cosmetics shopping and try some street foodI'm sure the street food is only for tourists, because I didn't see such a thing in rest of the city"
Come here in the evening to have street food,"Myeingdong is perhaps the most popular tourist area in Seoul. It can be easily accessed by metro. The market is big with a few big shopping malls (Lotte, Lotte Young Plaza, Shinsegae), Zara, Forever 21, numerous shops, restaurants, cafes, snack bars, street food vendors and more. Most of the stores sell cosmetics, clothing, electronics. The street food is the major attraction. There are food vendors on both sides of the streets selling a vast variety of food. Some of the food you probably haven't seen before.Occasionally, you see 2 people wearing red uniform with an ""i"" in front. They are the ""information center"". They are extremely helpful and speak fluent English and can answer any question about the area. I don't see any public washroom in the area but you can ask the ""information dual"" to show you the way.The place is very vibrant and always busy. Just come here to be with hundreds of people is an experience."
"Shopping, street food, atmosphere","Fantastic area to shop, loads of good price restaurants to find (try the side streets or look up to the higher levels) or just buy loads of tasty street food! Mix of international and Korean brand shops- some of them sooo cheap, lots of skincare, beauty and fashion options.Really busy and great atmosphere, worth a few visits while in Seoul- in the daytime and at night!"
Alway good ,"It’s 2nd time we came it’s still good an enjoyable this street for food and shopping , love to come back ☺️"
wonderful place,Very good for shopping and sightseeing. There are many cosmatics store that always give you special promotion as buy 1 get 1 free.
Best Place Ever ,"For people who are looking to shop for skincare and food, this is for you! This area has all the Korean make up and skincare stores, MULTIPLE of them!! As well as very delicious street food. My favorite brands include Innisfree and CosRx for Skincare, and for food you can try the fried Gyoza and rose shaped ice cream. We were lucky enough to have stayed in this area! "
Overwhelming!,This place has so many shops selling similar merchandise that it makes one wonder how they stay in business. Be prepared to walk a lot as there is much to see. 
great for food and shopping,We went on a Saturday evening and the buzz and atmosphere was amazing. Lots of street food stalls and shops. 
Buzzing Place,"Busy place with street food stalls set up by evening, selling all kinds of food from lobster tails to skewers. There are many cosmetic and fashion stores selling good quality but affordable fashion clothes. A must for anyone loves shopping."
Great market street. ,Exciting street with many varied eating options of wonderful korean food.Market priced clothing. Great atmosphere
Spend that money,"An absolute must when in Seoul. I regret not knowing a word of Korean cause I would be bargaining. Not so big but full of beautiful clothing items. If I come to Seoul next time I’ll deff come back, cause I bought so much."
Cosmetics shopping heaven for the ladies !,"If you are on Seoul and looking to do some shopping, go to Myeongdong shopping district. Especially for the ladies, there are so many cosmetics shops , local brands who set up shop here. Think innisfree, nature's republic and the lot ! Go check out the latest Korean trends and fashion.Do try to haggle tho, and collect your free face masks, for your own personal use and if you have too many, it works out great as gifts to family or friends. And if you are a guy and was dragged along by your wife or girl friend, there are many cafes around the area. Try cafe gaya, you can drink your latte or sip an expresso while she shops. Just remember to bring check in luggage :)Alternatively guys you can always try the street food around the area for some great traditional Korean food.By the way, there is a Line Shop there, so guys be prepared to drink lots (and lots) of coffee. "
Doing shopping in shopping street,"This year i've visited South Korea second time.In this review, I'm gonna write about myeondong shopping street where has lot of modern brand stores and you can buy what suits you want. In this picture, i've with my friend who study in korea. We did shopping all day until we almost straved. There were crowded people to do shopping. After shopping, we ate korean cuisene that called samgebsel. They often drink some beer and soju(korean traditional alcohol) after eating meat. Of course, we followed their culture kkk. If you are planning to visit seoul, never ignore to do shopping at Myeondong. In my experience, it's gonna make you happy that doing shopping at all new brands street. "
Just a quick trip ,"I am european, but the shops are good value ( apart from electronics) but for the larger person there are no choices. "
Evening Snacks,This street is just full of excitement for a tourist who wants to shop or nibble on some fascinating snack's that is sold by the street hawkers. The shops are open till 10pm so you got plenty time.
Lively street with many vendors and shopping options,"I love Myeongdong Shopping street because everything is so close to one another that you can shop, eat and get a nice hair cut and make up too. Compared to the prices of department stores, shopping in Myeongdong costs much less. I also like massage place in Royal hotel. I think it's called spa Element. The staff, prices, and services are really the best. I also like hair shops there. Cheap and Chick"
Interesting shopping & restaurant area...........,"Myeongdong is a maze of retail stores, restaurants, and hotels in Seoul. Well worth visiting as a tourist to wile away a few hours wandering around. Amongst the Korean stores there are many western brands including Boots, Starbucks etc., while the small restaurants offer an affordable way to taste the local cuisine."
Good place for shopping,This district is very busy with shoppers. You literally can find anything here. Street foods are also available here.
paradise for the shopaholics and foodlovers!,i went there 2 times; once in spring and then summer! better go in spring ah.. coz mosly the food are hot! but again so many cosmetic shop and local brand distro! definitely favourite place for those people who love to shopping and eat street food! once i try the crepes with my bf omg. taste like bomb with melted choco and banana as the topping
Shopping shopping shopping,"Hundreds of shops mostly cosmetics and apparels! Lots of restaurants too so easy to grab food during your shopping. At night, there are street vendors that make the area livelier. Try those street foodS from skewers to local snacks and delicacies. Subway myeongdong station or euljiro 1. "
It is like Orchard road of Singapore ,"Great place for shopping and eating out,Night time there are food carts around too. Lotsa hotels around. Convenient."
Strolling the streets of Myeongdong,"Myeongdong is actually 2 subway stations away from Seoul Station and we were told that the shopping was good there. We actually found Myeongdong Cathedral and it's bookstore even more interesting. Worth spending half a day walking the streets, it's really interesting."
Good place to shop but not eat,"There is a lot to see and buy, can't finish in a day. You can find some similar items in different shops, so compare before you buy. Avoid taking free samples from cosmetics and skincare shops as most of them will literally pull you in to their shop and take back the ""free sample"" if you did not buy anything. Food in Myeongdong streets are mostly over-priced. Ask the price before purchasing food as some sellers would raise the price if they know you are travellers."
"Good shopping area, watch out for overpriced food.","Myeongdong is great for skincare and cosmetics shopping. A variety of eateries, however pricing is higher than a normal restaurant. I paid 55000w for breakfast of 3, which I only spent 25000-30000w at Chungmoru."
Boring and expensive,"Lots to see in this area but mostly all the same - clothing, street snacks, and cosmetic shops. It all sounds fun except almost all the products being sold are basically the same. Everything is more expensive than the rest of Seoul, so that was a huge turnoff for us. I would not recommend shopping here, a quick walk-through would do it if you've got time to waste. Families with children - watch out for large crowds and loud noises."
Skincare haven,"The place to go to if you're into skincare shopping. Instant tax rebates free if you bring your your passport and buy above 30,000KRW. Nanta theatre is also located there. Very busy area. Sample some street food as well as quaint cafes. You can also find lots of currency exchange shops there. Tourist information centers can be found in several places. Many hotels as well."
Nice shopping place,Many shops and restaurants open until 10 pm. Good place to spend time and look for best deals! Branded stores are also in the area. Bargain carts on the street like night market. 
Everything is here!,"Shopping for beauty products? Well there are at least 5 from where I stand. And they all beckon. Snail cream, animal facial masks, you name it. Packed a dozen or so. And those socks. Just had to get them for my wife, daughter and granddaughter!"
Great place for foods and shopping ,"There are lots of street foods along myeongdong and many places where you can have Korean BBQ. This place is ALIVE during late afternoon to late at night. Many small stalls selling foods, clothings , bags , socks etc These are the streets full of where you can buy really good bargains of Korean masks. "
Excellent shopping,"A very busy place with every imaginable shop. Loads of name brand shops, restaurants, coffee places and skin care shops. Very safe to visit at night"
Cosmetics and skincare heaven; good street food,"FOOD: Street vendors come out in the afternoon to set up their stalls. There's a wide range of local street food here(which I noticed is more prominent in the night scene and not so much during the day) so there's bound to be something that will suit your taste. It is kinda weird how people flock to this place early in the evening and at around 11pm, this place becomes more like a ghost town. Yup, the stores close early. If you're planning to come here to drink, this is not the best place for that. Go to Itaewon. There is, however, a narrow street in this area with a strip of bars that stay open till dawn.SHOPPING: Prices here are higher. I bought some socks near Ewha University for 1,000 krw each and was surprised to see the same kind in Myeongdong which were sold at 2,000 krw. Don't fall for the free samples. Store clerks would give them away to lure you inside the stores. Trust me, they really know what they're doing. Cosmetics and skincare products are cheaper here, since this place is where they come from. Lol. Look out for incredible deals especially those 50% discount and 1+1 promotions. Overall, this place is not bad at all. As a tourist, I enjoyed the atmosphere here and would love to come back soon. "
"If you love buying cosmetics, this is the place","Great place to buy cosmetics, period, and we will come back here only for cosmetics, period. Food wise I think is a bit over-priced and not all of them are my type of food but very interesting experience. Personally I love tornado crisp."
No more a tourist attraction.,"Do you want to buy a pair of Nike shoes, a cup of Starbucks coffee, or a can of Coca Cola at a 7 Eleven? If yes, this is a perfect place full of literally all local and global brands. This place used to be the only modern place 50~60 years ago, but now it is a place with terrible restaurants who rip you off. I would rather recommend you Gangnam, Garosugil, Anguk, Hyewha, and many other places. "
Good for tourists,Here you can find local food and scene as well as an international flavor (shops). It's targeted to tourists and so it's mostly busy with people.
Great for street food and people-watching,"Definitely worth a stop if you are traveling to Seoul. I had delicious street food there and enjoyed just walking around and soaking in the ambiance, with many restaurants, shops, and bars to explore."
Carnival Atmosphere @ Night! ,"Street food Korean style! Shrimp on a stick, BBQ lobster tails, buttered scallops, saucy rice cakes, tornado potatoes, dumplings, fruit juices, Korean pancakes, and more .... so much choice, good prices, tasty food! "
Interesting shopping market in Seoul,"Famous for cosmetic shops, they are frequent and repetitive. Good street food options, look for the rose shaped ice cream and foot high cone. It seems like there are more deals than Gangnam, but not as good as Others."
Once is enough ,It's a bit of a tourist trap here however worth going to for the street food. They have a lobster tail smothered in cheese which I returned to the area another day just to get it. It was pretty busy and shopping not so great. I suggest only going if you're a foodie. 
Great time on weekend nights,Love Myeondong and street food . Although I am not a shopper type these streets have a different character and a must do in Seoul. Go there after 7 or 8 pm.
Shopping time!,"From fashion items to kpop items to cosmetic products in the morning then, street foods by late afternoon 'til the evening, you better prepare your money to fly away."
Shopping Eating Haven,"Loads of places to shop and loads of places to eat. However, travellers be forewarn of shop salesperson who try to persistently put you face mask samples to you to enter their shops. And when you refuse politely after multiple times, they become extremely rude and ask you to get lost. "
Make up shopping,"Place to buy make up (woman things), many cafes and also restaurant. For muslims you can easily found halal food.In the night there's a lot of korean street food stall."
Love the street food,"While I'm not into the shopping here, I do enjoy the street food vendors stationed at numerous locations throughout the area. You can find some great treats on sticks. "
Too crowded,The whole area caters to tourists. Most salesgirls are able to speak chinese and some can be pretty aggressive. They have repetitive brands almost at every turn of the corner. The street food are relatively more pricey too because its a touristy place. The streets get so crowded that you often have human traffic jams. I stay there so it gets quite frustrating on my way back to the hotel...
Foodie,"A street perfect for foodies and shoppers. Plenty of street stalls and even shophouses such as Yoogane and other KBBQ places. After having your lunch/dinner, you can continue to shop cheaply at innisfree etc and get your tourist tax refund. Remember to bring your passport along."
A treat for your senses,"There is so much action in this area both day and night that you cannot possibly experience all of it. From late afternoon until late in the evening, the streets are packed with food and other vendors selling unique treats. We never tired of wandering the streets and experiencing the visual and taste sensations. It would be a huge mistake to visit Seoul and miss this area."
Amazing place,The place is crowded and has plenty of food. There is also a mall nearby where you can buy groceries. It is a must-see place if you go to Seoul. 
Too crowded and a bit overpriced,"This place is really a haven for cosmetic-buff. If you intend to buy or looking for a good brand with discounts then this is the place for you. Other than that i would skip the place. Other stuff like streetfood and clothes etc are over-priced compared to other places like Insadong, namdaemun market and bukchon hanok village shops."
Best street food in Seoul,If you want street food at night this is the place to be. So much variety and choice. Bustling with energy and atmosphere. Tons of cosmetic stores too for bargain buys. Gives a good sense of Seoul at night. It's much more subdued during the day.My favourite area in the city 
Just an average shopping street,Maybe I'm missing something but i don't understand the hype? This is simply another 'high street' in a different city/country. There is nothing unique. Its is extremely busy and to be frank offers nothing in the slightest bit unique... 
Great place to eat and buy cosmetics,"It's a bit overwhelming to see several of your favorite Korean beauty stores along the area. But I guess that feeling adds to the charm of Myeongdong. Great food and shops along the way. The place is bustling but clean. The prices are generally the same in the beauty stores. But the promotions differ. So, if you see something that you think is of good value, better snatch it! The next store, although the same, may carry a different promotion!"
Superb Shopping Experience,Best place for cosmetic lovers and there is absolutely no language barrier at this place. There is at least 1 English or Mandarin speaker in the shops. Most stores give freebies to customers . A Must go!
Cosmetic Heaven For Lady,"We stayed right beside popular Myeongdong Street. Beside cosmetic products you can get local street foods, korean restaurant, apparels & some local stuffs. International brand such as Zara, H&M, Uniqlo, Forever 21 also available here.This busy street still active untill 2030hrs everday. Lot of hotels along the street. However the stuffs bit pricy compare to others downtown at Seoul.No issue on safety here, you can stroll the street safely, cctv almost everywhere."
Great atmosphere!,"Great shopping atmosphere and home to Seoul' s first department store Shinsegae...beautiful store with an amazing higher end food court, market and good hall. The street good vendors lend to the atmosphere...great for people watching "
Full of people with bags,"Restaurants, cafes, street food, shoes, clothing, cosmetics and....people buying, eating, grouping... The place is lively always when I’ll be walking there."
Expensive but pic worthy,Things r expensive here but since the K Pop became famousPpl flew to this place from allover just to CHECK IN into the cafes and some shops following the trendNothing muchJust cafes and shops and expensive clothes from china
Cosmetics Haven,"If you are into Korean cosmetics, this is the place to shop. They have great deals for all your cosmetic needs. But if you're not into cosmetics, this is still a great place to visit especially at night because there are a lot of restaurants from korean bbq to street foods and ice cream."
A must,"I went there after 6 pm and there were plenty of interesting street stalls selling hats, food, clothing, mibile phone cases, socks and snacks. The side streets nearby are also good to venture. All skin care shops are in the vicinity."
Great shopping mostly cosmetics ,"Well very busy shopping high street . Lovely to see vital and a lot of street food you must see , I rated only in resturant called pane pizza great Italian food while shopping "
The food is better than the shopping,"There are many tasty things to eat here, but I think the shopping is getting overpriced. You can find better deals inside of subway stations."
Myeongdong Review,"Large shopping street with many different shops and goods, especially for clothes and cosmetics. Also there are quite many places to have something to eat. For people who have the taste of shopping in traditional way rather than shopping centers."
Same things over and over again,"Same food, gadgets and accessories, even shops are the same nearly every block. The food on the street aren't that cheap for what they are."
Good but beware of false advertisement,"Good shopping area with lots for everyone. Just beware of false advertisement. The saem shop tried selling my fiancée ""buy one get one free"" on an item at 100k won saying they were 100k each - but when it came up on the till it was just 50k won each. We walked out after them trying to back out of the story. Beware of anything in shops without price tags. "
Shopping and street food,"Plenty to eat and shop. Loaded of Korean cosmetic brand, shoes and cloth. Pricewise is very attractive but, if you have time I would recommend try and look around several shops before you buy as prices may vary even for the same products. "
Busy Place for Shopping,"This place is busy even late at night. Plenty of food carts, skin care products, clothes, shoes. You can even watch some shows here like Nanta."
Great shopping and food street foods,This is a must visit. Lots of shopping and incredible amounts of new foods to try. My wife and I really enjoyed this area. it felt very safe as well.
Something for everyone.,I enjoyed the cultural experience and work of talented artesian. Stocked up on beautiful paper and calligraphy supplies.
Shopping places for Korean cosmetics and food,Pretty crowded and full of Korean cosmetics shops and restaurants. I think some of the restaurants are overpriced since it's a tourist spot?
방문,"It is the most famous shopping street in Korea. It is also the best place to meet young people. Since it is pushed by Japanese Chinese tourists, it is no longer a korea street.한국에 가장 유명한 쇼핑거리이다 젊은이들에 만남에 최고에장소이기도하다 언제부터인가 일본 중국관광객들에 밀려서 이제는 중국인거리라고해도 손색이없다"
A lot of shopping,"There are a lot of repetitive stores like same brands down the street. Should purchase in korea as home grown brands (innisfree, the saem, etude, nature republic, thefaceshop/thebodyshop) are much cheaper here locally. Masks when bought in bulk can go as low as US$0.50 per piece so do research and have a shopping list before your visit."
shopping..........shopping............,all famous brands of cosmetics are all around. also street food at night. I bought like a luggage of cosmetics. Too cheap to be real but it's real. ^^!
Great atmosphere! My fav spot,"This place just has a great atmosphere. There are so many restaurants, local stores, clothing stores, etc. This place is just great for shopping and have a good vibe. You would feel like walking in times square without the tall buildings though. You want to make sure you have gelato ice cream."
Love the shopping and stree food vendors,Lots of shopping and lively action going on all day into the evening. We had fun trying different foods at the street vendors. We will definitely come back.
Great Shopping Center,Great shopping center with some entertaining street snack...Many skin care product with low price and good quality..
Awesome,"Street food was amazing. In this market, you can find anything in this world from the lowest price to upper-average. Even adult toys is sold here. "
Shopping to the max!,Myeongdong street shopping is the greatest. The stores staff are accomodating and very helpful. They are also corteous.
Shopping,This is the place to go if your looking for cosmetics and clothings at discounted prices.The prices offered here are significantly cheaper than elsewhere.Look out for their 1+1 offers.
Great shopping especially for make up products,"It's very crowded with tourists everyday. There are alot of make up shops everywhere. Walk a few lanes and you will see alot of repeated shops selling masks, make up etc. The line shop is pretty packed too. The food stalls are pretty expensive. I rather go in a restaurant instead. But Myeongdong is great as you can find everything there."
Great shopping but...,"The shopping is really great, but since it's a tourist area it tends to be very crowded. Try to avoid going there on the weekends, also note that the restaurants are usually a bit more expensive there, but nothing major. "
Great Place,"Street where you can find everything. Shopping, good food, and church. Must visit place when in Seoul."
Shopping while street food culinary,"This is the place where you want to shop for cosmetics or even clothes. Once you are here to have to hold yourself, or you are going to buy everything. They even have a street food stall from the corner until the other side of myeongdong. There are cheap sweater or coat between them. Try the famous Kyoja noodle while you are there. You would need your passport if you buy cosmetic more than 30000 won to get tax refund."
Great food everywhere..! ,A bit crowded but the food and shopping is well worth it... lots of streets to visit most all have street food at a good price.
Lobster from a cart?,"Higher end food venders than Namdaemoon area. Lobster, crepes, etc. Wanted to try them all.Shopping was not very impressive but that was probably a personal thing. i saw more for me at Namdaemoon mkt."
Tons of Average,"Lots and lots of stores. Lots and lots of the same stores. How many Innisfree shops can there be? People flock here for the average purchase. When I was there, food carts were set up down the main street. It was busy with all sorts of activity. I tried several of the foods, but they were all ""fast food"" and not good food.Interesting to see."
Probably Korea's best known shopping district,"We visited the area during our walkabout of the Myeong-dong area. Lots of department stores and shops that sell brand name clothes, cosmetics and accessories. If you like branded products, you will probably like this area. However, I prefer local markets like Namdaemun where prices are cheaper and I don't have a preference for brand names."
Great,Stayed in a hotel in the area. Well worth it. So many things to see and buy. Sellers are friendly. A good place for shoe lovers. 
Shopping haven ,"We stayed here in myeongdong because I've read reviews about this place and we did'nt regret it.5mins walking distance from our hostel to the shopping district.The price of their shoes is much lower and you can take the tax refund also at the airport.Every corner has lots of beauty products to choose from.I enjoyed buying lots of face mask and make up from etude,skinfood,missha.The street foods was really tempting so you don't need to eat sometimes in the restaurant.We really enjoyed our shopping here.I just wish we had a chance to shop at the lotte mart."
Must see,"Myeongdong is one of the most important shopping area in Seoul and it famous for plastic surgery and women care products. Myeongdong Shopping Street is close to my Hotel and it Always busy.There are many shops, restaurants ,cafe in the street.On theother hand the smell not good.The product not cheap,you should bargain.I enjoyed buyfrech fruit in this market/"
Shopping spree,"Lots and lots of stores. We came here around 11 am on a Thursday morning. Place is full of people, and lots of stores having items on sale. I was able to load up on my face masks! Buy 30 masks for 60,000 won and you get another 30 masks for FREE at Tony Moly. They give you tons of free stuff too. I was able to buy some colored lenses for 45,000 won (buy 1 get 1 Free). Don’t forget to bring your passport to avail of the tax free on purchases 30,000 won and above. I heard the night market is pretty awesome too. But we left around 3pm. Totally a fun place to shop! "
Don't miss it,"This market is an exciting and authentic slice of the local experience, and should not be missed if you want to get a feeling for Seoul. There are some affordable items and notable things that are good values and also interesting are the various street foods and the experience of buying eyeglasses. Optical lens in Korea are very good and can be affordable and rapidly produced, but explaining what you want and working it all out is a bit of an adventure, in a good sense."
A shopping paradise for young ladies,"There are many shops, restaurants and street food stalls. Not cheap price and the quality not good. Selling fast fashion around the area. "
Lot of food and shop,"If you want to shop without getting bored in Seoul, this is the perfect place. Tons of hotels for food. We really loved the street food. Too much crowd in the evenings."
"If not the shopping, the street food is worth it.","This area is filled with stores. There are other things going on like a Nanta theater. The main focus is all the shopping so if Korean products (makeup, clothing, jewelry, or hats with Korean words) is what you're looking for then this is the place to go. It is very crowded, but not impossible. The largest UNIQLO in Korea is also located here. If it's not shopping then go for the all the different street foods (salty type and dessert types plus fruits. yes you can just get a cup of fresh blended fruit juice). Otherwise, there are also cafes to take a break if needed from the shopping."
Super lively with more cosmetic stores than ever,"Cosmetics cosmetics cosmetics! Very lively with a lot of street food vendors as well. Area is safe, easy to navigate. A lot of clothes store as well. "
Happening place to shop and eat,"Went there in the evening in search of a seafood restaurant. This market is full of lanes loaded with stalls of variety of food and shops. Walked and shopped here for two to three hours. There are many local shops as well as malls in this area. All shopping stores start closing at 9:30 pm and after that only restaurants are open. If u r a fan of bao bao bags and can't afford it , here you can buy the cheap imitations at a very reasonable price. A good place to bargain. Loved shopping here. A must visit ."
List your shopping Needs!!,"Lots of stores to choose from. Better if you focus on what to buy. Great steals are of course buying in bulk. Buuuut, might end up buying more than what you need :p Street food - expensive compared with other locations such as those near universities. Shopping - found myself buying in duty free malls for instant tax refund."
Girls Paradise,"Big area full of girls paradise, skin care, makeup, dress, all you can find, plussss food was great here, u will get confuse what do u want too eat, coz everything was tempting!"
Cosmetic paradise,"Very crowded; a lot of foodstalls, a lot of souvenir-stalls, and cosmetic shops! You can also find many restaurants. In my opinion, this place the right place to shop cosmetics, they offer many discounts, and also the price is cheaper than in my country (indonesia). I don't recommend you to shop souvenir in this place, because you can find cheaper souvenir in other place.Happy shopping!! :)Note: there's also a beautiful cathedral (chatollic church)."
Shop and eat,"A lot of street food, wide variety. Some can be pricey. But there's also Macdonalds. Many shops, mostly beauty products. "
A heaven for shopaholic!!!,"I love this place so much!!!! Everything I want is here!!! Cheap cosmetics, delicious foods and korean costumes are all around!!!! I spent all of my trip here. Thanks Myeongdong "
A place to get beauty product and korean street food at night,"A place to walk around if your are looking for beauty products. Most of all the famous korean brand of beauty products can be found here. They even have LUSH shop here! At night the street in front of the shop turns into hawkers stall selling food item. You can get to taste all sorts of korean street food there. They have grill lobster, fried baby crab, rice cake, egg bun, ice cream and even halal kebab. If you are lucky you can also get good bargain for shoe at some of the shop. For tourist you can get the immediate tax refund from the shop with certain amount of purchase made but remember to bring along your passport."
A place to see a bit of everything in Korea,"You need to have 1-2 hours to stroll down this street to see small ornaments, suveniors etc... etc.. A place where you can buy lot of things to your freinds when you go home."
Myeongdong,"I love myeongdong. It likes a cosmetic street. Halal food also available near apple shop. Face shop, nature republic every day sales. Awesome"
A place to visit whenever in Seoul,Shopping all around is how I'll sum up this place. From the many stores selling anything from shoes to clothes to facial products it's a place that one must visit when in Seoul. There's also lots of food to choose from either from the restaurants or the food cart stores. 
Cosmetics heaven,"You will be surrounded by cosmetics shops..esp face mask. its heaven for women...a few good store like nature republic, innisfree, laneige, olive & young etc..look out for their promotion for best price. They try to lure you with free mask to go inside the shop. In the night, there will be alot people selling food and taste nice as well."
Don't know about the shopping but great food!,"I'm not really a shopping person but I thoroughly enjoyed the wide variety of street food here. Sometimes it's a bit of a puzzle to find out what is being prepared/sold, but that's part of the fun I guess."
cosmetic heaven,"you can get cheaper price if you bargain with the seller if you talk nicely and not complaining to them. for real. and the cosmetic is everywhere. most of the shop is selling the cosmetic from hair to your toes, i suggest you to go to nature republic. you got to spend a lot of time and money there."
Great place for food and shopping!,"Highly recommended if you enjoy street food and shopping for facial products!The streets will come to life with vendors selling yummy street food at about 5pm everyday. There's a whole wide range of foods that will be sure to satisfy your taste buds. Even if you go during winter, there's foods that will warm you right up!There's also many restaurants around that you can stop for a nice warm meal in the midst of your shopping :)Myeongdong is famous also for the facial products there! There's lots of sales persons outside the shops giving you free samples of their products in hope of attracting you into their stores. If you're looking for brands like Innisfree, Etude House, and other local brands, there's lots of them around! "
"Noisy, fancy","Myeongdong is the area of fancy fashion shops, restaurants and massage services (very useful after the long flight!). Maybe the best place in the city if you are looking for a serious branded items. Fot the cheaper choice visit the neighbouring Nangdaemun Market."
Cosmetic shopping haven,"Face mask, trendy clothes and food stalls. Cheap cosmetic and face care.Stating in philstay myeongdong metro is a good recommendation as the owner gives personalized service."
Shopping ,A lot of stores and yes street food. Many people and tourists of course on a Friday . We arrived at 9 pm and we noticed before 11 pm stores are starting to close even the street vendor. I'm not amazed food are expensive and I didn't find it quite good sorry. You could really compare it to Taipei night market. But my opinion is just for me you might enjoy here because of a lot of shops and duty free.
Young,Good younger people hanging out area to find good and cheap fashion and beauty products. Also have easy and well-priced eats. 
September 2017,"A "" must do"" in Seoul simply to experience all the different food stalls from pancakes to dumplings to octopus ... favourite was the meat filled korean dumplings ... awesome And as opposed to the sights often seen in asian cities like Thailand , nothing seedy or concerning ... would recommend to do if you are Seould"
Can't get enough of the place!,"We visited Seoul during the Holy Week and stayed at T Mark Hotel Myeongdong, just a few minutes leisurely walk or one subway stop away from the busier part of Myeongdong, its shopping street. We LOVE Myeongdong shopping street! We must have gone there almost every single night for shopping, Dinner, or simply strolling the busy lanes. We Love the place particularly at night when everything is lighted up. You won't run out of options for shopping and food, and the choices all fit anyone's budget. The atmosphere is lively, and just when you feel Myeongdong can't get any livelier and busier, the weekend comes and the already busy lanes are suddenly filled with more stalls carrying food, clothes, bags, etc. This place is a must visit to any tourist in Seoul. Don't forget to get your supply of Korean skin products! "
The biggest shopping street in Seoul,"Are you love shopping? if you love shopping, yes this place is suitable for you. Because there's a lot of branded item in here like : Uniqlo,Zara,H&M,Guess,Adidas and many mores. Or do you love cosmetics? Don't worry because Myeongdong shopping street is comprehensive like : Nature republic,Tony Moly,Etude House,Innisfree and many mores. if you go here, don't forget to bring your passport to get a special discount (if there's an event). And also taste street food in here."
Nice for a one-time visit,"Myeongdong is a must-visit of korea because of its popularity but it's only worth it to pop by for just one evening. It mainly consists of korean cosmetic shops and the same shop appears every 50m or so. Great if you need some makeup and skin care or if you want to visit flagship stores like style nanda pink hotel and Aland. Otherwise, if you are looking to just busk in a chill atnosphere, Hongdae more diverse and more happening."
Shop and street foods!,"A place for u to indulge in street foods and clothings. Facial products heaven but u should go to the mall basement area, there is a small facial products shop selling cheaper then the boutiques itself. Some snacks are over priced though.. but if u are looking for more trendy k-pop feel then u should head down to hongdae on a weekend. Street shows, buskers and now trending fashions heaven."
Shopping not cheap,In Seoul I didn't go to the electronic market. All the other markets and shopping areas I visited did not have any thing that's worth while carrying back as everything except for the facemasks and other beauty products can be bought in most other countries I have visited at a cheaper price.Seoul is definitely not a shopping destination.
Shopping Paradise,"Here at Myeongdong you will also find big-name stores like Spanish fashion chain, ZARA and Forever 21. Migliore, easily accessible via Exit 4, Myeong-dong Subway Station, is a starting point to shop for many tourists coming out of the subway station.There are also many street food stalls serving traditional Korea delicacies such as fish cakes, tteokbokki (a stir-fried dish made of rice cakes with vegetables in hot sauce) as well as new food inventions like the potato tornado! So if you don’t have time for a proper sit-down dinner/lunch, just grab some food on the go, shop through a few shops/street stalls and then grab something else from the next food stall and continue on!"
interesting area to visit for local food and souvenirs,it took us 1 hour to wander thru this street as there are many nice shops. great place for tourists to buy souvenirs and to taste local food. 
Korean Shopping Market on Steroid,"This is definitely a tourist trip, but also a local trip. When you think of visiting Korea, you think of cosmetics, fashions, shoppings, etc. This shopping block is all of them on repeats. After 5-10 steps, you see another facial shop selling masks, cosmetics shops, clothing shops. There are also some good restaurants and street food options. At night, there are food vendors also selling street foods. An interesting fact about Korea is that they strongly encourage visitors to take people and upload them online. There is a big Line Friend shop that people would line up and take pictures. Overall, it is an interesting experience. "
Great shopping!,Loved walking around here and buying awesome cosmetics! So much to see and alleys to walk through! You can get lost b cause you have so much fun walking around! 
Shopping frenzy in the heaven of comestic,This is heaven of comestic. A lot of brand: Innisfree (wifi-free); Natural Repubpic; Style Nanda (only one store)Street food is expensive and It does not match my taste
All about skin care,"most of the shops are for skincare and cosmetic product like Sulwhasoo, Innisfree, Laneige, Faceshop, TonyMoly , etc. Hungry..? The street is fully of food carts in the evening. also have few halal food carts."
one of the best places to stay or visit,"Myungdong is one of the best places for shopping, food with short distance benefit to connect to sightseeing places. It is in the middle of the Seoul (Northern part of river) which can be easily connected to Namsan (top hill), Gyeongbok palace and other palaces, Cheongye streams and many museums. I recommend to stay near Myundgong and visit these fantastic sightseeing places and enjou night at Myundong. You will enjoy a lot of fasion products and a full bunch of street food and restaurants~~"
Great Place to Shop,"This is one of our must-visit places in Seoul. It was as what we expected - lots of shops, restaurants, street foods, ... and people. Since our hotel was 15-minute away, we went here everyday - morning, afternoon, and every evening.Many of our must-eat restaurants are also in Myeongdong. We had pan-fried chicken, dumplings, noodles, BBQ, ice cream. There are also many great coffee shops here. If you know how to shop, you can also find bargains for stylish and trendy clothes.And ... there are lots of people here."
Nice Shopping,Different than other shopping spots in Asia - for locals but tourists are seen as well. Have a great time ion this great city
"Was ok, a bit loud, but not as good as expected","Must visit for sure, but I did not think it was great snd the shopping os only average. Lots of beauty shops which is the norm everywhere in Korea."
Fun hustling area,"It was fun to aimlessly wander in this area, with plenty of things to lay your eyes upon, to buy or to eat. It's colorful day and night, and it was an enjoyable to discover some Seoul in a short citybreak."
Shopping Mecca for Cosmetics,Cosmetics stores abound in this area where cheap but quality products are on sale.... a million won is just about 5thousand pesos so dont be discourage when buying..
Not to bad,Myeongdong is a famous shopping street.. I think it's good.. But its expensive.. Sorry but the Korean people dose not respect me and dose not respect the Korean law about smoking.. 
Street food,"We stayed at the Myeongdong area so we came everyday to enjoy the street food and shopping. Love their food specially tteokbokki, geranpang, and scallop cheese. So many things to see and to buy. And they can keep the area clean."
Bustling Street from Dawn to Dusk!,"Visiting Korea will not be complete without passing Myeongdong! Cosmetic and food lovers, young and young once, ladies and gents will find this part of Seoul quite dazzling! The fusion of Myeongdong Cathedral, hotels, shops, theater, foods makes this place a must stop in visiting Korea. The lady attendants are speaking good english already so foreigners can easily communicate. Enjoy your shopping!!"
Good shopping. ,Good shopping. Thank goodness I was here with my teenage daughter and not my husband! Loads of different types of shops. Store staff friendly and not pushy. Felt very safe working around. Loads of coffee shops that you can hop into when your arms get too tired!
Great food,"This has absolutely everything you could imagine for shopping, and incredible food stalls all along the way. Why had I never had a cheese scallop before?Incredible. "
Beauty overloan,"Great place to find all the Korean beauty products, shop! Don't miss Lotte department store food court and market. Just the best. "
Myeongdong street food,"When speaks about Myeongdong most people think about shopping for clothes, accessories, cosmetics, etc. But for me Myeongdong is a good place to eat, especially on the street. There are lots of delicious street foods you can choose and enjoy."
Shopping for cosmetics,"Basically camped out at Missha, Laneige and Innisfree. The place is full, literally full, of shops selling cosmetics. Every street has the same few names repeated. Also lots of shops selling trendy clothes. Then walked under ground to Lotte mart and got Lotte biscuits. And there is live abalone 6 for 30000 won. "
Street food at night ,"No trip to Seoul would be complete without trying the delicious street food. We saw vendors along the streets of Myeong-dong selling a variety of foods, ranging from pineapple and melon to corns, fried squid to Nutella crepes. The prices are good (around 2000-5000 won). I enjoyed the fried cheese, the hotdogs, the bun with an egg..."
Makeup Haven,Korean makeup stores everywhere I truly enjoyed shopping for my favorite makeup brands especially its much cheaper than in my home country. What makes it even more enjoyable I got to take a lot of freebies thou sometimes you have to ask from the sales lady. Some are not friendly and not accomodating not all can speak in English. There are Taiwanese and Chinese sales lady who can speak in Mandarin. Night market and street food vendors starts at 4pm onwards which I truly indulge in them. ALWAYS BRING YOUR PASSPORT if you spent Krw30000 to get tax refund and ask the store first if they would refund it outright otherwise you will need to get the tax refund at the airport
The heart of Seoul,We stayed for 5 nights in the heart of Myeongdong. It was a great choice. We are not really shoppers but there are shops everywhere including some very large department stores. Prices are comparable to those in Australia if not higher however I am sure the dedicated shopper would find better prices in some of the smaller outletsThe great attraction of this place is the market food stalls which set up everywhere after around 2pm offering all kinds of Korean delicacies freshly prepared in front of you and costing very littleThere are some good restaurants in the area as well which we managed to visit however we couldn't resist the food stalls each day even for just a quick snackGlad we stayed here and would do so again next time we visit Seoul
Myeong-dong shopping,"Myeong-dong shopping area is very conveninance near subway line 2 and line 4. Each shopping ticket amounted over 30,000 won can get tax free directly or tax refund at designated counters or kiosks at Myeong-dong Shopping Area. Get the tickets and ask the shop staff you can have clear and comprehensive information. Enjoy 10% tax refund."
Myeongdong!,Must visit when in Korea. So many stores and restaurants in the vicinity. If you have lots of budget i would suggest to stay in hotels in this area.
Paradise of cosmetics lover,"My wife spent one whole day to purchase cosmetics, and many store clerks are very generous to offer u a lot lot of samples!"
Busy and good prices!,"A huge number of shops and modern styles. You can find all you are looking for, even on the side streets."
Shopping Shopping Shopping,Bustling shopping neighborhood. Dozens of cosmetics shops - you can walk 5 minutes and find 4 different Nature Republic shops. At night they have food carts with lots of delectable eats. Great for daytime or evening exploring!
Nice neighbourhood ,"The area around the cathedral is very trendy but still very Asian. The market has this particular ambiance with all kind of local street food and tourist stuff. Lots of stores in the area too including a huge Lotte. It's central area for a stay in Seoul. Close to the metro station, the city hall, and touristic attractions."
Meant for the ladies,"Myeongdong street is huge and mainly dominated by cosmetics shops so if you have that shopping list from friends & family to fill, this would be the perfect place.You will find cosmetics shops every step of the way and the face masks are at ridiculously cheap prices in packs. You can find Zara, Adidas, Nike and a few other famous shops too. There's also street stalls selling Supreme goods (fufu or fake, obviously) and food which can be quite expensive, in my opinion. If you are looking for endless options of clothes, head over to Dongdaemun instead."
Too crazy but good experiences ,A great place to get your cosmetic but the street were too hectic and confusing. Most of the sale speaks Chinese so it was ok if you try to specific product. Most Korean can speak English and understandable but not great.
Nice to get the filling of local life,The street is very busy with many shops and restaurants. It is full most of the day and offers a nice insight into the local city life.
Night time wander ,"It's a lovely place to wander around at night, hustle and bustle of the locals and tourists makes it a lively place - full of local eats, street food and deserts!Not really a place to go and drink - but there are one or two bars in the area (unless I just completely missed them!) "
Great for skincare shopping,Loads of Koreans brands of skincare and make up in these few streets. Also lots of restaurants from bbq to noodles to street food snacks.Plenty of souvenirs and clothes to shop so there is something for everyone!
Loved shopping here,"Mostly malls close around 8pm in Seoul which is early for me as In singapore they close around 9:30pm - 10pm. This market was only place which be busting with people after 8pm also. So many shoe shops and lot of korean cosmetic shops, you could buy everything from there. great street food."
"Busy, busy","It is very busy I thing 24 hours, if you like shopping and eating you are in the right place, try street food!"
"Cosmetics, shoes, clothes, food, sneaky cat cafe","It is everything you read, it's probably more than that. For westerners that come for makeup, I'm not sure you'll like it. It's brands you don't really get (at least in Australia) on top of the possible language barrier in either shop assistant or product text. It starts waking up around 10am, it's a big area, but some brands have 2-3 shops of varying sizes in the area. At night there are night food stalls which are delicious. Or many a Korean bbq meals. "
Main shopping area in Seoul,"If you like shopping or have time to kill, this is the place for you. Hundreds of shops and restaurants are within this shopping area. If you prefer street food, you would not be disappointed to try the taste of local street food. As it is located in the city centre, it is easy to go there by taking metro; do not drive there as you would have difficulty to park your car."
"It's cool but crowded as heck, so come with a purpose if you can!","I came here just because I know this area is famous, but really and truly you should only come here if you need makeup, skin care products, or the like. There are SO many stores selling all kinds of products for skin; I think I saw over 200 different brands of face masks that day. It was also hot and very crowded, so prepare for that as I'm under the impression that it's generally like that. There were people on the streets giving out samples too in an attempt to get you to come into their stores. They'll particularly target you if you're a foreigner, so be prepared to say ""no thank you"" in Korean if you want to politely and not ""noobishly"" turn them down. Overall, it's a cool place. If you're in Seoul I definitely recommend going just to check it out, especially if you want to buy makeup or face masks or something like that. There are some restaurants there too, as well as coffee shops so you can also stop for food or a snack if you need to. Not to mention, Myeongdong is pretty central to the city - my friend and I walked to Namdaemun market from there, as well as Namsan tower in the evening, and it was a really nice walking day (so wear close toed shoes). The subway is also close, and the area where you get off the subway right next to the big Myeongdong market area is also nice and has a Lotte Mart, a Daiso, and a bunch of other stores there too. It's a very nice place to visit :)"
Beauty Product Heaven,"Went on a Sunday afternoon and the streets were packed. Just about every beauty product you can think of is available. Reasonable prices. Sunday also features a great assortment of street food including lots of fish and lobster. Price per serving is around 5,000 to 10,000 KRW. Definitely worth a visit for the experience. "
Go on a Sunday for street food and good shopping! ,"Sundays after 1:00 P.M. are a great time to come here to shop and try famous Korean street food. From lobster tail to chicken skewers to waffles, everyone is sure to find something to satisfy. Also, the shops range from H&M to Zara to Nike you will find something that you are looking for. Also find, a large Methodist and Catholic Church. Plan to spend a few hours there. "
Great Place To Hang Around For Many Days - 可以膩在這裡很多天的好地方,"We are here for three days already. We hang around the area & kind of too spoiled by this area because it is full of varieties - street vendors and all kinds of shops, famous popular shops and too many little shops await you to find out, & restaurants that you should try one by one. We buy too many things and can not stop buying. You will know the place only when you are here.我們待在這裡已經三天了，一直待在這個讓我們寵壞的區域因為這裡什麼都有～太多路邊攤和各式各樣的店、網路名店和自己找出來的一大堆個性店、還有應該一間一間吃的各種餐廳，我們買了好多東西，很可怕的是停不下來。。。請來親自體驗！"
Amazing shopping hub,Reasonable price and fair quality. Food also nice and cheap. Can have half day exploring and enjoying here.10k won for each nice hat! Good deal I think!
A place cannot be missed,"A famous shopping paradise in Seoul, you cannot miss it, otherwise you may regret. Apart from shopping, there were many street snacks like traditional Korean snacks, grilled abalone, cut fresh fruit and many more... You can't stop eating during the street exploring."
Myeong song Shopping Street,"My son and I loved strolling through the streets of the marketplace. There is lot of foot traffic and some motorcyclist, so be very keen of your surroundings."
must visit when you are in seoul!,"exit via Myeong-dong Subway Station, it is really aceessible. street local delicacies. so many starbucks around. heaven for the ladies! must visit when you are in seoul!"
For shopping ,"People go there for shopping but I prefer a big mall. This street is too busy all the time. Full of tourists. If you are curious, visit just once."
Great shopping and tasty street food!!!,"I absolutely loved Myeongdong! It offers my two favorite things: cheap eats and shopping. There is no shortage of places to purchase clothing or beauty products! All of the beauty supply stores offer amazing discounts and BOGO deals on sheet masks and other beauty products. In between shops we tried all types of delicious street food. Definitely try the fried spiral potatoes, the spicy rice cakes and the lobster tails with mozzarella."
Halal food avail,"There is halal snacks available, one near the zara and forever21. And another along the street. We prayed at the cultural centre which is located at the upper floor,.it's either 3rd or 5th floor at the entrance between Zara.And.forevrr21. Halal food at busanjip which is at one of the alleys. Ask the people in red and a red hat, information people for directions.Myeongdong street is facial products heaven. Not for clothes, clothes at dongdaemum or ehwa uni. Please compare the price against the shops down the road, there are always discounts and offers available.You should watch Nanta if you're there. Funniest live show ever. Really made me LOL"
ready for the promo's of thier beauty products!!!!,"it slocated where you can buy thier beauty products a lots a place to chooice with,the street is amazing food try to go with empty stomach so can try all the food on the street."
Busy shopping place,"If you love to shop and do not mind of the crowd then this is a place to visit. A heavy crowded and busy place. Most of the streets are narrow and watch out for the cars passing by. A lot of beauty products, retail stores, street food carts and restaurants. Foods are expensive though in this area."
Kind of a classic busy Asian shopping area,"I prefer going to Gangnam for shopping, but if you're looking for that good ol shoulder to shoulder experience, check this place out. Might be a little crazy but it's still fun! "
Great shopping and food,"Great place to go shopping for cosmetics, clothes, trinkets, food. Easy to get to by subway. Stores don't open til 10am and there is street food at night."
Very Hap place and a shopper's paradise,"Its the main down town market of Seoul and you get everything you want under the sun on the street. From food, to caps, to clothers, etc.etc.The ""Dollar Store"" across the street is located in a 7 storeyed building and is a just right store for all tourists. Keep 2 hours minimum in hand to look and buy all things."
The busiest street in South Korea,"Just be aware that there are a lot of people always on this street. The number of good restaurants is around. Samgyetang, Gomtang and Jeonju bibimbap etc... It could be a bit annoying to see people calling you for massages and some other stuff. Also have a lot of shops for cosmetics... It is really shopping heaven. "
nice,"you can never get sick shopping here, especially knowing that your own country charges you double or more for the same products "
Busy and expensive ,"The shopping area is full of shops selling face cream and masks, clothes shops and small restaurants. It is busy and expensive. You get better food and cheaper goods outside this area."
Overcrowded shopping street,"This street is always overcrowded, but particularly at night, when the street food stalls appear. It is quite atmospheric, but it gets annoying if you don't like crowded places.There's a huge Uniqlo store if you need to do some clothes shopping. If you're looking for cosmetics, there are soooo many shops you can choose from."
Shopping area with everything,"You can do all your shopping in one places. In this area, it's the super big hub for Korean drug store cosmetic brands. Many shops selling same or similar things. There are 2 big anchor department store here that you can find more upscale and quality products. "
A must ,"We went twice there, A lot of shopping in this place, there is Daiso there, we didn't see it at first ;so cheap with great stuff don't miss it"
Super busy but fun,Its mental here. So many people and so much to see. Great shopping for girls especially for skin care products but I just liked the food great street food and plenty of options. If you are in the area or headed to the seoul tower its worth checking out even if just for a feed
A place to see,"Myeongdong is more than a street is a place where you can see how Seoulians are living, shopping and entertaining. You can taste some street food, enjoy restaurants offering different cuisines, make some shopping. But at the end, you will definitely feel happy. Don't miss visiting this shopping area."
Kpop lovers,I love the beauty products and kpop stuff. You can also enjoy yummy food here. Enjoy nanta show if you have time.
Some interesting shopping,"Just off the street there are a few nice outdoor mall areas that boast an array of souvenir shops, chemists and restaurants. We could only find one bar and it was not open until late. "
Overwhelming and awesomely good,"Street food, restaurants, skincare shops, clothing shops are abundance. You can literally everything and anything (stuffs that you need and even stuffs that you didn't know you need). It can get really crowded especially on the main alley that some people might find it overwhelming. Use the smaller alleys to avoid the crowding.Make sure to visit on an empty stomach. Bear in mind, depending on the number of food items you bought from the street food (not cheap), altogether the cost would probably be enough for you to get a meal for 2 at a sitting down restaurant. Example:Meal for 2 at a jjimdak restaurant 29,000won (with refillable side dishes and you get cold water)Street Food (below are just some of the street foods but there are a ton more varieties)fresh fruit drink 5,000wonchicken skewer 3,000wonfish cake skewer 2,000wongrilled small-med lobster tail 7,000wongrilled pen shell 7,000won"
Overwhelming but if you want a bargain this is the place.,I only breezed through here but it was super overwhelming. Definitely a bargain shoppers paradise. Lots of variety. 
Skin care overload,"Everyone comes for the skincare deals and street food stalls - and there's an abundance of it.All the big korean brands have several branches every few blocks, so if one particular shop is full of people, you can walk several meters to the next corner and you'll probably see another store of the same brand. There are also loads of deals at each store. Special freebie packs that change monthly, free face masks upon entry, tons of samples at the counter, and more.For food, you'll never go hungry. For 1000-6000 won per stall, you can try everything from grilled meats to seafood to footlong ice cream to freshly squeezed juices. There are also plenty of sit down restaurants around.It's a busy area that never seems to run out of tourists and locals."
Shopping and Food Heaven,"There's not much to say about this place because it is already famous and well-documented as one of the must-visit place in South Korea. There's a lot of thing to buy here especially cosmetics and beauty products. There also a lot of fashion store, electronics, restaurants and local food stall which is very intriguing to try. Overall, it is very enjoyable place to visit."
Street Food Heaven!,"I loved that our hotel was right next to Myeongdong! It is a busy, exciting shopping/eating/entertainment area. I was surprised that almost every other store was for cosmetics and skin care items. I guess that's really big in Korea. What tickled us was the delicious street food from the vendors with their carts who came out just about when the sun went down. Fresh fruit, juices, smoothies, grilled butter lobster, octopus, conch shells, chicken, barbecue meats, egg puff pastries, 15 inch ice cream cone swirls, roasted chestnuts and sweet potatoes,and even spiral cut potatoes (and hot dogs in a spiral potato!)...We tried everything and they were all delicious and fresh. The whole area is festive and all lit up. This is a must-do while in Seoul!"
Lots of food and fun,"This is a great place during the day, but really picks up after dark. The streets are lined with shops and street food vendors. We enjoyed all the cosmetics shops and dessert options."
"Looking for makeup, this is the place.","Visited this area, much more than one street, several city blocks with many streets and side streets. The area contains make up, clothes, food, drink. At night there are food vendors and night market type vendors. This is a very busy area at night. Good place to catch dinner and pick up some items you might need ."
Great for small gifts,The area is great if your looking for small gifts. Most of the shops sell the same thing but you can find a few small odd and end things. Nice to stroll in the evening. 
Shopping and Food Paradise,"Myeongdong Shopping Street is a place you MUST go to when visiting Seoul. First of all, there is an extensive range of shopping there, both cheap and high end. There are so many different stores in Myeongdong that there will definitely be a place for everyone. Shops are open until late at night, and you can shop til you drop! Literally! As a foreigner, I was worried as I have very limited korean language skills, however all shop assistance and street stall owners were very kind and helped me in finding directions. The food there is amazing, and the food stalls sell korean snacks and foods that are absolutely delicious and you must try it. There are also many restaurants there to choose from, mainly serving Korean food, and at a reasonable price. Since I lived in a hotel in the shopping street, everything was very convenient. The hotels in the area are not very expensive and I would recommend staying near or in the shopping street as it is very convenient and there is also a subway station very near, and there are many taxis too. In regards to shopping, there are Korean boutiques selling cheap but good quality and stylish clothing, as well as bigger brands. There are also many Korean cosmetic stores and MANY FREE SAMPLES ARE GIVEN. There are also more high end brands located there. Basically, everything you could possibly want is in Myeondong! It is a food and shopping paradise and not very expensive at all. It is a MUST visit destination for tourists!"
AMAZING MUST GO!,"Since I lived in a hotel in the heart of Myeongdong, I was exposed to the shopping street day and night which was fantastic, it was both busy in the morning and at night and gave off a pleasant atmosphere. Here, there were a wide variety of stores and it really is quite exciting. Here, there are mainly cosmetic stores, clothing stores and such which is perfect for the shoppers: I bought so much there. Not to mention, at 5pm the street food stalls open and let me tell you they are delicious. Normally, when I travel i feel foreign or not so welcomed but when I went here it was so warm (even though it was winter and I WAS FREEZING) and welcoming. I can't emphasise enough but this is a must go destination for those wanting good shopping and excitement. Coming at day gives one feeling but coming at night provides you with the food stalls and exciting lights and such so choose wisely! It is definitely worth it!"
Shopaholic haven ,"If you're really into Korean skincare, cute accessories or trendy clothes this is definitely a place for you to visit! The only thing is it can get quite crowded here especially towards the evening, but visiting a bit earlier before sunset around 6pm ish is still ok. There are also loads of street foods to try out and restaurants ticked away to help re-energise you for more shopping! The sales assistants are all lovely and helpful and not too pushy."
Place for Korean cosmetics and others,"Always very crowded but you can find loads of Korean cosmetics shops around. Off course there are also clothes,shoes shops and restaurants.There is also a Nanta theater. The money exchange places are open daily and the rates in my case were quite good."
shopping in bulk,"If you are in the mood for voyeurism and shopping, than this is the place to be. Masses of people from all over, navigating the beauty/fashion world in a pleasant environment. You can find everything from fresh seafood meals to kpop to bubblebath....."
A shopping meca in Seoul,"Nice place for wandering around. Plenty of shops, restaurants and cafes. A lot of vendors. A lot of opportunities for shopping around and having a delicious food. Do not miss the flowering ice-creams."
Good place for cheap shopping.,Nice place to grab some bargains. Lots of choice for souvenirs and food options good. Surrounded by larger mall type shops
Street food starts only 5PM!,"Don't do like I did and go there before 5PM. Although all shops will be open, you won't find the most important: the food stalls, which arrive at 5PM. Most of the stores are for women. A lot of cosmetics, accessories and clothing. It's a nice place to go at night."
"Shop till you drop: Beauty stores, Night food market and underground clothing stores.","A great place to shop for: -Beauty products (skincare and makeup) -Has many chain brands: Apieu, Aritaum, The Face Shop, Skinfood etc. - Behind all the beauty brands, there are great places to eat! - Beware of sales people outside of the shops, they will approach you. -Free samples upon entering all beauty shops. -Many cheap clothing stores (8000 won and up). -Stationary stores. Stroll along the various streets at night if you want to see the food stalls selling street food! They start selling at around 6pm."
Awesome ,Great place to do shopping be careful like everything is so cute and you can find all kind of stuffs so it's better to leave this place for the last day in Seoul so you will not worry about your budget and buy whatever you want. 
Nice to stroll for food or anything else!,"We walked about and forgot the time because we tried streetfood and browsed the uncountable stores around this area.Is it a combination of bars, streetfood and Korean restaurants but for streets!!! It is hatd to make a choice so we always came back for lunch and/or dinner...Some places are open all night long.You also find few places serving western food."
"Very busy, very fun!!",Great place to get street food and cheap souvenirs. People watching was also enjoyable. Very crowded area with lots to see.
Great place to get everything,"This is a great street to get anything Korean and shop till you drop. You can bargain if you want, but they will mainly give you a discount only if you buy a bit more than one or two items. Lots of nice street food available, so basically you can shop and eat your way the whole day here."
Shopping Paradise,"Always like to buy things here. With all the cosmetics brands here. You sure can find what you need and want. If you come at night, along the street there is different stalls selling food and drinks. "
Shopholic Confession,I love shopping here but (bit expensive) whenever we in Seoul and our daughter love the cat mascot too. There also halal restaurants to choose but we love trying Korean food (seafood) 
Shopping and Eating,"Myengdong Shopping is a vibrant shopping and eating extravaganza. The place to go for cosmetics, lots of cosmetics. Crowd watching is also fun. Street food vendors offer an array of local food selection but in my opinion, they are overpriced."
"Shopping, food and sights!","Great for shopping, especially cosmetics! If you are not satisfied with the discounts from a particular shop, just walk on and you will find another similar store with even better discounts.Street food carts set up around 3 plus in the afternoon and the view of the carts coming down the streets is a sight to behold. Delicious street food like baked squid and strawberry mochi are must-trys!Best place to rest your feet after shopping is at Sulbing:) Their bingsus are amazing and worth every penny! Daebak! Tried the green tea, cheesecake and summer melon special. Green tea is the best! They also have free flow buckwheat tea to quench your thirst.You'll never get tired of Myeongdong!"
Very Active Street,"A lot of Malls, Shops and Street Food in this street. I don't mind spending hours in this street because you can find in it all what you need in shopping."
Better For Women Than Men - Unless You're Looking For Food,"Great area to explore and do some shopping and food sampling. Lots of cosmetics if you're into that. Slightly better at night as more food vendors are open for business. Great variety and inexpensive way to try authentic Korean street food. Not a lot of friendly faces, but easy to point at what you want to purchase. Recommended as 'one of the top 10 things to do in Seoul'."
"Shopping, shopping, shopping!","Very touristy area with lots of shopping, street food, and of course tourists! You can find all the cosmetic stores here, athough the prices are a lot cheaper at the duty free stores inside Incheon airport. The street food are all delicious and cheap. There are some good buys from the carts selling stuff in the middle of the street (like women's clothes and sunglasses), but I would stay away from the actual stores unless they have really good deals because they're just more expensive. The place is very crowded, but it's a good place to visit in Seoul!"
You can find all brand korean cosmetics here,Its really easy to find all korean cosmetics here. If you are line lovers there also a line store. If you want to buy korean ginseng I suggest you buy in the farmacy. 
Cool night,"Anything except Myeongdong smell of Korean life!I mean, if you live out the high skyscraper and the business company, here you can find the real life of Koran.Cool also for going out for dinner with friends"
Nice shopping street,"First time visit the shopping street, a lot of things to buy, eat and drink. There are many shops selling various kinds of skin products, cosmetics. Facial masks selling at cheap prices. It's pretty crowded when we were there but we still spend a few hours shopping there. Really a shopping haven."
Street food galore,"We visited Myeongdong Street early afternoon and walked around and looked at the many shops. About 4.30 in the afternoon, all the street vendors started appearing and the smell and sights were just amazing! Lots of different foods were sampled ranging from baked potatoes to luscious seafoods curries stirfries fruit and deep fried ice cream! Many people to see as well! Highly recommend a visit and go hungry as there's lots to choose from!"
People watching ,"Myeongdong streets are perfect for shopping and watching people. We spend five days in the city and found several streets closed for traffic but open for Vendors for their merchandise. Activity starts at mid-afternoon/early evening until past midnight. Korean made products are in abundance, especially beauty and other related items. Of course Food and more food are available, very entertaining just to walk around and see the variety of food and merchandise available."
Love the shopping streets ,We visited Myeongdong shopping streets few times. So many shops and restaurants. Thoroughly Enjoyed shopping these streets. There are also many street stalls. Very vibrant and busy.
Nothing much,Less than expected! I'm that type of people who cannot survive with the smell of fried food!The stuff there are mostly can be found anywhere and the prices are quite high 
Lots of things to buy and great good place,It's full of things to buy and eat! Especially during the night time! I bought some cosmetics as it were very cheap. 
Premier Shopping Destination ,"Myeongdong is one of the busiest places in Seoul and it is considered Korea's premier shopping destination. It is a stunning shopping district with countless shops and restaurants. With Lotte and Shinsegae anchoring the area and a number of large shopping malls lie along the streets. Clothing shops or cosmetics can be seen at a very corners and streets stall for the spaces in between offering tasty street food snacks and inexpensive clothes and accessories. Can be easily reach by taking the Subway: Subway Line 2 Euljiro 1-ga Station Exit 6 and Subway Line 2 Myeongdong Station Exit 6. Myeong-dong combination of historical significance, nearby tourist attractions, and prime shopping has established it as the ultimate tourist destination in Seoul."
interesting but mostly beauty and skin care,"My teenage kids loved the excitement and vibe of the area. Alot of neat little places to eat and when the street food comes out it gets interesting. As far as shopping, it's mostly beauty and skin care. A lot of western clothing stores but we really enjoyed the excitement and vibe of the area. "
Great food and shopping for teens and young adults,"Absolutely loved the food here at 4 places here:1. Andong Jimdak (braised chicken)2. Myeongdong Dumplings3. O Sulloc cafe4. Gogung restaurantThe shopping here is catered mainly for skin care , Line teddy bear and young adult/ teen fashion."
Skin care heaven,80% Of the shops are for skincare and cosmetic product. And loads of restaurants. Best part is the street foods.
Absolutely loved it,"Ladies, this place is heaven Seven shops out of ten is a cosmetic or skin care shop. The choice is enormous. There are lots of places to eat around, some stalls with street food and just fun place to be"
You find everything ,"Good for an afternoon time. All shops are there, sellers are quite familiar with English and the range of products covers any need.Plenty of choices to eat or have a coffee break.Prepare your credit card and go! Enjoy"
Packed,"Its no doubt that this is a good place for shopping. I don't really enjoy shopping, so i don't find this place suits me. There's delicious food stall around, I enjoyed the food. However not very friendly staff, I don't feel welcomed."
interesting...busy and fun,"this is a busy shopping area heaps of diversity throngs of people,definetly not boring,especially later in the day"
Lousy and expensive street,"when I was a child, Myong Dong Street was for every body. but recently, the shop focused on Only Chinese visitor. some snack and street food are too expensive to eat. Pls Don't eat Street food and Don't buy anying in MyongDong. just eye shopping only. you had better shopping local shop in another area."
Great Shopping,"While I was living 2 hours south of Seoul in the middle of nowhere, this became my go to shopping district. It has every store imaginable. Great street food while also a great variety of restaurants. We were also able to find decent accommodation in the area."
Great Location,Busses drop PJ hotels gestures you never get bored From Myeondong Market Korean peoples too kind and Helpful
Shopping Experience ,"Very busy neighborhood, but great for shopping. Cosmetic stores are all over the place, you can shop and then relax with a great Korean massage!"
Nice place for shopping and street food~,Very crowded but so worth to visit for cosmetic shopping as the shops in Myeongdong provides the most sample products and gift! Street food also very tasty!
Nice walk,Nothing very exciting but it s convenient place for shopping. On evening there is lot of small shops to eat on the street and there is lot of souvenirs shops.This place is great to find restaurant on evening or to change money.
Full of people and shops,"Great place to do some shopping in Seoul. Tons of cosmetic shops, clothing stores, department stores, street vendors, you name it. Almost forgot, this place is packed with hotels and restaurants. Got take a look."
Crowded and hot in the summer! ,"Good shopping and yummy food, bring cash and an empty stomach! The cheesy lobster is very good and the fresh fruit juices are a treat!"
Plenty of shops and restaurants,"You can get to Myeongdong shopping street taking the subway and alighting at Myeongdong station at the south or Euljiro 1-ga up north of the area.It is almost like a huge square and you walk from north to south and then east to west. There are many exits but EXITS 1,2,3 & 4 would lead to the opposite side of the street. So better to exit at EXITS 5,6,7,8 or 9. There's also a underground shopping mall at exit 7 and 8. Exit 8 would lead you to the iconic green leaf building of Nature Republic.It's better to come in the evening till late if you want to sample their street food. There's also NANTA theatre, (not to be confused wth Myeongdong Theatre). Of course you can find shops and shops of cosmetic and skin care products, restaurants, cafes, massage parlor, fashion outlets and hair salons. Look out for their CAT cafe and DOG cafes if you are a animal lover.There are guides in distinctive uniform walking around offering help to tourist. Most shop attendance and restaurant staff speak Mandarin, so language is not really a problem. It's a must visit if you are in Seoul. "
Tourist shopping spot,Skin care and all korean local brand are all here for you in one street. Late evening also have the street local food for you to enjoy!
The street is not as busy as 2 years ago - good for shoppers!,"2 years ago there were lots of Mainland Chinese tourist, too crowded and you can't really enjoy shopping! Also the staff are more cater for Chinese tourist - they can only speak Korean and Mandarin but not English! Still lots of cosmetic shops along the street but at least this time the staff are not that pushy, and more friendly!"
Must visit place in Seoul,"Not as inexpensive as in Goto Mall, more classy stores are found here. Mnay local Korean brands (clothes and cosmetics) here, and the food stalls are very attractive too! Energetic place, love it!"
Must try street food,A lot of street food that you should try and some of them should put up a 'halal' sign if it's halal so that we don't have to always ask the same questions.The socks sold there are must buy too as I tried to buy bulk in dondaemun but don't find that kind of design.Souvenir t shirt can buy at Namdaemun for lower price.
Shop. Eat. Repeat.,"We were here on a Monday night and the main pedestrian streets were really busy. I'm glad we didn't come on a weekend! Great place to shop, people watch and eat. Plenty of street food available."
Crowded shopping street,"Staying 3 nights in this area gave me a lot of time to explore this street. A lot of Korean brand cosmetic store offer a lot of promotions, and they are giving some sample for the visitors. I also recommend to try their restaurants, spread all over the place."
Be prepared to get hustled,"Myeongdong is famous for cosmetics and skin care shopping. It certainly spans across a large area, although I did find that most stores were repetitive and so, competition among business units can be quite strong. This area sure is a visual treat at night when street food vendors and store promoters are up and about their business. You will get lost at some point. I would be careful of the promoters who can get quite aggressive when distributing their free samples (I got hustled by one and was absolutely shaken by the experience)."
Street Eats Galore while you shop,Had a great time just window shopping at the retail stores and gazing at all the street food options along this famous shopping street. Something for everyone
"If You Like To Shop, You Should Go!","I've started taking an interest in Korean skincare and makeup in the last couple of years, and Myeongdong always came up as a ""must visit"" area for that kind of thing. I didn't have as much time for shopping here as I would have liked (just one evening, that was not enough for me), but it's worth it. Every Korean cosmetic brand (and lots of Western, I think some other Asian brands too) has a shop (or five) here. Be sure to shop around and track what you're doing, as one shop to the next might have totally different promos (in the same brand - ex: one Etude House might have a huge promo on masks, but you walk down the street and a different Etude House won't have the mask promo but a promo on foundation or something). I actually liked shopping in the Ewha district a little more, because it wasn't as hectic and there were still lots of options for cosmetics and fashion (I think the prices were better too). There's tons of fashion stores too, including a nice Uniqlo. A lot of brands have flagship shops here, you can browse for hours. There was even a Samsung Fashion store. Since we were only here for one evening, I'm not sure about restaurants in the area, but there is plenty of street food to be had, and that's what we snacked on while we shopped. I definitely recommend coming here if you want to shop for branded fashion or cosmetics, but if you want more of an ""indie"" feel (and you are looking for women's fashion) I would recommend Ewha. Meyongdong is also not a good place if you can't handle large crowds."
Fantastic place for shopoholics,"This place has got everything you can ever imagine! starting from regular trade marks and luxurious brands shops to street market with fake bags and accessories to any taste. There is also sort of local pottery and souvenirs market where you can find amazing cutleries and porcelain plates, magnets, souvenirs and even fures. You should visit!"
Lots of stores,Lots of shopping if you're interested in it. However I wouldn't say this is the most impressive shopping area that I've been to.
Fashion in the Day. Fun street Food at Night.,"Excellent place. During the day you can shop in higher end boutique fashion shops. But it is best to come in the evening and eat all sorts of cheap food form the street stalls. From skewered meats, seafood on sticks, savoury rolls, to sweets cakes, fresh juice, etc. ... Wonderful variety. Fun busy atmosphere."
Just wow !,"A shopping heaven! Especially for face masks and make up and a bit of everything! It's quite easy to get lost as there are shops of the same name everywhere, it's like if u miss a shop, you will find it in the next corner! But be careful of the saleswomen, they are like bees and we are like flowers, scary sometimes! Of course one thing to be sure is that you need to find the will to resist your temptation! ( from buying goods, face masks etc) there are some snacks/ street food too in the evening.... smell wonderful! It's like causeway bay in hk, princess street in Edinburgh but crazier! There are some nice cafes too. "
Crowded but not cheap.,This area is worth visiting fur the fun of it and to taste different food But not for the prices or shopping. 
The word says it all; HYPER SHOPPING!,"One of the busiest areas in Seoul and sometimes not the most pleasant one. Thank god we had a wonderful and tranquil hotel to ease our minds and regain our sanity, because this place will make you crazy. Loud music, the same shops over and over again, everything revolves around beauty and cosmetics...it is all a bit tiresome."
Shopping heaven,"Honestly i went there just to try the street food. So many cosmetics shop. I love their LUSH store as the promoter are really nice, helpful & generous comparing to other LUSH store in Seoul. Come early as everything close down by 10pm :("
Korean cosmetic hunter,"If you are fans of korean cosmetic this is really the place..Not only that, you also can taste korean street food here in very affordable priceShoes, bags, and all fashion stuff are available here in very affordable price (in my opinion). I really can go 'crazy' to visit each store..But a bit hard to find public toilet so my tour guide ask me to use the toilet at Ibis Hotel near myeongdong street before strolling around..Can't wait to be back there!!!"
Shop 'til you drop!,"Myeongdong is known as the shopping mecca of Seoul, where you can find cosmetics, fashionable clothes, bags and shoes. There are also several authentic korean restaurants and delicious street foods in Myeongdong. A must visit for tourist visitng Seoul! I Love Myeongdong!"
Can't save monry,"Too many to shop,all the Korea famous makeup shop located in,and so many good restaurants,after 5:00 pm you could find a lot of local street foods on the road ,don't forget try the traditional eggs cakes it s so Yummy.Enjoy;)"
Cosmetics stores everywhere ,"We went to Myeongdong to buy some cosmetics. We didn't have to search for the cosmetic stores, they where everywhere. Apart from that, they have alot of different food and snack stalls.Most of the stores closes at 23:00 "
A must visit,Make a note to visit this place when you are in Seoul. It's a great market with excellent vibe. We went on a Saturday and it was buzzing with a lot of people. The choice of shops is brilliant especially for the ladies as they have hundreds of cosmetic shops.
Busy street on Saturday even in train ,"Good restaurants including dessert cafe. Lots of shopping Uniqlo, Korean cosmetics etc street food. Lots of small streets, people, tourists, tax refund shop."
A very nice place to shop,"I love Myeondong shopping street. There are plenty of shops for beauty, restaurants, food stalls and all other vendors. Just go inside the shops i.e. facehops, etude etc and you will get free facial mask... It is exit 8 of Myeondong station. I just found out that Nature's Republic Building in the corner of the street is the most expensive building in Myeondong and the best noodles in SK is found in Myeondong too."
Quite fun and busy!!,"This place is teeming with shops, mostly beauty shops that have free giveaways at the entrance. Check them out! You can also get your streetfood fix here. But if you want some peace and quiet, I recommend NOT checking in here. "
"Complete selection, but really crowded.","Went here on a Friday evening. For girls, this would be a one-day stop. So many shops, especially for cosmetics and skincare. Almost all the salespeople speak Chinese too. Not too much to see for guys, maybe some street food. But even then I think they may be overpriced. They do have more variety of street food than other shopping districts though.I personally prefer Hongdae. More selection for guys, less crowded, younger vibe, slightly less touristy."
Awesome time at the shopping Myeondong Shopping Street,"My family and I spend the late morning and early afternoon walking, shopping, eating, and simply enjoying the vibe. It's located near (walking distance - literally across the major roadway) Namdameum Market, so it's easy to do both if your up for it. "
Korean cosmetic galore,"Myeongdong has two sides. Come in the morning it may just seem like your pedestrian only shopping street (bar some motorcyclists). However come after the sun sets and the vibe completely changes. Shop vendors are out in force trying to you persuade every passerby to buy what they have to offer. But unlike other countries their attitude is respectful and not forceful. Street vendors with Korean delicacies fill the walkway and is a spectacle in itself. Do wonder through the small alleyways which deviate off the main strip as there are gems to be found. For those shopping till you drop, Myeongdong is a great base for first timers in Seoul. You will always find a nice place to eat and shop at all hours. The only downside is if a bus full of tourists come along best avoid the same store.Highly recommend the strawberry juice it was so good I had to have one everyday. "
Shopping & Street food,"There are many shops everywhere, some have really good deals, others are chain stores where the price are pretty much the same. Expect most of the food are fried but you've got to try some of them. Great fun experience as I walk through the area with my family. "
Skincare shops here sold cheaper than the duty free shops!,"I bought some branded green tea cleansing foam at a duty free shop at US$6 each, yet to my surprise the same product at the branch shop of the brand at Myeongdong was only sold at W8,000 for buy one get one, i.e. W4,000 each, which is about US$3.5 only!!So good!"
Only Cosmetics,Been to this market and all the market in the city.... Myeondong is only best for cosmetics and some street food... close to metro station.... not very big... many offers on cosmetics.... There are many market in the city... you should know what to buy and visit that market accordingly.
great shopping area for cosmetics and skincare !!!,"simply too many shops ...innisfree is my favourite !no more free mask samples. they need you to enter the shop and listen to their sales talk before they give you the free sample masks. most of the time, the sales staff speak chinese. although i can speak chinese but i am not from china. i dont really feel good. wish they can just speak korean or english. besides this, the shops are simply too many to finish shopping in just one day !...the streetfood is tasty though bit expensive..."
So vibrant and pleasant,So lively and vibrant with so many pictures and songs you can hear of Kpop and kdrama actors if you are into it. Cheap buys. the giveaways for the beauty shops are not given unless you go inside. 
one stop shop for just about anything you could need or uselessly want...,"as the description states... theres alot of junk to buy, but theres also some shops off the beaten path that provide extremely cheap custom work (as compared to american pricing); for instance i got 3 full tailored suits made in 2 days with a slew of options built in with awesome materials, shoes, custom hats to match, shirts, vests, the whole nine-for 200$USD! and there are electronics, and small batch manufacturing shops in there too!"
Something for everyone ,Lot of little shops and many different street venders. Go hungry! The food was all good and the shops are reasonably priced. We went at 9 o'clock pm and left around 11 o'clock pm. A lot of the workers speak English too!!!
"A plethora of shopping, feasting, sights and sound.","Theme: Shops, eateries, hotels/guest-houses, people. A dense shopping district with all kinds of branded and local goods. There are more shops in the Myeongdong MRT/underground/subway, too. Lookout for bargains in basement supermarkets - for souvenirs and local snacks (Lotte, etc). Street food galore - must try - the variety of popular food culture/snacks from different parts of Korea will be here.I stayed at a neighbourhood guest-house (Sunshine) - economical, friendly, cozy, clean and comfortable - conveniently located just 2 minutes walk from the hustle and bustle of the main shopping area but a stones throw from the MRT entrances and the airport bus shuttle stop.p.s. drop in to the Cathedral right behind the shopping belt to get away from the excitement and din to rest your mind and tired feet. Also visit Namsan Park, Namsan Folk Village, Millennium Capsule and make your way to N Seoul Tower (try the funicular lift and ride the cable car) to catch a more scenic side of the city and breathtaking views from high above. Cannot miss the 'love-locks' decorations everywhere which adds such vibrant tones to the natural backdrop. I went right before dusk - gorgeous sunset scene from atop the mountain."
Lively night seen after the shops close,"You must walk up and down the streets of Myeongdong as they are akin to the night street stalls of Hong Kong. Very lively, entertaining and exciting. "
Shop until you fall,"A place that you gotta visit carefully :)) Take your time, look around shops, decide what exactly you need to buy and which shop offers something that you need. Almost every shop offers tax refund when you purchase is 30.000 won or more. So to avoid unnecessary purchases take a thorough look through the offers first ;)And of course try local street food, it is absolutely safe to eat and delicious!!!"
What to expect and other tips,"The area is filled with beauty and cosmetic shops. I went in a few of them but did not buy anything. These beauty stores IMO are aimed for younger people. The prices are much cheaper in Korea if you used these brands e.g. Innisfree, Tonymoly, Etude House, Skinfood, Nature Republic, Face Shop, Banila, Missha, etc. Print coupons from the Korea Tourism website, you either get discount or bonus face masks. Bring your passport as many of these stores offer instant store discount if you spent over a certain amount. Usually as low as $50US. There aren't a lot of clothing stores but I did find myself attracted to the supermarkets and accessories stores. Art Box has a lot of different things other than stationary like the stores in California, kinda like the Watson's in Taiwan and Hong Kong but cheaper. SPAO and Giordano were much more expensive in Korea fyi. Monologue was the only clothing store I managed to buy some decent tops without a hefty price tag or cheap materials. About $15-$20 US. The Line app store has a lot of fans taking photo with the gigantic brown bear. Lots of restaurants that I recommend trying rather than relying on street foods alone. Food at the street vendors were much more expensive than any other Asian countries I have visited. e.g. a quail egg baked on a piece of bread no bigger than the size of an egg for $6US, or $5US for a cup of pomegranate juice. They were not yummy either. Too many selling the same items, and too many spicy rice cake - garaetteok. But I am still glad I got to try them. That's what vacations are for - to explore new things. :)Money exchange is the best in Myeongdong area. We have exchanged money three times at three different stores, and the rate was always the same as or better than what we looked up on xe or oanda. And no fees! Bring your passport!!Most stores are opened by 11am. Go after 6 pm for all the food vendors but not after 1030-ish. We went searching for food after arriving at our hotel at 1030pm, the vendors were sparse and we ended up grabbing some snacks from 7-11."
Nothing other than cosmetics shops,"Won't go back unless visiting some named restaurants there. Then again, can find alternatives elsewhere. Too crowded and nothing much to shop. Go if you want to buy local made cosmetic."
Loved this area,"Great shops, amazing street food and cool little cafes and bars!! Very vibrant area and open late every night!!"
Organised chaos with lots of fun!,"The place is so happening after sunset. Everybody is looking for something. The shops are looking for customers n the shoppers are looking for good bargains. Free masks if you enter their shops. The shops tend to repeat n reappear after a few steps. Don't worry if you miss one because the same one will show up again later unless it is a unique one. Bargain is the game. Once you hit rock bottom for the price, they will try to keep you happy by giving you additional free gifts. I leave when I have enough as the shopkeepers need to sustain too. Lots of drinks n food everywhere. Niche restaurants are tugged away but if you can find them, you will enjoy good old traditional Korean meals. "
Shopping Mecca of Seoul,"If you like to shop, this is where you want to be. This area has all the major shops and a lot of vendors on the street as well. You definitely will not find a shortage of face masks or Korean bbq. This area seems to be crowded no matter what time you go. A good place to go if you're looking for a shopping spree!"
Standard shopping street,This place is no different from any shopping streets in other countries. You will see a lot of clothing and food stores along the street. If you come after 5pm you will find many food stalls on the street but it is not cheap.
Amazing,"Great shopping, great food. Recommend night time as shops are still open and food stalls and street vendors are more active."
Great If You Love MakeUp and Skin Care,Every third store front sells a form of makeup and or skin care products. There is a lot of repetition in this area. There are also several tasty restaurants and food stalls that are out at night. 
Shopping heaven,Myeongdong has everything as shopping place and open till quite late compared to other place. Its good for first timer who would like to experience korea shopping alley and foods. 
Shopping heaven,"Probably my favourite place to shop after Myeongdong! Sadly most of the cosmetic shops here are repeats of one another, so there's no need to explore the entire area. But there's lots of food and shops here regardless, great to spend an afternoon here."
Shopping and street food heaven,"Typical shopping and food district in Seoul.Was there in the early evening, very crowded but with a good atmosphere- lots of locals and tourists. Shops galore - things are expensive compared to other Asian countries. Street food looks good and delicious but no where to sit and eat. Plenty of restaurants to choose from."
Sensory overload and more beauty products that you will ever need,"This is a hectic area of Seoul which is a magnet for tourists. Narrow streets, packed with shoppers lined with food stalls and shops selling beauty products, Myeongdong is an extreme shopping experience! Not for the claustrophobic... this is an terrific area to pick up the latest in Korean cosmetics and youthful fashions (don't expect to be allowed to try everything on, some shops have a no-trying policy). Wandering the narrow streets is great fun, around every corner you see something unexpected (foot high ice cream cones anyone?) English and Chinese are widely spoken. Things to buy: glasses (lenses can be fitted in an hour or so for many prescriptions), face masks and cosmetics (look out for the sales people offering free samples as you enter the shop), K-pop products (socks featuring G-Dragon anyone?!)Things to eat: sugar dipped potato chip spirals on a stick, lobster with cheese (really!), squid, ice cream sandwiches, fried chicken. anything which is calorific, delicious and of dubious nutritional value.To avoid: weekends are really, really busy!"
FUN,It's really the best area to be especially at night. There is a festive atmosphere with all the bright lights and street food vendors . The stores close late at night which is great so you can do your sightseeing during the day and shop at night.
Great Vibe at Night,"Lots of lights, shops and food stalls in the evening. Not a huge shopper, especially make up. Heaps of make up stores.Ignore that, go for vibe and food!"
Cosmetic store..lots of it,If u are beauty freak this must be paradise..lots of tenant are beauty store..some are fashion store and snack store..its quite crowded when I visited better not losing your way haha..worth to see anyway
Wonderful!,"If you are visiting Seoul, you must stay at Myeongdong - it's close to everything; shopping, eating... "
Beutifull,"A must see.All smells of Korea.Street food, and plenty of people to mingle.Just walked around. Plenty of restraints and bars. I tried traditional only, they were great"
Many Stores and Street Vendors,We were told we should go to this area to shop and eat as it was popular. Too bad we had already eaten as there were a lot of food carts with great looking food. It is really long and you could shop for a long time. This area was much better than the Namdaemun Market area which was closer to our hotel but had more lower scale food and trinket carts. It also closed up much earlier. (To Travel Is To Live)
Crowded and full of aggressive shop workers,"the Shopping street is very crowded, which is to be expected. the biggest issue is the abundance of stores selling facial products whose staff assualt you as you walk past and get annoyed if you don't buy anything. "
Shops all around!,"Love stopping by here during my trip to Korea to visit relatives! A ton of great shopping both brand and little pop up style shops. This is a good spot for both luxury and on a budget type of shoppers. There's a range of things to shop for such as clothes, shoes, accessories, knick knacks, handbags, etc. And on top of that if you get hungry while walking around there are always cafes, street food, and restaurants in between shops on pretty much every block!"
Must do while visiting Seoul!,"Such a lively shopping area that becomes even livelier at night! I walked through this area during the day and loved it. Its full of great shops and food! Even better, as the sun sets, food vendors line the streets with so many amazing choices. Visit at night if possible. The stores stay open late and its just a fun atmosphere."
Excellent shopping street,A blend of international and local brands in glitzy shops. Clean and nice to wander through. If you like shopping you will love it here.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.
Shops everywhere ,"This is a must-go-to place in Seoul if you like shopping! You take the (very easy) subway to Myeongdong station and (depending on which exit you use) head down to the right and you literally get thrown into the shopping-craze! There are small shops left and right, store attendants shouting (in a nice way) at you to walk into their store pushing free samples into your hands. In the middle of the streets there are food stalls where you buy goods like Ddeokbokki and fried shrimps to-go and then you sit down on steps to a store to eat it or if you're daring you eat it on the go. "
Lively shopping area,"Myeongdong Shopping Street is the place for cosmetic- and facial-crazy shoppers. One finds stores lined-up across and beside each other trying to entice you to enter their establishment with free give-aways- even f you don't purchase anything from them. On leaving the area, you'll probably be still loaded with facial creams and the like without actually buying anything. There are also shops with named brands such as Giordano, Uniqlo, Adidas and the sort. Interspersed among the shops are eateries, restos, cafes and of course Seoul's famous street food. Prepare to stay for 3-4 hrs (perhaps even more if you're really into make-up) . Myeongdong Station Line 4. Exit 6"
Myeongdong will make you insane,"Love this place so much, I love skin care and street food and this place offer both of it, so this is a must go place to visit. I made a vblog during my trip to seoul, come and watch my video for your references to create your very own itinerary. search title :#3 TRAVEL BLOG DAY 2 JEJU - NATURE"
Fun with Lots of Street Food,This is a lively area with plenty of stores and street food. My kids loved trying all different types of food and ice cream. Definitely worth a visit. 
Food street..,Myeong dong has various kind of food street in the evening..We can enjoy shopping and delicious food street ..
cosmetic paradise,"For all those who want to buy cosmetics and facial care products, Myeondong is hard to beat. Prices are competitive too with offers which can rival the duty free shops. There are also one for one offers which can change by the day. Hence, going to the same shop can give you a better deal on a product on a different day. Only problem is that it's all by chance as we don't quite know when an offer appears until the day itself. Maybe if you can speak korean, the staff would be able to let you know although I haven't come across anyone who has had this privilege. "
Best place to shop,"This market is one of the best and largest market in Seoul. You will find all type of shops here including cosmetics, clothing, food, etc.. "
Shopping paradise,It's truly a shopping paradise not only for ladies with so many cosmetic but also for men as well.Take the sky train Myeongdong shopping street and everything could be found from here.Noted to look for shops that have promotion / discount items
One of the best places in Seoul for shopping lovers like me (and who don't have too much money to spend),"Vibrant place with narrow streets and full of light at night. Tons of shops for cosmetics and souvenirs, lots of nice food spots, subway nearby. Also advise to visit underground shopping mall with 'Made in Korea' clothes and jewelry."
Too Busy & Crowded! ,"Went here just for the novelty... Too busy & crowded. You have to push towards the people who for some reason chose to be at the middle of the street than eat beside street food stalls. Food stalls are good but pricey, tourist price. The only good point for me are the road shops, bought my fave skincare & got generous freebies! ;-)"
I loved it!,"I visited Myeong Dong, in Seoul a few days ago. It's the best place for shopping. You can see a lot of restaurants, shopping malls, street food and any other dining options. One of the busiest areas in Seoul I believe. I love the vibes in Myeong-Dong and I'll definitely come back again when I was in Seoul."
Cosmetics and more ,"Love the vibrancy there. All the popular brands of skincare congregate there. The jostling and pushing through the crowd while touters shoving free masks into our hands and coaxing us to enter their shops. Every 50 meters you will see a repeat of the same brand side by side each other. It's good to shop for better deal as each shop has different promotion and free gifts. By 4 pm the landscape change with the food carts and others setting up business there. Lots to see , eat ,shop or just people watch. "
commercial,totally commercial place..Visit here if you want to buy things with high price (only street things. except brand store).
amazing!!!!!!!!!!,"full of shops of all sorts and stalls, the food stalls are a must try and very reasonably priced, everyone speaks english and is extremely kind and accommodating"
A little bit too crowded.,"Maybe it was original at one time, but now - not so much. I hear more Chinese or English from tourists than Korean."
All Skin care products ,There are so many skin care products that all around. Street foods are mostly deep fried. It is such a busy area that girls can easily spend a day . 
"So many shops, so many delicious things to eat!!!","If you are into cosmetics, you can find anything any everything here! Plus, if you are a night owl like me, it's pumping till midnight with food vendors and all kinds of stores! There was a money exchange place that gave better exchange than at the airport. There was also a police booth for tourists who needed information. It felt very safe and comfortable!"
"Amazing!!!! Food, Culture and Fashion!!","Here you can find anything from hair salons to clothing stores and cosmetics stores galore. The Lotte department stores offer every brand from Prada, Gucci, Louis Vuitton and the like. Street shopping is so fun and safe. "
Vibrant shopping with plentiful eateries that sell more or less Exactly the same type of food,Nice and vibrant shopping area. Night market with food stalls selling at ridiculously expensive price for poor quality stoggy street food targetting tourists starts around 6pm.
Wear comfy shoes and prepare to splurge. ,"Lots of choices, but can get a bit repetitive. Good to visit 2 or 3 times for one trip in order to get everything you want. Korean beauty products galore!"
Shopping heaven... and also great for food!,"The atmosphere is busy but relaxed. You can smell street food before you get there and hear tourists trying to bargain for a better price. No one bothers you as you walk through, they just smile and say hello. Looking at the pictures gives you a taste of what its like to shop in Myeongdong, but you really have to experience it yourself instead of relying on reviews.Grab some street food and walk around at first. If you see something you like, note where it is and how much. Then explore some more, you may find it cheaper as you go along. The food, well thats just to keep you occupied. its tastes good too!Seoul has many districts like this one but i definitely recommend visiting Myeongdong.And for the ladies... Skincare and makeup products galore! You can easily fill a bag with free samples!"
Great place for shopping,It's a heaven for people that love cosmetics. You can get a lot of cheap face mask and free sample cosmetics too. The place is also full of cafe and street food.
shopping!,"It's a great place to shop for skincare and make up. If I ever run low, I think I will make a trip to Korea to buy them. They give you one for one or free things or samples but only if you look hesitant. I was buying something for a friend and the assistant knew I was going to get it no matter what so I didn't get much. Some assistants (Chinese) are very rude and will tell you to scram if you don't buy."
Must visit for street food,The one stop location to try all Korean street food. This place comes alive only from late afternoon onwards till about 10pm. There are main shops along the streets that one can find all skincare brands you'll ever need. Start walking from Myeongdong Station Exit 6 where the Uniqlo is and go along the street stalls. 
Immerse in the atmosphere!,"I enjoyed being part of the scene which I have always read about! Can find almost every other brand of Korean skincare and cosmetic product here - most of the major brands have at least 2 outlets. It is totally a shopping heaven for me as some of the brands and products are not commonly found back home. Laneige products are definitely a great deal after tax refund and the discounts given! While most shops are not as active in giving masks or products to ""lure"" you into their shop as I had read previously, it is more about getting products I really needed and not on impulse.The street food at night is a scene to experience as well, but they are not cheap at all! The street lobster stall, I overheard, was more than 10,000 won. Quite pricey if you thinking about street food standard. But there were many other things to see and buy (socks, accessories, stationary) and many restaurants to choose from (but mostly only korean food only). There is a store selling toasted sandwich which is delicious!"
Shopping and dining,Myeongdong is crowded with tourists. Things much more expensive than other places in Seoul. A clear tourist trap. Only personal heath are products are priced fairly. Erwa woman University has better offers and prices half of that to Myeongdong.
FUN!,"We visited this area every day of our 6 day stay in Seoul… we liked it that much. It was fun to wander down the side streets also… lots of interesting places to eat. The shops all started to look the same after awhile… in fact there is a repeat of the same cosmetic shops throughout the area. The merchants that hustled us to go into their shops were sometimes persistent… and a bit annoying… but the excitement and ambiance of the entire area outweighed the pesky merchants. We especially loved all the yummy street food, and found it more exciting to walk around at night, with all the lights and action."
Tourist Spot,"Many street foods with variable prices from 3,000 won,5k won to 10k won.Because it was raining, we enter small shop local cuisine which we just found out its very expensive price.We spent 54k just for 1 portion porridge,1 portion jjangmyeon(black bean noodle) and fried chicken.Just be aware when we enter shop.Better enter the shop which have a menu with price list.but myeongdong shopping street must visit place when in Korea.So many stalls like cloth stall and socks also."
Myeongdong Street Food - Must Indulge,"Myeondong is a must-experience place when in Seoul. The best time to go there is when the street markets are already set-up (7pm - wee hours of morning). You can find established cosmetic shops all over, while in the middle of the road are street food stalls. We had street food dinner during our Day 1 in Seoul - definitely, a must-indulge experience.I also found the best US$ to KRW exchange rate in the money exchange shops in Myeongdong."
Not really special to see,All the shops are that you can see in your country easily. What you can do is just watching shops and shopping.
Many shops to buy Kieran brand makeup,"Many shops to buy Korean brand makeup, almost all the shop provide special prices for masks and tiny samples"
Worth going!,"We were there from afternoon till night. Most shops will close by 10. There is much to do if you are into shopping. Firstly the street food is interesting and well worth trying out. The number of skin care shops is amazing. Many offered discounts with freebies thrown in. The shop assistants are mostly fluent in Chinese or English, apart from Korean. This made our shopping experience a much better one.There are plenty of restaurants as well to rest and eat.We found some shops selling really value for money items. Clothes in 1 store are cheaper than Dongdaemun. Better yet they are fixed priced so no need for bargaining. Another store sold accessories at 50% off store wide. The quality of the rings and earrings is good despite the relatively low price. After all the shopping we went to do Hanbok photo taking. Also located in the area and it was really memorable.Overall it was a fun and fulfilling day."
Where you see local shopping ,"This place caters not only to tourist like me but you meet the locals. There are plenty of korean street food and lots of clothes, cosmetic , and authentic korean food. Even at night lots of people are still crossing path."
Shopper's paradise...,"Imagine a place with a labyrinth of streets lined with shops on both sides and stacked on top of each other. The outcome is an endless array of shops which an avid shopper would not be able to cover in one day. As amazing as this place is, the shops are fairly limited in its variety and mainly cater to the fashion and cosmetic shoppers. In addition, the restaurants are generally expensive, including even the street food vendors who came out in the evening."
Nice cosmetic & fashion street!,We enjoyed the time we spent in Myeongdong very much. It has a lot shops & restaurants arounded. Love it!
A must visit,"Pretty much heaven for those who like the korean skincare and makeup. Literally every single brand is here but there is also some branded clothing. If you want the cheap one, try the underground shopping. And starting 5.30 PM or so, there are lots of street foods, another must try. Recommended!"
Shop till you drop!!!,"Lots of Skin care, street vendors and apparels. From fashion to street food. Even designers like MCM! Nails, hair, aesthetic, restaurants.. etc "
Good night and day,This is a lovely market for stores and street food. Will suit any budget and has a lovely ornate theatre in the area. Walked this both day and night. Quite safe but watch out for pick pockets. Lots of health and beauty shops here.
Not a must to go,"Its a touristy place. There's good and bad about this place. Popular stores to be found ; Aland, Style nanda, The seam, Innisfree cafe, Faceshop, Gao Feng ginseng chicken restaurant etc. Push cart food not that worth to try, portion isn't big also. Thumb down for the Zha Jiang Mian store recommended by Taiwan Variety show, don't buy ; noodle not right and sauce not right too. Besides that, there's a few stores with ""Chinese speaking"" male staff who will even ""reach out"" to customer so as to persuade them to patronize their stores. ""Chinese speaking"" female staff just kept following customer, introducing one item to another. I really dislike their hard sale method."
Loads of Fun ,What are you doing in Myeondong? What else would you be doing? Shopping for fake designer underwear and socks for your friends back home! You're eating tasty Korean food at reasonable prices and buying all your girlfriends snail-extract face masks to keep their skin young! It's safe and you'll enjoy yourselves here.
Shopping area,I love myeongdong because you can buy everything here but ofcourse since its one of the tourist spot the prices here are a bit higher compared to other same stores in other areas
Myeongdong Shopping Street,"Located on exit 6,7, and 8 Myeongdong station.many shops offer you t shirt,accessories,socks,restaurants,which the prize is acceptable.you can buy T Shirt in 3000₩,food street about 1000₩-5000₩,socks 1000₩,and tey offer you cosmetics from Etude,Leinage, Natur Republic etc.Myeongdong Shopping Street open from 10am till 10pm"
Really Interesting,"It's a very interesting place. I find that it's nicer than the Gangnam shopping streets because it's more geared towards tourists than locals. Mostly Chinese and Japanese tourists, but also Indian and European and North American. Many cheap hotels and motels to be found. Lots of great street food. Lots of really cheap massage places. Lots of currency exchange places. The other great thing about visiting Myeongdong, is that it's connected to Namdaemun Market, which is a gigantic indoor/outdoor market that sells food, clothes, household items, vitamins, imported goods, you name it they have it."
Must see destination ,"The most famous shipping district in Seoul. Full of people, sights (cosmetics shop people trying to lure you into by giving our free face mask) and lots of yummy street food. For cosmetics, just stick to the larger outlets of each brand as they offer better shipping experience. Must try street food include hotteok, boneless chicken feet, grilled cheese and strawberry mochi. While multiple stores sells the same stuff, standards do differ from stall to stall."
Enjoyed it,"Meyongdong shopping street is very big and located in the almost city center place. They have many different shops especially my beloved line friends. From late afternoon, the night market begins with lots of different street food. "
Good for street foods but not for cosmetics ,Loads of street stalls for delicious snacks.. U can stroll along the area and eat til full. Many cosmetic shops but not the best deal in the city. Go to shopping mall duty free levels may have a better price for the same goods. 
Fashion and Beauty,"Lots of fashion outlets and beauty outlets.The shopping belt is divided into different corners and alleys within the same vicinity. You might be spoilt for choices. Clothes, cosmetics, face masks, shoes, bags etc.Also getting lots of attention is soft ice-cream at a height of 30cm."
One of the worst shopping street I have been,"I have been to many shopping streets such as in Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore... Not cheap, nothing good, and nothing extraordinary. Even for cosmetics, you probably could buy the same thing elsewhere with the same price."
Very good for shopping,There are many shops including brand name shops. Food were not very expensive and the taste were good.
A lot of fun!,"The food vendors are safe. Probably safer than the US. It is fun and reasonable to walk down the streets in the area eating as you go. There are lots of restaurants. Soup restaurants, Andong chicken restaurants, dessert cafes. The desserts were expensive, but one was more than enough for 2 people to share.We stayed at the Ibis Ambassador Myeongdong which was right around the corner. Great location."
Cosmetic Bargains Galore!,"After reading other reviews on shopping in this district of Seoul, I have found them to be quite accurate!I am always searching for unique and cost effective items wherever in the world I travel. I make an effort to avoid tourist trap shops so, I dove into Myeondong in the evening picking up last minute buys before I headed back to the States. I was struck by the many street food vendors, which I could not resist. After fishcake snacks on a stick, vendors were literally tossing facial masks at you to entice you into their shops. The shops duplicate themselves, at least 3-4 of the same shop can exist on one block alone. Once you accept a facial mask, of course one feels obligated to go in, browse around and pick up something. For example In one shop, I purchased 20 facial masks for 5.90 WON. At the current exchange rate, approximately less than $5.00USD. The buys are there.From cosmetics and a few scattered clothing shops, and costume jewelry, I would recommend this area for landing great cosmetic deals and a festive yummy street food scene."
Great shopping for skin care products,"It is a great shopping place for skin care and costmetics. It has most of the korea brands there. In fact for some brands, there could be more than 1 shops. Look out for sales as sale in 1 outlet might not be present in another outlet though they can just be a stone away. "
Crazy!,"I suppose I should be used to Asian shopping streets by now, but it seems I am not. Myeongdong is bright, vibrant, full of locals and foreigners alike, shopping in a range of shops that start at small and rather mysterious and move on up to big, bright, fancy, loud. Interspersed are restaurants and some street food that is mystifying, scary, and - often - smelling really good. Not that I can identify much of what's on offer. Korea has much the same attitude about shopping that Japan does (as much of the world seems to as well), treating it as an activity rather than a necessity, an event, a day or night out. I can't quite get my head around that idea, but I must say that Myeongdong is an experience. Once, however, was enough for me."
Great shopping area,"This is a great shopping area, and a must to visit if you are staying nearby. There are many shops and restaurants in the area. In the evening, the streets come alive when the night market starts. There is a good range of products being sold, from food to clothing. Many tourists throng the streets eating and buying."
A must place to go if your are a tourist.,If you are a fan of Cosmetics or you're shopa-holic then Myeongdong Shopping Street is for you. Some stores even offer 1+1 (Buy 1 Get 1) and the best thing if you buy some cosmetics here there's a freebies!!! Some stalls even selling KPOP Merch. (but a little bit pricey) There's also lot of restaurants and street food stalls around. 오뎅 (Fish Cake) and 순대 (Blood Sausage) are my favorite! :)
Very lively!,"It's one of my favorite places in Seoul. A lot of things to offer! Street food is everywhere, and mind you, it's clean! A lot of good deals from different shops too. Koreans are nice, and polite. Ask for a discount, and they'll give you. "
Place to shop,This is the place to walk around in and see the small shops where you can find almost anything. Street food galore!
Skin care shops & Street food,It's overwhelming with so many people. Go there if you have lots of energy. The skin care stores are repetitive - same brands/stores on every block or every other block. There are a lot of street food in this area too.Good Experience South Korea's skin care/cosmetic culture. 
Lots of shopping,Great area for shopping for beauty products. Lots to see. Lots of food stalls. Great place for people watching. 
Not for the faint of heart,"Myeongdong is everything the blogs say it is, and more. Imagine one district/street dedicated to just shopping. K-Beauty brands and coffee shops line every which direction. You'll never be left wanting for places to buy skincare and makeup. There's also a lot of street food in the middle of the street, so if you get hungry from all that walking, it's guaranteed that a food stall can cater to your tastes. First-timers in Seoul should definitely make plans to visit this area. (Myeongdong is also close to N. Seoul Tower and Myeongdong Cathedral) Here are the things that I wasn't so fond off in this area. First of all, if a source online tells you to nab all the free samples offered to you by the sales attendants, that information is sorely outdated. While some salesladies and gents will indeed offer you a free mask or two, taking them means you are willing to go inside the store to look at their products. You can't just take the samples and walk away from them. Some even tug the samples away from you if they notice you have no plans on coming inside. The only time I got samples was when I bought the 10+10 masks, with some extra products. The samples come with the purchase.Next, don't be pressured to hoard skincare products here in Myeongdong. I sadly discovered too late that I could have saved my Won if I had visited a Duty Free store before I went mad with masks in Myeongdong. Duty Free shops, such as Lotte, Shilla, and Doota, will probably sell more mask bundles for a cheaper price. For example, what would usually be a 10+10 deal in one branch for 30,000 won was upgraded into a 50+50 mask deal for USD 40 at the Duty Free. I even found LANEIGE products were cheaper in the Doota Duty Free mall in Dongdaemun as compared to the ones in Myeongdong (i.e. the Water Bank Essence was only 13,500 won in Doota, while it retailed for around 20,000+++ won in Myeongdong.) Bottomline: some deals will be better in Myeongdong, while some will be better in Duty Free. Be a discerning shopper and try not to panic buy just because you think you won't find a much better deal somewhere else. Korea is all about their beauty products so you'll find Tony Moly's, Etude's, and Innisfrees EVERYWHERE. Not just in Myeongdong. Lastly, I have to comment on the expensive street food. The way I did my research, I thought street food in Korea would be much, much cheaper. That was the way bloggers wrote about it too. But upon looking at what they had to offer, they were selling food items for as high as 15,000 won for just one piece! (Including the strawberry mochi cakes!) In my currency, that's around Php 660!!! Insane inflation!!! I would advise some caution when it comes to purchasing Myeongdong street food too. Some items are worth the price and are very cheap, like the freshly squeezed juice, the 32cm ice cream, and the egg cakes. But the others are too expensive for my taste. I could have used that money to buy a whole meal set in a sit down restaurant. To name a few, the 15,000 won lobster tail (though I get that lobsters must be a bit expensive), the gimbap for at least 5,000 won, and the battered shrimp that's more batter than shrimp. Tip: Go to INSADONG for cheaper and more delicious street food. The most I spent there was 2,000 won for 6 pieces of delicious taiyaki! All in all, Myeongdong is an experience first-timers should definitely go for, but don't get too lost in the moment that you forget to be smart about your money and your purchases. I'd probably go back here the next time I go to Seoul, but I'd try to avoid the suffocating crowds as much as possible (aka lean seasons are probably better for the claustrophobic!)"
Shop Shop Don't Stop,"Myeongdong is a must-not-miss shopping street. I loved all the make-up shops and you'll be happy to know most salespeople can speak English. Lots of restaurants around, but they're naturally priced for tourists. There's also the street food you must not miss. I suggest you walk through Myeongdong at night when the vibe is hip and the energy is high. Just remember to head home before the metro closes!"
Korean street restaurants ,"Korea has normal sit in restaurants, but to get the feel of authentic Korean go sit and eat at one of Koreas street restaurants, these are the hidden gems, usually mom and pop places "
Definitely a place to go in Seoul,"We stayed at the Metro Hotel right in this neighborhood and never tired of the food stalls and shops along the lively streets in the area. Restaurants, shops, street food abound. Try the shaved ice deserts, and the Maple Tree restaurant for barbecues. Unfortunately the fish shaped waffle with ice cream you get at the street food stall is not as good as it looks. "
SO SO SHOPPING PLACE,"Was here a few days ago. JUst come back to Singapore yesterday. People were talking so wonderfully to buy their cosmetic and skin care products and claims that you will get alot of free products sample from here which i don't experience it.The tax free rules is minimum purchase of 30,000.00 WON. Some can do direct tax free on the spot, some have to go to airport to claim the tax. Note that it is not 100% tax claimable. Only a certain percentage only. There are offers sometime on the cosmetic and skincare products. People are saying that free samples are given generously to any purchase, it is not true. They are NOT generously at all. Don't be fool by it. I went to Lotte Duty free mall too, do not buy from the normal cosmetic or skincare counter at the lower floor, they have a level which is for tourist direct tax free at level 12 (I think) where you can buy the skincare and cosmetic. The pice is alot different, the items there are all in US dollar. After calculation, the price is still cheaper than buying in Singapore. They don't give free samples generously too. The staff looks like you owe them alot of money. You can replanish your skincare and cosmetic products stock in Lotte Duty Free mall, Brands like History of whoo, Hera, Sulwaso and other international high end brands, but don't expect ALOTS of free samples. No such thing. They only give a few or upon request. Same as Myeongdong Shopping place. If you you want something more than the norms, you have to request it.You need to planned what you are looking for. Big brand should buy in the Mall, so that no hassle for the tax problem. You won't find high end brand such Whoo, Sulwaso, Hera in Myeongdong shopping, but IOPE, Laneigh, Etude, Skin food, etc is there. Hope this review helps if you are going there."
never tired of walking it,"so much to see and eat, and of course buy! prices are also targeted at tourists. multi lingual salespersons abound. at some points, there are also guides dressed in red who would be very pleased to help you with directions or recommendations."
Cosmetics Shopping Good Street Food,It's cosmetics paradise with all Korean brands present. We found it to be the single largest concentration of cosmetics shops in Seoul. Staff in most shops have English speakers. Daily discounts are on and they throw freebies if you buy over an amount. We didn't find the duty free shops Lotte etc great as they tend to stock the global brands. We just went berserk shopping here. And the street food options are many and varied. 
A must visit,"A must visit shopping street in Seoul. Street snack stalls were set up in the evening. The snacks were great, although the prices were on the high side. Cafes, restaurants, convenience stores and all kinds of shops were abundant. Great vibe and ambience."
Shop 'til you drop,Do not even think that you will manage seeing all the stores in a few days of stay. There are so many that I am still recovering from all the walking.
Wonderful shopping and eating,"Enjoyed the busy streets and the variety of shops around! Hawkers food carts were great, also there were many places for eating - you name it and surely you can find it!"
Good shopping place,"Good shops, but be careful of the fake items. First ask the prices and compare. Prices are different here"
Depends what you're looking for,"This seemed the shopping area for cosmetics, and food. It was always bustling, but easy to navigate to train station, department stores, etc. Many of the cosmetic stores repeated, and when you buy something they give you samples - love it!Don't forget to ask for a tax receipt if you spend over 5000Won - you can claim the tax back"
Sale sale sale,We were here last February and they had the winter sale 50-70% off on different stores and there was a street sale . Then now that its summer they have the same sale . MOstly on cosmetic products though . And oh ! Dont forget the street food ...
Overpriced tourist shopping spot.,"Lots and lots of skincare, makeup products - overrated spot with lots of tourists and the price is a rip off. Though they said its a must visit spot but actually there's lots of other places to shop off cheaper. Lots of street food but also priced higher than other places, but you'll be able to find a lot of varieties of products around. For people whom like to shop, it's a good place to get everything at one place. They even have the famous LINE Friends cafe around here."
So many Korean beauty products,"This is a great place if you want to buy good Korean beauty stuff, so many choices, street food are yummy and a lot to explore on the different Korean food. Clothes and women's accessories can also be found here. Affordable and enjoyable."
Beauty Products Paradise,"If you want to see what 3 different E-Tude House beauty shops have to offer within one block, this is the place to go. Blocks after blocks of face masks, face products, and other beauty products. This is, however, also the best place to go in Seoul for street food. "
Not a place for me ,I do not like this please very much. Whenever I am there it is because I am there in connection with something else. I only go there if I have to have a meeting or visit some friends. So not much love for the street because its noisy and not kept clean like the old days when i came to Korea first time. Lots have happened in 12 years I must say 
Skincare and make up everywhere,"This is probably one of the most crowded places I've been to in Seoul. It's a heaven for anyone who loves make-up and skincare products. There are several restaurants in this area as well, so walk around before you decide where you wanna eat at. Tip: come here with people who enjoy shopping as much as you do as it can get quite boring since that's all you'll be doing here."
Must visit in Seoul,"Very exciting area, full of shopping and eating possibilities. Excellent and tasty must try street food. If you're looking for the latest brand names for skin care and sports wear, you will certainly find it in Myeongdong. A huge choice of local food restaurants, of different cost levels, especially the wonderful Korean Barbecue"
Tourist Trap,Restros are little bit of everything but pricey. Shopping are filled with chainstore and street hawkers. Rather go to area close to Universities.
Stayed near Myeongdong Shopping Street,We went here almost every day. There's so much to discover. The street food is great & we ate at a few restaurants too. The shops will try to get you to go into their stores but they are super friendly & will understand when you say no. Nothing but great experiences here. 
AMAZING SHOPPING,If you like shopping this is the place to go with so many shops to see you won't know what to do with yourself. There is a good range of tasty street food along the pathways as well as some good market stalls selling clothes sunglasses and other items. If you like your beauty buys there are lots of shops that cater for this some expensive others cheaper. If you are from the UK you might get swamped by students asking you to do some quizzes and wanting a selfie (but they are very nice kind and polite so don't be worried). I'd say if you visit here you might want an empty suitcase to bring all the stuff you buy with you back home!
Many things to see and eat,"Great place to get your k beauty and shopping fix. So many shops. If you are nice you can get lots of free samples from the beauty stores. After 4 pm the food street vendors come out and the whole place becomes crazy crowded. To be honest, the street food is quite expensive. Many food items look good but only tasted so so. The swirly potato chips was a disappointment but do check out the honey comb vanilla ice cream served in a fish shaped pancake. Those were divine."
Love the street food!!,I felt like a local with the shopping and street food. I had the chance to enjoy Myeongdong 3 times out of our stay.
Myeoungdong Shopping Street,endless shopping. Lots of places to eat and if you're into Korean beauty products it is a must for your wives or girlfriends. satisfy your street food cravings !!
Tourist trap,"If you're up for a lot of shopping, a lot of people, a lot of street food, a lot of haggling for skin care--then this is the place for you! On my first visit to Seoul, I found this place very fun but after my 7th time to Seoul, I try to stay away from this area. Over the years, I've noticed that the haggling has gotten worse and if you don't speak Korean, they'll start assuming you're Chinese! The street food here is also more expensive than other places in Seoul. If you're looking for a more quaint area, check out Ehwa Women's University area--same skincare shops, less haggling, and less crowded. "
Delicious Street Food!,"So much shopping to do around this area, but the main attraction for me was the street food! Do your research and eat everything at least once! Korean street food tastes great, but may not be so great for the waistline."
Eating & Shopping - sooooo many cosmetic shops,"A great place to walk through mid afternoon and early evening. Lots of street food options (must check out the Myeongdong dumplings) including massive scalops, lobster, grilled beef, noodles etc etcIf you are looking for face, hand, feet masks this is the place to go. So many options I just bought a bunch of my stuff - not the expensive ones either. My wife is loving them"
Crazy busy ,What place to visit if you like shopping and food but be warned there are hundreds of people after 3pm 
Great area for shopping and foods!,"Myeongdong: Capitalism screaming in your face. It has a super high concentration of shops, neon lights, and food places. It is super lively and has good vibe until late in the evening"
Shopping place ,"We lived near Myeongdong station, and we shopping every night after finishing our plan. You can get street food, cosmetics, stationery here, and it's easy to exchange money, there are so many currency exchange stores on the street. If you wanna buy Korean brand cosmetics like innisfree, skinfood, laneige, tolymoly... here is the best place for you. It's lively at night! "
Full of night life!,"Fun street to come for tasting local foods, shopping for clothes and beauty products! Also has lots of restaurants around the area, dined here multiple times, although I must say that the restaurants around here have inflated prices."
Best area in town,Love this area. Lots of shops and restaurant and you can find street food as well at night. We were staying in myeongdong area and almost come to this area every night ❤️❤️
Worth a look,Place is full of people and shops. I was trying to find shot glasses but was unable to find what I was looking for. The place is great for cosmetics and there are various places to eat. They have tourist information people walking around in red cowboy hats that can answer any questions or help with directions.
"Food carts, cosmetics shoping","Was there in May 2017 and streets appears less busy ( this is a plus)due to China banning tour groups from going to South Korea.You can find all the Korean cosmetics sold here, there are multiple Innisfree, Etude house shops in this shopping area. Just a tip, I am normally late arriving at Incheon airport , however I was early this time and had a little time to walk around. I purchased an Iope skin care product (80,000 won) before tax refund (tax refund is only about 5%) at Aritatum Myeongdong and the airport was selling it for 60,000 won! Not sure if other Korean cosmetics are cheaper at the airport as I decided not worth comparing as I didn't want to find out I had paid more for all my other purchases!Food: lots of food being sold on carts. Drinks ( orange juice selling at 4000 won , maybe 5000 won ( can't remember exactly)... So in my opinion , not cheap. Stalls and most shops open till 11 pm."
Guaranteed to cause a shopaholic relapse,"Bright lights, hawkers shoving free samples in your hands, signs advertising huge discounts, all replicated every 50 metres in every direction, it's a recipe for credit card mayhem. Be careful if you can't resist!"
Crowded and great if you're looking for cosmetics,"Walked around this area around lunchtime on a Sunday just to browse at the collection of shops, which were mostly cosmetic boutiques and some clothing shops. Not a lot to interest most men :)"
Olive Young a teen paradise ,"On my family trip to visit my brother we spent some time here. My 17 year old daughter's favorite store was Olive Young as it had so many items she has seen but had to order on line. It was fun walking around looking at things, and not too crowded."
Girls skincare and cosmetic ,All the famous Korean skincare and cosmetic stores are all located in here. I went there for a one person Korean BBQ which was awesome. I like the crane machine there because I got 5 dolls in total. 
Full of life,We had several evening walk in this area which was really bursting with life. A lot of interesting street food to taste and purchase.
A bit too crowded for me,There were too many options and too many people. Most of the shops and products can be obtained at other places I think. But I did like the street food experience.
The Lively Street,"We had intentionally booked a hotel in this street as we know that it is a shopping district and lively by night. True enough, it is! The street is filled with cosmetic shops with different brands and clothing shops. There is also lots of eateries, coffee shops, convenient stores and even a bank. It is like a street mall with everything inside! At night, it is livelier with food vendors in the street and lots of people outside. You will never got tired in walking in Myeongdong."
nice but nothing special!,"hello, nice to see, walk through but nothing special when you already visited classic Asian cities .. plenty of shops and small food vendors ... guess a nice spot for cosmetic purchase."
Busy,"Huge bustling streets filled with all kinds of goods. Clothes, designer apparel, handbags and shoes. Was very fun browsing through this all. "
Become very commercial,"Myeongdong was all girls favourite shopping area, I came back after serval years, the street was kind of dirty cause there were lots of street vendor, fast food......! Comestic shop are the major business in this area, you will see young Korean man giving out free facemask sample to attrack customer. They all can speak muti languages but I found they were not too honest after I shop in serveral shop . Resturants were so crowd, food was just ok,staff wasn't friendly ! There are many other shopping option in Seoul, Myeongdong will not be on my shopping list in future visit."
ScrumptiousStreetfood and Make-up Galore,"We stayed at Royal Hotel Meongdong and went window shopping every night. Myeongdong presents a wide assortment of restaurants, fashion retail shops and make-up galore. Nanta Theater with the long running Cooking Nanta Show is here as well as the Meongdong Theater which has free weekend cultural performances. Prices here are reasonable and cheaper than at Korean department stores. But this is no place for haggling. There is a wide variety of street food from salmon to octopi to honeycomb ice cream to lobster(!) to eomuk (fish) cakes. Korean street food is by no means cheap and when we chose to have them for dinner, we ended up spending more than we would have had at a regular restaurant. By the way, the honey butter almonds and the yogurt almonds sold at a side street parallel to the famous Milky Bee Ice Cream are absolutely delicious!"
Cosmetics + Street food!,"Korean skincare is all the rage nowadays and once you step onto Myeongdong, you will be overwhelmed by all the brands, promotions and sales! Music is constantly playing, there is delicious street food you can enjoy while checking out all the stores. Plus every time you buy, you get a bunch of freebies too!"
A must see,"It is a Mecca for shoppers, especially if you love cosmetics, sneakers, sunglasses.After a bit product selection is always the same.The place is fast pacing, full of light and young."
Crowded shopping area,"I went there thrice and it was really crowded. Many people were looking things to buy like souvenirs, beauty products and different street food. It was really an interesting place for shopping and food tripping. The only thing I didn't like was the long queue at every shop I entered. There were items expensive and inexpensive and sometimes it was hard for me to choose because of varied choices. I also noticed couples outside having pictorials and a sort of romantic area for them :)"
Great Place to Eat and Shop,"Shopping and Markets close by, but the best thing here is the Street Food, great range to pick from."
Eat and Shop ,Great place to try street food. The street vendors don't come out until 2pm. Please make sure you try everything!! 
Fun street with lots of food cart,"Not sure what time the food carts are wheeled onto the street, I simply loved the variety of street food that are being sold on the street. There are spicy rice cakes, potato tornado, chestnut, noodles, banana chocolate crepes, cheese lobster etc. There are many shops selling clothes, shoes, accessories and even optical n contact lens shops besides beauty shops. Nice place to hang out for a taste of Korean street food especially evening time, besides shopping."
Really Nice places ,Nice place. Good Street food. Lots of beauty Products. Its a must-visit if you are in Seoul! Easy to take metro to myeongdong and come hungry. I fint like Street food normally but this is something else...new tastes and fin experience 
Make up haul! ,"Gosh! We were amazed by the large lines of make-up stores here. From BB creams, foundations, skin care, and other beauty products. Wow! We bought so much stuff to complete our wardrobe too. Shoes, bags, and clothes for summer. Street food is best here! Love them! "
Sights and sounds of Seoul,Pretty crowded but can still move around easily - there are many delightful offerings in the way of street food both savoury and sweet - my favourite is the spiral potato on a stick 
"Enjoy the multiple street food, shops, crowd and shopping",Best time to visit is when the streets shop are all set up by evening sunset. Try all the delicacy and thats dinner completed. Depends on your taste to buy the food or souveniers or whatever you choose. Take your time to walk and don't rush. Look for tallest icecream and local delicacies. Location near Myeongdong train station or take a cab to be here.
"Walk, Look, Try, Buy.....","Myeongdong....best visited at night... lively and bright with stalls and shops. Great street food and various goods on sale....something for everyone. The mood is casual and fun-like. If you're into Korean cosmetics, the street is lined with all of the familiar Korean cosmetic brands...you'll be spoilt for choice. I was so thrilled to fine a 'Line Friends' flagship shop there too. We visited Myeongdong a few times during my stay in Seoul and it was always a new experience..... go see yourself. Dress according to the weather as it's open-air shopping. But all's not lost as you can also hop into the shops and malls or sit in the coffeeshops and dessert shops for a short rest while enjoying a cup of coffee or slurping up a Korean ice dessert.... Do give yourself sufficient time as it's not a place to rush through or you may regret it forever...or till your next visit to Seoul..:)"
Myeongdong Shopping Street,"This is the fun, vibrant place to shop with an affordable price. Must-visit. We enjoyed the time to shop. "
Fun evening,This street is great fun. Loads of really cool street food. Try cake with a fried egg or tasty fried king prawn. Plenty of shops but just stayed on the street soaking up the vibe!
First visit to seoul,First time being in Seoul and was taken to these fantastic streets. A must see and plenty of shops to by things to take home.
Brilliant day or night,"We visited late afternoon and into the evening. Fabulous choice of shops and restaurants and excellent Street food vendors. This is the place to be, it's buzzing !"
Great fun,"This street is great fun for visitors to Seoul, it starts late morning and runs through to about 10.00pm. It is actually a complex of lots of cross streets and easy at first to get a bit lost. The shops are mostly make up, cosmetics, cheap clothes, phone accessories, jewellery, stationery, toys and cafes. (Unexpectedly no hi fi, cameras and electronics that markets usually have) Many shops are repeated multiple times. The stalls are mostly fresh cooked foods, fruit, drinks and other snacks. Struck me as high quality and inexpensive. Note that it is also hygienic, with my partner we eat at lots of stalls without a worry. Honestly although it was all very casual we loved it and walked round for at least a couple of hours every day. The friendly atmosphere and friendly stall holders made the whole place a pleasure. Every major city should have a corner like this. One of the best tourist attractions in Seoul."
Looking ahead for the next visit to Myeongdong . . . .,"Came for a visit with wife, daughter and friend mid-Jan 2017 to Seoul for a week and we all loved and enjoyed Myeongdong's amazing long hours of shopping treat. You'll find ladies and men's wear collection, beauty and skin care products for women (btw also for guys), delicious bbqs and grills, plenty of tempting street food, souvenir items and the sweetest tasting Korean strawberries. Seoul experience will not be complete without spending time in Myeongdong - for items well worth your money and visit. You also get to wear your sleek winter apparel with single digit temp if not below zero degree centigrade all day long."
Street food and cosmetic shopping paradise !!!,If you like street side food this is paradise for you. The place is full of food and it looks yum . The other speciality of this place appears to be cosmetics shopping and naturals clearly appears to be the latest trend ..There were more than 500 shops all selling cosmetics and giving some excellent deals. Must visit as part of the Seoul itinerary. 
Seoul experience,"At first it seemed a bit overwhelming but after about the 3rd day into our vacation, getting through the crowd and going from store to store became second nature. Lots of food venues and stores. Also you will find lots of beauty stores. Overall a good experience."
Street of mainstream K-skincare brands,"Every major K-skincare brand has a boutique store on this street, in fact more than one. The same brand has at least two stores on the same block, and then you see them again as you keep walking. Laneige, InnisFree, Nature Republic, Holika Holika, Etude House, My Face Shop, they are all here."
Window shopping ,"The mecca of beauty products in Seoul. I suggest coming here just for the experience, but I don’t suggest here to come for shopping. I think it’s too touristy that even sidewalk vendors sell pricey items. If you want to go shopping for cheaper beauty products without getting overwhelmed with the crowd and array of beauty products shop, then you should go to Ewha Womans University. But aside from beauty products which this place is known for, this market is also known for its copious number of Korean streetfood. But mind you, trying all the streetfoods here at this market can actually make a big dent in your pocket because the cheapest food that I saw was 1,000 Won. So be wary as you go indulge yourself on Korean streetfood because you might actually have used up all your money without you knowing."
NIce place to spent your money,Is a must visit place for those ladies who love shopping very much.I went there 3 times in a week.Cosmetic is so so cheap compare to my country.I wish i can bring more back.Street foods is delicious especially eat during winter season.
"Shopping, street food and animals! ","This shopping street/area is huge! There are so many shops off the main street and endless side streets with shop after shop. Some of them are very expensive but you can find good deals and sales and also find some cheap good quality items. I got some pants, dresses and shirts. We also bought several souvenirs for friends and family members. We also went to a dog cafe one day and a cat cafe on another. We had some street food and it was really good. This is a must see shopping area in Seoul. I would definitely recommend going here to do some shopping, grab some delicious street food and maybe grab some drinks and pet some animals (if you are an animal lover like I am!)"
Shopping,"Great shopping district, especially for cosmetic, great bargain and good quality, English speaking wasn't very useful in most of the shops, watched out some restaurants, checked menu price first, socks and toys were cheap but for XL clothes will be impossible, myself unable to find any, not even in Uniquo."
So much shopping on one street...,"If you're looking for shopping, this is the street that I recommend. It had every store that I could think of and more. All in all, prices were alright. There are also currency exchanges in the area which was very handy. "
Great shopping area!,Great shopping area with lots to see and experience. The place has lots of restaurants as well! And ladies can get most if not all the cosmetic brands there.
Shopping paradise ,Anyone who loves to shop should be at Myeongdong. Also there are street food at every corner to satisfy those hungry stomach. 
Shopping heaven and cheap,You can buy cosmetic here and it very cheap. The street food is also so yummy. Try as many food items you can find. 
Shop till you drop,"A must go and see, of course. Lots of shopping, lots to eat, either road side stalls, or restaurants. The choice is unlimited. Could easily spend half a day there, and back the second day!"
Lots of food!,All of the things you know about street food can be found here. The bazaar starts around 4pm till 10pm. It is also a giant shooping center. Everything from Korean products to Americans' can be found. 
Best cosmetic shopping mecca ,Try to split your item into a little bit more than KRW 30000. So you will get instant tax refund and free gift. Than you can move to another store and do the same. Try their snack along the alleys it's delicious
"Shopping for ladies, food for gentlemen!","That's a really great experience - to come in the evening to have a couple of bites of a local food. And to watch locals, who are so different and bright. "
Getting Lost and Finding Treasures,"Myeondong is one of those places, like many in the world, in any city, where the buildings, shops, alleys form a natural myriad of organically developed hustle and bustle of trade, residence and worship. A visitor cannot feel but overwhelmed by the closeness of these alleys which the senses are slathered with music, drooling smells of food, lovely retail assistants in many types of attire to entice you to walk into the shops. Where you have small but well stocked shops on both sides of the alleys and in some broader ones, have another two rows of carts selling everything from BBQ corn to children's socks. The residents who used to live here must have had close intimate relationships because of the proximity of one type of shop, food and service. Of course, there is some gentrification where more retail shops have popped up. Yet you find quaint shops from a Pet Cafe ( yes literally pay for time with different dogs to lie on your lap) to BBQ skewered meats, to strawberries dipped with chocolate, buns covered with pigeon eggs to famous Korean seafood cuisine and fine dining. And mind you, this is what you see at eye level. Most buildings have hidden gems of restaurants and retail in the upper levels. Your sight must rise above the usual man's height and look up, look around, look down to basements to find , explore and enjoy. And Myeondong continues to sparkle throughout the 4 seasons yet it has within this district, connected by major train lines, hotels surrounding it a most famous Catholic Church. When the Pope visited Seoul, this was the church he conduct mass at. Trip Advisor does not have enough space for me to continue with the many woven stories of good food, cute things to buy, fun people to watch. The thing is, one gets immersed into Myeondong ( Literally meaning Bright Cave) and need only emerge out of this district to fly home. Discover your own story."
Enjoy the market,"A very crowded place but good enough to shop some beauty products and snacks! Wow, when you just passed about 10/15 steps of your foot from entrance of the market (from myeongdong subway), theres a guy who sells the eggbuns. And it was the delicious one i have ever eaten. And also the fishcake is a must to try! "
Underground shopping ,"Nice choices, excellent service and high quality goods sold in the underground shops. The shops sell Korea made goods the demand for which is low with tourists. "
"Fashion, Cosmetics, Food Galore!!!","Place to find anything and everything a lady will like, plus tons of food around everywhere. Street food prices are a little steep though, but still taste great nevertheless. Most Street vendors operates during the evening time, morning and noon is usually just shops."
Great Food and Shopping ,"Great place to do shopping and eating lots of delicious food. Living in Hong Kong I thought it would be similarly busy but to my surprise it wasn't at all. There is plenty of place to walk around calmly, browse, eat, all day and night long. "
"walk, eat & shop",best time to visit this place is during night time. Many stores offers low price and lots of freebies during late night or almost closing time. Street foods are also a must try!
Everything in one place,"If you have limited time in Seoul, Myeongdong might be the best bet. Skincare, clothes, sport shoes, street food, café and restaurant all in 1 place. It is not necessary the cheapest but you can get almost all that I mentioned earlier. We stay near Myeongdong which was easy for food since there are a lot of restaurant and street food available. Bought great bargain sport shoes which we wont able to get back home, so that was good trip for us. Bought beautiful and nice accessories, some are more expansive than others, so do look out for those with great bargains. Bought ladies top which usually are free size and no fitting allowed. Typically they are a size M/L or the materials are stretchable, likewise some design are more than $50 which others bargain price so depends on your taste."
Buzzing.,Very busy and buzzing shopping area. Many eating places to choose from and lots of coffee shops. All the top brands and many other shops where you can shop at. Clean and even has smoking huts so people do not smoke in the streets.
Busy and fun!,"Lots of hustle, bustle and fun. Bargains for sure but mostly a good people watching option. Bought bits and pieces. Nothing amazing though. "
Tourist trap,"A lot of shops, mainly skincare. But the salespeople where almost aggressive when they wanted you to come into the shops. Basically it's the exact same shops as everywhere, but more frantic. I seriously don't recommend it for shopping. Choose one of the biggest malls instead."
Control your urge to spend money ,"My wife and I heard a lot about myeongdong, how the shops give away freebies like nothing, how attractive the sales are. We walked alone street away from the main street of myeongdong searching for face mask with heavy discount, and attracted by the discount signs outside one shop. Guess what? We didn't get freebies. The shopkeeper tried to talk us into buying face mask which are more "" premium"". And when I ask if there is tax free since I hit the 30k won, the answer was NO because the items were at discount. We were very disappointed. Where are the freebies that everyone talked about? When we went to Lotte Duty free shop, we saw the same items sold at same price, but can claim the tax. We are disappointed. Next time we will see where the crowd go, and stay in main street of myeongdong."
"Love it! Food, makeup, shopping!! ","A must if you're visiting Seoul! From knock offs and food carts to high end name brand stores, you won't be disappointed!! "
Great Shopping District,So many interesting shops and street food to try! A must buy is the facial masks and Korean cosmetics
It's a place for everything about shopping,"It open at 9 or 8 am. Our guesthouse was just a few steps from this shopping street. So many things that you could shop, from clothes, beauty cosmetics to food. But the food street usually opens in the afternoon until midnight."
Very Nice shopping street,"Very lively , different variety of stores in each street. There's balance - one street are full of eateries , another dresses and dry goods and another street sells diff brand of skincare and another street of variety of Korean souvenirs. Along the main alley a lot of street treats and Korean specialties. Fun place to be for a tourist. "
enjoy walking street food! ,"a great way to snack around and shopping in myeongdong with many free wifi hotspot. however, do shop around for the lowest prices, and find shops with Tax Refund for tourist! Only issue is, it is not quite easy to find restroom around the area. "
"Crowded, hyped-up shopping strip","Was very crowded even on a weekday afternoon. Reminded me of Ximending in Taipei in terms of scale, type of shopping available, food, and crowd.You can find local and foreign brands here, and local snacks and push carts selling cheaper goods and clothes.Can be too crowded to be child/stroller-friendly though."
Lots of animation in the evening under the illumination,Full of animated atmosphere and full of happy mood in the street. Lots of exotic street food in every ally. It is a MUST place to visit.
Heaven for cosmetics and food lovers!,"This place is amazing for people who love to look after their skin, cosmetics are nearly in every shop, feels like you're in heaven as I love make up, recommended for people who loves to look good. Traditional exotic food stalls all over the street, hard to choose they all look delicious and fresh as they are cooked on the spot."
Shopper's paradise,Here shoppers and food addicts will not be disappointed by the vast variety of products and eateries lining its streets and alleys.Special interest is street food at night.Must visit place in Seoul.
Expensive,"Very pushy sales people. Expensive prices compared to outside. Don't be too tempted by the ""freebies"" as they jerk up prices, then give freebies. I saw the exact same items, elsewhere for 20,000KRW and sold here for 30,000KRW "
"Foods,foods,shoping,shoping","Great place to have treats on South Koreans streets food. Mouth watering food with wide variety from fried,grilled,stuffed,soups and the list goes on."
Fun and Safe,"Day or night, the Myeongdong shopping street is a fun place to go. Lots of street food in the evenings and as early as noon on weekends. Really fun and safe. Full of life and positive vibes. Store assistants shout out their offers but no hassling. They even have volunteer tourist guides, dressed in bright red, mingling with the crowd offering assistance in various languages. I consulted with some of them and their information were spot on!There are lots of interesting shops too. What I found interesting is that the currency exchange outlets on the street offer hugely better rates than the money changers at airports in Singapore or Incheon."
Shop and Dine in Korea,"This place is the go to place when you want to shop and dine in Korea. It has all the brands, local and foreign. As Korea is known for its cosmetics, this place is about 50% cosmetics.Besides shopping, there are a lot of food stalls in the middle of the streets where you can eat to your hearts content."
Busy street,Enjoyed shopping at there and there are a lot of street food. Shame that we were too full and could not try all the food. 
Foodie delight,"Lots of great small restaurants and nightly street foods. Good way to try very a lot of different dishes. Vendors are usually younger folks, so very patient and courteous. Don't hesitate to ask"
"Cosmetic shops, good value for money exchange rate, street food","Going on weekends or friday night is exciting that going on weekdays. There are a lot of sellers when you go during weekends. Make sure to canvas prices first before buying as it is a big place to walk around and even has more than 1 shop for a single brand. Canvas exchange rates in different shops as the ones farthest has a good deal and value when you need to have your money changed to Korean won. Some shops doesnt accept credit cards especially stalls so make sure to bring korean won with you.From myeongdong station take EXIT 5 or 6. Streetfood is good here and usually starts at 3,000 korean won."
Highlight of the trip,"You can never miss this street if you are in Seoul.. along with lots of shopping , street food is so yummy .... after six in evening , food stalls will set up and you must relish on the street food sold there.. we stayed right in mid of myeongdong , so we had lots of street food. the place is really happening and you will feel hyped .. "
Vacation,Very interesting how they have there shoppong malls setup on each building the have stores inside stores.
Shopping,There wasn't too much of variety stores. Mainly a lots of cosmetic stores. I liked olive and young where you could get all kinds of beauty related stuff. I did not have my passport with me so they gave me bar coded receipt and I got my tax back at the airport. There were a lot restaurants and street foods late afternoon.
Fun bit crazy and over priced. ,We stayed in this area and were on this street daily. The food stalls are delicious but really over priced. $4 for orange juice $5 for a pastry. The skin care stores that surround the streets are full of over zealous hustlers who will try to sell you everything under the sun and be very demanding about it Found it like a very less classy shinjuku 
Love this place!,"Great for shopping with many kinds of shop from clothes to cosmetics, etc... many great street food for you to try."
A very 'lifely' Shopping -,"In this and the adjacent streets, you will find something for everybody, both in terms of shopping and dining. "
Exciting ,"A heaven of cosmetic Korea. I love here. It's not the first time I come here. But whenever I come, I always find the exciting things. If you can, look for a local friends, you can try soju, tokpoki, maekoli,.. in a small tent together. Not many Koreans speak English but I'm sure they are so friendly.Don't forget to enjoy street food here"
great place for shopping and eating,amazing place on the evening for some fun shopping and great street vendors foodfrom pasta to lobster and some nice chicken sticks its a fun place to have a cheap easy and quite nice diner in Seoul
"very vibrant, live with activities","Sensory overload for people who like quiet places. For people who likes shopping, people gazing and lively place, this is it. Many foreigners are there. Many great restaurants are available as well as cosmetics, clothes, and souvenir shops. Day and night is different. would consider visiting during the day and during the night to see the difference. Few negatives: cars/trucks/motorcycles driving through streets where people walk around so need to watch where you are going. Also, many sales people are around."
Makeup Mecca!!,"This is Korean makeup heaven, guys! Literally makeup shops for miles on end. And for each purchase they give you lots of freebies to try. Although there's a language barrier to a certain degree, the salespersons try their best to communicate even through gestures, haha. Shops are open til late in the evening specially on weekends. I stayed for 6 nights and went to Myeongdong every single night for my shopping fix. :) My happy place in Seoul!"
Fantastic ! ,Had a few hours to kill. Heard about the legendary Korean skin care and face masks which one has to buy as they make great gifts. This area was teaming with shops selling face masks and skin care products. Some shops have In-House VAT refund counters. But what I absolutely loved was the street food ! Tonnes of stalls selling mouth-watering food. Had the best freshly squeezed pomegranate juice. Great way to spend a few hours. 
Worth a visit,"Very nice shops, full of life. Looks like it is always beasy. Restaurants, coffee shops and lots of people in the streets during the weekend"
Good place to get street food and any other trinkets you need,This area is a good place to get street food and any other trinkets you need. It is filed with so many vendors and stores selling anything and everything a tourist and local may want and need. Allow yourself a couple hours here as you can get lost in the alleys that make up this shopping area.
This is a street maze you'd like to visit!,The Myeong Dong shopping streets offering a veriety of trending fashion as well as street food.It has a young atmosphere but elderly people will enjoy it as well.
busy myeongdong,"the very first thing i remember about myeongdong shopping street is the free gift :) when you walk on or walk in a shop some sales promotion girl/boys will gave you free gift (usually a masker or face lotion) at noon this street is full of shop and shopper only so many beauty shop you can find here from etude, face shop, laneige, etc. for fashion there also some known brand like uniqlo, H & M, etc. at night it changes to become centre of street culinary at myeong dong (oh my god!!) this place become so crowded and surrounded by delicious and mouth watering smell of street foodsfor the foodi recommend oden, toppoki, and some satay (pork, beef, chicken and seafood) the best time to go here is from 4 pm until 9 pmi visit here on jan 17 :)"
Shopping and Food tripping at Myeongdong😜,"It has been said that if u are in Korea, one must visit this place for cosmetics and food street. And yes, it was really true and we enjoyed the food too much and bought some Korean cosmetic products. Its quite pricey but worth it coz Korean beauty peoducts is one of the best and effective products for face and body care."
Everything you can think about,Its the place that you can find everything you can think about. It is a place you go to spend money. Dont miss it. 
Buy everything ,"Lot of shop and tourists, you can by everything. But pay attention on your wallet, you can buy street food."
Overwhelming exciting!,"This place is overwhelmingly great! Lots of shopping and eats. If you walk further to the Myeondong theatre there are shows being performed outside. A lot of street vendors selling food, clothes, hats, socks."
Pure fun!,"Come here in the evening, it is a pure fun. Music from all over, hundreds of people roaming, dozens of cosmetic shops on every street are inviting you to come inside. Really strange for Europeans and something you imagine to be really Asian. Really worth a visit right after you arrive to Seoul. "
The 'place to be' in Seoul,"Visited Myeongdong and loved the area so much that we came back to it everyday during my trip to Seoul. The street food is the bomb, particularly the japchae, flame grilled lobsters, and chicken skewers. It has a great nightlife, lots of shopping, restaurants, and a youth culture."
Excellent for skincare products and make-up!,Myeongdong is famous for the immense number of skincare products and make up shops! At almost every street you can find an Etude House or Innisfree shop. The prices are the same as most places elsewhere in Korea but they are relatively cheap compared to most other countries!
"modern face of South Korea, Seoul",one of the place you must visit in Seoul. Full with beauty shop and shopping centers and a lot of street foods which are delicious.
Shopping shopping ,This is haven for shopping junkies and food addict. All put it on your list when going to Seoul. Also prepare your budget ready for bargains!
Scratch beneath the surface,"A very vibrant district of Seoul, seemingly super famed for its shopping and food.Its easy to see why this is the case and when we arrived it was an exciting area to explore and we eagerly anticipated hitting the shops.When we did so I can only describe the experience as disappointing. There is lots of repetition and no standout identity to what was on offer (make up aside of course). "
Great street food,"The shopping in the Myeondong area is great, particularly for skin care products.There are many clothes shops too but the best part is the street food at night.This is definitely somewhere you should visit during your trip to Seoul, and I'd recommend staying in Myeongdong for your stay.Great atmosphere."
One of my favourites in Seoul,"My favourite place to stay in Seoul is around this shopping street in Myeongdong. It's perfect because you can drop all your shopping off to your room, and head down to get something to eat at any time. At night time it's a little more crazy and you'll be shoulder to shoulder with other people but you get used to it. Lots of food to choose from but most of it is the same stuff. Can get a little expensive if you get lots of food. Lots of restaurants around and plenty of stores to shop at, and the staff at the beauty stores can be pushy to get you to come in (one forced me to come in once - I just walked in then out). Goes on until usually around 11pm. Very easy to get to by public transport."
Holidays in Seoul,"Nice place to go for shopping. There are many shops at the basement as well as on the roadside. Many varieties of goods, clothes , facial products & food along the street . Advisable to bring more cash as some vendors don't accept credit card. You can go on shopping without realising that you have spend so much."
Nice Myeongdong Street and surrounding area,"I did not imagine I will enjoy Myeongdong. Such a nice experience esp. for street food lovers! There are lots of restos also, plus beauty products stores."
Overwhealming,"If you go at night, the lights here are similar to what you would experience in downtown Tokyo. Plenty of reasonably priced eateries around. If you can choose again between day or night, for sure go at not."
Best Place For Shopping ,Myeongdong was a great shopping place in Seoul. There were many shops & restaurants on both sides of the street. There were many pushcarts in the middle of the street sellingfood and all kind of items. The street was crowded with people and it's a very vibrant shopping place when compared to elsewhere. A must go place when in Seoul !! Love it ! 
Your average shopping street,"The best bit about it is the street food outside of the shops. The shopping is mostly beauty products, but still worth a visit."
Shopping Paradise,"I managed to find all the K-pop & K-drama actors merchandise and lots of skin care product here. Also it is a walk to the Namsan Tower. For shopaholic, this is your paradise and to find a hotel which is located in the heart of Myeongdong "
Upscale Shopping ,"Unlike the other market streets, this is upper scale shopping and restaurants. Most if the shopping is cosmetics and clothing. Very clean. Some street food. "
Sales could be really pushy,"LikeThey are generous with samples. They will offer you free sample, mostly face mask to have you enter their shop. Lots of eateries stall in the areaConsI dislike that mostly the cosmetic shop sell in bulk. For example, you will have to buy like 2 to 3 bottles instead of 1.And the sales could be really pushy, especially to foreigner. I was pushed to buy a eye cream at one of the shop (The S#e#). The seller told me that the price is 100.000 KRW and buy one get one. Since she was that pushy, I ended buy. But later on, I was pissed when I check on the receipt that it was actually only 50.000 KRW per bottle. So, basically I bought both those so called 'buy one get one'. I paid 100.000 for 2 bottles assuming that I got good deals, which apparently, it was 50.000 each. Stupid me. So, shall you wish to buy there... Don't get to excited with all the buy one get one promotion or others.... "
Full of life and lots and lots of shopping!,This place is amazing for shopping. A great place to visit in the evenings when all the street food stalls are open. There are soo many shops and I got lost numerous times!
Fantastic Shopping!,"Exit 6 of Myeongdong station is the nearest to this shopping haven. We went in early May and they were having sale. We bought more than KRW500,000 of skincare from Sea N Tree. They were having 1 for 1 promotion on their Vit C Capsule Ampoule and Snail Serum which cost KRW45,000 per bottle and KRW39,000 for Hyaluron Ampoule 100ml. We received lots of free samples and 4 boxes of masks free. MCM also offered KRW30,000 off any purchase with registration of a new passport as member. For purchases below KRW300,000, you can get immediate tax refund in the shop. Above that amount, you have to claim from the airport upon departure. You can find Etude House, Innisfree, Nature Republic, Teeny Weenie, Laneige and many other Korean brands here. After 6pm, stalls start sprouting out of nowhere on the streets selling street food. Shops open daily from 11am to 10pm."
Fun for free time,Great street to stroll around when you have some free time. You can buy a lost of reasonably priced items and delicious street food. I don't think anyone should PAY to go on a tour here- just do it yourself.
Lovely place ,"My favourite part of Seoul ^^ full of life <3 lot of restaurants, fashion shops, shops with music products (kpop), also magnificent cathedral :) "
Crowded and noisy,"If you want to get feeling for shopping, you have to go here. Hundreds of shops and street venors. Very interesting!"
Nice Place,"Restaurants and shopping centers has its wide variety of options. Very crowded that you cannot take a good photo alone, especially during Sundays and night time. But overall we enjoy wandering around. Enjoying the different street foods! So good! Next time we come back to Seoul we will absolutely visit this place again."
Shopping and more shopping,"Place for cosmetics and beauty products, cheapest place for beauty products as compared to namdaemun and dongdaemum. Place is filled with food stalls and restaurants and is extremely safe. Shopping for clothes is fine too. In short, higher end shopping at dongdaemun and lower end whole sale clothing at namdaemun."
The Heart and Soul .... of SEOUL !,"This is the shopping and youth capital of Korea. You can buy just about anything here - food, kit, makeup, every brand name under the sun. You name it, its here. You can get lots of cheap stuff here also, and girls - this is a COSMETICS PARADISE !! You can be young, wild and free here. There is something here for pretty much everyone."
Finally get to walk on this famous street,"Bring enough money or be disciplined not to spend at all the street food is not that affordable but I guess this is meant for tourists anyway. It all start from 3000 krw and a skewer of sausages cost 4000 krw or SGD5. There were plenty of cosmetic products and sales persons were aggressive. They could come close to you, handed you some samples and attempt to pull you in to the shop for shopping. So just shake your head if you're not interested. I'm pretty good at that towards the end of my first night "
Soooo much fun!!,This is one of my favorite thing we did on this trip to Seoul...the streets you can literally get lost in!!! Sooo much to eat and see and shop!! You need to do this!!! Koreans are excellent people very kind.
Full of Night Life,"The streets at night are full of people shopping, eating and simply strolling, Great street food which all looks tasty all be it mostly deep fried, but clean, "
Its not your imagination there are multiple shops of the same brand,"Great place to get lost and wonder if you have been there or not. There are multiple shops in each alleyways of the same brand so If you didn't buy what you wanted in the other shop, rest easy your chance to buy it will come up in the next alleyway. Oh and samples are great, they will give it to you as long as you go in the shop, but be strong they are really good at selling, otherwise you'll end up buying 200 piece of face mask (while in korea get their beauty products). If you get hungry the street stalls is great place to snack. try the dragon beard candy and if you can their KFC (korean fried chicken) it's to die for!!!"
Great Shopping and People Watching,Lots of shoes and clothingstores. Very close to an abundance of street food in the afternoon/evening. Seemed to be busy day and night.
Crowds and makeup ,"Myeongdong is great for buying makeup as there are literally hundreds of makeup stores. The street food is overpriced compared to other areas but still good. It gets very busy later in the day. Shop assistants will stand infront of their store handing out beauty face masks, but only take it if you actually want to go inside their shop and buy something. If you walk in and don't buy anything they will take the mask back from you. It's like a ticket to see their products. One visit to Myeongdong is enough if you're not into shopping for beauty products."
Wow,What a shopping experience.In terms of the array and diversity truly amazing.Local food offerings looked most interesting too.
nice shopping street with great food,The street is fully of food carts in the evening. Selling Korea traditional dim sum and also popular street food. 
Place to go if you have little time to shop ,"A very convenient place to go shopping and eating if you have only little time to stay at Seoul. You can find almost every cosmetic brands here and the staff are all friendly. They are experienced and speak fluent Mandarin and English, a lot of small gifts will be given along with your bought items. Clothes and accessories sold here are trendy. Many Korean restaurants and cafe and you can rest whenever tired. One point to mention is wifi is extremely convenient because almost all cafe provide free wifi service which is very caring to tourists. "
Shopping Block - Buy those cosmetics!,"Very busy block of shopping center which sale alot of cosmetics, foods and full of pub/bar at night. You named it, Face shop, Etude house, Innisfree, nature republic, skin 79, skin foods. The price can be 50% cheaper than what your country offer you. "
"Busy, loud, sensory overload ... but FUN!","We stayed in the Pacific Hotel, which is just across the street. After Dinner we made it our daily routine to stroll around the streets of Myeongdong. It's a real fun area, ok in daytime, but much better in the evening / at night. It is quite a compact area with a good number of side streets. Even in size it is not huge, we always discovered a shop we haven't seen yet...or even a whole lane we didn't walk yet.The streets are full with street vendors selling food, clothes, cheap jewelry and lots more. A good spot to stock up on your socks. The street food here is not that cheap, but good in quality. Besides the street food there are countless restaurants, many hiding in upper floors without english signs. And of course a huge array of stores. Mostly fashion, clothing and beauty products. If you are not interested in the latest trend of beauty masks, just avoid eye contact with the guys and girls trying to give you a free sample.In the evening the streets are packed. Full with people, lots of tourists, but also lots of Koreans. It's bright, it's loud....but it has charm, we loved it and couldn't get enough of it.Be aware that most shops and food stalls close around 10.30 - 11.00pm. Also many restaurants do not open longer than 10pm.Some restaurants I recommend:Myeongdong Jungil Hoegwan - just across the main street, next to the Pacific Hotel; good Korean BBQ (there are two similar restaurants next to each other....choose the one on the right)Kyoja - Dumplings, Gyoza and Noodle Soup; cheap and cheerful, great flavoursJogaewa Seafood Bar & Restaurant - great grilled seafood; easy to spot with the electric clam above the entraceAll in all not to be missed. We did prefer this area to Insadong, which was a bit too artsy for our taste (good restaurants though). If you do not have much time in Seoul, this should be on top of your list.Wanna know more about me and my trips? Check my profile."
touristic area of seoul,a bit too touristic with repetition of cosmetic shops. Recommend if you only have few days' time in Seoul. Recommend other commercial area if you stay for more days.
Favorite shopping area,"Myeong dong is so cool! Cat cafes, street food paradise, shopping both cheap & upscale. We loved it so much we went back a second time in a week."
Shopping and Eating!,"Enjoyed Myeongdong, no matter how crowded it was! The spiral potato on a stick tasted like fresh potato chips, we opted for plain salt over dipping on cheese or onion powder. We didn't try the other street foods but went to seafood and bbq restaurants instead. "
Great shopping and Korean Street Foods,"We visited Myeongdong twice. Once in the afteroon and once in the evening. We had lunch, dinner and street foods in between. The Korean BBQ lunch was ok, the dinner with Korean Tofu soup and stew pork was great and the street foods were even greater with variety and creativity.There were a lot of band name shops with good prices as well. Highly recommended."
A labyrinth full of surprises,"Been there many times and got lost every single times! what seems like a square is actually a labyrinth with multiple junctions, hidden treasures, vibrant energy and amazing street food! Primary aim to visit Myeongdong village is hunt for cosmetics and there are plenty plenty plenty!!! Despite this need, street food is umbelievable! from fresh juice stands (pomegranate juice recommended), fried delicacies, spatial ice creams and many more, great seafoos, noodles, korean barbecue joints are to be found! Bottom line is as soon as you step in you will be teleported in one of the most dynamic experience of your life! Garanteed (except if you don't feel confortable in the crowd):)"
Happening place for shopping cosmetics and eating,"The minute you exit from exit 6 from the Seoul metro you see rows of street food it is such a huge place selling all different kinds of Korean cosmetics such a wide variety of choices,many branches of Nature Republic,Tony Moly,Etude House,Skinfood,etc etc. If you purchase something they give you lots of free samples like face masks,skin lotions,emulsions,toners.There are also shops selling the latest in Korean fashions which are very pretty usually in pastel colours. It is not so cheap compared to the street stalls which are cheaper.There are also many good Korean restaurants here.We had Korean BBQ which was so good.Myeondong is usually crowded especially weekends and in the evenings."
Shop and eat,It is a shopping huge area with lots of streat food.I used to go there in the evening after sightseeing.You can do shopping and taste foodIt is safe and you find cafes as well 
Shopper's paradise ,"This is a must visit for shopaholics. You can find literally every thing from almost every brand, be it luxury or local. You cannot finish strolling all the streets in just ine day. I have been there for several times and every time I discovered something new. Even if you don't love shopping, you have to go there for the wide array of street foods it has to offer. You can also find some halal street foods there. Honey garlic shrimp and barbecue chicken has been my favourites. These shops are usually open till late so I suggest visiting at night. This place has something for everyone."
Hot spot for cosmetic lovers ,"If you don't know what to choose from hundreds of different korean cosmetic brands, myeongdong is the best choice to come. Why? Because all brand clustered together in this one area. They also usually have different promotion than stores outside myeongdong. If you're hungry, you can go to the famous myeongdong gyoza to have some noodles and dumplings. Or for K-pop lovers, you can go to YG republique for some BBQ. The restaurant is privately own by YG entertainment. You can ezpext to see handsome servers there"
Good eats,"Good variety of street food and shops. You can find things like mochi stuffed with red bean and fresh strawberry, fried prawns, baked lobster, egg bread, fish cakes, many things on skewers, and ice cream. It's crowded but manageable."
Beauty Products,"An entire area dedicated to beauty products, with all the major beauty brands located here (innisfree, nature republic, skinfood, face shop, balina co., etc). This is the place to buy all your facial products and makeup. There is a Line theme shop in here too that is a must-go place for absolute cuteness.Food and clothing stalls are set up at the centre of the street every night. Food is pretty overpriced but they offer a good variety.This is also the place for good food if you know how to find it. There is a famous dumpling shop here and there are great bbq and seafood places hiding in the lanes."
Shopping at its best,We went here and since its a weekend its a bit crowded. Good thing the deals from the stores are worth for grabbing especially the cosmetics.
A must in Seoul,"It's a wonderful shopping area with lots of shops selling fashion and cosmetics. There are restaurants, both indoor and outdoor, every here and there. Stalls are along the streets starting from late afternoon to late at night, selling wonderful snacks mostly. You can also find very good quality strawberries at very affordable prices. "
Good Street Food,Myeongdong Street Food is the best i have tasted in Asia. They even have cheese baked live scallop and lobster! The promegenate juice is delicious and healthy too!
Great food and shopping ,Go after 4pm and be hungry. Great choices for food and fun environment. Plenty of places to shop for mainstream and tourist stuff. Went back multiple times. 
Food food food!!! ,Went to this food street on our first night in Seoul! There were so many food choices. From salty to sweet myeongdong street will not disappoint. Fairly priced you can find many snacks to munch on as you explore. 
Lots of food,Great selection of street food. Reasonable prices. Some of the street vendors move from day to day so may look different the next day.
A fun food and street market,"The first street market I've ever seen that is set in the middle of high end shopping stores. But also the best street food I've ever had, and I'm a picky eater. They sell lobster, scallops(cooked with a blow torch!), steaks, chocolate covered strawberries, honey ice cream stuffed into a fish shaped pastry, the famous 32 cm high ice cream cones, fresh squeezed juices. The stalls go on for block after block in all directions. You can also get lots of souvenirs. I bought a nice souvenir t-shirt for only $6. Lots of restaurants, skin care shops, massages. We went here 3 times and had a blast every time."
Just another touristy shopping street,"Pricey street food, cheaper food elsewhere. Shopping is good as many streets and shops available. Beware of taking free masks as price is being pulled into shops for sales talk to buy more masks! "
Meongdong,"This is good for shopping and dining , but too crowded bec of the street food lining up the center of the main street! If only this could be placed on another street, will be less crowded, and much cleaner. The mask and skin care shops are too much like one brand can be seen every 500 meter walk; the store sellers speak good mandarin but poor english sad to say. "
Great place for shopping & food,There are so many brands of skin care and cosmetic products that you will be spoilt for choice. It's also a great place for food like the famous Korean fried chicken and BBQ meals.
Korea adventure ,"I love this place! Myeongdong is the fashion capital of Korea. If only I have enough space in my luggage I would have loved to do more shopping in this area. You can buy everything in myeongdong, from clothes to accessories to skin care and so on and so forth. It's simply amazing! "
Brand names and logos rule,"I really didn't see the ""so called bargains"" people spoke of. You either had over priced designer labels being purchased by people who were more concerned about the label than the quality or cheap stuff being sold in stalls that will fall apart after ne use. The primary shops are for skin creams and cosmetics. "
Shopping galore,A lot of information from all different directions. Shop all you want and eat street food as well. Prices can be quite expensive since its an obvious tourist trap but convenience is definitely there. 
Worth to visit but price will be cheaper elsewhere,Good time to kill time as a lot of things to buy though more expensive than other places.Have a lot of different food/snacks and also good place to exchange your monies at great exchange rate (can negotiate as well). 
Great range of shops,"Range of shops is the most interesting out of all the shopping areas. However, street food is more expensive. So for items that are pretty common, such as the egg bread and rice cakes, it's better to buy them at other areas like Hongdae instead where it's 500 won cheaper. However, Myeongdong offers other street food that other areas do not have to cater to tourists, such as seafood. And not forgetting, there's an innisfree / skinfood / nature republic / faceshop almost every corner you turn, so it's a great one-stop place to get all your beauty products."
Senior Deputy clerk,"This is a fantastic place. Endless shopping stores. We are on our 5th day and still many more shops to visit. No problem with not understanding the language a lot of local speak and understand English. A variety of everything you can imagine to shop for. Our Hotel 28 is in the very center of all the shopping stores. Jin, Jessi are excellent staff at Hotel 28 - Very helpful with providing directions and room service. Adien from Hotel 28 recommended lots of other attractions to tour as well. You also will not be hungry lots of food carts. An amazing place to tour and have your feel of the culture and the locals. The boutique shops are decorated very well and are inviting. Your feet walks right into the boutique without you realizing. Totally recommend the Myeongdong shopping street.Toni C."
Street food! ,"Went there twice in my 3 days there. Lots of street food, toiletries, small local restaurants and shopping."
Great shopping ,"Great for people watching as well as shopping! Lots of quaint tea houses and coffee shops! Many art galleries and street food vendors as well! Popular with young and old, families and singles! A must do while visiting Seoul!"
So much fun to do,Great to go around and just get lost in the midst of the vendors and tourists.Don't come too late though as Koreans are early birds so when we arrive here at 20:00 most of the vendors are already getting ready to close.
Vibrant exposure,"The travelled date was actually end March/ early April 2016. I was in Seoul for 12 days and stayed in Myeongdong area because it was convenient for transport to sightsee. The hotel I stayed in was only 10 minute walk from Myeongdeong street area where the real buzz starts from 5.00 pm till late. Bargains galore for quick souvenirs.....scarves, caps, pins/brooches, ........I love the socks, at AUD 1.00 per pair, great for souvenirs and they're quite good quality ( popular among locals too). Because this area is closed to traffic, many shops operate during the day too. Every other shop sells Korean beauty products. Clothing wise....don't bother if you're above size 12 ( I think that's Euro size 36 ??).However, it's the street stalls which draw the crowds. Grilled, fried, baked.....from ever favourite octopus/squids, pancakes, rice cakes in hot sauce ( I love the cheese ones) , sticks of fish cakes, etc. They're not as cheap as you think but prepare to pay around Aud 5 a 10 for any single serve. The large scallop, cooked in shell with toppings of corn, cheese...was imo most expensive at nearly AUD15. It was strawberry season and they're sweeter than sweet....must try (I ate about 2kgs over the entire stay). Boxes of dried peaches/persimmons were a little too marked up in price. Plenty of other outlets serving Korean, Japanese and some western. Money changers are aplenty here."
Better markets in Seoul,"Myeongdong is a busy but not so great shopping area in Seoul. Most of the shops are high end cosmetics shops and the rest are typical mall-type stores. There is street food, yes, but there is street food everywhere in Seoul and is better elsewhere. Check out Insadong, Bukchon Hanok, Dongdaemon, or the Hongik University area if you want to shop and eat among the crowds. Myeongdong, to me, feels more like a tourist invention."
Traditional shopping ,This area has a lot of gift shops and great selection of street food. Lots of things that catch young children's attention.
A great experience especially at night,With so much going on this is certainly an attack on the senses! Shopping and ratting galore! I even found a cat cafe here! 
street market ,"it was a nice street , nice cafe, nice market, every things was beautiful..don't miss visit this street..i love seoul"
Love love Myeongdong 💘,"A place with ambience and so many great choices for food whether it's morning or night. Great place to get the best rates for exchanging currency. Beauty products, clothes, street food, desserts, street entertainment and to get a feel of seoul! "
Love it,"I just love this street. It is full of life and everything you need and don't need. This trip was my 6th time to Korea and my second time to this street. First time was 7 years ago. Not that much have changed however I remember mostly the cosmetic shops from back then and that my suitcase was full off free samples from all the cosmetic shops that they give you when you enter and they let you keep it even if you don't buy anything. This time I felt there were clothes stores and everything of the latest fashion. I went in the morning and the streets were not so crowded as I had expected so that was nice. I was also impressed by seeing a 24 hour adidas shops. A real gem is a shop called Å. I forgot the full name but it has 4 floors with different things like clothes, bags, shoes and accessories. And even one vintage floor. Just love this shop and was glad to find it again. Myeongdong can easily be reached by subway. From there I used goodly map and walked to insadong. It was not far."
Shopping spot with so many street food,"In our last day in seoul, we visited this shopping area. This place famous for shopping, cafe and street food.We arrived at 5.30, intended to shop till you drop :) but my stomach wasn't so cooperative. After a few meter from the subway station, we met some food street outstretched the road. They sell traditional to modern food, from bbq to dessert with reasonable price.After happy tummy, we stroll along the area. In every 50 meter we found cosmetic store with a lot of brand. Korea is famous for that. You name it, they have it. Etude, faceshop, belif etc.If you want to see the nanta show, they have a theater there.But if you want to search for fashion, i suggest better shopping in hongik (young fashion) or dongdaemun market.This street open till pass midnite."
Get ready for the same stores everywhere!,"Unless you've been living under a rock, get ready for the same standard department stores/fast fashion store, and numerous beauty products stores around every corner, in between corners, and the same exact three on the next corner!It was fun to eat the street food (fresh Promogranite juice, so many different sweets, etc , and try out some of the cafes (Hello Kitty, Cat Cafe, etc). But, most of the department stores can be seen anywhere, and the beauty shop prices are very similar to most places in town. We got slightly better deals at innisfree, faceshop, etc at dongdaemun square"
Favorite Place to Shop,"You can find everything here at Meyongdong! From the latest fashion clothes, cosmetics, contact lens and international brand like Nike and Adidas. And don't forget to have some Korea famous street food while walking around the area! "
"Repetitive shops, highly crowded area","What to see:-make up and skincare products (some have 2 branches in the same area)-street food (most start early evening)- restaurants and coffee shops (mostly on the higher floors)-hotels in the area (but would you really like to stay in a crowded area?)-clothes, coats, jackets which are slightly expensive than the ones in Ewha Women's Fashion Street-tourists (like me. Hahaha!)"
Popular street,"It's a very popular with street food,and kosmetik store.It's not open 24 hour.when i go there,there start to close at 10.00pm"
Just ok ..,We have been to better market in terms of choices as well as bargaining with the vendors compared to this place. My personal view is that it was just average. Literally average!
Great for shopping and street food,"This is the place to visit if you're after Korean beauty and skincare. Definitely walk around a bit first before committing to buying in the first store you see as there's at least 3-4 of the same shop in that area. If you can't find a certain LE item in one place, go to another as you might find it there. There's also tons of other retail stores, plus it's worth exploring the little side streets as there's heaps of big brand knock-offs and fakes that are decent quality and inexpensive. My favourite store was the stationery brand Jetoy's Choo Choo cat. If you're into cats, you're going to love this store! The designs are amazing, and there's so much stationery and other adorable things to choose from! The street food vendors start popping up closer to late afternoon, just before evening if that's what you're interested in doing."
Heaven ,"Myeongdong is shopping heaven, either for the street food or skincare.. almost every night we had myeongdong streed food for dinner... variety of Halal food can be found such as egg bun, octopus, lobster, oemok or fish cake and daebokki to name a few... other vendor are selling souvenirs, t-shirt, bag to name a few... for the skin care... just name it all u can find here at myeongdong... they will gv free gift such as mask or sample size of product to allure u to enter their shop...just take the free gift n stroll along their shop, even u dont buy anything u can take the free gift... and if u buy they will give u more free gift... "
Amazing!,"We stayed at Hotel Shin Shin which was a 10 minute walk from the Myeongdong Shopping Street. We frequently visited the Myeongdong markets, which came alive at night time with the many food trucks. There's a lot of food to choose from and the shops were good too. "
Best place to shop!,Had to admit we kept coming back here to shop. Really nice place to shop till you drop. Definitely a must go if you want to do a lot of shopping. You can also buy delicious delicacies at the stalls along the shopping street when you are hungry. There are also halal food around. 
Shop til you drop...,We spent an afternoon here mainly for my wife. The place focuses mainly on skincare and makeup products but if you from a western country - you will find that it's probably cheaper to buy foreign brands at home than here. It's probably better value to get Korean brands that are both cheaper and not available in your country.Lately the crowds here have thinned due to Chinese sanctions on tour groups but its still fairly huddle and bussle.There are many street food carts lining the streets. The variety is good but prices are much higher than in the markets nearby (nandamen)Most stores you just need to buy 30k won and you will get immediate tax refund. Save the hassle at the airport!
Nothing Special,"First time there. However, nothing special. Is the same like in any country. Selling lots of local delicacies. Clothing is more expensive than those selling in any outlets."
Good to visit,Myeongdong is a very nice place to visit however there are not many things to buy. A visit is enough.
Perfect for shopping and eating,"Myeongdong street is your go-to place if you want to try their street food and if you wanna go shopping. There are a lot of stores that you can visit and buy stuff. Further, there are different restaurants you can indulge yourself with Korean food. As for me, this is my fave spot. You can encounter different nationality in this place."
Just Perfect!,"Its an every Woman's dream to be in one place for all their beauty, skin care and the what not. This place is like heaven on earth for Women. For the street food fanatics this street also will not disappoint. It has everything in one single place, its like a complete package."
Shopping and eating!,Myeongdong shopping street was a great place to spend a couple of hours to taste Korean street food and do some light shopping. The streets are very clean and a ton options on food. If your not into street food there are even more restaurants to choose from.
Shopping wonderland,"This place is known for their cosmetic shopping! Many options and duplicate vendors all over. Just make sure you bring your passport or a copy of it so you could get a Tax Refund Receipt at the airport. Try out their cat cafe too, the fuzzy creatures are adorable."
Heaven on earth - Myeongdong shopping street,Many many cosmetic stores which offer best price. Best products. And best brands. Heaven on earth for ladies.. prepare your wallet.. 
Shopping heaven for women,"Yes, it is a place to shop till you drop. Well, if you have much money then you can try shopping in Myeongdong. There are cosmetics, clothes, and others you can buy. Because there are so many cosmetics stores, then they offer various discounts for their products. Too bad, I do not wear cosmetics, so I am not interested in them."
The most touristic in Seoul,"It is across the street from our hotel, i loved it and visited nearly every day special at evening. Lots of shops cloths and lots lots of skin care shops i think all the Korean cosmetics brands have more than branch there. At 10:00 pm most shops close but the street food start from afternoon till after 12:00 am different kind of food snack seafood dessert and juices. Really It fun experience and it is must for anyone visiting Seoul. "
Best place to shop in Seoul,"We visit few recommended shopping areas and found Myeongdong to be it for us. It is a bit more expensive but it has a lot more shop and offer wider range. Having said that if you expect cheap it, this is not the place. Here you can shop till you dropped and that is what we did for few nights."
Make up Haven,The best place to get big big big discounts on all Korean beauty products!!! A true must visit especially for ladies and make up enthusiasts. They give away free samples too!
Massive shopping...,"...yet nothing I really wanted to buy. I was told ""if it's not in Myeongdong, it's not in Korea"". It gets a bit repetitive tending towards boring if you don't want to buy bags, hats, womens clothing or jewelery"
My fav !,You can find so many korean cosmetics stores here and actually korean food streets !! Soooo deliciousss !!But when in adidas store I can't found NMD shoes :(( thats happening now right ?!
the best makeup area,"i stay at seoul for 11days and i went there for 6times its heaven for makeup lovers. There are halal food. kebabs, bun & nutella crepe. "
Looked like a food street more than a shopping street,"Myeongdong was actually the most favourite shopping street of our family in Seoul! There was a lot of nice shops and restaurants around the area. The whole area, also, turned into vibrant and lively at night with hundreds of food stalls along the streets, so it might be looked like a food street rather than a shopping one."
Paradise ,I have never seen such a busy place ever. There are streets of shopping and crowds everywhere. There's restaurants and a variety of local and international brands of cosmetics and clothes . Many many skin care products to be found here. Shoppers paradise.
MyeongDong,The snacks in food stall are great though it is a bit expensive when compared to other places in Korea as being told by my friend. A place for shopping especially when you would like to have a walk on all the cosmetic shop of Korea! However you have to prepare there are many same brand shops. It may be a bored place for male travellers and boyfriends.I believe there are many restaurants with delicious food but too many people so I could not have a look on most of them. You could put this place at night and the last activity as many shops here closed late
I absolutely love this place!!,"I was only here a short time, what a pity!! It has amazing restaurants, stores, and shops. I didn't get to visit any, but I did try the street food and ohhh it was amazing!! Also, i went to the underground shopping area and I barely had time to stop by a huge kpop store where the CDs were cheaper than I had ever seen before while staying in chuncheon or in America. I am definitely going to explore this area more when I come back. I did visit the Myeongdong in Chuncheon so i imagine it is similar and I seriously love that Myeongdong!!"
Craziness!,"I loved this area! Lots of shops (many cosmetics shops), street Food and action. The Place to be in the evening in Seoul!"
Myeongdong Shopping Street,"Shopping district perfect for make up addicts and bargain hunters! You'll find a 5 story Uniqlo across the Pacific Hotel. Lots of shoe stores, ice cream trucks and food trucks. For bargain hunters there are many stalls selling different bargain items such as clothes, gadgets, souvenir items and much more. Vanity items are everywhere, coffee shops are all around too and when you feel hungry there are different restaurants from Korean to American and even Japanese food. "
The place for skincare products!,"Shops after shops of skincare products! We could also shop for other stuff such as apparel and souvenir too. A wide array of restaurants and cafes around each corner. In the evening the street transforms into a night market with lots of street food and stalls selling socks, bags, etc. "
Cheap buys,"Loved this shopping street. All sorts of things is here. Skin care, bags, shoes, dress. Everything! And its cheap too. ❤️"
Great for Tourist - Lots of Street Food,"What is good in this place is that beginning after lunch, the street becomes a pedestrian street which plenty of food stalls set ups. Great Street food!!! Good place to do window shop."
Shop Watching,"We wandered down this shopping area on our way back from Easter Mass @ The Cathedral on Easter Sunday Morning.Lots of little shops,bars,cafes & small service entities adorn Myeongdong Shopping Street.Sadly there were very few sales on,making a lot of goods quite expensive even by our standards in Australia.Myeongdong has its own Metro Station & is an enjoyable place to go shop watching & leave your purse/wallet in your pocket or purse.Interesting place,albeit would not go there by choice "
Oxford street of South Korea,This place is really hectic at all times of the day.Great for buying beauty products and has some nice restaurants near by.
Iconic street,"We stayed in Myeongdong area. It's a crowded and vibrant area, restaurants and street food cater to different needs, however, it does have a 'go-to-rest' time. Most shops, restaurants and all street food carts will closed for the day around 10-11pm. Most staff in shops and waitresses in restaurants can speak Mandarin & English. Expect street food to be tourist price. "
Discovery walks,"This was across the street from our hotel. We had so much fun trying the food. You could get lost around the streets but its easy to navigate. And in anycase, you can do a lot of people watching and make up shopping while waiting"
Quintessential tourist stop,Great place to sample local korean snacks although not super cheap street food prices. Pretty good vibes in the evening with the tourist & local crowds. 
Shopping Street in the old part of Seoul,"It is a busy shopping street for tourists and locals. There are plenty of restaurants to choose from, and at night time there is also street food available."
The place to go for all comestics stuff... some street vendors were quite rude though.,"We drop by this place 3 times in our trip mainly because it opens til later at night. Surprisingly... not beyond 9pm... as vendors and shops start to close their businesses. Crowded and can be overwhelming at times, and some vendors can be rather rude. Overall, still a must visit place when you are in Seoul."
The crowd!!,"It's rarely quiet in this famous street. Cosmetics lovers, fashion, shoes, to bags and everything in between will love this shopping paradise as it offers so many varieties, brands, and style. And those foodies also will enjoy the delicasies. The trends could be changing from time to time but you'll be sured to have fun and getting the tummy filled. During our visit, cheese lobster, scallop, prawns, chickens, candies, crepes are a huge thing. Around 7 yeard ago it's more like fear factor with crickets, worms, and all those critters. cosmetics wise, Korean brand are on the rise, their lipsticks are pigmented, their skincare has wide variety and they are creating their own line that are leading. Walking in this street could be challenging with the crowds and sellers offering people to buy or go to the stores, so embrace yourself. Carry only what's needed and always pays attention. We never experience crime like pickpockets or stuff like that but still, do be careful. Do visit the place around night as the food stalls comes by during that time. Or if you only wants to shops, day time is best as the streets is not yet flooded with those delicious stalls. "
Shopping Mecca,"Best place if you wanna hurdle for BB creams and other cosmetics! Plus, it has a gamut of food choices, international brands, street food, and anything you could ever wanna find in a shopping street,"
Lots of fun.,We spent hours strolling around the quaint little streets filled with lots of interesting people. Worth a visit.
Nice perestrian area,"Alot of shops, restaurants and street food. Most of the street food quite pricey, though. Very crowded. Quite a few cars coming to the pedestrian areas, very annoying."
Shop and eat!,"one of the interesting shopping places in Seoul.. Cosmetics being the highlight.. lot of street food, clean , loud but fun to walk.."
Best place in Seoul!,"All you need is here!!!!! Food, masks, massage, fashion stuffs. It's a total heaven but your wallets might suffer as there's too much temptations around. There's lots of legit massage parlours around (all located at 3/4th floors above the shops) with really good service too! A foot massage costs about 18,000 wons for 40minutes. Highly recommended to relieve your muscles. "
Always Something there to Buy,"We love shopping @ Myeongdong Street. The place is always alive. Very accessible and cheap. So many shoppers in and out of stores. And food stalls and carts lined up the street so you'll never get hungry. There are a lot of stuff to buy specially cosmetics at discounted prices. And there are always freebies given away.Every time we go to Seoul, we make sure to allot 1 day of shopping in Myeongdong."
Less Than Anticipated,Not much variety in shops. Mostly cater to skin and hair care and personal grooming products. Crowded with tourists. 
Shopping!,"Busy but fun place to check out and pick up some required Korean beauty products! And of course, check out the street food -- lobster, scallops, juices, yum!"
Shop Till U Drop... Then Eat.... Shopping Continue,"So many facial shop here.... Value for money.Of course with others too...Many eating place with wide choices.Street Foods start @ 4pm till 10 pm (Just a bit on the high side the price).Wow, can see mostly tourist from all countries.When in Korea, must visit here"
cosmetic heaven,"Myeongdong offers you everything!!! Delicious street food, super cheap quality cosmetic product, fine korean restaurant, trendy fashion store, to foot massages when you fell your foot is killing you but you still need those pairs of eye mask. Came here 3 times in my 6 days visit to south korea but havent managed to explore all areas and still hugely want to come back. Do ask for a tax return form because it was surprisingly easy to process my tax return at the airport. "
window shopping,"wasn't able to look around , everything lack of time & our korean friends have hard time parking and we can't let them wait so long coz they don't like shopping"
Shopping at its best,We went at this area weekend so it was a bit crowded with all the shoppers looking and buying assorted goods from cosmetics to other available stuff on the street.
Vast amount of shopping and street food,"The street has many many many ... shops (most of them ""make up"") you can find a lot of people around and shopping with good variety of restaurants and cafes. La calle tiene muchiiiiiisimas tiendas (la mayoría de maquillaje) puedes encontrar una zona con mucha gente y gran cantidad de opciones para comer y tomar café. "
Shop and Dine,"Tourist spot for Korean cosmetics and apparels. Nothing to worry about if you're tired from walking, hopping from one store to another as food stalls are everywhere at the middle of the road. Restaurants and fine dining are also abound. I always come back here for the Dakgalbi rice at Yoogane; great way to restore your energy after walking around the streets of Myeongdong. You can also choose to relax at Lotte mall and even watch a movie if you want to; they play english movies too!"
Shop till you drop ,This is the place you need to go to buy cosmetics and beauty products. It has the best brand of cosmetics. There's also good street food.
Beauty Products Haven,Myeongdong is a place not to miss. You can get everything and anything you need. Korean cosmetics brand easily accessible in just one street/area. From high end Korean cosmetics to pocket friendly ones. Things you need before buying is more arm power and deeper pockets. 
Shop shop shop ,"A famous area full of shops and restaurants. Nice to roam around. Most shops are cosmetics though that are all the same with different brands. At night, more food and stuff stalls are added on the street that made the area livelier. One visit is enough to explore this area. Subway stations are Myeongdong and Euljiro 1."
Crazy busy but fun! ,"This is the area if you want to shop till you drop. I was looking for gift ideas for all my family members and manage to get them all something. Lots of small gift shops, plenty of different food items, coffee shops, etc in this area. The crowds are plentiful but you can manage to get around. "
Local Eatery & Convenient,"It is great seeing typical localised shops with their localised merchandise, its even better when the money-changer exchange rate is higher than SG.Lots of buses that leads to places like Namsan Park, Palace and Square. Some parts of the streets are lined with white cherry blossom; its gorgeous and within reach from the bus-ride."
"Eat, Shop, Walk and Explore","Our hotel was right here and there were rarely any dull moments. From the shops, the food carts that are out as soon as the afternoon to late at night, the droves of people and the whole culture in itself is an experience. Try to book a hotel in the area, you wont be disappointed."
Happening and good to shop,"We stayed at Jhill Hotel just in front of the Main Street of Myeongdong.Everyone knows that this is a shopping street, and there are lots of food hawkers around.Once you arrive myeongdong, the first thing u should do is find the information center or the person who wearing red hat and red clothes standing in the middle of the street to get a myeongdong map! (You will feel easy to and manage to plan which direction to first and next).Here got lots of women's things, like clothes, accessory, cosmetic and facial shop.This is the third time I visit myeongdong, there is one thing difference if compare to last visited, the hawkers now not willing to bargain(not even one cent), I don't know what happen to them. Seems they earn a lot and doesn't bother. But still some will discount abit, for those who not willing to bargain we will just skip them. Everyone do know those hawker mark up margin for sure over 100%, and they have not willing to give us just little discount.For dinner, we are having Korean style all you can eat! Very cheap, you should look around the sign board, once you visit there you should try their BBQ all you can eat.(I'm sorry to Muslim friends, for those all you can eat restaurant, they do serve pork, Because the cost for pork more cheaper than beef)My sister do like their grill cheese and rice cake(food hawker), you should try it when u see it, and they also have fresh juice blended on the spot(strawberry) and so on, make sure you bring enough Korean Won to enjoy their local food. ^^The local fast food named: Mom's Touch is so delicious if compare to our home country KFC fast food. You can have cheese onion flavour or curry spicy flavour friend chicken(yummy).Myeongdong street connected with two subway station, Eurolji1ga station and Myeongdong station, its very convenience to come or go to other places.Wish you enjoy your holidays in Seoul."
beauty stuff galore,"there are several pedestrianised streets and alleyways selling all sorts of beauty products. some of the smaller ones will have their staff give away product samples (mostly face mask) to entice you to look around inside their store. take note that the more popular ones (innisfree, laneige, etc) do not give free samples. "
Korean pop culture,"This is the ultimate place to be for shopping, dining and just immersing to the Korean pop culture. It tends to be very crowded at night especially on Friday nights. "
Fun experience!,"Beauty shops galore! This is a fun experience while in Seoul, just walking around and seeing the madness of shops (mostly beauty/skincare). If you want to buy stuff make sure you do a bit of research beforehand and most sales people don't speak any English and all the packaging is in Korean! I enjoyed banila and co, tonymoly, and nature republic. Have fun! "
Shopping Heaven for the ladies.,Most amazing shopping place ever. It's not a joke when they said you can lost your way here. Place is big with many cafes and cosmetic shops.Remarks - Bring a leash for your girlfriend. 
Busy shopping area,"Myeongdong is very packed with people. It is the place to look for Korean skincare and cosmetic products. Shop assistants will always try to lure you into their shops by giving away free sheet masks. This is also the place to buy the famous Korean socks. You can find a variety of street food here as well. My personal favourite is the deep fried twisted potato. Overall, this is a great place for shopaholics."
Highly Recommended!,"Myeongdong Shopping Street market is the place you can find everything 'under one roof' sans The Roof :). As an avid traveller, it is a good sign to know that even the locals shop there. Food-stalls, restaurants (burgers, Thai, steamboat, etc), fashion, cosmetics, shoes, the list goes on. The ambience at night got me excited, even if you are not a keen shopper, you can just have coffee and people-watch. "
Perfect ,The street food and shopping are amazing. Would recommend people to check this place out. I have really enjoyed the street food. 
Affordable price,"Very happening starting from 5 till morning, love ❤️ them street food , & affordable price, for sure we will be back"
Very Korean (in both a good and bad way),"This district is THE shopping area of Seoul. There are many different shops with different price ranges. You can mainly find a lot of (Korean) cosmetic shops here. I personally loved shopping here. The only real downside is that the helpers in the shops keep walking up to you and they don't leave you alone. I felt quite uncomfortable a few times. Despite the awkwardness, I will come back when I visit Seoul. "
City with life,"From apparels, makeup to food, this part of Seoul is not to be missed. It is always bustling with life and full of surprises. The MCM boutique is a must visit if you don't want to be disappointed by the lack of items in the latest collection. Stylenanda's Pink Hotel boutique offers a different view of shopping experience with different theme on each floor, and mostly clad in pink! The street comes alive in the evening with food stalls on carts. if you run out of luggage space, there are shops readily available to see to your needs. Tired legs? The streets are clad with cafeterias and restaurants perfect to rest your feet and fill your hungry stomach. "
My first time in Myeongdong shopping streets,"First time in Myeongdong....lots of face, body and hair products. Enjoy the street food....but it's surely more pricey than local food market. Nice cool weather today for walk along shops in Myeongdong "
Heaven for beauty shoppers,There is really no other place quite like this! Its def worth checking out during the day and the evening. As its very different. Lots of great korean beauty products on offer. 
Night Shopping,"The street shopping starts at 5pm. You can reach there early to shop on the front shop and follow up with the street shopping. As usual, the shop are usually cosmetics and street stalls are more on foods. "
Meongdong!!!!,"Meongdong is one of the most visited streets in korea. I see many foreigners here, and everyone seems to be enjoying this place. This is one of the must visit places in korea!!!! Highly recomend it!!!!!!"
Shopping street for girls who like facial products,This is a shopping streets for girls. 80% of the retail shops are meant for girls. Alot of restaurants and street food stalls around. So you wont feel hungry. It is very packed in the night time. 1 to 2 days should be good enough unless you want see every single shop products. Alot of repeated stores in this shopping streets. 
FUN!!!!,The street food were awesome!!! Freebies are good too!! It was fun to go to Myeongdong. It was like Hong Kong!
Very busy and people like directing you to their shops.,"Been here many times, the street food are good and many options. There are lots of cosmetic shops and the sales like directing you inside. The street is packed all the time and very touristic. It's worthy to visit for first time tourists coz you can find all the Korean cosmetic shops there, plus some fashion brands, a good place for shopping."
Fun shopping street,"My daughter and I had a great time shopping here. She loves Korean cosmetics and they have it all. Late in the afternoon , all of the food vendors come out . Lots of delicious snacks and drinks. "
Who can resists Myeongdong Shopping Street??,"I stayed nearby Myeongdong station exit 4 and every night this is my favourite spot. It is very lively but not as crowded, you can still enjoy the lovely atmosphere here. There are plenty of shops/ stalls where you can shop and eat. You can try all sort of famous korean street food here. Famous cosmetic brands are available every corner in myeongdong street."
Everything ,Huge shopping mall with every designer label you can think of. Food court on lower floor and food was good with huge selection. Just point if you think know they don't understand but I ordered spicy prawns with rice and it was excellent. If you go at the weekend though be warned it is very busy 
"Free Hanbok Experience,,great","At Seoul Global Center,they offer free hanbok get ups, plus interesting workshops .Next visit,will check their schedules as it is not only shopping but learning new arts and crafts ..."
Myeongdong by night,"This is the place to sample street food, the ones you don't normally find in your hometown, its not cheap but what the heck, you're on holiday & you want to give it a try. Shopping is the other magnet here, you'll find all the international brands plus some local ones, especially in cosmetics. Its something akin to Osaka's Dotonburi. Overall well worth a visit."
The most lively place in Seoul,"Just like what you have read or heard. It is the busiest district, filled with shops, stalls and restaurants. Go there hungry and try all the Korean famous street foods for average of KWR 30/dish. Probably too squishy for little children. Not so stroller friendly as the place is often packed with tourists. "
Shopping galore,"Myeongsont Shopping Street is a good place for, well, shopping. There is a hotel that sits around the district & what our Filipino community recommends is to stay there, we opted not to because we knew that there will be a lot of people.I gave it a 4 star is because we were able to go to a place were there is less people & have the same shops so to me, it's just the hype."
Cosmetic/shopping haven,Truly a cosmetic and shopping haven. :) interesting finds at discounted prices with freebies. I look forward to going to Seoul because of Myeongdong experience
Shopping and eating for all,"Well known for their beauty shops, in fact a bit too much of in your face selling. Shoving masks in your hand , left right and.center. Apart from that, plenty of delicious food, cafe's of all types and night street food. Must go and stay place."
Great vibes!!,"This is a great place for shopoholics and for people who savour street food. Most of the food vendors put up there stalls post 5 pm , so if you are visiting the street post 5pm you will find great food options with amazing vibe all over the area. Its definitely worth visiting once for shopping and interesting food vendors."
A must-do experience,"So much shops, and street food. One can collect face masks by just going inside beauty shops. Although prices are not really that cheap as buying them online, it is still one of the highlights of our Seoul trip."
Bargain hunters paradise,"This is a great place to experience a real ""open market"". Endless vendors for clothing, souvenirs and food. Shop where the locals shop!"
Huge,"A branded shopping area.. very commercialized and full of tourist.Many branded products and a sea of beauty shops. you can get good street food here too,A must place to go if your are a tourist."
A place for street food,My 2nd visit and yes lesser Chinese but more Indonesian and Vietnam people. Otherwise lesser crowded now and thus easier to shop
Shooooooping,"Shopping, shopping and shopping. The main street is crowded with food stalls and each corner leads to yet another shop. Recommend a walk around even if you're not up for shopping just to get a feel of the shopping craziness."
"Shop, Walk, Eat, Happy","Thriving shopping street in Seoul. Lots to see, lots to buy, lots to eat. My personal favorite shops are Stylenanda a boutique fashioned in the style of hotel, Aland a boutique selling fashionable clothes by local designers - but the decor is interesting - with worn & torn leather chairs, old luggages, really old radios & more. Go see for yourself if you are in Myeondong"
Shopping place for young people,"Young people would like this place as it has lots of shops catered for them. Food is readily available too. It feels like Ximending of Taipei. There are many restaurants and street food but the street food aren't cheap. Clothes are also not the cheapest here. I personally feel clothes are cheaper in subway basements where most things go for 10000won. Here they may cost about 20 to 50% more.Still, a must visit for anyone visiting Seoul for the first time."
So much to do!!!! ,"One of the highlights of my trip. Myeongdong is packed with stores, stalls, and delicious street food!!! It has a lot of alleys with stunning neon lights at night. Make sure to allot at least 3-4 here because there's just so much to do!! "
Hub of shopping,"This is a must see when traveling in Korea. So many stores foreign and local with a great feel to the Korean culture around beauty, shopping, and kitchy little Korean glam. "
Don't miss it!,"You can find everything here, cosmetics, clothes, footwears, CD store, Daiso, money exchange, Korean spa, a lot of restaurants. If you come in the evening, there are a lot of street stalls selling food, bags, scarves, mobile phone cases, etc. that attract a lot of people."
Shopping and food!!!,For cosmetics lovers this is the place for you!! There are also a lot of nice delicious street foods!!! The push carts will start around 5pm till late. The foods are a MUST TRY!!! There are plenty choices of halal foods too!! 
Bustling with energy!,"Interesting market. Has good shops on both sides of the streets, and vendors in the middle of the streets. Very energetic. Vendors range from those selling socks and battery operated children's toys to food carts with the preparation of foods in full view, be it pomegranate juice or potato chip skewer. One particular attraction was a lady adding simple sugar in a small bowl and stirring it over a bunsen burner and converting it to candy..a big hit with children. Another area with long lines was a soft icecream vendor. His attraction was a cone of icecream that was 32 cm. high. No kidding! Lots of interesting vendors and lots of crowds and high energy. Loved it! A must visit market!"
Everything you want,"You can buy everything here, cosmetics, great street food, clothes, exchange your money. It's crowdy, specially during weekends, but worth visiting."
You have to go,"If you like shopping or not, just go. you will end up buying something even if it is street food which is awesome!"
Family Shopping,My family and I visited this shopping district and we had a wonderful time out. We found great deals and hidden gems.
croweded with people......,"for those ""shopperholic"", this is the place for you........there are too many facial/mask or Korean brands shops at this location......"
Shopping Paradise,"Great place for shoppers whereby you can shop till you drop!! Plenty of cosmetics, clothings, shoes etc to choose. However, most brand shops are duplicate. Restaurants are also pretty easy to find."
Great shopping streets,U can spend the whole day here shopping and eating.. whole stretch of beauty product shops as well as restaurants to go to n not forgetting start food.. 
Excellent Place for Shopping and Street Food,"We had fun shopping at Myeongdong Shopping street, especially the street food. Excellent choices from Angus Beef Slices, Cheesy Butter Scallop, Chicken Korean Style, to Fresh Fruit Juices. Enjoyed every minute of the tour. Well recommended esp to foodies"
crowded and average service,"This is my second time to be here and i will be here again because my friends never been to Seoul before.This place is full of clothes-selling shops, eateries and massage shop. I dislike to be here because it is so crowded and the average service attitudes.It is easy to get lost here, since many alley and not much public toilets available"
On the list,"Nice to visit and experience locals, food and items that can be brought home. Recommended stop after visiting serious stuff "
My first time in Seoul,"Very crowded, a lot of street food, a lot of vendors, and a lot of stores for clothing and cosmetics. It is a great tourist spot for shopping and food, a little to crowded for my liking but still a good and seems to be a safe spot to visit. "
"Eat, Eat, Eat","If you looking for street food, this is the right place to go because street food everywhere in here and not just street food u can buy cosmetics in here too."
Staffs know mandarin but not friendly,"I like to shop in myeongdong but most of the staffs were not friendly. They know how to speak in multi languages like mandarin, Japanese, english etc. They are very aggressive but they didn't listen to what you need. However there are few shops with nice staffs too but can be counted using one hand."
 Very commercial,Busy part of town and ok if you like chain stores/ high end shopping. Plenty of food available usually at inflated prices. I lived Seoul but this was not my favourite part. 
Mix of high end shops and bargains ,"Arrived at 9pm on a Friday and it was packed. Vast area with brand name stores that you see on 5th Ave, but also small bargain shops and street vendors. "
5th Avenue in Korea,"We enjoyed window shopping in this area, but really didn't too high end for us. We did enjoy a nice lunch in the food court in the basement of the Lotte Department store. Lot's of good items to choose from."
Shopping while in Seoul,"Taking a break from work, we decided to go shopping. Lots of nice local stuff and some traditional retailers. But, it would help to speak Korean to get the real deals. We felt like being American was a disadvantage. The jewelry was nice and there was some negotiating starting at 30% off and going as far as 35, but it still seemed high."
My day trip to Seoul,"This was one of the best parts of my trip. I took the blue line Subway and changed to the 4 line and went shopping. This place has many many makeup stores and discounted prices. In the evening or late after noon there are food vendors set up all along the streets. There are also great restaurants on the side streets. There are department stores as well as boutiques. I am large compared to the locals but I found a sweater coat, a shirt as well as face masks, eyebrow pencils, lipsticks that would go well with my dark skin color also. It was just great. I went back three times during my time in South Korea. "
COSMETIC HEAVEN,"Out of four days in Seoul, we spent two straight days here. And I mean all day. Save yourself some time by doing some homework of which products or at least brands you want to try or purchase. If not, you'll be spending hours here just walking in and out of every store. Each major brand will have at least 5-8 branches within a few block radius so don't sweat if you changed your mind. Feel free to go in and try and ask questions. The staff are quite incredible almost everywhere. Multi lingual and really helpful. The street vendors sell great stuff too at incredible cheap prices. However. Don't forget to haggle! (Not with the food vendors) "
expensive stores good street food,"Myeongdong Street market is a lot like an outdoor mall. It had all the big, brand name stores like Forever 21 and Zara. In my opinion, it was a little bit of a let down to learn that the street vendors, including the street food, didn't come out until night time. But it's certainly a good area to walk through, though I would not say its cheaper in Korea if you're shopping at the brand name stores."
"Hustle and bustle, but delicious!","Visited the street with two young (and fussy) eaters at around 7pm at night and must have gained 4lb in weight!?Gorged ourselves on dumplings, Korean fried chicken, grilled steak, spiral potatoes, cheesey hash brown type things, strawberries and honey goldfish ice creams.Fresh, affordable and delicious.The subway is nearby, taxis are cheap and easy to find and if you need help there is a tourist police office in the middle and at the end of the street"
Myeongdong items were too pricey,"It's a shopping haven for shopaholic like Me. But I've been to nandaemun and got the chance to compare it with the items sold here. Imagine 1 pack of strawberries in namdaemun costs only 2,000KRW while in Myeongdong they were selling it for 5,000KRW. Some of the vendors don't even give you discounts. My sister wanted to buy those Korean Hats that were sold along the streets of Myeongdong. The vendor said its 50,000KRW. We were in awe because the original Baseball caps were only sold 39,000KRW at Lotte World Mall. Anyways, this place is fantastic for those picture perfect areas.. But if you want to save than splurge more than what you're budget then I suggest you consider Namdaemun instead of Myeongdong. "
Wow. what a place,you can shop for anything over here. Best known for make up things .A few big Shopping Mall caters for all need
"interesting place to shop, especially for the ladies.","A very big place to shop, dine and drink coffee to relax. Especially for the ladies. Alot of cosmetic shop to get all your facial and bodies needs. Basically, i like the street food compare to the restaurant."
"Great Street Food, Tons of Shopping","Came here for the Nanta Show and loved all the great street food! My favorites were the mandoo (dumplings) and spicy beef meatballs. Lots of shopping, especially of beauty products. Easy to get disoriented since the same shop will be in 3 or more locations, so you may want to stop by the tourist information area to get a map that shows the names of all the stores on it. There are also 3 movie theaters in this area."
Favorite food area!,"I LOVED walking in this area and checking out the numerous food vendors. I enjoyed it so much I returned for a second visit! It is fun to slowly browse and scope out the available foods. There were guides there to answer tourists' questions. I was not interested in shopping for other items, but there were numerous stores for those that are looking to make some purchases."
awesome!,"so much fun here, ate to much, drink to much!, bought to much!.....lobsters, abalones, hot dogs, juices, etc etc"
Excellent for crazy cosmetic shoppers,"The cosmetics there doesn't stick in one price and the prices are negotiable. They even gave us free gifts and extra samples. Tax rebate is up to certain amount. Besides shopping, there are nice street food everywhere too! Don't forget to try the caramel sugar! "
Super packed & fun,"Can be overwhelming but is a must see - great for shopping, especially for skin products. At night the food stalls start selling all kinds of street food. "
"Its all about street food, skincare, cosmetics, and buy 1 get 1","Its SUPERB and PERFECT for both men and women. While your ladies are going crazy to shop their buy 1 get 1 sheet mask and stuff, you can just go grab a baked cheese scallop or tteokpokki and etc. Its just crazy in Myeongdong. The street food taste sooooo amazing, and so many unique and tempting snack too..ahh.. i would love to go back to korea soon..very soon hopefully.."
Shop till you drop,"You can probably find everything in Myeongdong area, we had lunch, shopping, dinner and more shopping there! You will definitely need to bargain for price with Street vendors!! We got ripped off on those seaweed snacks and found much cheaper ones in supermarket nearby! But it was a lot of fun trying street foods from those vendor stores! "
Touristy,"It's a very touristy place and I can understand why as it has it all! I can say that 90% of K beauty products has their store at Myeongdong, the only difference is the promotion might be different from store to store at different location and the samples they are giving are lesser. I still don't think is a major issue since I'm not paying for the samples but for the product I purchase so not a problem to the later. The food stall is a little overrated and it's not cheap but for first timer I still think you should try.Now, for stalls on the street selling bags, socks, etc. I don't recommend you buy at myeongdong, it is so much cheaper to get it from Underground shopping, the one that I found it good is Gangnam Underground shopping. E.g. I bought laptop bag for KRW10k at Gangnam underground shopping but Myeongdong selling at KRW15K."
Good street food,Yes this street is renowned for its shops that sell beauty products but we really have to talk about the great street food available on the weekends. Go around late afternoon when all the stalls have set up for the evening.
"Like Black Friday, if it didn't suck","Myeongdong was an absolute madhouse and I enjoyed every second of it. We did very little actual shopping here but visited three times just for the fun of it. At night, the main street had a couple dozen food stalls. I tried about five of them one night and they were all delicious. If nothing else, you've got to come here to experience the mass of humanity and light and sound."
Paradise for Beauty Product Lovers,I super love the place! We came here three times during our stay at Seoul. If you love beauty products this is the place to go. There also a lot of street food to try and also boutique shops and all. We also got our souvenirs bought here. A must go place in Seoul.
Must visit shopping area and street food,"Lots of things are happening on this street. Will take you more than 3 hours, luckily I chose this neighborhood to stay. You can get any kind of Korean cosmetic and make-up products, international fashion brands, local fashion brands, local mom and pop shops, street food (only in evening) and duty-free shops. I found the best food gem to be the local places upstairs or in the basement. I had the best Korean fried chicken there. During christmas time, tons of christmas lights on the buildings and nearby parks."
Always my favourite place in Seoul,"Myeongdong is THE place to be when one visits Seoul. You cannot leave Seoul without coming here for the shopping and the food. We stayed at the Ibis Ambassador Myeongdong so we had access to Myeongdong shopping street right at our doorstep. The street is very vibrant and filled with pushcarts selling typical Korean street foods, tons of cosmetic shops and connects people to many shopping malls and shops that especially appeal to shoppers who wants to buy fashionable and trendy goods. It is a very self-contained street where there are activities for everyone - shops for shopaholics, nice eateries and restaurants for foodies and massage/spas and cafes for the people who wait around for their shopaholic/foodie friends. If you can find the time, you can even take a break from shopping to watch the famous highly popular Nanta show at the Myeongdong Theatre just next to the Myeongdong police station. Serious shoppers will be glad to know that there are many Tax Refunds kiosks and counters located within Myeongdong street so you can conveniently settle your tax refund for all your shopping without doing this at the airport. "
TRADITIONAL KOREAN MARKET,"A nice walk in market for buying traditional Korean stuff from Ginseng, cosmetics, traditional bags and a lot of other typical stuff."
crowded but nice,"a must place for you to shop a nice, cheap things in Seoul..there are hundreds of shop and few shopping malls around myengdong..we enjoyed the street snack there..for moslems.. don""t bother to ask before you buy..."
Happening street. Must visit. ,A lot of street food in the evening and shops to visit. Very convenient as it is located near a lot other places of attractions. 
Shopping & food haven,"This street is alive 24 hours a day ,different delicious food stalls , offering all kinds of food, prices are a bit expensive which is understandable Shopping is every whereThis street is the place to be"
Great prices for local products!,"A must visit for souvenirs, local food and entertainment! Products are fairly priced and some vendors encourage a lower price from competitive rivals! A haggler's haven!"
A lot of good deals ,Whole street is full of Korean cosmetics. Sales people are friendly and always give out free goods. Opens til midnight. 
"Good Street Food, Nothing More. ","For one of the most visited destinations in Seoul, I found this place to be pretty disappointing. The street food and carts are what carry it, any other kind if shopping is the same as you would get anywhere else... "
Fun place to shop around,"Lots of cosmetic stores, Korean brand stores and some fun malls. I recommend going in the later afternoon when the food vendors set up and you can snack your way around as you shop. "
Hussle and a bussle for your next bargain,"The buzz of this place esp. in the afternoon when the street food vendors bring their offers, is electrifying. Shop assistants will give you free samples to get you in their shops and spend your money on face mask, fancy clothes and shoes or bags. When you're hungry you simply stop halfway of the street width at nearest vendor for variety of treats or get a green tea latte from a regular coffeshop snd you are good to continue. Shop, shop, shop. "
12000 steps easy.!!!,"If your a shopper it's great ! First time visitors is a must, good products and famous shopping district.Good to explore if your into these kinda things but as you walk around the streets a bit more the shops get repetitive - same shop same brands same products, probably each shop you will see more than 15 times..You might even see the same people hahaTruman Show alike.For the Bloggers it is not similar to Orchard, Pitt Street, Bourke Street or even KLCC - it's original in its own sense.( sorry read too many blogs and it kept saying it's Orchard and CWB)"
Crowds and Shops,"If you are looking for a traditional Korean market, this isn't it. This is a very commercialised area, very, very crowded, with many chain stores. No low prices. It's fun to look around, but is you want deals, go elsewhere. If crowds, loud noises and rude, pushy people bother you, don't go here!Best thing about this place is the street food, and there are some very good local and western restaurants."
Not too much fun.,"Very busy shopping area. Lots of small inexpensive stores. Dirty, noise, overcrowded. Not much fun, don't lose your time"
best for Indian people looking for winter jackets,"this place is like Tank Road market in delhi india, you can shop so much that it would be difficult to take it back to india, i have purchased 12 winter jackets for family/friends from this market and nearby spots"
Nice food,Food is good. But people behave like from the Middle Ages. Korean ladies pushing their way through and even manhandle passerby just to get through
Very touristy place,"I heard from a local that Koreans don't go there anymore since it has become very touristy place and prices had gone up dramatically.Still I went there, only to find he was right. The street feels like a show for tourist with shops and food street but not a real local place like Hongdae for example. It is very crowded and big but with not soul. Only places which are interesting are the Lotte department store, the Lotte young plaza and the big Uniqlo branch (which doesn't have XXL for men at all, so if you're a big guy, forget about it)"
Myeongdong!,Alive and bustling. Truly a visual treat for the senses. Cosmetics and skincare mecca for anyone who is looking to stock up. Plenty of shopping and eating places as well as hotels. Gets very crowded on weekends but all is good. People/vendors are polite and making their way to places they want to go without pushing or shoving despite it being crowded.
Thousands of shops!,"This is the place for beauty product lovers! My wife had a blast at Myeongdong, and our hotel was strategically located here as well. Shopping all day and lots of restaurants around for sustenance in between. If you are a foreigner, bring your passport for duty free discount."
Shop for Beauty Products,"If shopping is your thing, then this is a good place for you. Rows and rows of shop selling beauty products and a lot of street food around as well. Some brands are repetitive though. Definitely recommend for those who loves cosmetic and beauty product ,you will be spoil with so many choices."
Lots of the same stuff repeated,"Was excited to see all the street food stands until I walked around for awhile and saw that they were all repeated several times. Same with the street vendors for like hats, etc. Otherwise, it's mainly cosmetics and some clothing stores and not that exciting."
Myeongdong shopping,This is a great place to buy Korean cosmetics as all of the shops are in one place and they seem to repeat on every block. There is also some great street food and restaurants to eat at along the way. Lots of great shops and interesting things to buy.It gets very busy so be prepare for some crowds.Try the Hotteok! :)
Have Fun Shopping,"Felt like they have thousands of shops just selling cosmetic...plenty of restaurant to choose from...if you are not a shopper, just go there and look at the foot traffic - can see all kinds of people..."
Shopping beauty products ,"Wow! If your intention is to shop beauty products, this is the place. All along the street, it's difficult to decide in which one to buy. Walk also through the little streets on the corners, you might find some different things."
You feel the city's life,In this street you will find finger food restaurants bars and lots of stores playing k-pop music You feel like you share this special culture in this street which get animated at the sundown No need to spend too much time though if you don't like crowded places 
Shop and then shop some more,"So many shops for make up, cosmetics, accessories, eateries (at night), restaurants during the day, shoes, etc. "
Heart of Seoul,If you are in Seoul try to take a stroll through the thoroughfares of Myeongdong. This part of Seoul is bustling with life and is busy throughout the day. Main attractions are it's shops and the array of different restaurant and open air food stalls
South Korea on one street,"All of South Korea's major retailers and products are found in and around this bustling street. With clean hawker street food and clean brightly lit shops, the street almost feels akin to a theme park with an lively ambience. "
A must to see in Seoul ,This place has many shops and many food street stalls.. the food is very delicious and the variety is very good.Highly recommended. . I think islts the heart of Seoul. .Ps. Take cash with u as all stalls dont have credit card machines.. Many things are irresistible to buy.. Most of those shops close by 10 30 PM .. so plan well .
Shoppingggg for young generation,"Just prepare your Korean won and walk along the street. If you have nothing to buy ,just enjoy the food. From Halal Kebab right up to the lobster cooked with cheese. Oh man...it is soo delicious. "
Bussy bussy bussy,This place is busy all the time. But it is really worth the walk an experience. They have all type of shops and restaurants at night time they havr food venders. 
Beauty products and food street,"I have heard about this place from so many people and finally i make it here myself. There were lots of China tourist filled up most of the shops.... prices are no longer as attractive due to all these over demand, We can now buy the products online from the Korean retailer at cheaper price and send right to your door step."
This is where you'll feel alive!,"Clothes, souvenirs, cafes, restaurants, cosmetic and skin care products (endless of them), this place is always bustling from the moment the shutters are up all the way till 11pm when most of the street hawkers retire the night! The things to look at and the temptation to empty your money pouch is endless, so please bring enough cash (or a credit card) if you want to take a stroll down Myeongdong!You will see all sort of people and all sort of stores opened in this stretch and it reminds me of Taipei's very own Ximending shopping street but Myeongdong is in my opinion twice bigger, cleaner and very much more vibrant.Take the exit 6 or 7 at Myeongdong station and you'll be here in no time!This place is also friendly to muslim travellers with abundance of Halal food establishments - so eating in Seoul is really not a problem!"
Fun wandering,"I simply adore outdoor market. Whether you are a big shopper at heart or you just want to window shop, this is a place to experience. I ended up with more stuff than I intended to get, but it was so fun. The Asian side of me enjoyed bargaining; and teasing of the vendors. One shop owner ended up giving me lots of extra 'samples'; and sent me off with ""I love you"" after I bit him farewell with 'Happy New Year'. On the eating side, I watched two guys made a fresh fish cake stick a size of my arm; and resolved to try one. I would say that if my stomach is tribble size in capacity, I probably would be eating all evening walking around there. It is simply entertaining just to see all the different street food. If you are a foodie, go nuts!"
Good atmosphere to soak in!,"Many many brands (mostly cosmetics) along the street and many interesting street food. As a muslim traveller, I was very happy to have found a few halal stalls and 1 restaurant which provided halal dishes. The duty free mall and underground shopping centre are also worth visiting!"
Shopping Street with everything,Nice shopping streets and side lanes offered good bargin beauty products and delicious street food and good restaurants. At the end of the main shopping street are Lotte Departmental Store and plenty of Duty Free Shops that you could spend whole day there.IT is a MUST visit when you go to Seoul.Highly recommended !
Shop and eat,"You can buy clothes, toys, souvenirs, food, perfumes, cosmetics beauty products (very popular) and have very good moments.Don't forget to try fried seafood."
Night walk in a typical modern Asian outdoor market,I took my family to Seoul for a long weekend and I wanted them to experience a outdoor market. Considering my daughter isn't quite ready to go native we went to the Myeongdong market. The kids enjoyed the banana crunch crape and they were exited to experience the energy.Getting around Seoul by subway is easy. We let our daughter figure out how to get there and she did very well. Being outside in March is a little cool temperature wise so dress warm.
Brimming w street foods n pushcarts,"A must see!!! U get to taste the different street foods all in one straight lane. Pushcarts selling all sorts of Korean touristy snacks like seaweeds, flavored almonds, Korean strawberries etc n socks that are selling for KRW1000 = SGD1.25!! Really good quality. Shops lining the sides are usually cosmetic shops, fashion apparels n restaurants. We stayed in myeongdong n were super happy that these conveniences are within arms reach to our hotel. We were never hungry "
Shopping and dining ,Shopping paradise for ladies. Lot of cosmetic shops with offers. Lot of must try street food stalls. Also other restaurants like cat-cafe and dog-cafe are there. Interesting visit. 
Beauty product and street food,"You can get different type of face mask in this area. Go for the better one like innisfree, natural republic etc... tourist can ask for tax refund. All sorts of street food available if you are hungry after a long day walk. Range from 2,000 won for egg bread to 15,000 won for lobster bbq. "
Fantastic area to base yourself in or visit,"I chose to stay in Myeongdong due to the night markets, which were fantastic. A huge variety of food available to try in small portions, all between 300-500Won. No one hassles you for anything, its not like thailand or china, all very polite and civilised. "
"Nice food, a loooott make up store, crowded street","a lot of street food can be chosen, from sweet to saviour. A lot of make up store is available. Try to avoid this street when peak time (i think when people got back home from work)."
Your Shopping and Food Paradise!,"Plenty of Cosmetic Shops, but some branded keep repeat be themselves along the streets. Plenty of food stalls and restaurants as well, price is on the high side if compare to other places.Well, enjoy the environment, would be back if bringing first timer."
Shop some local cosmetics ,"As KOREANS are well kwonn with their pristine face skins, here is to find out how they make that.A chic place to do shoppings or even just to spend some time enjoying the environement.The street foods are great. Try and share 2 or 3 foods with your travelling mates"
must visit when in seoul,"crowded in most evening and shopping heaven for the ladies. As for me, i cant get enough of the street food and that is why i keep going back to myeongdong."
Very crowded,"Very crowded place. You can easily get lost. Tourissm information bureau, in middle of Namdaemun street, is helpful. Difficult to find English speaking Koreans. But worth to visit and watch people and enjoy atmosphere. Visited alpha store nearby. It is a real heaven for handcrafters."
"Fun, busy intense",Loved it all especially the street food and cute stuff! Overload of cuteness I. Korea. Lots of coffe shops made it a great place to wander and rest in no particular order.
Korean cosmetic mecca!,"This street is full of Korean cosmetic leading brands. Several shops fir the same brand in a row. I don't use make up; but I am fond of skin care products. On purchase of 35,000 Wong the shipping becomes tax free. Innisfree and Lotte duty free refund tax in the store. All other stores provide a coupon that can be claimed at the airport. I could find all korean brand outlets. Tonymoly was only available in Lotte duty free 11F. Nature republic had but 1 get one free offer so was a good buy!"
A bite of everything ,"This is a good place to have different types of street food,expensive but worth it. The one I loved was the cheese lobster, but some other were also good.If you want to have your lunch here, be prepared to expend a lot of cash, but if you just try it as some snacks is ok."
Seoul searching: A solo traveler's diary,"I was staying near Myeongdong streets so every night it was always my last stop from wherever i was before going back to my hotel. The busy streets of Myeongdong will definitely lift everyone's spirits. Tourists and locals were busy walking, shopping, window shopping and eating. Skin care products were all over these streets and freebies were just about the same. My favorite skin care brand Skinfood was on sale, and i was able to score 10 pcs of sheet masks plus another 10 for only ₩10,000, about P350.00 here in Manila. If you'll purchase it here 1 mask costs P75.00. It was a huge sale in my opinion. Needless to say, i bought a lot and a lot more of their products at Lotte Duty Free where everything was also on sale and way cheaper. Once i got tired of too much browsing, an array of yummy street foods were just a few steps away. I tried almost everything, gimbap, tteokbokki, octopus bbq and sandwich, pomegranate juice, shrimp, crabs, crablets, lobster all of which were breaded and fried and came with a special sauce, odeng, hotteok, kimchi pancake and bunggeopang. I was there for 5 straight nights, no wonder i was able to taste a lot for dinner. Shopping in Myeongdong was 24/7 but my legs can't cope up anymore with the city's business not to mention the places i visited during day time. When i come back to Seoul, i will definitely go back here every night. I'm in love with Myeongdong.❤❤❤"
Heaven for make-up shoppers,"This place is a must visit for anyone visiting Seoul. Even if you are not planning to buy any makeups, I think it is worth visiting to feel the atmosphere. A lot of nice and unique street food sold in the area too. Moreover, because the place is very touristy, most sellers and waiters in restaurants can speak English."
Myeongdond shopping street,"My hotel is only 10 minutes walk to the main shopping streets, there must be 4 or 500 shops in that area, mainly cosmetic and fashion , lots of local restaurants , you can spend hours or days , also good bargain prices."
Exciting gift shops and street food,"There are plenty of different choices in this district to buy the souvenir or gift from authentic Korean artifacts to fridge magnets, fun to wander around the many streets and window shop, and every opportunity to eat the many street vendor food, form ice-cream to seafood"
cosmetic heaven,"if you are a woman and love make up, this is the place to go. with affordable price, you can spend hours in this place just for make-up shopping."
"Shopping, Dinning, Experiencing ","Exciting hotspot for days and nights. Attractive and creative side street food stalls, such as fresh grill cheese mini lobster, steamed egg bread, freshly squeezed pomegranate juice, rose shape icecream........"
Shopping ,"Myeongdong is a 'must' visit place for visitors to Seoul . The place opens around 10am and closes around 11.30pm.This shopping belt is world reknown for its shops and stores selling branded cosmetics. Other items sold include clothes and footwear.For the more adventurous, do try the hawker fare selling baked scallops, baby lobsters, croissants. As they are freshly baked, the risk of developing a bad tummy is very minimal, I should think. There are also numerous small and mid size restaurants offering Korean bar-b-q of grilled fish, beef , pork and chicken. For those who like to taste local Korean cuisine, visitors will be spoilt for choices. All orders come with a serving of kim chee , bean sprouts and vegetables . Rice is an optional order . I was there twice , and tonight I enjoyed being there just soaking up the atmosphere to see the huge crowds streaming in and the neon lightings similar to what you can see in Times Square though not as magnificent.The place is highly recommended."
Best shopping area in Seoul,"My favorite thing on my Korea trip was definitely shopping in Myeongdong. Excellent street food, restaurants, beauty stores, and right by the subway station. The employees in the stores were nice and also spoke English. You can also ask for discounts and samples and they will usually give them to you which was great! Loved Myeongdong and I wish I could go there again!"
A must go!,"Best place in Seoul.Best place for shopping and other things.There are many restaurants, cafes, etc.There are even theme cafes here, I visited many cat cafes, dog cafes..My hotel was here, I never regretted the location, best location ever.Visited in Summer of 2015"
Shoppers and foodie heaven,This place really wakes up later in the day. If you're looking for somewhere to go early in the day this isn't the place. The range of shops and street food available is plenty and very affordable too. You'll end up eating at every stall!
Winter Time,Nothing much to see there - maybe it's winter season? Went to a few malls and mostly selling same clothes too.
Best places in Korea for shopping and eating ,"I like myeong dong the best in Korea, a lot of street food along the way with the shopping mall , and good food restaurant is all around. You can explore a lot of stuff in here , I went here during January and is the coldest winters time month. I will come here again "
Sun,Love the shopping area!! Lots of great restaurant and name brand stores. Very crowded. Walking distance from our hotel. The Hotel offer shuttle bus but walking is only 10 min. away. Very safe area. 
Heaven for girls,"Best to come night timeNear train stationA long street of korean skin care and make up, affordable shoes (les more shop) and local foodYou may find non korean brands in Olive Young (e.g Nuxe)Lotte young dept store is across the street, you may find april skin there, if you are looking for one. I recognized only h&m, uniqlo, forever 21 and zara for clothing boutiques, others maybe i dont know the brandTheres a mcdonalds near the center intersection Theyre also offering tax refund slip if you buy more than 30k wonMoney changer is presentInnisfree, Missha, etude house, tony moly and the saem are the common brands along the myeongdong street, you can find more than one storeSome stores were giving away free masks No japanese brands like shisheido, hada laboI cannot find perfume boutiques maybe not enough for me to see thoseYou may also see the subway with cheaper clothing line up, if youre a kpop fan youll definitely should consider it, you can also see posters of popular kpop artists being sold there"
The place to be!,"Well this is the place to be when in Seoul , lot is of tourist destination close by, for shoppers it's heaven. Must Exchange your money here cause it gives you the best exchange rates and in Seoul."
Visited 3x on our 7 day trip!,Lots and lots of shops! The street food at night are not to be missed! Nearby Lotte mall also has good food choices in the basement food court. 
A must do!,"Street food, shopping for dayyyz and dog cafes! Exciting and nothing like anything you could ever imagine!"
Food and shopping paradise,"Myeongdong shopping street is full of cosmetic shops; fashion stores; restaurants; cafe (even cat cafe; dog cafe!) and of course the night market with all the street vendors' stalls along the whole street. Quite fun going from stall to stall to see how they cook the various food. The variety is enormous from giant clams, lobster, various kinds of pancakes, grill meat, to candy floss, roasted chestnuts & sweet potato and freshly pressed juices. Just amazing!"
Fabulous energy at night! ,"Wow, this place was amazing! Crazy busy with shop after shop of skin care, face masks, shoes, food etc.etc. Lots of street food & market style stalls too. Nighttime is definitely the time to come as the lights & people really make it exciting! Open most nights till 10pm, it's a shopping Mecca! Must visit if you are in Seoul, just to feel the craziness! "
Cuteness Overload,"Streets and streets of cheap Korean makeup, fashion, food, and so much more! Could spend a full day here shopping and eating, and you still probably won't see all of it. It's a literal maze! The street food is delicious and cheap! Wouldn't recommend for those claustrophobic and don't like big crowds."
Shop and eat till you drop!,"So many shops that you just have to be aware of which way you have turned so you don't get lost!If you are hungry, there are also plenty of restaurants and street food around. Wear good shoes as you will be walking heaps!"
Too many people ,"Been there several time, it is a good place for money exchange, and the foreigner friendly show and restaurants. Big chain stores that often occupies whole building floors. But, just way too many people walking on the street and a lot of repeated food vendors."
Good and nice place for shopping and walking,"One of the famous place for tourist in Seoul. The place is good for relax or even just for walking.There are many mini market, store, restaurant, cafe and coffee bar.Open time start at 4:00PM until 11:00PM. More better at night while the LED with full color is everywhere"
"If you love shopping and want lots of shops and street food, this is your place","Walking distance from Naemdaemun shopping, this area is full of fun street foods, little trendy skin-care and fashion shops, and lots of trendy, interesting, foreign foods. Personally, I tend to prefer places like Namdaemun and Gwangjang, but for people who LOVE Harajuku and that trendy collegiate-youth-ish vibe, they'll dig this area, too. There's a lot of fun stuff here to check out, so don't be shy. "
Night Shopping And Snacking Place Bursting With Energy,"The whole area is filled with street vendors peddling local snacks and shops selling not expensive stuff. Very touristy feel. If you are looking for good fine dining and branded items, this is not the place for you. "
Crazily busy with lots of food selection from street food to proper restaurants,"A deffo great place for cosmetics shopping and relaxing at nice cafe or having a meal here. Personally, I found their street food interesting and worth a try. The only tip is when buying cosmetics, select the shop carefully, even under the same brand, the extra gifts could be different."
Shop....eat....shop some more!,"The Myeongdong underground subway shopping is already exciting but once you get out of Exits 6 or 7, you've stepped into a shopper's paradise! The streets are closed to vehicular traffic which makes it easier to ""navigate"" this shopping district of streets and alleyways. Not only will you find skin care and make up stores one after another, but there are also clothing, shoes, jewelry, hats, etc. and the food stalls....you can have a feast of specialty seafood -- lobsters, crabs, clams, scallops, along with the usual Korean food plus fresh fruit juices, ""foot high"" ice-cream cones, etc. Restaurants of various cuisines are all over if you prefer to dine-in. Lotte Department store is in the area also where the food court offers a good variety of mostly Asian food. Their bakeries are not too be missed. Plan to spend at least two days in this area."
Just go see the place,Even if you aren't going to shop (because Seoul is quite pricy) just go walk through the street. Its a great experience and feel. Has all these lovely fresh fruit juice stalls.
Street Food,I didn't really do any shopping during my time at myeongdong.. I mostly went to the different stalls at night to get street food. My favorite stall is the tteokbokki at the corner with the guy serving it.. 
Beauty Haven,"This is my wife's favorite place as of now, of course just next to Heaven. All of her beauty needs in just one place. A must go destination for ladies for all their beauty needs."
Everything you need is in here,"You can buy any cosmetic your wife, friend or even your mother would like, try many kinds of delicious food, watch korean traditional performances, and all thing you want to shop is here.Only a few minutes by walking to reach Nam Dae Moon market, where I always by camera and accessories with very good price, wide range of product.Nice place to visit."
Crazy shopping experience,"This is my first visit to Seoul and my hotel is just minutes walking distance from this famous shopping street. I was bombarded by many salesgirls from endless skin care shops like Nature Republic, Face Shop, Innisfree, etc. They were giving out free masks but you're required to go in and shop something. Well, I 'accidentally' bought about 100 pieces of masks on my first day as I was just overwhelmed with all the options. Anyhow, it was quite an interesting experience but I'll suggest you do some research as to what products you like. I'm just giving the masks as souvenirs. "
Shopping galore ,This place is literally filled and jammed packed with cosmetic products. Rows after rows of them. As a bloke I found the street food amazing and was stuffing my face while the girls shopped for the latest placental face cream etc... Few restaurants and cafes to stop and have a quick drink/ bite. May get crowded at times but all in good fun right? 
Street food heaven.,"This is the best place to try south korea's street food. Be there early around 3 pm until 11 pm to experience food trip. Food price ranges from 1,500 Korean won to 15,000 won just for street food. Always share the food with your friend / companion is order to taste a little bit of everything. "
Day of Shopping,A very big shopping area with many shops in the many lanes. We spent half a day there and got lost in the big area.
Busy but clean & safe .,"Busy during the day , but clean and feels safe to wander round. Plenty of street food the day we visited , which was interesting & good to try.Plenty of shops ( a lot of cosmetic ones ) , cafes easy to get there either walking or via the Metro."
Nice shopping at pure Korean style,It is probably one of the most representative places for shopping. It is extremely crowded so I won't recommend to visit with kids. There are all kind of stores from local to international brands. Not luxury shopping at all. 
Shops shops shops,Jees there are a lot of shops there. You can buy many things (be ready.. them pokemons are everywhere). Lot's of street food places too.. Over priced if you ask me.. You can try one or two things but for food Seoul has many much better places.And crowded fur sure. So if you just want to have a relaxing walk this might not be the place for you.
Should go,Was there in the afternoon but the stores are mostly makeup and women's clothingLots of shops and eating placeWent for coffee very late afternoon and on way to subway after coffee wandered bat into shopping district which had exploded into a vibrant assortment of shops vendors and food standsWhat a welcomed change had dinner at a variety of food stands try as many as you canGo here it is well worth it
Shopping and eating ,"In my opinion Myeongdong is the best Seoul has to offer! From the moment you step onto the street the sounds and scents assaults your senses! The hustle and bustle of persons looking for food, clothes, South Korea's famous face products, specialty cafes is an everyday thing. Never a dull moment here, you could visit everyday for a week and still not experience all it has to offer.It is upscale and Morden with that certain street flair. A must visit if you go to Seoul, if you can live near here, like within walking distance you won't regret it! "
Depends what you looking for,To be honest..nothing really special here..the street food here is actually quite on the high side compare to a meal elswhere..i only came here for a mask shopping which is really cheap depending on the brand you choose..other than that i find item quite pricey here..
Shopping Paradise,"Korea's best known shopping district, many department stores, shops that sell cosmetics, clothes, shoes and accessories. Also, food paradise too!!! Many restaurant choices. If you love Korea beauty product, this is definitely the place to do one stop shopping. Because of the competition, you can always snap good deals too!!Subway Line 2, Euljiro 1-ga Station, Exit 6Subway Line 4, Myeong-dong Station, Exit 6"
Good Place to shop,"This area is a wonderful place to shop for cheap and good stuff especially cosmetic and skin care products, it is also a good place to try their street food "
My favourite place in Seoul,This is definitely the place to stock up on your cosmetics and skincare products. But please do up a shopping list beforehand or else you will be lost in all the different brands and stores. I wouldn't recommend getting clothes from Myeongdong because it is more pricey than Ewha and Hongdae. But the street food is a must-try.
Cosmetic heaven,"If you're looking for Korean cosmetic, any brands, you could find it here. Rows and rows of shops selling cosmetic and trendy clothes with affordable price. "
So crowded and easily get lost. ,"Myeongdong has everything you need in terms of shopping and eating. Thousands of shops, restaurants and kiosks await you there. Since I could not see the sign or the name of the street clearly, and with the crowd walking toward me, I got lost for 4-5 times. If you find what you want to buy, just buy it because it is difficult to find the way back there again. If you want to meet someone, consider the subway station or the post office located outside Myeongdong and then walk to Myeongdong together. Some brands offer you cheap price and it is better to stay there more than 1 hour, depending on your walking and shopping ability. "
Best place to shop!,Hi there. A must visit place here as you can see there are such a paradise for the girls haha. See you again myeongdong!
"Almost impossible to move around freely, too many people","We met with friends here to spend some time together. After the sun went down, the streets were packed, we did not walk...we were moving in waves as people shoved and pushed. We were packed in like sardines in every corner of MyeongDong. I would recommend visiting during the day unless you enjoy this kind of crowd. There are lots of fun street foods to try and great souvenirs to buy here. "
shipping shopping !,"heaven for woman, u can get all sorts of Korean cosmetics from this place, most shops offer in-shop tax refund. the downside will be that it's very touristy, and restaurants around the area is comparatively pricy."
"Lots of Shopping, but tons of crowds","Myeongdong is a very popular tourist shopping area in Seoul - if you want to avoid the crowds and the craziness, there are definitely other more remote but great shopping areas (like the bus terminal/subway districts/Insadong/Itaewon/Dongdaemun, etc). Lots of things to do here though so you won't get bored if you do check it out."
great shopping areas,"Lots of cosmetics store, restaurants, etc around the streets. We never gets enough of this place. We always come back here for eating, strolling around, do some shopping when we visit Seoul. We love this place hohohoho"
Major shopping area - great shopping and great food,"For those who use Korean facial products, Myeongdong is definitely the place to be. As a first timer to Seoul, the streets that are lined with so many shops and brand names was mind boggling. Lots of eateries and cafes too. Our best discovery was a corner stall Great king of castella - Long queue but must try! Overall, a great place, with lots of exciting street food in the evening, eat and walk at the same time!"
Recommended destination,"One of the primary shopping district in seoul. Many brand name shops and department stores line the streets and alleys. Myeongdong also has family restaurants, fast food, plus korean, western and japanese dining options. So many place to go in here. You must be here guys.. Dont miss it "
Shopping and street food craze!,"This impressive area is a must-see in Seoul! At first it takes some time to understand the area and market, because it is very very crowded, and with time you get your orientation right.There are many street food vendors with a huge variety of choices - from egg-buns to many different kinds of skewers, from corn to oysters... The price is between 5,000 to 10,000 won per serving, which is quite reasonable - but I have to admit, I could not stop myself from trying almost everything!There is a huge number of cosmetics shops on the street and they are full of people. You can find many kinds of cosmetics from mass brands to quite premium ones. As the street gets more active towards the night, it may be better to walk around Namdaemun Market first, and come to Myeongdong afterwards, because I tried to do the opposite, and all the shops in Namdaemun were closed by 7pm."
Shopping!,"All about shopping for skin care and make-up. Crowded and not so enjoyable to shop. Some of the sales person are not friendly but not all. It is a nice to shop when it’s less crowded, I guess during weekdays or when it’s very cold. Repeated shops but the deals are slightly different. Many restaurants in this area too."
Women's Heaven,"This is the right place to find all kinds of cosmetics...Ladies never leave Seoul without visiting this place. Lots of free samples and very affordable items. also, lots of street food to satisfy your hunger after shopping...a must visit...."
Halal food choice,No problem for Muslim to find foods because there's bunch of choices in Myeongdong from street food to fried rice in Yoogane. 
wow great place in seoul to shop and eat,lots of hotels in the areagreat nightlifelots of shopping areaslots of street foods toovery easy to navigate
Urban Lifestyle + Culture,"Myeongdong didnt fail to impress me. This place is my most favorite spot in Seoul because it offered me heaven as a tourist and as a backpacker. It offered a variety of goods from beauty/hygiene products, clothings, food and experience. This place is so youthful to the extend that Korean Hallyu is really noticeable. I must mention that street foods in Myeongdong are to die for. Swear!"
Great shopping,Great experience but the salespeople are very pushy in the cosmetic stores. Cute socks and very good vendor cart food.
Shoppers Heaven!!,"The food!! The shopping!!! Just beware the clerks. They way oversell everything. But overall..wonderful!! Get a fried potato spiral and green tea/strawberry ice cream ""rose."" Lots of great street food!!"
Place to Shop for Facial Products,"Like what others have commented, this is heaven for people who are looking for Korean facial products. Within a street, you can find 3 to 4 innersfree stores. Ask for discount if you are buying more and they will also throw in a couple of their new products."
Cosmetic Heaven,"Many korean brand cosmetic here. You can find more than 2 same brand in this street. The crowd was happening. in the evening, street food vendor start to set up their table. You will go crazy here ladies. Watchout!!"
Wow ,Wow almost says it all. There is literally something for everyone here. The sights and sounds are amazing. The food the people everything is so different. No matter what your looking for you can find it here.
cheap and crowded place to look around,"We went to Myeongdong on February 2017, the place is full of people, the goods mostly Korean brand but you can find Uniqlo, Zara, Adidas, etc. They have a lot of cosmetics shop, every corner of Myeongdong. Their streetfood stalls are awesome, but lil bit expensive, i think because tourist area. Its hard to find bathroom, i walk into Uniqlo store, and go downstairs twice to find toilet for women. "
Tour as many skincare shops for the free masks!,"This was my first trip to Myeongdong, and upon arriving, instantly realized why it is such an iconic hot spot for tourists and locals alike. From the outstanding and diverse street food offerings such as grilled lobster tail, Havana sweet corn, to the so-highly-raved Dr. Fish pedicures, Hello Kitty Cafe, coveted skin care stores galore, and even a Cat cafe- where you pay to spend time petting cats while you sip your afternoon milk tea! The staff is pretty helpful throughout the stores you visit. Make sure to visit as many skin care stores as possible, as each one you pass, an associate will try to lure you in by giving you a complimentary face mask for visiting their store (which you get to keep even if you don't purchase anything). I don't speak Korean, so the shopping process wasn't really a hassle, as the associates just informed me whether a product was a cleanser, toner, moisturizer, etc. The shops here have everything from Forever 21 and H&M, to high end stores such as Boy, a London based high-end clothing store with edgy fashions. Myeongdong has something for everyone and is easily accessible by Metro, so make sure you create some time to check it out on your next visit to Seoul!"
Shopping area,Good places for food and shopping. They have lots of street food stalls at night and also plenty of korean brand cosmetics shops
good place to shop,"it is cosmetic center in Seoul, located in center of Seoul city. it provides ranges of cosmetic brands"
Never fails to entertain and lift your spirits,"A must do visit for everything. Korean modern culture, shopping, dining, entertainment. It is a regular destination for our family. Get lost in the friendly mayhem"
Shopping Galore,"Myeongdong is a great place to go shopping when you visit Seoul. There are lots of street foods, beauty products with discounts and promotional items and for Catholics you can go and visit the Myeongdong Cathedral."
Best street food and shopping ,"This is a very busy street. I haven't seen so many people in one place before. It is a very nice place for shopping. Shoes, clothing, cosmetics, you name it, you can find anything in here. Don't forget to taste every dish they offer. It's the best street food in the world! "
Nothing Great,"This is purely for cosmetics all around, however there are street food which is nice but expensive. Recommend for girls "
Makeup shopping galore!!,I'm 3 shades darker than any of the makeup products for face offered in ALL of myeongdong but nonetheless i had a great time window shopping. The eats around there and the roadside entertainment can keep you busy ALL day!
Nothing much other then cosmetics,"It's rows and rows of shops selling cosmetics and face masks. Be wary of those touting free samples, as taking a sample will mean you have to pay a visit into the store, and not buying anything could result in them snatching the sample back from you. All a very ride experience. Nonetheless, if you are looking for cosmetics and beauty masks of all sorts, check out the street.During winter months, night market for street food opens after 3pm.."
A MUST see!,"You cannot go to Seoul without roaming down this street! Be sure to eat the street food, it's all delicious! "
Love the Vibe,Eat while you shop! One of the best places to shop in Seoul is Myeongdong Street. Prices are reasonable and cheaper compared to other shopping districts in Seoul. I just loved trying out the street food while hopping from one store to the next. 
Heaven for shopaholic!,"Myeongdong has everything you possibly needs. From over 100 make up counters to boutiques, to a wide range of clothing stores to accessories store. Surrounding the shopping street is street food!! Everything that you see in Korean dramas are all there! "
Must go!,All the yummy street food! Start at 4pm till late night! Lots of restaurants as well. Lots of choices. Lots of shopping though not the cheapest. 
lovely,my hostel is in myeongdong..i was able to try nd eat the street food everyday hahaha..tasted them ..yummy! stir fried rice is burning my mouth to much spicy..i love it.. but too bad got allergy to dried squid..souvenirs are good and i love those socks they are selling..colorful..its a nice place to explore especially on cosmetics nd malls
Good,I went there for the street food at night rather than shopping. You can find cheaper products(from the same brand) in other places.
Seoul,Food. Be sure to try the amazing Korean beef. Melts in your mouth. Street food. Go for the piping hot pancakes. Keeps u comfortably warm. Music. Nanta musical is one class act. 
Cheap place to shop for souvenirs!,"Great place to visit and splurge your money on souvenirs! But must be great in negotiating skills hahaha. Also lots of street food. The place is literally next to the subway station. Safe for female solo travelers. Be careful though, you might overspend your budget because of the cheap prices and fancy souvenirs available here. I spent a good 2 hours here. Food, cosmetics, clothings, and kitchenware are the most common stuff you can have here. Definitely a worthwhile stop when in Seoul, Korea."
Very lively at night. A fun way to end the day.,"Lots of food and shops. Very fun to walk around after a long day. Lots of tourist so food prices are like for tourists too but they are all good,"
The best ever 💕💕,All the food is so good and the shopping was super super nice .. myeongdong street is a MUST .. when I went Korea everything was on sale and serious I spent a lot of money cause all the clothes are very nice and comfortable .. 
Very interesting..!!!,"1) very nice food to try!! But not all of them are nice..but most of them are so good!! Its expensive than other street food but its worth it if u stay nearby myeondong street. 2) nice vibes to hang out for youngsters at night3) theres also halal food available4) clean street.. please throw your rubbish at the food stall where u bought the food and dont litter it on the street. Every stall has their plastic for leftovers and rubbish. 5) there was people wearing red clothes with hat that says information for anyone who needs help with directions so dont worry much if u are lost 6) so much beauty products for u to try with good price and discounts. Skin care and body care, face , foot mask so much cheaper here..!!!7) reach this place by train and bus. "
A street with wide variety of dining options ,"For first timers, Myeongdong is a relatively big shopping street with wide variety of dining options and comestic shops.Street food in Myeongdong is slightly expensive but tasty."
Interesting street and much cheaper,"There're so many attractive shops. And they provide customer with cheaper price than Japanese counterparts. When you are tired of shopping, you can take a rest at a caffe shop. There are also many fascinating caffe shops."
Crowded and lots of shopping ,"If you like makeup and beauty products this is the place to go. They sell so much of it here. Even if your not a fan, check it out for the atmosphere. At night, street food is also available. "
Shopping paradise,"Myeongdong is without a doubt the paradise for shopping lovers. Hardly could you find the difference between day time and night time here as this place is full of people all day long. There're numerous cosmetics, fashion, restaurants in the area, from budget to high-end. You surely can find the suitable ones with your budget.You can't immagine how fast time flies when you're in Myeongdong. You might think you spend 15' in each store, but actually you will end up with leaving it 1 hour later haha. The thing I like the best when shopping in Korea is that shops are very generous in giving customers samples and gifts. Uggghhhh greatttt!And don't forget to tried street food. So yummy. And buying strawberry too. Strawberry are extremely delicious and much cheaper compared with those in Japan (price might differ according to buyers and how big the fruit is)."
Fashion and street food,"A nice walking street market with lots of cloths and cosmetics. Face masks are everywhere and people are buying in bulk.What caught my interest are food stalls(50-60 in total the day I went there). I recommend grilled lobster with cheese. (15,000 krw)Catching taxi on the way back to hotel late at night is a bit of a problem because the taxis refuse to use the meter and charge 3x normal rate."
Must Visit when in Seoul,"Great food selection. Shopping! Shopping! Shopping! Visit the visitor's information center so you won't miss a thing. My niece enjoyed her time at the Dog Cafe. Since you will be seeing the same stores almost every 2 blocks, you might want to plan what to buy in each store so you can get tax refund (30,000 W single receipt purchase). If you don't want to line up for the refund at the airport (took my sister less than 5 minutes to do though), you also might want to ask if they deduct refund right away before you buy. Some of the food stalls start closing around 11 pm. "
Myeongdong,Lively. Diverse. Crowded. Lovely street food. Excellent Korean shops. Interesting clothes & shoes to buy at reasonable prices.
"If you liked to get hustled, stuck and waste tons of time, this is the place to be.","I must tell everyone that Myeongdong is marketed as a place with vibrant cultural experience and whatever, but most people from Seoul and who live here will never go to this area more than once a year. The reason im demoting this place is because the whole area overcharges tourists and visitors with ridiculous products that you can literally buy much cheaper anywhere. The streetfood is filthy and I am dead serious as there is barely any health concerns for most of these stalls, I have never seen these vendors never clean their pans in between intervals. They are seriously a health hazard, Myeongdong is over-rated as all the resturaunts are subpar franchises or franchise-wannabes branding themselves as authentic traditional food but they are prepackaged food that are usually reheated in stone pots or microwaves.. Just a ridiculous neighborhood. There are so many better places people should be heading to, rather than this ridiculous trap. Try your luck at GwangJang Market, Mu Gyo Dong, Suh Chon and GyeongRiDan Road, better food and a more friendly vibe for family and couples."
Great Shopping streets,"I would say Myeongdong is the best shopping place in Seoul, or even in South Korea. There are so many shops especially skin care and cosmetics. Line Store is very interesting. Clean public bathroom is available at the subway station."
If you are a tourist...it's a must experience,"I have to say it's always interesting to come to Myeongdong. It's always changing. Most visitors are tourists but locals come here too. You can find most of the shops and stores in Myeongdong in other malls or areas in the city. But the experience of shopping outside with street food and merchant vendors make this area an interesting place to come. I recommend coming here at night time with some appetite and roam the alleys and try various foods. Bring cash (Korean won) to make things more easier. You will easily get full trying many types of foods. The food vendors are general clean and nothing crazy or weird food. Also there's many restaurants as well but too many to pick from! Finding a public restroom could be difficult but if you go into large shopping centers or coffee shops, you will be fine. It's family friendly but it gets crowded. I would say myeondong is more for shopping at known brands such as makeups and shoes while dongnaemun is more for local merchants and clothes. There's definitely a different feel. I think you can give yourself about 1-2 hours to go through myeondong streets/alleys. "
Great night street food market,"This is a very busy shopping strret ' filled with all the local and other internationa brands but the main attraction is the night market, so many food stands offering such a huge variety of Korean strret food - lots of fun !"
Great place to shop,You can buy pretty much anything here. Gets very busy though as you could expect. Like orchard road Singapore or Oxford Street London.
"If you like crowd, this is the place","I must warn that I am biased in this review because i simply do not like crowded area and this place is super crowded. To add to the crowdedness, we were all wearing winter clothings. So imagine the squeezing and pushing. If you don't mind all that then it is a great place to find street food. Lot of them! All nice and cheap. "
Shopping heaven,"Dont get lost here, got many fashion clothes, beauty product ,eating streets food at all reasonable prices, i lost here around Rm300 one day shopping here at my 3rd days when i was stay at korea about a month.,nice places"
Not my favorite area in Seoul,"I guess people would have varying views but I personally don't find Myeong dong all that great. It's usually crowded with people (mostly young tourists) especially on weekends. Shops are mostly just franchises which you can find anywhere else. There are many street food stalls which you might find interesting at first but again, not my kind of thing. 늘 사람이 붐비고 길거리 음식 부스 때문에 조금 지저분한 느낌의 거리들이 많습니다. 젊은 외국인들은 흥미로울지 모르나 제 취향과는 별로맞지 않네요. "
Shopping,Excellent place to shop and eat! You can find make-up store all over Myeongdong and most of the staffs can speak in English Chinese and/or Japanese.. 
Attractingly crazy ....,"Anything you want , anything you think you can imagine , its on the streets. Because we were here winter time , can you imagine coats , scarves , gloves , shoes, cardigans on sale in the streets ??? oh ! and dont forget to try the street food ,1. stir fry beef with monggo sprouts , 2. Scallops with melted cheese ( super yummy) and 3. Fish andSweet Potato paste / cake....4. theres even lobster..."
"""shopping haven""",""" this place is really a must palce to visit, my family really enjoyed looking for great bargains, especially my daughter she bought a lot of cd's & we bought a lot of beauty products not just for us but for our friends & relativers as well."
Cosmetic shops! ,"I love the street! The food street and the cosmetic shops! 4 times when there in 2 weeks. But it also not enough for me since I'm a makeup lover LOL! Body shops nature republic, thefaceshop, april skin, iope, anything is here! Dont forget to try the food street along the street and also the ice cream."
shopping paradise,"you can find everything in Myeongdong which is including trendy fashion,cloths,jewelry,shoes,skincare,delicious foods"
The Best Shopping,"Myeongdong is a huge shopping district, you can littearlly spend an entire day there. There are tons of shops, resturants and bars. If you go at night everything is bright and lite up, it's quite a sight if night life is your thing. I gets a bit crowded at night, so if your not into big crowds definitely visit during the day. At night the food vendors set up and you can eat some really good street food while you walk around. This is one of my favorite hangout spots in Seoul."
Literally can buy every cosmetic-related products,"You can literally find almost all well-known cosmetic shops here in Myeongdong. There's like 2-3 branches of the same brand in every different corner of myeongdong. The promoters and workers here speak different languages, especially Chinese and Japanese. There will be a lot of Chinese here as the Chinese Embassy is at one of the streets in Myeongdong (not sure if this was related though.) But anyway, you can find better ""currency exchange shop"" here with better price. I'm not sure about other currency but I know China RMB and Hong Kong dollar have good prices here. So, check it out yourselves :) And, there's lot of good restaurants and of course STREET FOOD. "
New Years weekend,"Fun area to walk around in Seoul. Lots of street food and shopping. Visited twice during the week. Would recommend the Nutella crepe, my kids loved it- ""best they've ever had"". "
Myeongdong was the highlight of my trip to Seoul ,"Without a doubt myeongdong was the best part of my trip to South Korea. The market seems to go on forever.. the real fun is tasting all the street foods. An array of fried halloumi, street fruits and pancake type delicacies awaits you.. they also had amazing foot long soft serve ice cream. The shopping for gifts and souvenirs was amazing but be prepared to bargain a little for the best price. It's a must stop and see place if your in Seoul- but do go at night as the selection of street food is wider. "
Great place to shop for make up,well my title says it all. If you want to shop for make up you should go here. THere is a lot of food stall too. 
Street sellers and department stores,"This place is amazing. Many department stores and a lot of street sellers, where you can buy goods and food. At the end of the street there is the myeong-dong Catholic Cathedral, which is a historical marc of redemocratization of Korea in the 1980s."
Worth a visit ,"Spend time wandering around the markets, you will find there are lots of branded stores with unique architech. Lots of street food along the way. A busy market. Some shops have their staffs standing outside persuading you to walk in to their shops however be careful I myself experienced being pull in! But there are many shops for everyone to browse. "
Shops everywhere ,This is a typical shopping centre. There are lots of the flagship shops here and multiple versions of the same brand. I got disorientated as to which street I was on. Korea is big on skin care and there appeared to be a third of the shops were skincare. There are also street stalls and street entertainers. 
best shopping,shopping down town was so clean and safe. You could find so many people speaking English. The people could not do enough for you
The world famous street - slighly over hyped,The shopping area is really busy and there is plenty of things to shop and eat. Rather pricey especially for cosmetics but you can get tax free done right inside the shops.
Shopping and street food,This is a very lively shopping streets filled with shops selling clothes and cosmetics.It is a very lively and vibrant area as it is filed with busy shoppers.The street became extremely busy after 1pm as many of the street food vendors starting selling food too.
Crowded,Many foods n shop very crowded. U can shopping there n eat many street food very delicious open until midnight.
Cosmetics galore,"My wife loved this place. Every shop Vick g away a free sample at the front and so many discounts. I followed her in only to get the second free sample so she had 2. She bought a lot of stuff, things I don't understand.This place is Heaven for girls.There's about 6 of each shop (nature republic, etude house etc). "
Skincare/Cosmetics Heaven + Tips for Shopping,"FOODThe street food stalls are pricier compared to Namdaemun Market or Ewha e.g. egg bread was twice the price in Ewha? SHOPPING TIPS1. Don't rush to buy products. Take the time to walk around and compare prices first. For example, Mamonde is a brand under Amore Pacific, and Aritaum is the main store that sells more prominent Amore Pacific brands (so one might think products there will be cheaper). However, while I was there, Olive Young was selling my Mamonde toner at 17 500 won, much cheaper than the 25 000 won at Aritaum. 2. Tax free is a minimum of 30 000 won, so try to collate all your purchases and buy them from the same store so you can hit this minimum. E.g. If you're only going to buy one Laneige lipstick (~23k-25k won), it's easier to get tax free by buying it from an Aritaum store where they carry several other brands you may wish to buy products from (and therefore hit 30k) compared to buying it from the Laneige flagship store.3. Myeongdong has several outlets of the same brand e.g. lots of Innisfrees, Tony Molys etc. However, NOT ALL OUTLETS GIVE IMMEDIATE TAX REFUNDS. Check if the store gives immediate tax refunds first before buying. This means less hassle since you won't need to dedicate time to claiming tax refunds at the airport. 4. The more you buy from a store, the more freebies you get! So it's better to have one MASSIVE buy at one time from a store than to go back multiple times. 5. The salespeople will tell you that a particular product is very popular. EVERY PRODUCT IS POPULAR IN KOREA. Do your research first, or you may end up spending more than you intend to. (And if you do indeed become an unsuspecting victim, the moneychangers with better rates are those opposite the Chinese embassy in Myeongdong :P)6. Most outlets will have salespeople pushing their new releases. If you're tempted and are willing to purchase, DON'T GIVE IN/SHOW THAT YOU ARE KEEN TOO EASILY. What I've found is that the harder the salespeople have to work to convince you, the more willing they are to give you freebies. E.g. When I was at The Saem, after 10-15 minutes of extolling the benefits of their Wrinkle Plumper, the saleslady was offering me 2 deep foaming cleansers, a packet of masks and makeup products ""and you only need to buy 2 plumpers!""."
Shopaholic's Oasis,There are many shops and street food stalls at this street. Come by around 6pm where the street vendors start to cook up their delicacy. The shops at this street are also places to look foward to find branded clothing or beauty products
Korean cosmetics haven,"If you love Korean cosmetics, this is where your bliss is. Street after street of korean cosmetic stores are located here interpersed with clothing, shoes, bling, and tourist take-homes. Restaurants also abound in the upper floors of the cosmetic shops. Its pretty crowded but the yummy street food in the evenings are worth braving the crowd. There is a food stall selling japchae almost right at the entrance of Myeongdong at the Lotte side. Its usually the one first to close because its japchae sells out really fast. Look for it and the guy who can make your japchae with our without meat. Mine was purr veggies for 3000 won. 4000 won if with meat. We stayed 3 nights in a hotel right in Myeongdong near the Myeongdong Cathedral and I tasted almost all of the street food carts there. Some are so-so, others were worth one repeat while the japchae was worth going back for 3 straight nights. So "
Cosmetics and food galore,This place is made for women!!! Cosmetics everywhere!!! Be sure to ask for free samples!!! Nice to walk around also during the late afternoon when all the food carts are set up... Nice to try different street foods!
Honeymoon @ Myeong Dong Street,"We wanted to go to Myeong Dong Street but not sure how to travel to this place.We just walked along a subway shopping and exit. Suddenly, we are at Myeong Dong Street. It's somehow so magical.Food along this street seems expensive. We tried the cabbage omelette, which cost around KW$5000. It does not taste nice.A very good walk along this street and observe the night activities and scene.Shops close at about 11pm. Adidas closes at 10pm. "
Myeongdong ,This is a most popular shopping area in Seoul. You could found all the cosmetic items with 100 sq. Meter. and 2 duty fee shop nearby. But the only problem is too many peoples. It was Crazy!
You can find anything here!,"this place is always packed with people, definitely a must visit for shopping from cosmetics, fashion, and also kpop cds (buy it at myeongdong underground shopping mall for cheaper price). there is also lots of street food at night, eventhough it's more pricy compared to street food at other places."
Shopping and more shopping,Well probably the best shopping area in Korea! Anything that is fashion and cosmetic related this is the place to go by far! Don't read this go and shop!
Always stay here,"I used to stay in Myeongdong when i have business trip in Korea, because you can find so many local foods and all fashioned goods here."
Everything you need,"A convenient one-stop shop. Anything you need they'll probably have it if you look hard enough. There's a cat cafe in the middle of the streets (worth it trust me) and a lot of street food!! My favourite is by far the grilled lobster, half of a lobster was 10000won and the sauce has a whole lot of goodies in it so definitely worth a try. Needless to say, if you're a make up addict you might go broke. Be sure to check out different branches for different promotions because I swear there are 50 etudehouses within a 20m radius. I also find that you have to ask for samples nowadays because they don't give them out by the handful anymore. Overall a great experience :) "
A Shopping Paradise,"Myeongdong Shopping Street is a must visit in Seoul. Look out for Line Store with their HUGE Bear mascot welcoming you at the entrance and you are free to take as many photographs you want inside the store.There are dozens and dozens of shops selling skin care products and you are spoilt for choices. As for international clothing brands I highly recommend the Zara Myeongdong Store that gives good discounts during their sales and they have an extensive range for both sexes.There are many lanes and alleys that might put you in maze and for a while you find yourself lost in Myeongdong. So, best to remember a landmark so you can make your way back.If you see people distributing free goodies bag do grap one and besides free samples inside you might be lucky to find vouchers in exchange for free bags at Shinsegae department store and also vouchers to purchase Arex train ticket from Seoul Station to Incheon Airport at a discounted price."
must visit the cathedral too,you must visit the cathedral there. a set of quiet and peaceful catholic buidings in a busy district with rich history and culture.
Very crowded but a fun experience,"This area is a shopping area that is famous for its cosmetic/skin care brand stores, clothing stores, restaurants, and not-to-be-missed street food. The place is crowded most days, but it is one place you will want to experience. Expect to be bumped into a lot by people from all over the world, but dont let it bother you. Where else in Seoul will you be able to say you rubbed shoulders with people from China, Japan, Philippines, Malaysia, England, Russia, Mexico, Canada, the United States, France, Australia, and Africa, all within a matter of minutes. Also be prepared to be pulled into the different skin care stores by enthusiastic sales girls working on commission. Not to worry though, stay here very long and you will leave with a large haul of free skin care samples given to you by these girls. Also, while you're here you might want to consider looking to taking in an afternoon showing of NANTA- The Cooking Show, an entertaining off-broadway style singing, dancing, comedy stage show that is a delight to behold and not hindered by language barriers. Tickets are sold at the NANTA Theater and go quickly, so plan ahead."
Shopping ,"If you love to make up yourself, there is so many things you can buy here. From top to toe, they're had it all. All the best brand you've ever heard."
Heart of Seoul,"Between two great subway stations lies the greatest shopping district in Seoul. With a wide range of shopping categories, one day is simply not enough to explore the whole shopping district. And at night, life brightens up with food stalls at every street. Although the average food item would cost 3000won, its an experience you cannot miss.There are also 'tourist helpers' who may speak multi-languages who are walking around at cross-streets which is very helpful especially if you get lost.Ps. for all those cosmetics lovers and freebies lovers, look out for staff members waving cosmetics around."
"Shop, eat, shop","What is visiting Seoul without a sport of shopping??? If you are traveling to other places in Korea, I'd suggest making Seoul your last stop to save some huge luvvage lugging. Unless its something that is native (i don't know if thts the right word to use, pardon me if it's wrong..!) Or if you happen to be at O'Sulloc Jeju, save all the shopping for Myeongdong! I swear I thought I'd never see the end if the malls, fashion and cosmetics outlets.. The street is busy so come prepared for it. Comfy shoes and easy to remove apparels are essential if you intend to buy clothes.. You don't wanna be the cause of a dressing room line nw.. There are plenty of street stalls selling really cheap stuff but they tend to be pretty generic after a while and the streets can get a lil confusing after a few turns if you don't read Korean so if you see somethi g you want, buy it! If you've missed it already, dont worry coz it'll likely pop up further down the street! Food options are great here.. We had awesome, awesome grilled beef at one of the upstairs restaurant.. Like literally melts in your mouth kinda meat.. Which we unfortunately finished before we could do the picture snapping thing (yes..it was THAT GOOD..)but it wasn't cheap..like abt sgd$100 for 2 pax w/ additional soup n soju? But it was the best beef we've had the entire trip i swear. If you'd like cheaper options, keep a look out for the restaurants in the alleys..! They serve pretty gd food at reasonable prices. Once you've eaten your fill, theres always the option of walking those calories off checking out SPAO! We spent like 2hrs in SPAO coz there's soo much to see and try on..if my wallet could speak, it would be crying in pain.. If clothes ain't the right season, go check out Olive and Young. Its kinda like a Korean wonder-drugstore where you see shelves and shelves of products you've never even heard of but can't wait to try..! I got my Dr Jart masks and Whamisa stuff here..! Sorry guys.. No pictures of the said street coz 1. The fingers were too frozen and 2. Hands were too busy trying stuff.. :D "
Make up skin care freebies,"The entire street is littered with make up shops. From afternoon onwards, vehicles are not allowed. Food stalls sprung up all along the centre of the street. You can get your fill of Korean make up and skin care products and street food. All the shops are trying to outdo each other by giving away free samples, face masks, etc to entice any customers to walk into the shops. It's very lively. "
The main shopping area of Seoul and always bustling with life,"All the best shops and always full of life. Big Uniqlo, Zara, Skinfood etc and cafes and street food non stop. Always fun to walk through and see, smell and taste all the different and often fun decorated snacks from the local cuisine. "
Great shopping!! ,"We had a blast shopping, the place is huge- easy to get lost!!! Lots of good deals, great street food "
shopping shopping shopping,it's like a 24 hour non-stop shopping center but abundant of street food stalls at night some serving lobster tail at $15.00 each. plenty of Korean make up and clothing stores.
This place comes alive on Saturdays,"Head down on a Saturday and go hungry. There are so many street stalls selling so many different dishes and nibbles that you are bound to find something you like. Don't like street food, not a problem there are just as many restaurants vying for your trade that you are just spoilt for chose. I passed by once and then went back a few times."
shopping heaven for skincare lover,This place is a shopping heaven for girls or anyone. You can spend a whole day here. I recommend bringing some kind of luggage or bags with wheels because you will buy a lot and carrying your bags around all day can be tiring. 
Nice and good area to walk around and shop,A nice area to walk around to look and if you want to buy things as gift or as souvenirs. Take your time to walk around there
awesome street food!,a lot of food u can try! not so expensive! they sell clothes also..try bargain as much as u can..very friendly seller.
Repetitive shops,"The area is pretty big with lots of shops and places to eat. Quite a lot of western options, which is a big thing for me living in china, but not do much if you are just on holiday. You'll find H&M, forever 21, Lush. And food places like Krispy Kreme, McDonald's etc. I have never seen this many cosmetics shops, ever!! Though the shops and products are all the same and really repetitive. Worth a see but only for an hour or 2."
Great stroll thru the neighbourhood,"Great place ro spend an evening, people watch, shop and try the variety of street food. Very lively and crowded but a place to experience. Try the ice cream in the fish shapped waffle with honeycomb. Delicious"
Great place for shopping and eating,"Great place for shopping and eating. I ate a delicious ox head soup in small restaurant. There are lot of people also. Lot of see, quite cheap food. I recommend to at least visit there once."
A place I go to during every visit in Seoul,"This place is perfect for those who are into skincare and makeup products. Lots of different brands can be found here, you'll definitely go crazy at the plentiful choices available! Besides that, there are lots of great street food that you can try as well aside from the usual restaurants etc. It gets livelier at night (and more crowded), it's best to experience Myeongdong during the day and night to get a feel f both settings. Definitely a must go to place when you're in Seoul :)"
good place for eat street,i've been there in 21 januari 2017... the things is at night Myeongdong are crowded place.. but its fine you can find many diffrents kind of foods... many restaurants and eat street..ooh and you can find many kind of departement shops too... this place is very enjoyble when you at Myeongdong
More for ladies who like to shop,I stayed here for 4 days. Not really for me. I'm a guy and I'm not into shopping. The shops and restaurants here were fairly repetitive. Not many attractions here to see.
Mecca for Shopping and Makeup,"#1 Place to go for makeup and skincare supplies, shopping, local eats, coffee shops, and more. There is also the famous Myeongdong Cathedral which is worth a visit. Ask the Tourist Helpers in red for a map and directions and they will point you in the right direction whatever you are looking for. "
Always brimming with excitement,I went there at least 4 times during my week stay in Seoul. I went at all times of the day and must say that it was the most exciting at night when the street vendors pedalling food and other items for sale emerge. This place is always bustling with activity and there's always something for everyone.
"Myeondong (S Korea) vs Ladies market (Hong Kong), A comparison can help first time traveler","The purpose to have comparison is to make possible any re do may be skipped, especially when a traveler trapped in the temptation to go to every similar shopping area they/she can......well..I'm not trying to lead not to go to L M.....Look... every ambience of each spot, if we are talking about street shopping experience, you can actually draw a comparison line in consideration based on your main reason1. First time experience ?2. For fun only ?3. Being a solidarity person, because your friend wanna go  there ?4. Repetition ?5. Or truly/genuinely a street shopper, and you love it anyhowIn any case Myeondong win for its neat,cleanliness,more decent and especially the attitude of trader, shop keeper slightly less rude, even in fact most sellers are Chinese, but however they are nicer (although not all)I would prefer to hang out longer in Myeondong rather than in Ladies MarketLastly... up to you... :)Although you might find cheaper in term of price wise....less logistic cos dude...."
Excellent shopping street,You can get lots of cosmetic items along this street as there are many stores selling cosmetic items. Lots of street food as well. There are many eateries which can be found along the lanes from the main street.
Myeongdong Shopping Street,"Probably was pampered by how available cosmetics and skin care products are available everywhere in Seoul. Didn't find it worth a trip. There is a Daiso at the end of the street, and the food streets are just okay compared to TW. Prices of merchandise is not attractive compared to what one can buy from Taobao."
Perfect Place to Shop and Eat!,"A street that overload with shopping retails and great street food! I will start to become crowded from 6pm onwards. Selling from the range of branded items to non branded, everything i can find here. I bought very nice puma sneaker at FOLDER, a concept shop with variety of sneakers and sport shoes. and also you can expect to find a lot of cosmetic shops along the street as myeongdong is mainly famous on cosmetic outlets. Street food also delicious! I've tried a few stall and what i can say is, they are selling a really great food! Even during Seollal celebration, this place is open and crowded while other place like namdaemun market and dongdaemun are all closed. "
"Busy street, yummy food and shopping galore","Been here a number of times already, but I still did not get bored of this busy street every night. It's a cosmetic and shopping heaven for my partner and the number of delicious street food adds to the fun. However, take note that not everything sold here is cheap, especially for those cart shops, some of the stuff like glove scarfs etc, I have found same one for cheaper price elsewhere.There is also many good restaurant around here that is mentioned by many food blog, do your research and make sure to visit them!"
Cosmetic supplies and street food galore!,"If you need to stock up on your face cream, cleanser, cosmetics paraphernalia...look no further, visit Myeongdong.To energize you while you shop, there are loads of street stalls offering the best of Korean street food...from the traditional toppoki to the whimsical spiral cut potatoes on a stick.Great place to shop for fashion items but could get a bit crowded with tourists during weekends or holiday season."
Cosmetics Heaven,"If you love shopping for Korea brands cosmetics, this is a place you should never skip. Don't worry if you regret not buying stuff from the first brand A shop, there're more brand A shop at Myeongdong. Easily there are at least 3 ""The Face Shop"", ""Innis Free"" etc. There's quite a variety of street food and cafes if you're a non-shopper. At least a reason to be at Myeongdong."
Lots of repeated stores,"Definitely a street to check out. Lots of cosmetic stores and they tend to repeat after you walk 500m or so. They have street food starting around 4pm daily, again, they tend to repeat as you go further down the street. Prices here for food are inflated. "
shopping haven,"We have no itinerary for the day, we just ket on walking and walking until we reach this streetLots of shops, dining area, street foodsIt's worth a visit."
Shopping heaven!,"This place has been on my mind ever since I left! If you're like me and love make-up, skincare, food, clothes. JUST EVERYTHING. Then this strip is just for you! The food stalls don't come out til 4-5PM so I suggest either ditch dinner plans & just try everything (which I did on many occasions!) huge variety of different types of food! This strip is makeup/skincare heaveeeeeeeen! So many stores, with so many unique & popular products! Also with plenty of samples! Don't forget to ask for your samples! All the store-workers are happy to help even though there might be a slight language barrier. Literally went here at least once a day!"
"Street food, cosmetics & skincare products galore ",You can find all the famed korean street food here. I initially thought that all korean skincare and cosmetic brands would hv at least one shop here but I was mistaken. There are only about 10 brands which had many outlets within one stone's throw. Atmosphere was awesome though and you'd be surprised to find that the cafés here are deserted and practically empty even on weekends. The line friend's cafe is an exception though
Always worth a visit,"As expected, a visit to myeongdong doesnt disappoint. Whether you go there for shopping or for food tripping, you will always leave the place satisfied and wanting to come back. The streets are lined with shops filled with cosmetics, clothes, bags, etc. And then there are those food carts that sell everything from potato twists to scallops to lobsters to ice cream at a very reasonable price. Go with an empty stomach to make it worth your while. "
must go for make up junkies,many cosmetic stores around with special offer or discounts..cheap tho..there are many food streets stalls..ready to get loaded! very crowded and popular among tourist
Amazing Culture,"My fiancé and I accidentally stumbled into this area, not really knowing where we were going. We read about it on TripAdvisor, but just didn't realize where we were when we got there. The street food was absolutely fantastic, streets were so clean, friendly people, LOTS of shops and plenty of dining/ drinking. Great to visit! "
heaven for make up addict,"It's literally the heaven for make up addict! Tons of free samples. Just by walking around for 2 hours I got lots of samples. And when you buy, you can get more samples! Best thing, when you buy there they can give you discount plus extra product with much cheaper price than its regular price!"
Seoul's Shopping Mecca,"If you want to have that korean glow and flawless skin, then this is the place where you can buy those skin care/beauty products. The food here is also a must try. The shoes here are cheaper than those in HK. "
Busy shopping area with some bargains,"This is a crowded but pleasant area to shop for clothing, shoes, skincare & beauty products, Korean souvenirs, and more. Remember to look up while you are walking along the streets. There are innumerable shops and vendors to see, and not all are on the street level!"
Shopping street with plenty of street food. Quite pricey abc repetitive. ,"We just went for a short while for the ""been there done that"" factor. We were mostly interested in the street foods which we read so much about. The streets are lined with mostly cosmetic & clothing shops. There are also restaurants around which are mostly long Q because it's a touristy zone. Prices aren't cheap either. You can get similar food elsewhere for cheaper. The street food are quite repetitive in each lane. Grilled seafood sticks, fried chicken pieces, crepes, buns, noodles etc, then repeat. Things aren't cheap. From ₩2000 upwards. And not really wow taste. We tried quite a few stalls and only the fresh strawberry mochi was wow but expensive ₩2500 each. We didn't shop much, just a face cleanser for my brother. There's tax refunds available from some shops for tourists with passports so bring it if you want to shop. "
A MUST SEE,"Everything you'd want to see, taste or smell is here! I bought sterling silver jewelry in a small and unique shop where the gift-wrapping was too beautiful to open when I got home! Candy hawkers made us laugh with their silly songs and the little restaurant that served bimbimbap opened up a new world of flavors and tastes to us - 2 adventurous Americans who made it through a wonderful day on the street market!"
Giving it a five stars because my wife said so. ,"Took my wife here and it was paradise for her. Stores after stores loaded full of cosmetics and more cosmetics. Everything is buy one get one free to lure you inside. If you're a male then prepare to feel lame. It helped that there are food venders all over so at least I had something to do. Should be renamed to ""women only cosmetics street"". "
Heaven for makeup lover,I believe most people who look up for seoul will ended up going here especially girls this is really heaven for us!If you buying makeup buying together with other friends so you can get more sample and tax refundAnd dont forget to list what you wanted to buy if not you will get lost here 
Shopping Paradise,An area pack with shops and restaurants. Lots of great Korean restuarants in this area and you can also find many food carts if you would like to try out Korean street food. Many fashion and beauty stores in this area.
Skincare Haven!,"If you love skincare, you definitely need to drop bu Myeongdong! Various Korean skincare brands are here so choose what you like first before going on with your purchase. There are also a lot of street food here so make sure to try those too! I loved the chocolate covered strawberry mochi. "
Street Food Heaven!,"Complete selection of Korean street food can be found in here. In addition, you can also shop for various kind of goods. But for myself, the street food is the main attraction! My personal favorite is the Jjajangmyeon & Cheese Scallops. "
Love the street food at night,"Various kind of food in the street at night, good price. My whole family enjoyed a lot there. Deep fried crab was our favourite"
Skincare Heaven! ,"We were really looking forward towards Myeongdong and it's endless supply of skincare shops. We were not disappointed in this sense. These skincare shops were everywhere, and they also had many of the same branded shops on different roads. They also do give free sample by the door to entice you into the shop, sometimes it's hard to not 'buy' because there are just too many good skincare products! And yes, they do give more free gifts as well after purchasing. The good thing was that most of the skincare products were decently priced and of course remember to bring your passport! I found that most of the shops deducted the 'tax refund' amount off your receipt right away, you just gotta spend at least 30,000 Korean Won. If you don't speak Korean, I found that more people could speak mandarin instead of English. There are also clothing shops like SPAO, 8, UNIQLO and etc.; shoe shops; LINE shop (which has cute LINE merchandise). Also, street food is all over Myeongdong, however, more stalls do come out during the weekend. However, cars do tend to come into the shopping street and it can get a bit dangerous as the street is crowded with people; and there aren't many bins around for your trash. "
Paradise for shopaholics.,"Love the vibes.No matter how many times I'd visited this places, I never get bored.It's just like your feet walked automatically to this place whenever you visit Seoul.Lots of stores for us to shop, lots of cafes, street food stalls and restaurants for us to savor, and lots of sudden events to see in this place :)Good place for friends' hangout!Even while I was writing this review, I miss this place!"
Unforgettable experience,"Everything is great...sounds, smells, people, noise... The food is cooked in front of you and at Meyon Dong I took the best orange juice of my life."
Shopping heaven!,"If you LOVE shopping, then you can never leave Seoul without visiting Myeongdong. I have been visiting since I was a kid and every time I come here, it has something new! Back in the 90's, it was all locals and I would often come here with my siblings and cousins during our summer breaks. We would always go shopping and eat street food when we got hungry. This was where all the youngsters would go shopping and hang out with their friends. I am surprised by how different it is now compared to the good old days. Years ago, it used to be all the Japanese tourists shopping for cosmetics and the sales representatives were Korean that spoke Japanese. Now, most of the tourists are Chinese and the sale representatives are also Chinese but they are multilingual. (They can speak Mandarin, Japanese and Korean.) If you can speak Mandarin or Japanese, you will be able to communicate with them since they are not fluent in English. A lot of the signs are in Japanese and Chinese so it is easy to navigate around and there are also street guides that can help you if you have questions. The streets are filled with tourists and you'll see the long lines in every cosmetic store. If you go during holiday season, popular cosmetic items are sold out so don't expect to buy everything off your wish list. :( If there's something you REALLY want, try visiting a store that is NOT in Myeongdong. If you get hungry, you will never starve because there are food carts everywhere (only in evenings) and endless restaurants on every corner of the shopping street. Just be careful where you go because most of the places are targeted for tourists so gets expensive and not as good. If you don't like being stomped by tourists, avoid going on holidays and in the evening. I would prefer to visit in the morning so you can shop in peace and not get pushed around by people. Do some power shopping and get out of there around lunch time because that's when it starts to get packed. Make sure to wear comfortable shoes and be ready to do some crazy shopping! :)"
Very vibrant,"I went here a couple of times in mid-January late evenings, when the temperature was below 0. Was pleasantly surprised to see the crowd and energy around. Absolutely loved the vibe. Some shops are pricey but you could find good deals if you explore.Loved the street food too."
"Vibrant place, but pricey","For first-timers in Seoul, this area is such a fascinating picture of what the city offers. On our first day, we went straight here to experience the street food, and check out the shops. After a few days exploring Seoul though, we've seen Hongdae, Dongdaemun, and Ewha Shopping street, and we realized just how expensive it is in Myeongdong Shopping Street. The skin care shops and clothes outlets are okay, since they have the same prices across the board. The street food and clothes sold in stalls, however, are expensive. You can get cheaper street food in Hongdae. "
The famous shopping street in Seoul,"Various makeup brands, clothing line, and restaurants are located here. Some stores allow additional discounts for foreigners. Street foods are all over the place, just everything starts from KRW3000, though, higher compared to other parts of Seoul like Jongno or Yeongdeungpo (where we also got to try street foods). If you're up for branded items, this place is good, but if you're not much into it, Namdaemun Market might be a better place to shop, though does not look quite as much modern as Myeongdong."
"21st Century ""in your face"" culture and shopping.","Myeongdong is an amazing experience that morphs and changes as the hours pass. After 5pm, out of nowhere, emerge street vendors, food carts in the middle of these tiny lane ways. Unbelievably, cars and trucks still meander through the chaos at all hours, so be careful! It was like the vampires emerged from the dark, but these people were NOT vampires, they were gorgeous, beautiful, well dressed and groomed, young people, out to have fun!Coming from Melbourne Australia, where are city lane ways and alleys are famous for their art, food, culture and atmosphere, we thought we would be prepared for the Myeongdong experience. How wrong we were.As the sun set, literally thousands of hip, cool, well-dressed and well endowed, young ones converged from goodness knows where, into the streets and filled it with a buzz and almost electric excitement. It felt like a carnival or street fair, only this happens every night! Enhancing this cracking atmosphere are the street spruikers and touters - lots of people offering 2 for 1 deals and other tempting offers. It seemed as if there are more than 200 shops, selling different potions of face cream, whiteners and promises of youth and eradication of wrinkles. If you ask me, I am yet to see or find a Korean woman's wrinkle!The shops are amazing! They are not cheap but here one has the opportunity to buy genuine, high end brands and good quality items. The shop assistants all ignored me as I guess, a roly-poly, over 50, baby boomer is NOT their target market. We just walked around over 4 nights and I don't think we scratched the surface. Every night, thousands of young, beautiful people massed together to shop, eat, have fun and soak up the incredible atmosphere. We had more fun, ""people watching"" than shopping.There are all the major multi-national retailers like Zara, H&M, Daiso, MCM and the Uniqlo shop claims to be the biggest in Korea etc.Don't expect a lot of English to be spoken and most of the clothes cater to the smaller Asian sizes. Likewise with shoes.Every night was a different experience and a blast. Western people will have a wry smile as foods such as Nutella & banana crepes are considered ""premium"" and priced at the very top end of the scale, whereas to us, this sort of food is no big deal (we have to watch calories, fats, questionable palm oil additives etc. issues that don't even seem to be on the radar in Seoul) It is much better to do as the locals and we learned to love kimchi (fermented cabbage and radish) which is served with EVERY meal.Do yourself a favour and book a tourist, kimchi school lesson, in order to learn how to prepare it and spice it to one's liking.Our stomachs went through a revolution with fermented food and Korean cuisine.Myeongdong is amazing and we absolutely loved it, although it really is more suited to the hipster, under 30, high earning young ones or at least those who are young at heart ;-)The area is extremely well serviced by public transport [subway], buses and moderately priced taxis. No Uber available yet.We soaked up the atmosphere of Myeongdong, dined, wined and walked till we were exhausted and could not go further.This area showcases the success, hard work and achievements of the young, well-educated Korean society, trying to balance tradition and culture with modern technology and progress.Amazing!"
Fun place with an unique layout,"Walked to Myeongdong Shopping Street from the hotel we were staying one day looking for something specific, this place is really unique in its layout, there are maybe a dozen makeup/skin care shops in the area that has multiple stores each around another corner, they sell the exact same things but in case one store runs out of something you can just walk down the street and find another one of the exact same store and chances are they'll have what you are looking for, guess it's a tactic to maximize the store exposure to tourists. Most of the employees there spoke Korean and Chinese, very little English though but since I'm a native Chinese speaker I had no problem getting around. Good little fun place to just hang around."
Great place for street food hunting.,This is the place where you can find a lot of street food varieties. Lot of makeup and facial products also can be found here.However i had a bad experience here with mobile accessories seller. Bargaining is not a option here. They tend to chase you away after you make a payment.
I LOVE THE ATMOSPHERE !,myeongdong street offers wide range of korean food from traditional to modern. All the food are very delicious and i consider the price very affordable. What i like the most are the busy atmosphere of the street.
"Dazzling, exciting Street Food with lots of Korean beauty products PLUS a school that would teach you Kimchi making!","An exciting destination at night when the streets are brightly lighted up and the food in the streets so yummy, from authentic vegie omelet to grilled Lobsters! Wow, they have grilled fresh Scallops, shrimps and squid, too even baby octopus...A taste of hogalbi on a stick is krw3000, chicken bbq is also krw3000. Lobsters costs around krw8000..and if you get tired of eating, go inside the Cosmetic shops and try some BB cream (Korea is where BB cream was invented) or CC cream (moisture content). They come in a lot of forms from tube to Cushion style . there you can get some facial masks.. On sale , buy 3 take 1!!..and if you still have extra time, try getting a kimchi lession along Myeondong street. they have a school there that offers Kimchi making!! you will bring home whatever you made. "
Heaven!!,"If you love beauty products, you must visit this place! There are restaurants and hotels around the area. The biggest Uniqlo is located in this area. Must visit! Make sure to visit during the day. It's crowded at night...VERY crowded!"
Great place for first time in Seoul,"Stayed in Myeungdong while in Seoul for the first time and it was excellent! Plenty of stalls for street food to try out. Although it appears cheap at first, having numerous snacks is actually more than a meal inside a restaurant!Area is typically open from 10 am to 11 pm with nowhere to buy coffee at 7 am and little selection to get snacks after 11 pm!Shops on the side streets are much cheaper than the ones on the main road. Currency exchange was pretty much wholesale rates, better than the 5% surcharge at the airport for USD cash conversion.Coffee is excellent in Seoul with pricing about 2x inside Myeungdong whereas half the price a couple blocks over. Quality is excellent either way."
Bad experience,Prices are much higher than other area in Seoul for the same product. Shopkeepers are extremely pushy and force you to try their product. Feel like it is a tourist scam. I will stay away from this district if I visit Seoul again in the future. 
Shopping and street food,"A wide variety of street food stalls to choose from, ranging from more expensive items like grilled lobster (10000 KRW for small) and grilled abalone, to affordable items like porridge, noodles, etc.The place is also filled with make up and skin care shops, it can be dizzying trying to figure out which brand and type to purchase. When I was there, all shops have 50% discount for facial masks (WOW), and according to my friends, some shops do give free samples."
"a great buzz, plenty of shopping and eating places","Walked there several times during the day and at night. Yes it is very crowded but there are many many streets and alleys to explore. So many shops and eating places to choose from including international brand stores to local Korean. A lot of fun just walking and looking at the shops, the crowds, and trying to work out the foods being sold on the street. Im sure there are other places as well but if staying near City Hall would certainly recommend this as part of the Seoul expereince"
One hectic place to be,"A place where you can buy a lot of stuffs especially facial product or make up. Some little tips, some products may be cheaper in the duty free mall but duty free mall is not as complete as this shopping street yet they still have variety of food from breakfast to supper."
The trendy streets!,"Lotsa trendy clothes and shoes here in Myeongdong! Street carts line the place after 3:30pm onwards! A great place to shope and prices are reasonable!There are loads of Chinese tourists here and dont be surprised if retailers all speaks Mandarin! Do check out the street food and the ""giant mussels"" cart!"
Fun vibrant place,"Visited here on a cold snowy Saturday evening. Great fun atmosphere lots of people, shops open until late, great street food, some items very interesting. Definitely worth a visit. If you are looking for cat cafes as one of our group was this is the place to go."
Quite crowded,"Myeongdong's a great place to go if you wanna shop for makeup and skincare all in one place. It's a nice shopping place but I personally would rather shop someplace else as this area feels so crowded, and I had been grabbed by one of the shopowners in an effort to bring me to one of the makeup shops. Some of the shops also give you free samples so that's cool. "
"Good fun, reasonable prices","A busy evening market, said to go on quite late. Useful mix of street stalls and established international and regional and Korean local shops (H&M, Zara, Giordano, etc). Quite friendly and good for locals and visitors alike."
Good for shopping,"Myeongdong really has just about everything you'd want, shopping wise. The information angels stationed at major junctions were very helpful - they speak English, Mandarin and Japanese. Funnily enough, we went back often for food - O'Sulloc tea house, BBQ galbi ribs and fried chicken."
Interesting shops,"Many brands and products exclusive to South Korea. Lots of cosmetics. Variety of food stalls, restaurants, and coffee shops."
Great place for shopping!!!,"It is great place for shopping and dinning!All kinds of brands of cosmetic and skin care, won't miss any such as Innisfree, etude house, VDL, Holika Holika, skin food etc.. Lotte duty free is also located near by. Few Supermarket open till midnight. Lots of famous dinning restaurant, Korean beef, all u can eat pork, fried chicken, coffee houses and more!If u only have limited time staying in Seoul, just go to Myeongdong shopping street!"
The street of everything and pack with things of your choice!!!,"You want to get yourself pampered with all kind of fashions, facials, trends, unusual street food (this is not the traditional type but created for tourists) and lots of variety of food (restaurants everywhere)!It was truly pack during Christmas day and tonnes of people just wanted to get out of the house and hang around here. You can see so many different type of people (I mean local and tourists)! Get some discounted items on your facial products, sports shoes of all brands (I can't find my size~Arrgh) and nearby is the Nanta Show Centre. We got to taste a good local food ~ A pot for all. It was really good and we actually cannot finish it. Top Korea Tour private guide, Juno Lee brought us there! Yeah I know I can walk there but the purpose was the show and a walkabout in Myeongdong! You won't regret walking to all the streets but avoid the small lanes. There is a Cathedral Church too! Trust me, this place has too many brands for you to choose and I was lost for a moment of time!Once you are out from the Myeongdong Street, you can see the KDrama shooting view that they have taken in some points. Find out on the latest Mermaid story. Oh yeah, things are not cheap there actually but you need to find out which to get and ask for the discount! Majority of the sales person could speak Chinese but a minor can speak basic English! Have fun rounding, shopping and eating!Shop and Eat till you drop!"
SKIN CARE HEAVEN,"my favorite place in SEOUL , my hotel is located near myeong-dong , so do the math . how many time did I went there just to shop for all my skin care and makeup "
Not to be missed,We stayed at the Lotte Hotel just across the road from one of streets leading into the market. Even after a trip to another location we would find ourselves being drawn into the bright lights and great street food of Myeongdong. The shopping is great for accessories like scarves and bags. Lots of cosmetic shops. We found that there is quite a turnover of stalls and new ones pop up on different nights. If you see something you like buy it because it may not be there tomorrow or you won't find the location again. The food in the market (my best was spiral fries on a stick) is better than most restaurants around the market. You can see what you are buying whereas ordering off a menu can lead to some inedible surprises. Aside from going up to the DMZ this was our second favourite experience. 
Ripoff outdoor food carts ,We went practically everyday as our hotel was just across the road and would pick up snacks and have dinner at all the restaurants in the alleyways.The food from all the carts are a tourist trap and charge as much as a full meal for a skewer of food. 1/2 a tiny bag of pomegranate juice at 6000W was the biggest ripoff of all. Their prices were inconsistent and I saw that locals were charged half of what tourists were paying. When I confronted the stall owner he just pretended he couldn't understand me. The restaurants in the alleys are much better and you get a full meal out of the same price.
The streets are alive!,"Love this place...night stalls and cafes and food establishments aplenty. Lots of shopping too. Personally, nothing beats the fact that it is such a vibrant place...especially at night. Plenty of hotels there and a good place to see Seoul by night."
Shopping haven,"This street is full of food and shopping!! Never got tired of it, we were there for 5 nights in a roll coz it's so long and filled with so much food that we couldn't hv sampled all in a single night. Go there empty stomach and eat to your fill! Skin care shops are everywhere... there's a big MCM outlet somewhere too!"
The best place to shop,This is the best place to find all your beauty addiction. Super crowded and a lot of shops you can enter and they also have a lot of promotions. There is also a lot of street foods you can try. 
The best of the best retails stores in Seoul,"Myengdong Shopping District has it all. Apparel, cheap bargains, yummy korean foods, branded clothes, souvenirs, skincare, name it, Myeongdong has it all. If you wanna go cheap finds, you just need to walk around first for you to compare prices and for you to enjoy the whole myengdong district. "
Best shopping district in Seoul,Myeongdong has a great variety of shops to cater for all levels of budget. Range of prices vary so it is important to shop also in the smaller alleys and boutiques. Quality is good and do make sure you get good quality Made in Korea stuff. Lots of cosmetic shops as what Seoul is famous for. Facial masks and hand lotions are aplenty; take time to shop. Samples available freely. Korean street food is simply great and cheap in Myeongdong! Easy to move around and safe. Make sure you have strong arms ready to lug your shopping items around as there is simply too much to see till the very late hours.
What a great place to people watch!,You can snack on everything from cheese-coated lobster to hand spun sugar strings on an almond. Most of the stores are geared towards younger women and couples.
Get a glimpse of Korean shopping street,My stay in Seoul was really short. I stayed in hotel Solaria at Myeongdong. Only night was available for exploring. Its a nice place enjoy busy Seoul nights with street foods. Muslim travelers can explore the street foods as there are several Halal certified restaurants. For shopping I actually saw lots of beauty products shop.
Exciting food trip plus beauty products.. Only in Korea!!,"Fantastic food street ! There were treats for everybody from grilled, saucy chicken Bbq (3000 won) to grilled Scallops and Lobsters (8000 k won). You can also find there shrimps and squids on a stick, yummy strawberries at KWon 6,000.00 and the freshly squeezed promegnarade at krw5000. And if you're tired tasting the new and exciting food in the street, you may want to go inside the beauty shops and treat yourself to a Facial Mask from cucumber , Apple, pineapple to Snail and Ginseng facial mask in a pouch. Buy and give a gift to yourself and your friends at home the original BB CREAM now in Cushion. BY THE way, if you are a kimchi lover, enroll in Kimchi making along MYEONDONG and bring home the kimchi you made !"
Shopping,Every women's place to visit.it's a shopping area where one can buy souvenirs and a lot of cosmetics.
Best place to eat street food,"Myeongdong was the place I probably went to the most while I was in Seoul. For some reason I would gravitate to that place almost every night. The food is pretty cheap depending on what you get. There are many shops but I found many of them started repeating after a certain distance. When I went, the sales for some of the shops were even better than the duty-free places I went to so I do recommend going there for last minute shopping."
A must place to visit for shopping addicts!,A must place to visit for shopping addicts and street food snackers! Lots of skinscare/beauty shops to visit. They even have 3 faceshop stores there! Most shops close at 10pm however street food are open till late. One place I recommend to buy from there and regret not buying more is 'Great King of Castella'. 
Top Touristic Spot in Seoul,"A lot of stores, some of them with really amazing sales (especially cosmetics). You can enjoy the traditional and the modern in this street."
So many shops and restaurants and street food!,"This place is amazing! For the shoppers, they have department store settings with flea market prices!For the foodies - WOW! I wished I had multiple stomachs!!! They have Korea, Japanese, Chinese AND around 4pm majority of the street food vendors start setting up!This is one place that you want to do multiple visits. During the day, they also have people in vests to assist you should you get turned around in this maze of stores and restaurants. It's also pretty clean for the amount of people that's there.The only complaint that I have is that there is a LOT of people there that at times I felt too crowded in. "
Big shopping street ,"It assume all local cosmetics brand such etude house, skinfood, nature republic and including street food at night time. "
Enjoy the night while shopping,"At night the place is visited by many people. Many stores sell goods, especially fashion. We can find good stuff at reasonable prices. Along the way, many people who sell drinks and typical Korean snacks."
Another tourist area,"Crowded and overrated but I'd still choose it over Hongdae any time. The area is huge and it has much more options when it comes to shopping or eating out, also it's possible to find restaurants and bars little bit on the more sophisticated side. I especially like to come here in the mornings when it's almost empty and tourists hasn't flooded the place yet. There are lots of cafes and also cinemas around, it's great to meet up with friends or even your significant other if you're in the mood to spend some time in a lively setting. Come here to exchange money, shop for cosmetics or street food, if that's the sort of thing you're into."
good place,"This is the good place have all of the thing you can buy, And Loisir hotel is a good location in this area."
Shop till you drop!,"This is a shopping heaven for girls! There are lanes and lanes of Korean make up stores throughout Myeongdong Shopping District.We spent lots of time and money here buying all sort of make up and also enjoying the street and restaurant food available.Typically, you can spend the whole day here considering the amount of shops and food you can find here.Also, sinc you are gonna burst your wallet here, its good to know that there are plenty of good money changer in this area, trying asking around for the different rates. You can easily get very very good rates."
Where the locals shop,"We needed another suitcase, so we came here, we looked, and we bought. Plenty of choices within a relatively small area, and prices were good. "
Something for everyone,"As others said, go on an empty stomach and with plenty of money. Street food paradise - make sure you stop by the strawberry mochi stand and the flower gelato place. Lots of shopping but surprisingly little variety - cosmetics, clothes, bags, and socks. Tons of skin care shops, but many of the same chain in different locations. Plus side: awesome 1+1 sales on masks! Massive crowds at all times and occasional vehicle traffic at night.On Sundays (at least the two Sundays I was in town), there are religious groups distributing literature protesting verichip implants. Some of the content may be disturbing to kids (references and images of the ""mark of the beast"")."
