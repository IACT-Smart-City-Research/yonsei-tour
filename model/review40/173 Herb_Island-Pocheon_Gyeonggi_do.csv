"Good place for Family, offcourse not much for Parents but many things for kids^^","Its a good place for whole family visits, especially for kids. There are many things they can look around, Be careful if you go in summer, don't forget to bring some mosquito killer^^ In term of food, there are good restaurant nearby, also not so many things for vegetarian so please check in advacne."
Herb island experience ,"The island is in the middle of mountains, feeling is fresh surrounded with herb gardens, had good experiences mermaid theme room with spa bathtub and herb toiletries provided for a relaxing experience.the parks around are pretty random though with a Santa village , dianosaur park , small diy shop, cafes , with very little food options , little difficult for vegetarians."
Waste of time,This place is like a fake disneyland. More like a cheap edition of it. Everything is fake.Also restaurants are closed or packed most of the time
Excellent place with beautiful night view and various things.,"CY+c ( 19.03.23 ) If visit at daytime, there was point 4, but night time, point 5, I think. There was vast area, and had many various theme things, botanical garden, Santa village, cafe, bakery, memorial place, shop relative herb, and so on. Though I didn't expect this attraction, but there was excellent to us with night view and atmosphere. We spent about 4 hours wandering this area and enjoying various things."
??? not sure about this one.,"So we went late, but I think that is probably for the best. It was winter and not a lot happening. It seems to be a place full of cute photo opportunities. There is a really nice indoor garden, and a craft area where you can make your own soap, candles, bath bombs, shampoo etc. I would like to go back and do this, it takes time though, so be prepared to spend a few hours. Night time is beautiful as it is lit up like a Christmas tree. Worth going late just for this."
Beautiful place,We were here on a cold weather. About -7 degrees centrigade and it was night time. The park is lit with colorful lights. It was amazing. The garlic bread is really tasty. 
Many intresting place for photo,I personally enjoy this place. Can take bus outside the Soyosan Station on ur right. Do not cross Opposite the road. I took taxi there it cost me 13000won. Going back I took bus and need to walk about 10minutes the the bus stop. It was 7pm but it was already dark and is a bit eerie for me as the place is quiet. Best time to go is afternoon until late noon when the lights is up at 5pm. 
Worthful for 5 hours visit,"Can reach by public transportation from Jamsil station. But the bus frequency is not so good. Perfect for taking pictures, peak winter won't be suitable for visiting here. There is a donkey firm here, you can feed carrots for them. Kids will enjoy this place."
Endless Things to Do,"The place with full of entertainment. There are so many artificial waterfall, dianousor land, mini zoo, land of love, botanical garden, cactus garden and many more. Another attraction is healing centre where you will find all the organic cosmetics. The entry fee is only 6000won per adult."
Find the place a bit messy,"Went to the herb Island as a group tour, spent about 3 hours there, had lunch at the traditional market but they only served mutton soup with rice and kimchi pancake. The cafe only served pizza. The restaurant pricing about usd10+. There were many shops that sells candles. Went to the santa village, a bit weird when it is Sept now, but I feel that should pay a visit using the Christmas season, and evening will be better when the lights light up. In the Santa village, u will see Christmas decorations, dinosaurs and right end of the santa village, you can see other small animals like rabbit, hens, piglets, you can also feed Donkey at 1000 won. "
The best wellness center,"Probably my best visit to the wellness center. Here you can spend a good time with your friends, and try a lot of wellness programs at affordable prices. Also on the territory of the park, there are many mini paths and various shops with unusual goods. Also, if you have never tried to make your own perfume, you have that option in Herb Island! Visit this place and I'm sure you will not regret it!"
Herb Island visit,"While I live nearby Herb Island, and have heard a lot about it, I visited for the first time today. I had to go early and didnt have a lot of time. And by the time I left most venues were just opening. I was able to walk around and get some freat shots of the place. I will definietly go back when I have more time. But I did like what I saw. I was able to purchase a bottle of Herb wine which was being sold for 29,000 won at other venues, for 19,000 won. This was from the Aroma shop. Otherwise a beautiful place and well worth exploring."
Winter WonderLand in Herb Island,My visit here was unplanned but I did not regret doing so. The entrance fee is really worth it! The food was suprisingly affordable given the beauty of its premises! I loved the Winter Wonderland they set up! The place is more gorgeous and romantic at night. :)
BEST garlic bread ever!,"If you are a kdrama fan, then you will appreciate this place more. It is where the proposal scene of “oh my venus”. Restaurants are limited but it is still a must place to visit in pocheon. And you should not miss the garlic bread in the herb bakery. I can eat it all day its really yummy. "
"Largest Herb Garden in Korea, Good place to rest & relax & retreat","Pocheon Herb Island is a largest herb garden that runs by private sector. There are many zone inside, eg. Herb Museum, Herb Garden, International Village, Traditional Market, Nostalgia Zone, Small Zoo. They also have many cafes & restaurants. You can taste good quality & fresh vegetable & fruits. You can relax your mind & soul at Healing Center with spas & massage. Do not forget to buy some good quality of herbs, teas & cosmetics. If you would like to rest & relax, they also have many types of pensions to select."
Beautiful place,"Visited this place during weekeday with my boyfriend in the afternoon (around 4pm kst) and there weren't much people visiting on that day. We drove from 지행역 (Jihaeng Station, Subway line 1) all the way up till the herb island. We purchased the tickets at the entrance for ₩6000 each for adult and parking is free of charge. The first impression the place is really big and beautifully decorated with flowers and colorful Led lights. Especially since it is still in the spring season, you can see the beautiful flowers.There are a number of attractions which includes herb cafe, restaurants, bakery shop, souvenirs shop, small shops selling old school snacks and items, and many more. We toured around the place with the guide of map which you can get it at the information centre and it comes with a few languages including korean, english, mandarin, etc. We stopped by the souvenirs shop which sells all kinds of products including herbal teas, candles, soaps, skin care products, herbal jams and many more. We were offered a cup of mint herbal tea and it tasted real good. The place itself was also covered with nice herbs smell. We decided to get a small bite at the bakery shop and their recommended menu was their signature garlic bread. We bought it at ₩5000 a pack and we really loved it. It was so tasty that it makes you want to go more for it.We stayed till 8pm kst taking our time relaxing and taking pictures. Although there is nothing much there, it is good to visit once for first-timers. Overall experience was good and the people were friendly too. Another way to get here is to take Seoul Subway Line 1, alight at Soyosan Station, take the bus 57 and alight at Samjeong-ri station. Go straight at Samcheongol-gil street to get to the herb island. "
Unfriendly to visitors with no knowledge of Korean Language,"(1) Taking Subway Line 1 to Herb Island: note that not all Line 1 ends at Soyosan Station. At Soyosan Station, after you exit, you need cross the road to the bus stop directlt opposite the station to take bus 57 or 57-1 to Herb Island.You can seek bus driver's help to alert you when it is the place to alight. But have the place written in Korean if you can't say it in Korean.Note also the bus-stop you alight is also the bus-stop you take the bus to Soyosan Station.(2) After I bought the entrance ticket, I was shocked to see a super steep slope to walk up. The worst is, the Information Centre is right in the centre of the place and all signages are in Korean Language only. But more dismay to come, I found out too late that the only language use is Korean. But it saves me lots of money because I was not tempted to buy any of the herb products since everything is in Korean and I don't understand.(3) While it claims to open all year round, when I visited, lots of places were closed. The activities and herb experience were unavailable too."
Nice and relaxing place to visit.,Nice and relaxing place to visit. Take bus number 57-1 from opposite direction of Soyosan Station approximately 30mins ride from Soyosan to the village. You'll need to walk approximately 7-10mins from the bus stop to the village. Or you can take Taxi from station to village for approximately KRW @15000 Enjoy the LED light scenery at night. 
Quirky Korean Treat,"Went in a bus tour to Herb Island from Seoul. Group left at 2:00pm, got there before 4:00. This left us time to see things in the light before it got dark and the magic of Christmas happened. There is a spa on site with massages, aroma therapy, and various other treatments. Everything smells very manufactured and not true oils in many of the shops. They do have a sizeable lavender field, but I'm not sure if they distill their own oil or not.After dark, the lights come on, all over, millions of Christmas lights. Christmas in Korea seems to be for couples, as there were many ""love"" and ""heart"" signs and lights to take selfies with. There is an Italian area with paddle boat gondolas that you can take around the moat. If you are lucky, you can catch the K-pop performance in the pavilion there. On the other side of the road, there is a large scale Trevi Fountain. The restaurant had a varied menu, not just Korean food, which made the child happy. They served wine which made the parents happy.I've been once, glad I went, but will not go back for Christmas again. I do hope to get there in the summer when the lavender and other gardens are in bloom. "
Christmas Time is the best time to come visit!,"Excellent for couples wishing a romantic evening under the lights and families with elementary aged children and up wishing good photo ops. You have to ask about making the soap it is 2 pieces for 12,000 Won in the main large gift shop in the hotel area. My girls liked walking around seeing the lights, the greenhouse garden, as well as the gift shops and feeding the donkeys. If it weren't lit up I don't think they would have enjoyed it as much.I would recommend as a romantic getaway more than for families, but it was a great one-time trip for good photos."
Not a fantastic place to visit,"After reading the reviews and saw the Christmas lightings during winter, I held in high anticipation to visit this place. However, great disappointment. This place is pretty run down and nothing much for young kids. There is a dino place with displays of a few broken and poor maintained dinosaurs. The flower garden looks run down and are covered with fake flowers. The herbs museum nothing interesting with some Rosemary, banyan trees, etc. The so called gondola ride is not working with construction going on near to it. Hence, is really an awful site. The Santa village has a donkey feeding area and a souvenir shop. Nothing much. The only comforting part is the Athenas hall restaurant, near to the main entrance which the food is tasty and very reasonably priced. The herbs bakery sells very yummy garlic breads, biscuits. We took about 2 hours plus yo drive from Seoul to herbsisland. There is traffic jam along the way. It is not really worth to visit and to spend a day to travel all the way here . We got free entrance tickets from the Seoul tourism office in Singapore. We did not even stay until at night to watch the winter lights. Whilst we are there, there were not much visitors. "
Herb island,"Quite a long journey out (abt 1.5-2hrs) travelling time by car.. The venue is not as interesting as expected, although pictures have colourful background, nice flowers n herbs. Bakery, herb experience are the little shops to pop by. Do download the Korea voucher for discounted entry fee."
"Free admission, huge area, quite run down due to lack maintenance",Took a cab from the nearest train station to herb island. Roughly about 15mins cab ride. When return can also ask the information counter to help to call cab. Many many plants and flower. Good for photo taking. Personally I feel the place is quite rundown. It's free admission anyway. 
Beautiful flowers and herbs all year long,"This is my first visit here and I enjoyed it! No regrets. Came here on Sun 12 June 2016 (note many places of interest in Seoul including Herb Island are closed on Mondays). Prior the trip, we booked a bus (KRW$5,000) for a return ride from Seoul via email - brain@pncvalley.com. However if they are not responsive, you can consider finding other contacts online - there are many tour buses out there. Assembly place was very convenient at Line 1 Cityhall subway station, Exit 3. Departure is 0930 and boarding of bus for return is 1700. Bus journey took about 1.5 hours single trip. Upon reaching destination, we headed to the tourist booth for a map. It's a theme park with various venues to visit. Take note that map isn't updated as cautioned by the friendly staff. We had a leisurely stroll appreciating the beautiful flowers and herbs that were in bloom. Totally loving this trip. Garden was spruced with beautiful, cheerful looking flowers! The locals at the fragrance store (Store 10) and cafe provided excellent customer service which made us felt very welcomed. The ladies at the fragrance store were very charming and helpful attending to our queries.However the customer service at the DIY experience making shop (Store 5 marked on their English Language tourist map at the info booth) was terrible. We visited the shop on Sunday 12 June at 3pm. Instead of approaching us to check if we are keen to make crafts, cashier counter lady gave the tourists (there were only less than 10 of us in the store) and me the death stare as we looked through the intricate items. Anyway we wanted to purchase some items and noted the signs on the shelves stated no touching but seriously, there's no point to display such small intricate items for sale if we can't pick it up to look at what we wanted to purchase. The death stare lady suddenly raised her voice rudely cross her defence post (the payment counter) at 3 tanned looking tourists behind me that they should not touch the items. I felt offended and stunned even though I was not them. We can understand English. What this staff could have done was to gently approach them to assist without treating them rudely. We have consumer rights and we are all adults - there is no need for the voice raising. In the end, after contemplating, my friends and I left the shop immediately even though we wanted to purchase some items. Lost of small revenue for that shop due to poor customer service.Now Herb Island, if you want to continue business and impress good sincere customer service to International Tourists, please make sure you train your staff like how the fragrance store staff are. Either that, remove those intricate fragile souvenirs for sale so that it removes the tension and fear that customers will break the items.Overall, I won't let one small matter spoil this trip. Herb Island is worth a visit for first-timers, family and couples. Do pack some light snacks as variety of food isn't widely available there. Stop by Store 10 Fragrance Store as marked on map for awesome retail therapy!"
I enjoyed this place in this trip in Korea. Dont miss this good place to visit.,"The journey from Seoul to Herbs Island was great and about just nice. Took about 1.5hrs by train including transfers, bus ride and walking to the entrance of the attraction. Must catch the timing of the bus as it's quite accurate.Herb island give you some kind of out of city experience, there are colorful flowers, plants and aroma everywhere. Key attraction is the donkey feeding, children riding, peacock, piglets, stretch of lavender flowers across the field with the santa claus village. Food at the restaurant was reasonably priced and food is also not bad."
Biggest Herb Island in Korea,"This place is the BIGGEST Herb Island in Korea. There are many interesting zones inside this island, eg. Herb Museum, Santa Village, Mini Zoo, Many Concept Theme Gardens. A lot of restaurants served many kinds of healthy / organic foods. At the Healing Center, you can relax with the massage service and enjoy shopping herbs products. Don't forget to try the nice & excellence accommodation here... highly recommend."
Relaxing in Herb Island,"Herb Island where tourists can use fresh natural herbs to make various products such as cosmetics, soaps, and candles. I've got to admit, this is one of the most beautiful places I've seen here in Korea. But don’t be misled though, because Herb Island is not an actual island, it’s more of a theme park. I would highly recommend Herb Island as the perfect romantic dating place for couples. It's not surprising that many Korean dramas also chose this place as a filming location. The scenery was even better at night when the entire place lights up with colorful lights. Don't forget to try the gondola ride as well."
"Review of Herb Island in Pocheon, Gyeonggi Province, South Korea","Want to experience something Mediterranean without the need to go there directly? Then ""Herb Island"" in Pocheon, Gyeonggi Province is a must visit place for you whenever you visit Korea.""Herb Island"" is actually not a place surrounded by any body of water as you think it is but rather it is a place where you can enjoy, experience and have a relaxing getaway either with family or friends. In here visitors got the chance to experience first hand how to make organic herb soap, hand cream, scented candles and much more. Not only that visitors can also do couple of experience program offered generously by the management of Herb Island.Crucial to point out when you visit to Herb Island is to wear comfortable clothes and shoes for you will definitely would want to go to all places all day long until night. Night scenery of Herb Island is just so awesome that you would want to stay longer."
Great place!,"Even though it was not as full of herb aroma as I expected it would be, you are going to meet a new world everything regarding herb stuff ranging from soap to something to eat!MUST visit place in Pochoen.If you are planning to stay Pochoen couple of days, I strongly recommend you sleep pension in herb island. So romantic!"
Was a great Place that was easy to get to by Rent a Car,"We left from Seoul Ktx Station in a rent a car and drove to Herb Island. Just plug it into the navagation and off you go. Directions were easy and drove right to it. It cost 6,000 per person and i think was well worth it. Its in the country for sure and i love things set in nature. Parking was free and it was on a wedsneday so the place was not busy at all, which is great. First thing that we did when we got there was have some lunch at one of the Galbi restaurants and that was not busy so was relaxing and cook at your table.. foods were good and not that cheap but we dont mind paying some money for good foods. Then we started walking and went to the Herb Shop first, i like the smells and as you enter someone asks if they can put some peppermint oil on your neck. I tried it and kind of burned a little on my skin so i wasnt crazy about it. I guess it was a way of trying to sell it.. Then we walked in and was offered a mixed tea sample.. the tea was incredible tasting.. I had two glasses and they had a special if you buy two then you get two glasses to go with it for free... why not?? We looked around and they had a couple other demonstartions but only purchased the teas. Then we went out to the greenhouse and it was huge... they had herbs and flowers and was like a maze inside.. We came out one side and there was like a Santa Village place with a whole bunch of places to take pictures..We had a great time with this.. Made some one of a kind pics for sure.. different poses and went around to all of the places.. Was really fun and the weather was perfect not to hot or humid.. Perfect day and we walked down to the end of the road where we saw some mules.. In the cages were some other animals like some rabbits and peacock.. We purchased some carrots to feed the Mules but.. we saw a place with a small pig and another with two goats and they liked carrots too.. I took some great pics of feeding them and we spent 2,000 only and had a great time they were so cute and sorry to the mules...Then we walked around back to the greenhouse and it took you to some beautiful ouside gardens with flowers and herbs and i know alot about flowers and especially herbs so was cool to see. Got some great pictures. There was a section that had kids rides but we were not interested in that so didnt go to that section. We walked into some other areas in which looked like a place to hold old fashioned Korean weddings. was pretty cool. Had a room with old fashioned classroom and a place where they used to process and dry flowers.. We had so much to eat for lunch that we didnt go to the bakery but it smelled good. The place needs a little paint and tender loving care but overall it was worth the drive.. check it out"
"Great place with naturopathic theme, albeit a bit inaccessible","The bus was rather irregular from Soyosan station, and I hailed a cab to go there which cost around 18,000won. You ought to check out the schedule before you get there, and in addition, plan your day early on. It is better to arrive there earlier than later. When you stay on until the evening, you might be lucky enough to see the illuminations around the gardens, and they add to a sense of mystery and beauty to this 'oasis' in the middle of rural Gyeonggi-do. Personally, I would like to make another visit there again in summer, but I want to be sure that I plan my trip earlier in the day instead of the afternoon. The restaurant inside the site was rather good."
"It was a fun family day, cheap","We spent 6000 won(six dollars)each to get in. It needs a coat of paint but it's silly decor and beautiful gardens are worth every penny. Go to the bakery, the chamomile bread is delicious along with all the baked goods. I loved feeding the donkeys, goats and tiny pigs. They give you a tiny stick that you put carrots chunks on to feed them. Lots of photo ops. They shopping is plentiful and not too expensive. It was a great afternoon! The best restaurant in in top of Athena on the back side."
Way off the beaten path,"My wife and I went here in June. It was an escape from the hot, humid city. The park is run down and totally kitsch but go! The food is delicious and reasonably priced. The spa looks luxurious but we weren't there for that. In another far part of the park was a santa and Christmas themed area that was totally creepy. Go and enjoy the food, weirdness and over the top attempt to be foreign. You won't find anything else like it. You'll find yourself wanting to return a second time for the food, soaps and nicknacks. Trust me!"
Definitely unique!,"Although this is a beautiful place, we felt as though at times it was a bad dream. Complete with cement paddleboat gondolas and random placement of smurfs and disney characters, to say it's ""unique"" is an understatement. Bus 57 wouldn't stop for us to get back home. We had to call a cab."
Not only for summer~~~,Herb Island is a fun place to spend a few hours. In the winter they have covered everything and anything with lights which makes a beautiful scene. They also have some shows on the main stage and great activities for all~~~
