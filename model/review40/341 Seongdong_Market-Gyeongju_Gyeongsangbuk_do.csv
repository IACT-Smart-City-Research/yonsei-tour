Great place to sample different dishes,Great market and nice food! The food stalls are great in the evening and we also found some very tasty handmade mozzi in the market. A great place to must visit when in Gyeongju.
Good choice of food day and night ,"We visited the market during the day and evening for good cheap local food. During the day all the stalls are open there was a choice of freshly made food available with lots of locals eating. In the evening there is 25 different food stalls that open each one selling a different dish, we tried a selection they were all tasty. "
Great place with kids,"You don't really know what to eat in the evening? Kids all like different stuff?That's your paradise of food. All pretty nice and prices are ok.If you are a bit more adventurous, you can try one of the restaurants in the middle of the market.Enjoy!"
Fish . Fish . Fish.,It's a fish market as you will see from the title some vegetables and the odd tin pan little else so if you've seen one before you've seen this one.
Your average South Korean open air market,"The market is extremely close to the Gyeongju train station and is protected from the elements, making it a good place to visit for an hour or so - if you have nothing left to do in Gyeongju.The market itself seemed quite old and a little dirtier and more rundown than the open air markets I saw in Seoul. The whole complex is quite large, containing stalls selling various food items from seafood to meat to vegetables to fruits. However, it was quite devoid of customers when I visited on a weekday afternoon.I would put this low on your priority list when you visit Gyeongju."
Great Experience!,"This is a large covered market, which during daytime seem to sell household goods and foodstuffs.At sundown, it transforms itself into a street food type food market. There are a large number of individual food outlets where you can watch the food being prepared in fast food style. You can buy different types of food from different outlets and mix and share.There is general seating areas to sit down and consume your food. The best way to describe the place is that it is halfway between an ordinary, dusty, smelly street food market and an upmarket Food Mall!If you want a drink there are plenty of sellers selling beer or rice wine (soju).The whole place seems to be well regulated and is hygienic and safe.Very definitely worth a visit."
Interesting Market,"This market, only a minute or 2 away from the trainstation, houses all kind of vendors. You will find people selling suitcases while others sell spices, veggies or fish. Then you will find vendors for all kind of dishes & sweetsv(if you like pankakes, try the ones which have the shape of a fish and come filled with custard or red bean paste - the later one being a favored sweet treat all over south east asia...) The market seems to be organized in sections..like you hardly find people selling chunks of raw pork next to one selling sea food. The food at the vendors seem good and prices reasonable. If you buy veggies/fruit...ask the price before...Greetings & enjoy the trip :-)"
