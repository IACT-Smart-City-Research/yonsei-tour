Excellent modern facilities!,"As far as convention centers go, this one is very good! Facilities are excellent. There is a coffee shop, 7-Eleven, and beer pub inside the convention center, which is nice. But not a lot else immediately nearby."
Modern and Complete,"Building was completed with modern and suitable for international meetings that accommodate many countries with various cultures and religion, "
Interesting,"It is very close to the Premier Incheon Hotel, Central Park, Metro Station and Lotta Supermarket. Lots of conferences are hosted there."
Unique Architecture,"South Korea is a country where business tourism is rapidly growing. If you'd ever visited Korea to attend an exhibition or convention meeting, you must have known COEX in Seoul or BEXCO in Busan. Songdo Convensia is the only international convention center in the city of Incheon where Incheon International Airport is located. It is only 20 mins. by car from the airport to the convention center. Many business travellers visit there and participate in a meeting or an exhibition. The place is famous for its unique design. Some people say that the design is from the Opera House of Sydney but its design is from the Mountains of Taebaek in Korea. I heard that the designer of the convention center had an idea on the plane at moment of looking the entire view of the Korean peninsula with many mountains. "
Modern looking for Songdo,"This convention center have a super modern design, that fits the Songdo style as a modern business district.Just walk by, it's nice"
Beautiful architecture!,"Located near Central Park, the architecture of this building is beautiful. Near the subway of Uni of Incheon."
A regular big city convention center,"A convention center next to the Oakwood Premier and Sheraton hotels. Very much in line with other large convention centers. There are various activities here (we went to a dinner presentation) that make a visit interesting. By itself there is really nothing to look at or look for. The architecture is interesting, but the center is set among an architectural free-for-all that makes for interesting sightseeing."
a grand events place!,"everything is state-of-the-art! you can't ask for anything more in this venue..wifi is strong and free, food is delicious, sound system is very efficient, staff are courteous..."
Awesome Place,State of the art facilities with super speed wifi all over the place. So many convenient sites and shops around the convention centre. 
Complete Convention Center,"We ve been there for an International Convetion trip. It is basically a large convention hall with lots of well serviced rooms. Toilettes are very clean. Equipments are nice and we had a very good time. If you plan your next conference in Korea, probably it worth a try. Several high level hotels are in the 0.5 mile range, along with very good restaurants and malls."
Great place for kids,We took our young students here for a field trip. It is basically a large convention hall with lots of inflatable slide and bouncing houses for them to play in. The kids had a wonderful time and it was easy to keep an eye on them because everything was so open.
