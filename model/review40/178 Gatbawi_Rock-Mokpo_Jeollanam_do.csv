Worth it if you're in Mokpo,"The Gatbawi Rocks were very neat. Situated near multiple museums and a nice park, it's a great place to go. Its a quick easy walk around a boardwalk on the water to get to them. The plaques explain the stories and history of the rocks. They have it in multiple languages, including English, Chinese and Japanese. Great for photos and doesn't take long. For better views, follow a trail to the top of the cliff overhead for views of the water and surrounding area. Be sure to wear good shoes if you do this. For just the boardwalk, footwear isn't as critical. But you do want a camera."
Interesting story behind it.,An interesting rock formation by the seashore. Erosion over centuries has carved out 2 figure heads which appears as if they are wearing old style Korean hat. To find out what the story is you will have to visit !
Mokpo,My son visited the site before and I looked forward to seeing it and I was not disappointed it really is special to see and read the history I lived visiting and would highly recommend it
Worth the quick walk and photo stop.,The rocks are only 100 meters from the main road .There is a large sign marking the spot and a loop walk of 5 minutes will get you to the site.There is a explanation board there and an easy photo.Worth the effort.
Nice but can’t fully visit,"They are probably nice and sweety (the meaning at least) but I couldn’t see them due to work reason, they are under costruction or sometjing... i climbed the rock on top and reached them from top..the view btw is spectacular of the whole bay...it was also foggy day and looked like Pirate’s Island "
A nice evening walk by the coast,"We took an evening stroll along the waterfront area straddling from two major attractions, the water fountains and the Gatbawi Rock, in Mokpo, South Korea. There are lots of locals walking briskly or slowly like us. The lifestyle is relaxed in contrast to the big cities. "
good walking site,"its walking line is connected to the new sightseeing site, Peace square. I think this place is one of the best playing places in Mokpo."
One of the best place in Mokpo,The rock formation is very unusual and uniquely shaped. The city has built a deck in front of it to see and walk around. The sea itself is very beautiful and the hill above it offers a pleasant walk and nice view. There are other attractions nearby. You don't need to make a separate trip just for it.
"Nice, if you're there",It's quite a nice walk and i think very enjoyable during the spring or when the weather is nice. the walk is fairly short and there isn't much reason to linger by the rocks but its verypleasant and the rocks have a nice story. It's nice to visit if you're in the area and want to enjoy a day at the park of have a short hike afterwards.
Pay them a visit while you're there,Nice how weather could shape these rocks in what they are now. From the walkway you can admire these two and at night they're illuminated (luckily not as excessively as the walkway)
Nice walk along the water,"I think koreans are very good at giving meaning to everything they come across. This a nice walking path along the water. I discovered it accidently while returning from a visit to the National Maritime Museum. There is a sad story behind these two rocks, but I'm not going to spoil anything. It is a short walk, very pleasant along the water, but also very crowded on a sunny day."
Thought provoking Gatbawi Rock,"From the light jade green waters touching the shore at Gatbawi Rock, to the shapes of the figures and the images they conjure up, a visit here is very enjoyable. Images of the rock formations can be taken easily from the Boyaenggyo Bridge. We were there on an overcast, cool and breezy day in February 2016. For photography buffs, the colours will really stand out at sunrise/sunset, or in the evening when the rock figures are illuminated. There's also lots to see and do in this area of Mokpo along the banks of the Yeoungsan River...."
Interesting site and story,Gatbawi can be viewed day or night due to the great lighting and wooden walkway over the ocean. The story attached to the rocks is cool and I was pleasantly surprised by this natural attraction. The waterfront is a great place for a stroll with many coffee shops and places to relax and so walking down to see Gatbawi is a no brainer!
Beautiful at night,Gatbawi Rock has a great walking path. The lights attract small fish and jellyfish. The only thing that I didn't like was that fishing is allowed on the boardwalk. Some inconsiderate and seemingly inexperienced 'fishermen' obstructed the path and even cast their lines over groups of people. 
Great first encounter with Korea,My host family took me for a walk to this rock the frst morning I was in Mokpo! I loved every minute of it and the quality time I was able to spend with my adopted family! I would definitely recommend the walk and seeing the natural beauty of the city!
