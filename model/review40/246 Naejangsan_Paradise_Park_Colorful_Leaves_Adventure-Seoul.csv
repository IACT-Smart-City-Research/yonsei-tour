Travel with confidence.,"Before engaging the service of this tour operator, I checked many reviews and found little information about them and the response to the few very positive reviews were met with much sskepticism. The price seem to be higher than competitors. I gave World Heritage tour a try nevertheless. I asked for non-smoking English speaking guide who is into outdoor activities and photography, and the director Rorne arranged one as requested. Mr Hans (Han Seob) KIM, our guide cum driver, was punctual, attentive and all along the way followed our pace. We were not at our physical best after a red eye flight, so took us longer to trek up Daedunsan. He was very patient with us even though he might end up finishing late. Naejangsan was less strenuous but requires an early start (arriving before 9am) to avoid the crowd. Hans collected us at 730am from our hotel in Jeonju. The scenery at the hills was good, the trekking and walking along the path very enjoyable. Everything went according to plan and we had short queues for connecting bus and cable car ride. At the end of our tour, when driving back to Seoul Hans was careful as usual and did not speed even though his service should end at 5pm. He kept the vehicle immaculately clean and comfortable too. . So if you are first time travelling to Korea and want a reliable tour operator, give them a try. And Mr KIM sent me the photographs he took along the way too at the end of the day. Worth spending a bit more for extra comfort. "
Naejangsan is the best autumn holiday destination in the world!,"Naejangsan is a famous mountain in the Jeolla-do province, and the best mountain in Korea for viewing autumn’s crimson leaves. The park is 76,032 sq. km. in size and the name Naejang means 'many secrets' in the mountain. Because of the bright crimson leaves that blanket Naejangsan Mountain’s fall scenery, the mountain is also referred to as ""Geumgangsan of Honam."" I was there last September and maybe I was lucky as it was the peak autumn season and the colors of the foliage and the tree leaves were incredibly beautiful and with bright colorful colors.The profile picture of this page was exactly what I saw when I was there. I engaged a guided tour with World Heritage Network and after following the Director of Tour, Mr.Rorne's advice to delay my original tour dates to another week, it was a blessing in disguise. It was really the best and right time to visit. According to the locals, I came at the best time to view the leaves and it was like an enchanted garden of eden plus many and plenty of colors of leaves everywhere. I will always remember this trip and I am also planning to go there again to explore the mountain top. I missed it the last time as I was late and the cable car was already closed. Anyone who comes to Korea must really visit this most unique and beautiful attraction at Jeongeup. Safe to say it has a reputation to be the most beautiful autumn holiday destination in the world!"
