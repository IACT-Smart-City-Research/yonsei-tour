Pretty campus ,If you are on a budget try campus tours. This is definitely one of the campuses you shouldn't miss...close to Ewha University.Nearest subway is Sinchon station.
"3.5 stars, beautiful campus","If you visit Ehwa Women's University, you should also come here. It has some attractive buildings and nice landscaping and it is one of the best universities in Korea."
Nice Campus especially during autumn,"Came here for exchange a long time ago and the campus had undergone renovations. There may not be any main attraction here as compared to Ewha University but overall, the vibe is better. Not a must go place for tourist but for prospective students, this is a great campus."
Nice campus but nothing special,I came here for a visit because one of my friends took a semester of school here. The campus was surrounded by trees which made it really pretty but otherwise it is not particularly special.
