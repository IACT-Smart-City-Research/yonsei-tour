Easy hike to reach a breath taking white forest,"We decided to take this less traveled route because the forest has inspired many painters and otters artists. The climb wasn't difficult and eventually we reach the beautiful forest of white trees. It was a wonderful feeling walking through the forest but despite that it was a weekday, the forest was still crowded and the non-stop talking by the locals killed the ambience. Otherwise it would be perfect."
