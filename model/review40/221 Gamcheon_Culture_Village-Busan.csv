Arty village with history,"This was a lovely little village that’s been turned into a large tourist site. Be sure to buy a stamp map at the tourist desk, where you can follow and collect the stamps and the stamp route will give you a diverse course exploring this quaint arty village and a good workout as it’s hilly and some areas has lots of stairs. Everyone we met at this village is super friendly but please be mindful that this village is also someone’s home and to respect their privacy too. "
Lovely walk around village,"I was hesitant at 1st because we did Hanok villages and they were all same..but this was beautiful..lucky to have sunny day..beautiful view of colors of the houses. We walked around the whole village,took couple of hours..Has coffee shops & souvenior shops.We got a local bus from main city and got off just before the steep hill to village..then got a mini bus No 2that took us to the entrance of Culture Village..too steep to walk..so. take a mini bus."
So beautiful ,The village is amazing and you can take really great photos here. It's a must see if you're in Busan! 
Quite visually attractive ,"Lots of colorful houses near the water provide the setting for a sweet vacation spot. Bring good shoes, as it is quite hilly here. Good place to find souvenirs. Most enjoyable walking around and finding the unexpected treasures. "
Korea's answer to the Cinque de Terre,A great place to wander round and see the old style houses and the little museums and when you need a coffee break you can find a place that looks out over the rest of the colourfully painted suburb
Gamcheon Culture Village/Busan,"Interesting place to go on your own by taxi. With 2 GFs, we had a good time with lots of pictures taken with the painted mural walls, a village of colorful houses. The main attraction was finding the statue of Little Prince perching on a platform, overlooking the colorful village of houses. Long queue to take photo with Little Prince. Lots of local souvenirs to hunt for.. we bought pretty hats to coordinate in our photo taking.Overall worthwhile to roam around with my 2 GFs."
Piece of South Korea’s History,"Thoroughly enjoyed walking through this historical area (for refugees of Korean War). Today, it offers fun photo opportunities, snacks and crafts."
Just get lost!,"The best thing to do here is to get lost! We got our bearings over coffee in the Avant Garde Café at the top of the hill where the taxi rank and buses are, then set off. We managed to discover a temple, the House of Peace and the Steps to the Stars (luckily on the way down!) and several interesting murals and colourful statues of people and animals. There was a massive queue by the Little Prince and his fox so we didn’t hang around for a photo. "
The BEST place in South Korea!!!,"Of all the places we visited in Seoul and Busan, htis cultural village tops our list!! It reminds me of the Rocinha favela that we visited in Rio de Janeiro many years ago. This village is so unique and full of character. Despite the narrow lanes that snake through the residents' houses, I don't feel claustrophobic or cramped like I did when I visited the Hanok Village in Seoul. There are also many quaint shops and tea houses here. Overall, it is a very classy place, and not too touristic or tacky. I love ths place! Highly recommended!!!"
Cute village,"This is one of those places that's a nice photo stop of all the different colored houses. However, if you spend some time there, you see what poor conditions exist there. It's not really a nice place to go to, just one to get a few quick pics of."
Contemporary art meets traditional Korean culture ,"Spent a wonderful half-day at Busan's version of Positano and Santorini with its blue-painted houses hugging the hillsides overlooking the sea, that is, Busan Harbour. From MRT station Toseong take Bus No 2 which takes you right up to the village, dropping in front of a restaurant selling buckwheat noodles and other delicious Busan specialties. There's a socks shop with all manner of socks at 1000 won per pair. The souvenir shops here are worth browsing as the trinkets, pouches and tote bags are well-designed and nicely made.In fact, everything here is artistic, from the murals and installations to the cafes and community spaces. Go down the steep and narrow alleyways, you'll see plenty of cats and their families, there's even a display celebrating the feeding of strays. A real market lies at the bottom of one path while a little museum displays retro items like a millstone, dial telephone, gramophone and record player.There are several spots created for photo opportunities including one with umbrellas and two pairs of workmen boots, red and blue. Plenty of street and snack food, including the famed fishcakes besides ice-cream and waffles.We went back on bus 27 which goes directly back to Busan Station. Great fun for families but may be challenging for the elderly and disabled. "
Not a big deal,"I've seen neighborhoods like this is many parts of the world, is nice but not amazing... Not a place to have dinner, lots of peiple walking but goo views of the city"
A cute village,"The place is packed with tourists, local and foreign - there isn't a lot to do here, mostly pop up shops and food stands along with some small art galleries. The experience as a whole felt inauthentic, but the colourful village panoramas are a viable compensation."
Waste of our time,"We took a taxi from Jagalchi Market which cost us only about 4500 Won. We were disappointed with the place as we felt there isnt anything ""cultural"" about it. There are some cafe, some rental of costumes and also a view of the houses below. Overall, we felt it was a wasted trip as we didnt enjoy the place at all."
Long queue for Prince,"Im not sure the way I went to the village is correct but the bus dropped us at the walk side and we need to walk a long deep road in order to reach the village. Anyway, we took taxi at KRW3,300 (min cost per ride) to reach the village in 1 min.There is alot souvenir shop before you saw those houses and the price is higher than other market (tourist place). One thing I feel funny is the queue to take photo with Prince, very long and min waiting time is at least 30-40mins (because one person may take few angles). End up, we just enjoy our tea time and snack next to the Prince. It really pretty if you take a far distance photo from top of the houses as the special here is the colourful houses theme."
Colorful & Bright!,"This is a gem! Cute colorful houses, good backdrop - Perfect for pictures! Easy to get too as well. The combination of colorful houses, hills, ocean are just perfect! A definite must go place!"
Colorful Village,Went there with 2 of my mommy friends! Quite far from the city proper but worth the trip. So many places to see and try new stuffs. Very very colorful and you can experience the culture of the Koreans here. Lots of place to have that perfect picture. Definitely worth the visit!
I came here on a rainy June day but it's still very nice,"I visited Gamcheon Village on early June 2018 and love the way people built this small fishing village. Walking here following the map, seeing interesting outdoor decoration, buying hand-made souvenir, having a hot coffee or chocolate with the great view of the village and the sea and taking photos are my activities here. The village is closed to the Jagalchi seafood market where is a good place to have lunch, hence, you can visit Gamcheon in the morning then drop by Jagalchi for lunch or come to Jagalchi first to have a big seafood lunch then go to Gamcheon in the afternoon."
Cannot be missed,"Such a unique place! We enjoyed our 3-4 hours walk on the main streets and in between the lanes. However, it’s quite painful to lose your way as it meant extra effort to climb up and down the stairs. We bought a map for 2000 won on which you can collect stamps along the way. Some stamp points will give out free postcards. If you are not interested in collecting the stamps, just take a photo of the map at the bus stop, they are exactly the same. Do not miss the photo taking spot behind the bus stop too. Le petit prince stop is so popular there was a queue to take picture. We didn’t bother to queue as some tourists just took their own sweet time to take photos. I just took a few shots as the tourists took their turns... chanced upon a nice noodle shop near the end of the trail runs by a middle-aged lady. She sells hot and cold noodle and homemade enzymes. Try it out!"
Must visit in Busan !,"It's a culture village where you can find the local and foreign everywhere. Come early so you don't have to wait for a long queue to taking picture with the 'iconic prince'. Every shop is unique and you can spot a beautiful view everywhere.Please where a comfortable shoes because the pathway may be too steep. After all, this is a hill area so you will have a lot of hiking up and down. But the scenery here is very awesome."
Rare finding,Noted the neighborhood spirit and persistence in maintaining its legacy. The intimate nature and unique character was something to see
must do in Busan,"Gamcheon Culture Village mush go atraction spot in Busan. The colorful houses, mural art and coastal view make our trip memorialable. Lots spot to take picture and enjoy the view from the cafe with good brew coffee. good place to buy small souvenir."
Love the colorful houses,"Pretty view especially during sunset, when the sunlight is against the colorful neighborhood. Lots of picture worthy spots. A bit uphill. Good for an afternoon stroll."
Beautiful view of Santorini of Busan,"Beautiful view of Gamcheon Culture Village-Santorini of Busan. This place is nice photo shoot. It's can be reach by subway ​Toseong Station (line 1, exit 6).Take Bus Saha 1-1 or Seogu 2/2-2 to Gamcheon Culture Village stop."
Very colourful village,It looks more like an artist village. Many places to take nice pictures. Quite hilly with spectacular view. 
Gamcheon cultural village,"So nice village. Though it was the poorest village, now its the most visited. Rent a costume while touring the village."
"Beautiful village, well worth visiting",A wonderful meander through the streets of this village surrounded by colour . Some great views too. 
"A must, of course!",A must to visit of course! The place gets crowded / more lively as the day goes. One can easily spent half a day here for the view and do some souvenir / food shopping.
Tourist trap,"Went here full of expectations & left feeling totally disappointed. Yes it looks stunning from a distance with vibrant colours on the buildings overlooking Busan. However on arriving you had to pay for a basic tourist map ? (It’s not the £1.50 I was bothered about but the principle - it set the scene for the village). It’s an alternative row of coffee shops, small restaurants and tourist shops. It markets itself as the Machu Picchu of Korea & Santorini of Korea - its a bit like comparing Liverpool FC with a 3rd division team ! There are the odd few areas to take nice pictures. There were some very small exhibits of interest but this place was a massive disappointment"
Gentrification ,"A fantastic cultural experience, great to see the transition from shacks to modernity. South Koreas equivalent of Rios favelas. A must see!"
Colorful Container Like Village,"We catch a cab from around Seomyeong Station to this Village for Krw11k. The view of this whole village is best taken from 2 spots near the Avant Garde Café. Just follow a side road (left side) down to these 2 spots - less than 30m away! Most tourists joinging tours will start from the information centre, a road on the right side. The views from other spots as suggested by the tourist map (cost Krw 2k) are not as good. We walked down to the famous instagram spot - the little prince. Not impressed from first impression but still Q up to take photos like everyone else. For better photography, recommended to go early before 8am or after 4pm. We were there almost noon time and the light was too glaring. We joined a night tour and dropped by this little prince again for a night shot, it was totally quiet! Gamcheong Village may looks like Cinque Terre. Check out the differences."
Culture village,"Simply breathtaking, I was amazed at the beauty of so many small homes so close together. The colors of the homes all went so well together. I would like to live there today if I could. A must see in Busan"
Colourful village,"Perhaps the term ""Cultural"" is not the best description for Gamcheon. As some reviewers mentioned, the village didn't give them the cultural experience that they expected. If anything, I would described the village as an artistic village.Me, my wife and 5 yo son took a bus to the village. I would recommend this option rather than walking up the steep road leading to the village.We love how the local government rejuvenated the area by adding sculptures, murals, etc. We thought we would only be there for a quick visit but instead spent the morning walking around and then down the hill and back into the town.We really enjoyed it although it was crowded. If you are expecting a traditional Korean village withn hanoks and then thus is not the place. However, if you like to see a colourful and artistic village, then this is the place to go."
Nice if you like hill walking,"We walked up from the Metro. It is steep and the traffic is intense. Not very cultural, but quite pretty. The coffee shop on the left at the top has a great view over the city. "
A Visitor’s Paradise ,"I must be a terrible student: I went to a culture village and returned not knowing any more about the culture of Busan or of Korea than before I went. That is not to say that I didn’t enjoy the visit, it’s just that it didn’t add to my knowledge.A village on a hillside. Buildings from another era painted in many colors. An occasional glimpse of the sea. An occasional maiden wearing a traditional dress walking by. All of the above make for a pleasant few hours of walking. And since your time is spent out of doors, you should hope for good weather during your visit.Because it is on a steep hill, people with walking disabilities should not visit. For those of you who have a thing for purchasing keychains and refrigerator magnets, you will have discovered paradise."
Rainny day,Due to I was there in rainy day so there was few people. That's very good for me to got many pictures without people. Easy to go but quite far anyway. You should take one whole day if you want to visit all area.
Pretty outdoor village,Its a good place to go if its a bright sunny day outside or at least not raining. My trip was kind of ruined by the rain. Other than that its not very highly recommended by me. 
Fun and interesting ,"This was a great way to spend a couple of hours. The walk from the Metro station is up a VERY steep hill. Once at the top you enter the village, eventually walking down the other side of the hill and back up. You will require a reasonable level of fitness to fully enjoy. Having said that it is a great place to wander around, lots of interesting craft shops selling the usual tourist gifts etc.Loads of very cool photo opportunities. The views and back drop are amazing and worth a look.We took a taxi from Busan station to the main entrance as we were very short of time. Cost was only 7000 won and took less than 10 mins in middle of the day traffic."
HBH are overwhelmed by the throngs of visitors,"This place is called a cultural village but it is more a South Korean village turned into a tourist destination by painting the houses in bright colours. Definitely an impressive build on the steep hillside but the cultural ambience I expected was gone. Souvenir shops line narrow streets that really should be car free, but are not! So many people in such a small space then cars trying to get from A to B, a recipe for disaster. Take a camera take photo's, you may see Japanese tourists dressed in kimono's that can be hired to walk around in. Take care on the road. Definitely an atmosphere, just not what we expected."
Like a real life painting,"I was ‘wow’ and is very impressed with the view of the colourful valley of cascading houses when I first set my eyes from a viewing platform. A friendly local guided us the correct street that leads to the village. It was steep climbing up from the main street (we took bus no. 87), so not a recommended starting point for seniors. Then, I noticed some local buses that will take you to the front of the entrance. The village map is for sale but you don’t need it, as there are maps on big boards along the way. The little museum is must for those who love history or a walk down memory lane."
Breath taking view,A must visit place to explore when you're in Busan. So many tourists but that's unavoidableThere are quite a few inclines so wear your best walking shoes.
Interesting walk,"We wandered through the village for about an hour, drank coffee and took some photos, wouldn’t rush back but it was nice to see how the economy in a down trodden part of town had been altered."
A good strolls arounf small hillside houses,"Though interesting, this place has not exceeded our expectations. There are many toursist and small shops, and you can wander around and look into small houses, take some pictures, but that's it. We find much more representation of the locals and Korean culture elsewhere."
Worth a visit,"This is a pretty village, built and decorated, with a map for easy discovery at the information desk. Many interesting shooting angles, quite beautiful scenery because it is located on a hill."
I could have spent two days there ,"A must visit in Busan, do not miss that Village. The colorful houses and buildings which are build into a steep hill are amazing. Shops, coffee shops, restaurants can be found there. Of course the art is a big part. You can discover while walking through. Take the bus to the top and you see the stunning view. Then start walking and exploring. "
Nice place for taking pictures,"This place is mostly to take some nice pictures. The pictures you find on internet is basically what you get when going there. A bunch of small houses providing some great scenic pictures. However its not much more to do than walk back and forth on the ""main"" road. Maybe buy some ice cream on a hot day and enjoy the view. Recommend taking a taxi from nearest subway station."
Come early! And Complete the mission ,Great Place to visit. There was a lot of opportunities to shop and great cafes to eat and drink I took the mission from. The Start yo explore the place in full. No regrets. Definitely a great place to visit in Busan 
Definitely an Instagram highlihht,"While the history behind the area is very unique and interesting, it seems that many people come just for their next Instagram shot. There were lots of artistic shops and some good souvenirs as well as interesting food items. "
Amazing village,"We had to come back to Gamcheon village twice because it’s so different and to see how people live here , this place is neat and tidy and residents live her is very humble the have put in lots of hard work to make the village look unique which have attract so many tourists which make this village number one tourist attraction of Busan , this is a must if you are in Busan"
An amazing place,This cultural village has a lot on offer. It's bright and colourful and full of history. If you're lucky you can see women walking around in their Korean national dresses. I found south Korea a friendly place. Food is delicious and plentiful. Look out for the Little Prince.... You'll find him sitting on a ledge looking out over the surroundings. I'd highly recommend a trip to the Cultural Village.
So pretty ,Worth a visit wondering through this cultural village. Very pretty and instagrammable. Try and go on a clear and dry day to to capture the colourful buildings. 
Fascinating visit,I thought it was going to be outside of Busan but it’s actually been absorbed into the city. The brochure gave the background of its development but the atmosphere was great and the shops and houses are so colourful and the people so friendly it was a real pleasure to visit!
Visit to Folk village at Gamcheon,I was surprised to see the transformation of this mountainside village from the first time I saw it in 1976 and now. Great experience of Korean Culture and how it has affected this village in a positive way. 
Colourful and Creative Buildings,"It is at the top of peak. So better take a tour bus or taxi. We were in Busan 4 days and found taxis efficient, $10,000 and more depending. For this place better take tour or taxi,otherwise you have to walk long way up the hills. We took a taxi. Well worth it, the town is an alley all the way...15 minutes walk but if you stopped then takes longer. We love it. Very artistic and beautiful town or village. There are souvenir shops and cafes along the way, there are residents so need to respect them by not naking too much noise. There re public restrooms so very good and clean. When we were there it was drizzling so not many people. We bought many souvenirs cos cheap. We cannot find similar ones elsewhere so we were happy we bought them. From $5000 a piece onwards do please but whatever you like. We bough korean hanbok material purses or wallets, bags, etc. Very cute and unique.Also t shirt. It us an interesting place to visit. Truly enjoy!"
Artsy attraction in Busan,"I was very excited to visit Gamcheon village based on what I had read online. It did have great views of both the colorful houses and the sea. There were some fun cafes and cool street foods like frozen beer and cotton candy in the shape of animals. I was staying in Nampo Dong so it was only 15 minutes away from my hotel, while it was cool I don’t think it would be worth the trek from Haeundae Beach personally."
Nice to check off list,Reminded me a lot of San Francisco. Cute what the community did with upgrading the district and making it a tourist destination. Be prepared to walk steep hills. We walked down to the water same day but it took a long time. I’d visit the village just to see what the hype is about but frankly think you could skip it.
Perfect place,"Gamcheon culture village is one place to spend your weekend evening away from a totally busy city. The village is calm, still habitated but with old Korean style houses. The view from the top gives an awesome experience."
Historical,"Great historical place to spend some time walking along the narrow uneven paths. Fascinating stores, small houses, and food to tease your taste buds. Great visit. "
The Number One Tourist Attraction in Busan! ,"A trip to Busan is not complete without a trip to Gamcheon Cultural Village, the colourful artistic town atop a hill! Queue up for about 30 mins for the photoshop with the Little Prince! "
"A tourist madhouse, but leave the beaten road for beauty","Before I came, I expected an area with a lot of artsy cafes and craft shops - but luckily I read the reviews before and lowered my expectations. It really is a tourist madhouse with busloads of people being dropped off at the main gate and pushed through the main path. These people are extremely annoying, taking their instagram shots, and yelling and running around mad through the main street and the paths right off of the main street.But if you leave the main path and just wander around the area, you'll be amazed at how quiet things can be. It's built similar to a Greek village in a mountain, with tiny paths winding through and connecting all the little homes. I enjoyed walking around, but wished there had been more hidden gems as cafes or craft stores and not just the super touristy/cheesy places on the main drag.Once you get tired of the crowds, head to the huge purple and green building that is very close to the entrance (but not technically ""in"" the village. It has a cafe, Avant Garde, that hs coffee and beer at regular prices, and it also has the most amazing terrace with a gorgeous view of the village. This place was empty when we were there, and it was the nicest part of our village visit. Take in the views and just relax..."
Calm and relaxing place,"Small area and a little hidden gem away from town that offers peaceful, quaint and relaxing experience. Great view on the valley and ocean view. Enjoying the blue roof on the village houses which dominating the colorful view.Select those cafes that have the roof top overlooking at the valley. I love the view with my coffee while the sunsetting with a nice autumn breeze . It makes me forget about all my problems for a while."
It seems to see Rio...,"This area is known for its steep streets, twisting alleys and brightly painted houses,It was a refuge village during the war, but the governement turned it in an artwork.The view from the top is simply amazing!"
A Must-Visit in Busan,"Love this place to bit even though i visited on a raining day. It felt a little bit like surprise hunting. If you take the unplanned route, you will be pleasantly surprised by the little art installation and mural appearing around the corner. If you are big on IG, almost all these are IG worthy. Best part is to sit in a cafe with full height window and stare blank into the pretty sight. Village is located uphill and I found it too tiring and challenging to walk. Take the bus which is only a short 5 mins away."
Quaint little village,"The walk at gamcheon is not as steep as other places. Lots of wall paintings and cute little houses, cafes, souvenir shops along the walk up to the top. Take your time at this little village. Allow 1.5-2hrs to take photos and take a drink."
A unique village,The houses are so colourfully painted and the walls are decorated too. Shops are interesting and it's a must go to visit place!Worth climbing the slope!
Don’t waste your time ,"It seems one of the top attractions in Busan and everyone says it is gorgeous. But the truth is, it is not at all. I was really excited to go there, couldn’t wait to see it and then totally disappointed. Yes, there are some small souvenirs stores, coffee shops. Also some funny and colorful sculptures around but there is nothing special. Some people wrote on their blogs “ you should buy its map, follow route, collect stamps. It is very fun” I bought map. Follow the route(purple one), but there is nothing. Most of stamps don’t even have ink. People also wrote “ you should try raindrop cake, it is very delicious” Really??? I don’t know. I didn’t like this place. It seemed total tourist trap to me. Also if you want to take pictures with little prince and fox (must things to do), you need to wait for it. There is queue, I mean longggg one. Good luck "
A lovely afternoon spent wandering!,Really enjoyed wandering around this area. Loads of nice souvenir shops. We spent around 2-3 hours here and did the orange trail. Would definitely recommend checking it out. Some of the art exhibitions and buildings are closed (maybe it's off season) but it was still worth the visit. 
Colourful houses,It's a must in Busan. The houses there are so colourful but be ready for some steep mountain roads around. 
Amazing even under rain,This place is truly beautiful. It's nice to be wandering around and to get lost in the tiny streets or stairs. I recommend. 
"cute, kitchy authentic","a great example of what public art spaces and a committed community can do. It's a unique place, with chock a block buildings where people have been empowered to make their own space. The main drag has some truly interesting spots and public art spaces, but do a little wandering off the beaten path to get a real feel for this unique warren. Most of the shops sell crap, but there are a few authentic crafty places (need more!) if you look hard. Well worth aimless wandering."
Cheerful and pleasant morning ,"Possibly the highlight of my super speedy day tour over Busan! If only I had more time to explore the village - there is tons to see and take pictures of if the weather is good and if the crowds aren't too bad. If the forecast predicts rain, may be better to try and postpone the trip to a sunny day if possible.The colourful houses create a scene similar to the views at Cinque Terre or the Amalfi Coast in Italy. People liken it to Santorini or Machu Pichu as well. There are a lot of quaint, narrow little alleys to explore here too. You can do as some tourists do and buy the map to collect stamps - this might provide more structure to the tour around the village to ensure that you don't miss any spots. Otherwise, I think wandering around and ""getting lost"" has its charm too. There are so many photo points!! A point to note - there was quite a massive queue for the Little Prince, so if this is a must for you, perhaps it would be good to head there first before you start exploring the rest of the village. Lots of cafes to grab a drink or bite at if you get the nibbles. An absolute must-visit in Busan! "
gorgeous and picturesque spot,"if i had one regret from my short trip to busan, it would be that we did not have enough time to thoroughly explore this beautiful and quaint little village. would definitely love to go back for a lengthier visit.p.s. it’s super instagrammable, but i would also advise people to put down their phones and cameras to enjoy the view and vibes in person every now and then :)"
Must visit,"Very pittoresk village not too far from Busan. We went here by rental car, but you can also take public transport from Busan. This colorful village is very pleasant to stroll through, with art waiting to be discovered on every street corner. The main streets can be very busy, but if you go a bit of the beaten track, you'll find more peaceful streets with interesting art works.Don't forget to pick up a map at the tourist information center right near the entrance of the village. It's cheap and a real help to explore the village."
"Beautiful, a must visit place","Get a map at the tourist information centre, very useful for navigation and to plan what you want to see.I thought of spending 2 hours here but the place is so beautiful and quaint, I ended up walking for 3 hours.Just follow the road and you will see various wall art murals and art deco. There are souvenir shops and cafes along the way. I travelled solo but managed to get other tourists to help me take photos.The houses are beautiful and you can explore the narrow lanes to have a feel of the village. This is a place to take your time and soak up art and atmosphere. Don't rush.I would recommend stopping at the community centre, there is a cafe with a friendly ahjumma and wonderful toast with ice cream. You can also get 2 stamps here.Please visit this place if you are in Busan, cannot be missed!!"
Very interesting with amazing views!,"This was a really neat experience. It was a tad challenging with our younger kids and not speaking Korean, however the signs were in English and an English map was available. Definitely worth the 2000 won! Parking was quite reasonable and easily available early in the day. "
Must visit,This place is full of culture and beauty. It was only commercialised and turned into tourist attraction about 10 years ago. Definitely remind me of Cinque Terre or the Almalfi coast of Italy. And the narrow alley resemble so much of Bellagio at lake Como. You can visit the little museum or walk up to the roof top and take a picture. There are many photo zones but be prepared to queue. 
Beautiful View,The history of this village is heartwarming. Walking through is like being in an open outdoors art exhibition. The colors are breath taking and the local residants are friendly. Many shops and views along the way for epic pictures.
Nice walk,"Did the puzzle route. Nice walk, out of the mass tourism. Takes 1h 20/30 min, nice paintings and art on the way, some roof view pics. Had great time! "
Couple of hours needed,"It is a nice way to spend a morning in Busan walking thru the artisan shops of the colorful village. Lot of local food shops also thru out the village. The viewpoint gives sweeping views of the colorful village. The Asian version of Santorini. Must visit if you are in Busan.Make sure you drink plenty of water, put on loads of sunscreen, if visiting in August. It was really hot."
Incredibly photogenic spot!,We only had a very short time here on our tour (while in port on our cruise). A very photogenic community bursting with crowds and tourists and souvenir shops. Definitely an instagram mecca! I do wonder how the folks that actually LIVE here feel about all this- but I still really enjoyed our short stroll through the colourful streets
Touristy Feel to a Once Unique Area,"The alleyways and views are of interest. The maze of back streets can be fun to wander through as it is quite unique. The main streets are overrun with tourist shops selling generic items of little interest. I had a coffee on a rooftop with a nice view, was very relaxing."
Quaint area ,Nice area to visit and see the history and culture of Korea. Although a Touristy area - the houses and area are nice and views are great. 
Instagram opportunities around every corner.,"Visiting here as part of a KTOURSTORY excursion of Busan was the best part of our day.Lots of photo pops, quirky shops and local cafes too."
Beautiful view of murals,"I went to Gamcheon Culture Village in July, on a foggy day. Not the best day to visit tho. But still got to see beautiful view of the houses and murals. On sunny day it will be great to visit since you can get a view to the bay.There a lot of food stalls, souvenir shops and photo spot. Be aware of crowds on the noon. Best time to visit is in the morning. You can buy a map on the information center and follow the map to get stamp and postcards.Wearing comfortable shoes are highly recommended since you have to hike, because the village located in a hillside"
Loved this place ,This place has such a nice view on all the buildings n the sea. The colors n artwork make this place very nice to visit. This place is know for socks so I do recommend buying some cute or original ones 
Beautiful village,"Glad to have visited this village and wandered around. Relatively easy to get to by vehicle from the CBD. We got a taxi there and back (you don’t want to walk up the hill there. Once at the village, it’s easy to wander around the streets. Lots of colour and street art. Cafes and souvenir shops everywhere. Can easily spend a few hours walking the streets and taking in the sights. "
bright and colourful houses,Gamcheon Culture Village is a landmark in Busan. the colourful houses around the area and up to the mountain. local people are very friendly. road and area are very clean. easy to reach by local transport!
Colourful Summer,"Scorching hot afternoon visit. Try not to go during summer, otherwise the visit is all worth it. Plenty of nice colourful buildings, and friendly residents are happy to point you to the right places to go to."
"Impressive, beautifully done, great morning for art lovers.","A lot of thought has been put into so many details all around this cute neighborhood. To think that this aesthetic, artistic village was once a run-down, poor and ugly slum, blew our mind. Allow about 3 hours to stroll the alleys and streets, collect stamps on your map and absorb all the beauty.Most of the tourists go only up to the Little Prince statue, take a selfie and then leave. Thus, once you're passed the Little Prince, you're no longer surrounded by the crowds. Really beautiful place to visit. A MUST, if you're in Busan."
Little prince with little thing to do here.,First when i arrived it was amezing with the paint on the wall but after we walk up to see view on the top of village .it 's soso the shop and cafe not look interesting and only take photo with Littleprince.
Beautiful village,Easy to find. Great attraction and nice little walk. A lot of shops and restaurants along the road. I recommend you pick up a map or use your phone to navigate through the village. 
Cute colorful village,"A good place to take photos as there are many colorful murals along the village. Besides from colorful murals and some small cafes there's nothing much to do here. I'd say I spend 1-2 hours exploring the village. I'd say weekends will get crowded with tourist and local who comes to take photos. Be there early if you want shorter line, especially at the ""Little Prince and the Desert Fox"" area."
Colours!!!,"It's a really quaint village where pretty designs and gorgeous splashes of colours were seen everywhere. Small snack shops selling nice food - I found a doughnut shop which had delicious sweet potato snack and a cafe selling sweet tea - could be stumbled upon if you follow the map given. However if you hate stairs or cannot walk uphill, this place is not for you.Look for hidden souvenir shops for delightful items to bring back home. Restrooms are cleverly disguised so no worries despite the long walk around the village. Public transport is by bus, which is quite easy to get at the entrances of the village going back and forth from the nearest train station."
Colorful beauty in the middle of the city!,"Easily accessible by bus from Toseong station, about every 7 minutes during the day. Plenty of picture taking opportunities, original souvenirs, and good snack shops along the way. "
Gamcheon Village,"This village was known as Santorini of Korea. Worth to visit in Busan. Some photo scene is crowded of waiting queue for a check-in. Buy an ice-scream and walk to the top of village, you can see amazing view"
Cute little village,"Gamcheon is not a traditional village, its more modern, but it's really neat. The houses and buildings are all brightly colored. It's very pretty. Lots of tourist shops for local goods and souvenirs. If you're adventurous and go into some back alleys (quietly, there are homes here) you might find a small Insect Museum with VR. But it's tucked up there, so you'll have to go looking. Many good photo areas, so bring your camera. It's not too long unless you want to walk it full circle, but good comfy shoes would be recommended. Do try some of the local food and drink."
Good for photos,"This was an odd place – to get there i had to catch the metro and then a number 2 or 2.2 bus (which is actually a minivan and quite a rough ride up the hill - but you wouldn’t want to walk up.)The cultural village itself looks amazing through the lens of the camera and it’s quite an interesting place to explore. But you definitely get the sense that you are walking around an actual functioning village and the villagers are going about their daily business, so it’s a bit voyeuristic. The bright colours are gorgeous to look at but there’s lots of feral cats and there was an overwhelming smell of cat urine everywhere I walked. It seems to be one of the better things to do in Busan so it’s worth it for an afternoon."
Korean Favella with a nicer and safer touch,"Was easy to get here on your own if you are on a cruise stopover. From Busan station, take a metro to Toseong station and get out at exit 6. Once out, walk straight then proceed to bus stop of Pusan NU hospital. Board bus 1-1, 2 or 2-2 and it will take you all the way to the entrance of Gamcheong Cultural Village. Be there early or you will soon have many people in your photos which you would not want to. The sights are interesting with many artworks decorating the routes along the whole village and the colorful houses make the whole scene perfect picture shots. There are also a number of eateries throughout the village. Be warn though. There are steep slopes and staircases and would not be so friendly for the elderly. This is something different from most order tourist sites. Worth a trip."
Wow! A Magical Place,"The Gamcheon Culture Village is a charming, picturesque place. I took an easy subway and bus up the steep mountain and was rewarded with a colorful rambling village. I nerded-out and purchased a 2000 won stamp map. There are designated destinations on the map and if you go, you get a stamp. If you collect all the stamps you get a certificate. Again, nerd alert. Anyway, there are galleries, restaurants, shops, and beautiful vistas. I barely cracked the surface and can't wait to go back."
Lovely,"Well worth visiting when in Busan. We took the subway to Toseong on line 1 and then walked from the station. It's also possible to take a bus as everyone else seemed to arrive by bus but we decided to wall for 20 minutes up a very hilly hill !! The village is really cool and quite large. Lovely views. Lots of interesting little art pieces, little shops, cafes. We loved it! Yiu would swear you were in Rio or something and not in Asia at all anymore. A really cool interesting place."
Fascinating place to visit ,"This village is well worth a visit. We took the metro and a bus to get there, but it was well worth the effort. As it’s still inhabited, respect for the residents is appreciated by being quiet and not photographing the locals. Loads of funky craft places, cool gift stores and superb views. Loved it!"
gamcheon Culture Village photo shooting location,"This is a very nice place to have some memorable photo shoots. I was amazed with the views. It is relative easy to reach by subway and follow by the bus. Just take note there are a lot of tourists . We are there relative early . How to go there : When in Busan, take the subway to Toseong Station, take exit 6 and turn right walk up the slope until you see the bus stop in front of the hospital. Look out for bus number 2 or 2-2 (clearly marked “Gamcheon Village” in English on the side) and get off at the Gamcheon Cultural Village. Can pay cash on the bus. I have include last 2 pictures"
Colorful and lovely village,The village is located on the hills. I've been there in the spring time so there were so many pink color of sakura trees. The village is really lovely and photogenic place for tourist.
A colorful village ,It’s little far from the center of city. A colorful village with many creative graffiti. There are many cute shops and cafes. This place is for art lovers.
Poor village turned to culture village.,"It is very impressive to see very narrow alleyes and small house. I could feel how life is hard in that poor village. Thesedays it has many hot spot for turists but ordinary people are live for thier life. Old houses turnd cafe, shops, restaurants. View is good ."
stroll around have a coffee and enjoy,sleepy little neighbourhood with an element of pride and care stroll around go into a coffee shop find an innovative angle for a picture have a great afternoon 
Genius tranformation,"A fantastic bit of culture, a village transformed from a shanty town cobbled together after the Korean war to an icon of Busan. It is a wonderful place to walk around in (and up if you dare, it's less stuffy than the bus), with quirky artwork to photography on buildings and shops to get some typical as well as unique souvenirs. Watch out for the Little Prince statue though, a very orderly queue formed to take pictures with it against the village. If you aren't super sold on the Prince you can walk down a bit more and get a similar view of the village."
Nice Walk,Good exercise with views. You can also buy a map and collect stamps along the way and complete the full routes. Seniors with knees problem should avoid the 148 steps See Stars stairs. You can access this place using public transport which is inexpensive. No entrance fee to walk round this village. 
Korean Santorini,The climbing trip is all worth it for the cultural experience. You will be greeted by relaxing and easy going atmosphere. There are many surprising sculptures and murals along the climb.
Very unique,"This a great destination to go to if you are in Busan. For spending a couple days in Busan, I would say this was the top thing we saw.The views from every angle were very nice. Try to go to the top of one of the buildings so you can really enjoy the views. This is obviously a top tourists destination so it takes a bit of the charm away. The stores and restaurants are not great and overpriced there, you truly just go there for the experience and view.I think it would be a shame if you go to Busan and do not spend a couple of hours walking around that neighborhood."
Every angle is so Instagramable,"Spent a good 2-3 hours walking and exploring the houses. Some are turned for commercial use as cafes and shops while others are still occupied by mainly old folks. Full respect for the people who have built these houses in the 50s! You can buy a map for 2000 won, the funds will go to helping the village for some basic repairs and maintenance works."
Cultural Village,A neat little village with lots of artsy stuff to see! We had loads of fun taking pictures and people watching
Super cute and artsy village,The village is so unique and picturesque. There are little modern/contemporary art exhibits scattered within some of the homes. There's great cafes and street food options. Easy to get to by taxi or bus from Busan.
Amazing,"I never thought I will love some place so badly. Amazing city, amazing view, amazing people. Great spot for photographers."
Fun to walk around at....,"It’s a nice stop when visiting Busan..... it’s quirky and artsy, and unique.... the history of these hilltop homes is very interesting. The locals fled to the hills to find a home, during the Korean War. Considered slums before, they are now being refurbished and used as businesses, too."
Day travel,"You can reach this destination by taxi or train. If you take the train, it will leave you a few minutes away from the location. Take a taxi from the train to the location. Train station to location by taxi is $5.00 or less. Shopping stores in the area."
A magnificent village of Busan,"I absolutely loved Gamcheon Culture Village! So many things to do and it's so colorful! Perfect for taking photos, walking around with your friends and just enjoying a beautiful view of Busan :) Also, be prepared for lots of walking and I would say it's good to stay there for a few hours, to walk and enjoy all the things to do there without a rush ~ All in all, it's definitely recommended to visit if You're in Busan! P.S: I tried fried ice cream there for the first time, and woah so good!"
Beautiful village with amazing views ,I arrived in this village in the morning. It was already quite busy and many people were lining up for a photo with the Little Prince statue. I didn’t see the point of this and instead found a cafe with a rooftop and sat and enjoyed the view away from the crowds. 
Best view without walking,Did not hike but enjoyed best view of the village and valley from Avantgarde cafe while enjoying a Smoothie and lovely cheese cake. Located next to public bus terminus at hilltop.
Unique cultural Village ,"I think it is a must go place if you happen to visit Busan. Very near to city itself and not too big or time consuming to explore. However, somehow i find this place a bit over rated, and commercialised.Some nice shops for arts and souvenirs too. "
A pretty village with many photo spots,"It was a really hot day when we visited and there were throngs of tourists. But the guide map for 2000 won from the visitors’ centre - it’s worth it! The illustrations are quite detailed and allow you to get a postcard at one of the stops. Seeing the village requires walking up and down slopes and a fair amount of queueing at the photo spots. On the day we went, the gamcheon donut shop was closed. There are many quaint cafes where u can grab a bite and rest. Allow at least 3 hours. "
photos time,Good to know the history before you ascend GCV. The hype about this place is to sit beside little prince for a photo shot where you can have an all round view. Read somewhere that a more than 30mins q is expected. we were lucky that we managed to take photos within 5min. There are shops around the village as well.
The highlight of Busan - colourful village!,"This is really one of my favourite place to be in Busan. Beautiful place to take photos as you immerse yourself with the sight of colourful buildings. Get lost here as you walk and discover every nook and corner. There are plenty to see and food to snack on. We spent 2 hours here but it felt little. Tips: For the best view, go to the Avant Garde Cafe. You probably need to get a drink to stay."
A must visit in Busan,This is the must visit attraction if you’re in Busan. Many tourists during peak hour. So would recommend to go early.
Beautiful Place to take photos,"It is a MUST go place in Busan. Lots of places to take photos, cafes etc. There are many photo spots for you to take photos with outstanding backdrop. You won't see this type of scenery any where else in Korea. "
Quiet Late Afternoon Visit,"We came in the late afternoon and it was a great time to visit as there were no crowds. This allowed us to explore the village at our own pace and not have to jostle with others to get the best spots for our photos. In our opinion, stop number 11 was the best vantage point to capture a panoramic view of the village. The saying ‘it takes a village’ really applied here with so many households adding their own unique contributions to make this a cool place to visit and explore. We found paintings, museums, mosaics, statues, libraries, Super and Spider-Man scattered all over the main road but also in small alleyway. The show Two Days and One Night even left their own plaque memorializing the places showcased on that episode.The fastest way to and from the village was by taxi as the roads were steep from the metro station. I also do not recommend using the public bathrooms which were quite stinky and filled with mosquitoes."
Love it!,A wonderful transformation of this area into a artyband colourful village! Every corner has something to offer! The cute statues and comtemporary art pieces are all around and yet there are local residents who are still staying in the houses! A must visit attraction in Busan!
Very cute and interesting place!,We enjoyed our short visit in the village and the murals were fascinating.The cafés and shops were quite interesting as well. Worth a visit and I would definitely go back there again!!
Fun walk around the village,"There is no way we could have walked up the hill to get to this place and so were glad we got a taxi from the start! It is a fun looking, colorful, artsy place and I enjoyed looking at the art work scattered around the main path. I do advise getting a tourist map (200krw, about $1.70) as soon as you get there at a place not far from the start of the walking shopping area. There are tons of little side paths that go up and down and the steps to some may not be the best. We pretty much stayed on the main wide path with a few side trips here and there. When the shops thinned out we simply backtracked our way to the beginning. Lots of picture and selfie moments. We were there on a Sat. and the place was closing around 7:00 pm."
Must-visit village!,Beautiful colourful village that shows part of Busan's culture. Great views from the top of the village. There are eateries and shops that sell souvenirs and accessories. Be prepared to walk to enjoy the different views and aspects of the village. 
Crowded and stressful,"This must have been a pleasant place 30 years ago. But now it is overrun with camera-happy tourists, and doesn't really epitomize ""culture"" or ""village."" Skip if you hate crowds."
Explore,We arrived and parked our car and then explored the streets. So much to see!We got a drink from a cafe called avantgarde that had an amazing view over the village. We posed with some of the statues and street art before looking at some of the tourist shops. Excellent lively place. We quite busy when we went.The colours of the houses are so cool!
Nothing much to explore,It is just an ordinary village and I do not really impressed about it. Only go there if you really really have spare time.
Nice view,Nice view but climbing may be challemging as no proper steps. Overall a good experience to see people staying in there. Hose look cramp and small
Weather was bad as typhoon passing by,"The day trip highlight was supposed to be taking a train to the skywalk. Unfortunately the typhoon passed by so we only went to a temple. Then the maritime museum for lunch but nothing to see. When we got Bumcheong village, the rain and wind was so strong that 1 female tourist and I wore 2 raincoats to take photos of the little prince but got all wet. Most of the tourists stay in a nearby café for drinks as too windy and heavy rain. It spoilt the kstory tour as we didn't get to the skywalk and train highlight. Hope in future, the company will check weather forecast first so we don't waste our time. Very disappointed not able to take the walk and the train. But I think the female tour guide, maybe Ling Ling did her best together with Ted."
lovely village in a fairy tale,"This village is very colorful, peaceful and meaningful. If you like something vintage, small. cute things, it's a must-place to visit. Wish I could have much more time so that I could spend a whole day in Gamcheon Culture Village, everything is so lovely, small houses, small roads, small paths...but were built with a big heart I think."
Instagram/Selfie Hell Hole,"I have never seen such a circus of people queuing in line for ages to take photos of themselves . I felt like I had to constantly duck, swirve or apologise for standing in somebody else's photo space. The village itself, I would not describe as cultural....more of a tourist attraction where many souvenir , coffee, ice cream, food stalls line the streets. I challenge anyone to go here with out a phone or camera as there is nothing more to do than ....GRAM IT !!! "
Colorful city on the hill,It’s super touristy is a bad way on the main drag but if you stroll on the narrow pathways you’ll find quaint areas and there are beautiful small gardens on the nearby hill
A Worthwhile Find,"I took the subway and got off at “Jagalchi” Station and decided to walk up to the village since it was only 30 mins. It was a mission of twist, turns, uphill battles and narrow stairs cases but when you take the last couple steps into the village it gave me the “wow” factor. Beautiful artwork, welcoming people and just one of the best views I’ve since coming to Korea."
Holiday ,We went to this area of brightly coloured buildings. The village has many quirky shops and things to see. The roads are non quite steep so wear good shoes. We are in our early 70’s and we walked most of the village but the uphill gradient had us puffing and sweating. Not good if you have a walking impairment or heart condition . Worth seeing
A favourite location,We spent time here as part of a Busan tour and really loved this village. You could easily spend half a day here exploring the little lanes and taking photographs. Don’t miss it!
Great place to take lots of Instagramable pics,Do arrive early as the crowds will start to pour in around noon. Go early morning if you don't want to wait in queue too long to have a chance to take a pic with the Little Prince.
A beautiful place,This is one of the place you must visit in Busan . I go there with my tour bus on morning . I suggest you go on night because the night view is more beautiful . 
Day tour ,We went there but a bit crowded as Saturday but nice to look around. Very colorful buildings. Good to go there and spend some time at there.
Great Villages View,This is a must-visit place when you come to Busan. It is like the colorful version of the Brazil Favela. It required some steps so wear a comfy shoes when visit the places. Just take your time to take as many photos as you can. Tried the big ice cream macaron which tasted very good.
A must visit for tourists.,"Comfy shoes are a must here, but no matter how many steps on an incline it is so worth it.We probably spent a good three hours here, including the walk from where we parked the car, a nice bloke let us park in his driveway ( I think ) he kept our keys, which is quite the norm in tourist places, and as other cars left he moves the cars around. After a little history lesson about the origins of the painted buildings we steadily wandered upwards. We tried some street food, apparently the fish wrap was quite tasty. We had a Korean ice cream which seem to taste like the nicest ice cream I have ever had, cool flavours too. It was a warm day so it was very busy and some photo spots were crowded with queues. But if you wander a little past each queue you can take an equally good picture."
Beautiful views! ,"Lovely village. It is not an easy climb to go up to see the village. Being an asthmatic, the constant climb up with the humidity made me have to take my pumps. But it was really worth it. We didn’t see everything but what we saw was beautiful. It is worth a visite. "
Enjoyable experience,"We joined a local tour and they brought us to this place. We enjoyed ourselves walking around this place. Buildings are colorful and there are lots of arts showcase around for photo-taking. Do remember to stopby the tourist info office to obtain a map of the village. From the map, you may find the specific location and obtain a special stamp. It is fun hunting for these places."
"Must go in Busan! Lots of walking, must wear comfy shoes!","1. Lots of walking up and down the hill - must wear good shoes2. Can take taxi or bus directly to the entrance3. Go to the tourist information counter to purchase the map (2k won) - recommended to buy the map and collect all the stamps, it will make you walk to all the places, so that you won't miss out every single spot.4. Once all stamps are collected, go back to the information counter and claim 2 free postcards.Overall, I feel it is a must visit place in Busan. Very colourful village overlooking the beautiful sea. You will see many cute little cafes and souvenir shops too. But if you don't like walking, you won't enjoy it, as you will need to walk up and down the hill many times."
Brilliant,"Wonderful scenery, it really looks like a replica of Santorini. A lot of tourists but the place is tourist friendly "
Truly Unique and Charming,"I visited here as part of a tour for about an hour. It is a quaint little boutique community with an interesting story about the refugees who came to live here when they were pushed back by the North Koreans and needed to settle on hills.Lots of cute boutiques, tasty food items, and souvenirs like flower tea. Very picturesque views."
Busan,I love Busan. I take a hop in and hop off bus around the city that is quite convenient for the tourist. Nice weather and people. Great food and beautiful attraction 
super fun,"Take a taxi to the table he's expanding our strolling around this fun neighborhood. It is a real testament to the lack of vandalism, in Busan, the amount of creative and fun public art you run into about every 10 feet. Recommend."
Beautiful view and an interesting hike,"As described by some, it was the Cinque Terre of Busan. The pastel-coloured houses perched in a valley and it is best to visit in the morning when the east-facing buildings are sun-kissed.Protip: Start by walking along Gamnae 2-ro and NOT Gamnae 1-ro. There is a nice photo spot (prominently docorated) on Gamnae 1-ro, but do not head there as you will end up walking uphill for the entire route. Instead, ignore that structure as you will pass it later on at the end of your route along Gamnae 2-ro (walking downhill)."
Machu Pichu of Busan,"Gamcheon Cultural Village is the village that build on the hillside of mountain.. If u come here, u can see the house painted with bright colourful colour. The famous spot to take picture among the tourist is petite statue.. It a must visit place when u come to Busan. "
What a quirky place!,What a quirky find this was - a cross between a wacky theme park and a cultural experience. You must try the cloud coffee at the blue house on the stairs - amazing.
Village with a lego like look from afar,Good place to slowly explore all the nooks and crannies by walking around. Go prepared with comfortable walking shoes as there are steep steps to climb and narrow alleys and low ceiling to navigate.
Nice to see and be here~,"It was nice. The view was beautiful. So colorful and cultural :). There are small shops on the side of the street, you can buy food and souvenirs. I got some nice postcards and magnet :)."
Looks almost Korean hipsters place,"I would say it is not a traditional Koran place. It was an interesting and colourful walk, but too crowdy. There are many shops but we did not manage to buy anything. It was a bit complicated to get there by public transport."
Excellent glimpse of South Korean culture and lifestyle,"Seeing South Koreans in their natural habitat is awesome! This attraction provided me interesting insights about their lifestyle, observed through a culturally exhilarating lens."
average,"a spot to spend a couple of hours. I went early in the morning before the tourists' buses arrive. Early means no crowd, however, only a few shops are open at this time.If getting here via public transport is a hassle, sharing a cab is a better option. I paid less than 7000 won coming from Busan station,"
Getting to Gamcheon Culture Village,Our travel to Gamcheon Culture Village by public transportation appeared simple - but it is not. Getting to Toseong Station in Busan is easy but locating the bus stop to get the bus to the Village is not. There are no signs to lead you to the bus stop which is quite a distant away from Toseong Station - some 15 minutes walk. And the bus stop is not very obvious too as there is no shelter. Only the locals will know. So it’s best to have a conducted trip to the quaint colourful village.
Must visit place in Busan,Great to visit and see the reformation that this place has undergone.Very picturesque and a paradise for those who love art/
Worth the visit,Pretty colorful village. You can get some nice souvenirs of Busan and Korea. Wonderful spots for picture taking. Prepare comfortable shoes and wear appropriate clothing. Lots of walking. But worth going.
Great place to visit when in Busan,"First experience in Busan and visited the famously known Gamcheon culture village. It was a beautiful place, and may probable need a few hours to finish the longest trail. There’s 3 trails to choose from, and we chose the second longest one. Love the rainbow colours of the shops/houses and it really brightens up my day. "
Steep walk.,"Nice place to visit, take the bus from subway station up hill and walk through the village. It is enjoyable but with warm weather quite heavy for elderly people......"
Don't come if you don't like taking pictures,"I was bored out of my mind walking around the village. Sure, the first few moments being there was interesting but the scenery got boring quick. Not worth the time at all, feels like a tourist trap.My recommendation would be to take a bus there, go to a nice cafe with a great view, chill for a bit and take some pictures (for the gram) before leaving."
Great day out,"Had a great day out at the Gamcheon Culture village. Caught a taxi from the fish market around $5 to the main entrance. There are maps of the village in several languages at the information centre for around $2. Worthwhile getting one as there is a lot to see. Quite a bit of walking and stairs involved. Lots of colourful buildings and a lot of art decor to see. Plenty of eateries ,cafes and souvenir shops as well. Lots of young people with traditional costumes walking around and the cherry blossoms were out so an added bonus. Very colourful and most enjoyable. Could have spent the whole day here!"
Nice place,"One of a well-known nice place in Busan. Morning time is better, no more people, no more queue at every points there for photo shoot. "
Picturesque,"We arrived there around 10am and I was with a friend in his car we had a hard time finding a parking space. Anyways, the place is so colorful houses were all painted. To make your trip exciting, you can go to the information first and grab a map where you can put a stamp on it so you can track your progress. It was quite a walk going up and down. The most popular site is the prince statue and the line was very long so if you want to have a picture of it, just be patient. Overall it was fun and we got some lovely photos."
Great ,Lots of walking and crowded but many interesting things and artworks to see. Worth the walking. All kinds of up and down alleys.
Must go if you visit Busan,"The colorful houses were actually a slump turned into a colorful, artistic and beautiful village. Cafes around to take a break from the hot weather (if you go during the summer), and you can get up to the 2nd floor of the cafe to take better unobstracted photos."
Nice place to visit,This place is very nice and colorful place and it very unique by the color of the houses.There are many cafe for you to go and it easy to walk around. At Gamcheon Culture Village is very suitable for the one who love colorful and joy to take a pictures because it have many house of color and have many of art installations.
Piece of art,Easier and cheaper to get there by cab if you have more than 2 pp. From Nampo to the village was abt ₩5000. Public toilet is tricky. Its tiny and you need to bring your own tissue paper of course.
Best from Viewpoint,It's a nice stroll through the streets with some smaller attractions tucked away but overall only found the viewpoint overlooking the Village to provide the best view.
Quaint and nice spot ,This place is colorful and easy to walk around. There are plenty of cafes and souvenirs along the way. We got there by subway and then walked up to the top of the hill (there are buses that will take you up there but we did not have a bus card). Definitely worth a visit. 
Very touristy but nice vibe,"Sometimes, things can become so touristy that it takes away all the fun of visiting the place. Here you will also find droves of tourists but walking around is still nice, especially in the smaller streets. Fans of coffee will have a difficult time here to pick a place - almost every second house on the main street is a coffee house :)"
A bit overrated,"Gotta agree with some of the previous reviews, this place is a bit overrated. Don’t get me wrong, it is worth visiting if you have time but IMO not worth it if you are on a tight schedule. Also, one of the sign mentions that Gamcheon Culture Village is the “ Santorini” of Korea. I strongly disagree with this statement, they are not even close to being a “Santorini”. Santorini is on an island and has unbelievable views of the neighbourhoods and the sea Gamcheon village is a bit dirty and the restaurants and stores staff can be a little pushy to eat at their location or buy their stuff. "
"Pretty Place, a bit overrated","If climbing is your thing, the steep slope and stairs will be everywhere. Family with limited mobility beware. If you still wanna go with elderly and strollers, please reconsider as too much climbing and walking with no disable access"
"Touristy, but nice walk.","The place is touristy, but worth spending 2-3 hours walking around the place. The weather was nice, sunny, windy when we visited the village. Managed to find good affordable souvenirs at this place. Some korean snacks and drinks along the way too."
Interesting village ,"It was an interesting place, much like Taipei's Jiu Fen. There are souvenir shops along the main walkway. However, it was raining and we did not explore further. Some shops were closed too. We went to a cafe to enjoy the view instead. With a great view of the entire village, it was a very pleasant experience."
Entertaining place to visit,Not the normal tourist attraction. Quaint. Colorful. Fun. Visual surprises about every corner. Fun things to eat and to buy. Be aware that lots of walking up and down steep walkways and narrow roads is part of the fun. Lots of teenagers there - a perfect place for them.
Picturistic Village,"It is very unique and nice village situated on mountain top with colorful small houses, small souvenir shops , restaurants and cafe. To get to the village, one has to be ready to walk a lot, mostly climb up the hill. The view from the top is awesome . There are many spots for photos and one needs to spend about 3-4 hours there. AS the lanes are steep and narrow the buses/cars have to be parked at the entrance of Gamcheon Culture Village"
Colourful village,"Very crowded with tourist and locals during weekends. Nice view. There’s cafes, souvenir shops and convenient store. You can also rent hanbok to walk along the village to see the "
A colourful village,"It's a place that once a biggest slum turned into a colorful and an attractive cultural village in Korea. At information center at the entrance of the village you can buy a map that costs 2000 won and do a stamp hunting, it is also a good way to explore the most of the village, and get a free postcard while you stamping."
Awesome Treat,"A trip to Gamcheon Culture Village is an absolute treat. Upon arrival of this hilly community you will be awe struck by the beauty of the vast array of different colored and magical homes. This artist inspired community has whimsical decorations everyone with different themes. Stroll down the streets, take the various detours up side streets, walk down the lengthy stairway...take it all in while you shop and eat. This is a beautiful community well worth seeing."
Cute area!,Coming from the Busan station you can take the bus 87 and get off at yangseong store and change to the number 2 or walk up the steep road for 10min to reach the information center. There buy a stamp map or go on your own and discover the village!
Lovely area to explore,"We walked up the hillside to reach the culture village, meaning we got to see more on the way than if we’d got the bus. It was a little steep but we managed with our stroller. We enjoyed exploring the culture village, eating Bingsu in a little cafe overlooking the city and hiring traditional Korean clothing. Lots to see and do! "
Beautiful place in Busan.,"Gamcheon Culture Village is known for its streep street, twisting alleys and brightly painted houses. The nickname is “Machu Picchu of Busan” or “Santorini of Korea”We‘ve recommended for nice place to take photos and try to taste fish cake and Gamcheon moonlight doughnut."
Beautiful houses,This place is nice to walk and chill around but make sure you wear the right shoes. The road is super up high and bring a water bottle with you!! 
I took nice pictures,"Nice view,but was so cold and windy outside I didn't spend to much time there,but great place.Maybe summer time will be much better."
Wonderful transformation.,"This is an excellent place to visit to see how places can be renovated both for the benefit of individuals living there are the wider community which benefits from improved environment and benefits form the tourism. There are a lot of nice little art type shops an installations and some good food places, too. Easy to get to via the 87 bus, but expect a long uphill walk!"
Instagram Worthy,"Gamcheon Village provides the perfect shots for your Instagram. Walk around, visit some of the cafes, art installations, and quirky souvenir shops. "
Peaceful little village filled with tourists,"We visited the village on a Saturday morning. The cherry blossom was great. Yet, lots of people around during weekends and so need to queue for taking pictures in some popular spots. "
Breathtakingly beautiful,You would not expect that this was a slum area before it was changed to a tourist hot spot. It has a lot of artwork great shops for food and souvenirs 
Interesting place to spend few hours,"This place is very artistic with the whole place full of art of all kinds. Didn’t see a lot of tourists when we were there in the afternoon. Best to take bus no 2 or 2-2 up to the top and then walk down through the narrow alleys and roads.The place is clean and quiet when we were there. However, prepare for some steep climb is you want to walk up instead of down."
Wow! Best thing to do in Busan,I wasn’t expecting such a beautiful place in Korea. Great shopping atmosphere. Lost of cultural spots and great views of the city and sea.
Colourful Village ,We joined a guided tour to this village where is one of the popular place for the locals.This village's houses are painted in different colour that made it very unique and attractive. There is a popular boy overseeing the village statue which attracts many people queuing up to take photo with him. 
scenic view,"we went there early morning so we dont have to queue for photo taking with the little prince statute ( the hightlight of this place ) . the area is big with many steep slopes and flights of stairs, could be physically challenging for some"
Wonderful Area to Visit,"We stopped visited the Gamcheon Village and it did not disappoint. Unfortunately it started to rain 1 hour into our visit so we didn't get to explore much. Don't try to walk up the mountain like these 2 foolish Americans. We did it, but probably would have enjoyed the visit more if we had taken the bus up! If you go to Busan, this is a must see visit. "
"Touristy, but still worth a visit","Gamcheon is interesting enough to explore and take some happy snaps. Like much of Korea, there are lots of street food snacks available. There are a lot of hills and sometimes stairs as the village is nestled in the mountainside, so be aware of that if you are with young kids that get tired of walking or those less mobile.Tip: for a bit of fun, there are a couple of Hanbok hire shops near the entrance of the village - dressing up kept our kids amused during our visit."
Nice village to Visit,"This place is a very interesting and nice village to visit.It can certainly get touristic, so it’s better to visit at low times or else you’ll be dealing with lots of tourists trying to take photos.Some small alleys along the path have nice murals and graphites on the walls.The location is also easily accessible by metro and a short bus ride."
Can I do this on foot?,"The quaintness of this village needs to be seen to be appreciated. It is is definitely quirky and cute with so much to see. However the steepness of the stairways can be a problem for people with mobility issues. If you're OK going downwards on foot then get dropped off at the top. There's an info centre, coffee shops, souvenirs and lookout points there."
Colorful and spectacular view- feels like cuba,"About a 30 minute bus ride from Busan is the colorful “Gamcheon Culture Village“. This touristy place is worth the visit only if you’re into photography, film, or art. Once you get off the bus, you’re amazed by the colorful houses and the breathtaking view that makes you think of Cuba. This destination is a self-guided tour and visitors are welcomed to walk in the narrow alley ways to take that perfect photo. With the various colorful back-drop, any outfit will do. At the end of the self-guided tour is a tradition Korean market that was surprisingly empty and doesn’t have the high energy market vibe."
You should to see!!,"This village has a lot of sad stories except it looks beautiful. in general it is an old style korean city neighborhood but there are too many cafe restaurants for tourists. you can probably stroll in at least 2 or 3 hours. In the meantime, make sure to get the excursion map of this place and be sure to reach special points, there are beautiful surprises waiting for you. Don't forget to use the seals !!!"
A Great place to explore ,We came by cruise ship and visited here on our own which wasn’t too difficult if you do a fair amount of research with buses etcThere are so many coloured houses that this place is unique for South Korea and you just walk through the village getting higher and higherYes this is for the tourists but it is still very goodYou can hire dresses for women or outfits for men for one hour upwards just to walk through the village and take pictures - a great souvenir and experience of your trip thereWorth a visit - recommendedEnjoy 
Interesting place,"Alot of Instagram Worthy spots, and that's about it. A tourist spot with no local around as it's boring"
Day tour ,We came to Gamcheon Culture Village on our last stop for our day tour trip in Busan with Ktourstory. It is a nice place with lots of small snacks and sourvenir shops. 
Feels Like Inside Korean Drama,"Its a lovely place to visit, If you like to watching Korean Drama, you would be feel be part of that drama. When you walk there its feel like you are a actor doing actions. Every side is in Gamcheon Culture Village is instagramable. If you are Indonesian, you can found the similar place in Malang. Enjoy it."
Colorful Culture Village,"A small town of fishing village formerly which have been restored and enhanced in recent years to attract tourism. In order for the village to be reborn as a cultural hub, the residence with help of various government offices have turned the village into one of the most featured tourist spot in Busan."
Great for strolling around,"There’s a lot of hills in Korea, and getting to this one was an adventure. There’s a bus that goes up and down but I took a taxi up and it wasn’t expensive at all, 3500won. It was raining and it gets very cold! Before wondering around the village and while waiting for the rain to settle, I stopped for a coffee and dessert. It’s a small village, great for sightseeing, views and for more coffee!"
Lovely place,"It’s a lovely place to visit, though is already a bit touristy. I’m glad I have visited it, as i understand that the place will be demolished in the near future for development."
Colorful village,"The village has a story and it’s a nice place to walk around, up and down the stairs! Looking for art pieces on the wall around different corners! You’ll be surprised to be there!Don’t be there on local holidays, the place turns into a parking lot!!"
Gamcheon,"It is a lovely village for families to spend time together. I don’t see here as a first place to visit in Busan, but books and website suggest here pretty often"
Nice to visit,What a colorful house! It's happy to just see people from around the world walking around. All people in this village look delightful. 
Okay,"Well, I read the reviews before my visit and have to say that I agreed that the place is very touristy indeed. 50m queue to take a pic with little prince statue... No thanks.But I liked the narrow alleys and it was a pleasure to see Korean people in beautiful hanbok (traditional dress)."
"Tiring walk up/down the winding lanes, very touristy","The culture village is very touristy, very compact, one main entrance in and out. Shops, eateries and attractions are all found and located within the village area. With their map in hand, you could cover the whole village in a day, provided you have comfortable walking shoes to trek up and down the winding lanes and corners..."
Interesting art village,"Cool place to explore and take photos. Lots of interesting things to look at. However, it looks like no one liver there any more. "
Great fun with 2 teenage girls!!,"Want to give your teenage girls an opportunity to snapchat and instragram perfect pictures? This was the place for our hard to please teenage girls and they bragged about it and were super happy! For us adults, it was a great place for picures as well!!"
Appreciating Busan's Unique Art,"Visited Busan for the first time. Our first stop was the well known Gamcheon Culture Village. Got a guide map from the information center which helped us choose which areas to visit.There was much to see. The view of the colorful houses, steep streets, korean tradional souvenirs, trying korean food and seeing ladies in Korean dress-Hanbok was very interesting, entertaining and fun."
A succesfull rejuvenation of a squatter area,Wasn't expecting much when I first got here but it won me over as we walked around. Tiny little shops selling knick knacks and a great view of the city from the top.Stop by for a cup of coffee in one of the cafes and just take your time to wander around.Lots of instagram-worthy spots if that's what one is after
Wander blissfuly,"A definite must go for anyone visiting Busan. You could spend hours on end wandering the streets here. Must try the food, especially the fish cakes. It's a very quaint location to stroll around and discover pleasant surprises."
Love it..very beautiful,One of my travel highlight in Korea is visitting this place. Its so beautiful. However the transportation to this place is not so easy. The bus is small and packed..so everybody need to squeezed themselves to fit in the Bus
A great way to spend afew hours,"We reached Gamcheon Culture Village by the metro (line 1) get off at Toseong Station, follow the signs and walk up the road until you see a big brown sign directing you to the left (to Gamcheon Culture Village). From there you walk up a very steep road (about 200m) and when you get to the T-junction at the top, turn right and walk towards the pedestrian bridge. Cross the bridge and where all the activity is, is the start of the trail. Just to the right there is a Tourist information Centre where you can buy your trail map for 2000KRW.We had a great day out @ Gamcheon. Loads of interesting places to see and visit. The further along the trail you go, the less crowded it gets. The trail gives you a great insight into the life of people who live in Gamcheon as you pass through narrow laneways. At the end are some great local eateries (if you're not going to eat pizza and hamburgers like us, whilst in Busan). Happy snapping!"
Machu Pichhu of Busan,"Our First stop at Busan was the Gamcheon Culture Village.We had taken an early morning flight from Seoul and decided to visit this place after our lunch. So we had ample time to go around. Would recommend to keep aside at least 4 hours for this visit. Houses built on slopes, colorfully painted ,beautiful murals on the top of the houses and by the side of the main street stepped pathways to reach the houses , small by lanes all makes this one of the must see places in Busan and rightfully called the ‘Machu Pichhu of Busan’.Lot of shops set by the sides of the steep streets, with various options to eat and along with some photo shoot points makes the visit memorable.One can reach this place by a private taxi. We opted for a city bus and Busan has an efficient road transportation system.The tourist information office can provide you with a local guide map, which gives very good and clear information of various trial routes one can take along this village with approximate time and distance one needs to cover-a is very informative and helps one to plan the available time efficiently. But one can also plan their own route to go around based on the time available or their present state of physical condition.A word of caution here –the roads or pathways are sometime very steep. One needs to do lot of walking here and those who are not fully fit, can stick to outer street way or path way and avoid entering the small steep by lanes."
Perfectgram,"This place is a picturesque Instagram place where you can purchase a map @ 2000krw and collecting the stamps to get a few free postcards. If you take the longer route, it takes 2-2.5 hours to complete the route including taking photo. Be prepared for tons of slopes and walking but it is totally worth the visit!"
Overrated for sites that must visit ,"If you have time to spare, food to spend time to walk around the village. Houses painted with different colours, painted walls with animals, insects and art work. Some pictures taking spot but nothing spectacular. However, a very long walk up the hill from the train Toseog station - 1.6km! However, you may want to walk back the same way down else you probably lost if you walk out the village on the other way.. there have not many restaurants in the village and limited choice. Some small cafe and some small street food stall. There’s a bus to get to the village and I suggested you all take the bus and the walk at very steep hill not an easy job .. must be fit to do so. Enjoy ! "
Worth the visit ,Very picturesque apart from a couple of blocks of high rise ruining the landscape lol. Some souvenir & street food available. 
Time well spent in colour!,"It’s my usual habit of getting to know places of interest before travelling to a city and this place is one on my bucket list of Busan. We could have chosen to take the bus from Jagalchi but we decided to take taxi to get here for just under 5,000 won with 4 people. It’s actually cheap and very comfortable in addition to typical polite and honest Korean driver! From the moment we step out of the taxi the excitement sinks in and all our gadgets starts to click and roll! Never ending selfies and groupies makes our stroll so exciting and memorable with lots of fun! Though it’s winter the walking up and down the hilly village made us sweat and gasp for air but nonetheless worth it! There are plenty of spots for a good IG and FB post to share our memorable experience and time in this colourful and fascinating place! I highly recommend everyone to take taxi to get here. "
Whimsical Village,"This was the number one thing I wanted to do in Busan, and it did not disappoint. This village had a lot of charm, and we had fun trying to get stamped at all of the locations on the map we purchased at the tourist information center. It was 2000, but the money goes back to the locals. Charge your camera/phone because there's so many great photo ops. Great way to spend the morning!"
2 hours walking trail,"Paid 2000 won and redeemed a map to collect stamps.It’s a good exercise for everyone as we explore the village within 2 hours. A total of 12 stops and there’s 3 stops which you can collect free postcards!It’s a must visit site while in Busan. Do wear a good pair of walking shoes, you have to climb steps or walking up and down a slope.Have fun everyone!PS. I used approx 2 hrs 20 mins "
instagramable,just walk around the area and you'll find lots lots of spot for your instagram spot... though I should say this place is quite far from the downtown
Busan Gamcheon Culture Village (부산 감천문화마을),"The Gamcheon Culture Village in Busan was a beautiful place for both my friends and I, but also family friendly. You are able to rent a hanbok or other cute outfits for a day. Lots of shopping and cute cafes. "
Fun adventure~,"After reading some of the bad reviews I need to say something first... complaining about the bus ride to get there or tourists taking pictures with selfie sticks.. or the fact that there are gift shops.. seriously get over yourself.This little town is full of character and history!! Once you take the bus to the top of the hill you can begin your adventure!! There is a map guide which you can buy for ₩2000 totally worth it, you can go around finding the stamp locations and you get free postcards !! Plus the money you pay for the map goes to the people of this little village. There is a main little street right at the top of the hill, this seems to be where most people go~~ but following the map and the stamp guide we got to see a lot more! We went to a cafe at the end of the day to watch the sunset and we even sat of the roof top. This area is really worth the visit.But try not to bother the people in their homes^^ "
Very senic,"This area was more impressive than I expected. Easy to just walk around and get lost. Interesting sites, food, and cafes."
From slump to a beautiful & romantic artistic village,"A must visit to mini Machu Pichu of Busan. Such a brilliant idea to have recreated such tiered, next-to-thy-neighbour colourful piece of panoramic artistically picturesque community living in the mountain slope. The view is breath-taking. Make sure you have minimally 2 hours to spend here if you’d like to 1) sit and watch the world go by in one of their many cafes,2) roam the neighbourhood beside just walking the main street, 3) take your various Instagramable moments with all the different wall murals and strike different poses with the artistic installations at various locations of the village, 4) soak yourself in one of the many shops✌"
Great Afternoon activity,"The “Santorini” of Korea is quite a fun stop. We took our time and tried to find as many stamp stations as we could. You can buy a map with the stamp checklist at the info center at the entrance. We just told our guy Gamcheon and he knew right where to go. There’s lots of great views and plenty of little shops for snacking throughout the day. There’s also lots of reasonably priced stores for souvenirs and Korean crafts. Get everything here, much cheaper and eat better variety than other places...and Busan airport doesn’t have anything when you leave except more high end duty free shopping. "
Go early and finish before the crowds,"It was a nice stroll, at a touristy place. The map purchased from the information centre served a a great guide. Chose the most common one and collect the stamps along the way and the tour is over. A great insight to Korean pop art culture. We spent about 3 hours here. "
CUTE,"This is a great place for girls or to take a date, as there are many cute things to see and do here. I am very happy that the relations of North Korean refugees are finally earning some money in this village."
Highlight of our Busan trip,Fantastic place. We visited without any expectations but had a great time. You can buy a map for KRW 2000 at the start and you can collect stamps at various landmarks throughout the walking route. You get a few postcards in exchange. Excellent views of various parts of the city including the harbour. The whole walk takes about 2 hours. 
Great pictures,"If you are into photography, this place makes great pictures. The colours contrast on a sunny day will make good pictures. It’s easy to get to as it’s very near Busan city. Allocate about 2 hours to enjoy a leisure walk around the village."
Lower your expectations and take your time! ,"Just take your time for visiting... and do not expect too much from this place. I would say.. that if you’re here for the gram, then fine! But if you’re here for culture/art installations ... take some time to look through some of the art rooms — of which the house of contemporaries (or the Modern Man) freaked me out. Haha! "
This is a village now catering to tourists and visitors,"We arrived here on a drizzling Tuesday late morning. It was a colourful and sight to take in, and the walk in winter was nice as the weather is cool.This is a village now catering to tourists and visitors, given the number of shops or cafes selling snacks, ice cream, and even renting out traditional Korean costumes for you to walk around in. However, you will also note that there are folks who are actually staying there, and we saw several elderly residents navigating the hilly paths.Take the subway and exit at Toseong station at Exit 6. Walk on and take the first right and walk up the slight slope until you see the bus stop outside the hospital. Take bus 2 or 2-2 and you will get off the top or start of the village. "
Cultural Heaven,"A great place to understand and explore the local culture by visiting this place. Plenty of eatery but pretty commercialize for tourists since this is one of the tourist spot. You can rent Hanbok here and walk around with hairdo and makeup along with accessories. We took plenty of pictures and make sure you get a good pair of shoe to walk around even you are in your rented Hanbok or school uniforms! For souvenirs, do scout around as you might be able to find some good bargain there! "
Amazing,"Good place for a walk around seeing how the area has transformed so beautifully. Good effort. Colourful area, sets your mood light. "
"Colorful, Creative, Nice Place to go, but Dont Rush!","You really need to explore this Cultural Village, slowly, relax and explore many alleys along the way. Best is to buy a Map at the entrance, collect your Stamps at designated locations, look around, plenty of creative paintings, designs, kiosks, stall fronts etc that will amaze you. There are also plenty of small eatery shops, worth to try for your lunch after a long walk. Worth a visit in Busan!"
Beautiful Sight of Busan,It was so nice to see Busan from the top of the hill. Many cafes and restaurants along the street of the village. Petite France location photo
Average tourist spot for photo shooting and day out,"Picturesque tourist spot, a must seen at Busan. I had a pleasant afternoon walking around the village, taking cute photos and enjoy some street food. Overall a relaxing place to visit."
memorable place with fun and surprises,Its a long day walk but definitely worth the calories burn . many beautiful surprises and views . many places to take beautiful pictures. don't forget the post card challenge so you wont get lost inside .
Worth a visit,Interesting area to see how with the help of artists some neighbourhood can achieve some charm. Very colourful houses and art works in random corners. Quite crowded depending on the day with lines of people waiting to take pictures in some spots.
Instagramable place,Beautiful and creatively decorated place. A must go place if you love to take pictures name post them. But be mindful and practice queuing at the popular murals so that you can enjoy the experience better.
An absolute must-visit <3 <3 <3,"Charming, colourful, European and fairytale feels! The village is very photogenic and fun to explore, yet surprisingly peaceful. Allow 3 hours to navigate at a comfortable pace, and wear good walking shoes as the place is hills and stairs galore. A map is available from the information centre at the start for ₩2000, which details a few suggested routes and the main art installations/checkpoints - handy to have for sure. TO GET THERE: Walk out of Exit 6 at Toseong Station (Line 1) and go straight until you get to the first intersection/set of lights. Turn right and walk (less than 50m) to the bus stop just outside the hospital and catch either Bus no. 2 or 2-2. It's a (twisty!) 5-10min drive to the top of the hill where Gamcheon Culture Village is.P.S. The queue to take a photo with the Little Prince statue was at least 30 people long when I visited and I've heard from other friends that it was just as long when they went so be prepared to wait (or give up like I did) when you go."
Interesting Gamcheon,A beautiful heritage of Korean culture. Need to research and decide on the route depending on the available time.. Tiring and a lot of walking.... 
Best Part of Busan!,Lovely village with awesome views of Gamcheon.When strolling to the streets (which can be difficult and tiring due to heavy inclines) you can run into nice piece of all kinds of arts.
Interesting place to visit,"Lovely place to visit, with different exhibits and art installations on display though those things can get repetitive after a while. You can purchase a map from the information centre and participate in the stamp hunt- where you also get free postcards at certain checkpoints. Some parts are hilly and you probably have to walk up and down quite a fair bit of stairs. Expect to get lost too even with maps because some parts of the village can get confusing."
A popular spot - especially at the weekend!,The colour of the houses will draw you in as you pass by and Gamcheon Village is certainly worth a visit. Crowded at weekends viewing is best done during the week when you can take your time to absorb the scenery around you. Was a little underwhelming when viewed on a crowded weekend where parking was at a premium!
Not a must visit,"This place looks way better on the guide books and website compared to seeing it in person. Small village with all the tourist trap, expensive beverages and more... Do not have to purposely make a trip there, go only if you have the time/ "
So so,"Gamcheon Cultural Village is just a so so place for me. I been to Taiwan Culture Village, I think it is better than here. But of cause, for photo shoot is nice because of the colourful house. But depends on the timing you go as well. I think morning will be better."
Must go!,"The history of this village, the support from the govt to beautify this village & making it a tourist attraction is amazing. Free to visit, tons of photo opp."
It was fun,"Do buy the map at the tourist information centre for the collection of 9 stamps. It was only 2,000 krw and you would get free post cards if you reach certain stamp posts (3 post cards in total). You can follow the designated paths and explore around Gamcheon Village. Some routes would bring you to residence areas. It was very interesting to see the life of people in Gamcheon village. However, the maps can be difficult to understand and there aren't many road signs to guide you along the way. But I personally enjoyed the adventure very much. Also, the people here are very friendly. There was even one Ahjumma made us coffee just because we bought stuffs from her stall. I will come back again if I ever have the chance. "
Colorful View,Amazing way to come hereWe went there by bus and we have funAnd we took some pictsYou can rent hanbook also there
Nice place to visit around 4pm,"I went there in Nov by day tour. The tour guide arranged the visit here as our last destination at 4pm. The view is stunning with the perfect sunshine at that moment. We took great pictures there and the street nearby has lots of painting, cafés, accessory shops to visit. I want to stay the whole afternoon here!!!!But I saw the other blog saying that public transportation might not be that good to visit here."
Wonderfully unique,"most interesting set-up with colourful roofs and painted walls, narrow & winding streets that meander past quaint shops and houses; a must-visit attraction."
This is No Machu-Picchu,"Gamcheon advertises itself as the ""Machu-Picchu"" of Korea - well I cannot see it and I was disappointed with the visit. I walked from Toseong Station and it is a very long and steep climb. You follow a road through the village and there are several vantage points along the way. If you like you can veer off this road and explore amongst the local houses. The weather was perfect and there was a huge throng of people visiting many dressed in traditional clothing which was nice. The views are great but I don't think spectacular. I see the village more of a money-spinner for the businesses that line the roadway selling foods and all sort of souvenir tat. Worth a visit but certainly not at the top of my Busan list."
Nothing interesting ,Nothing interesting... more for youngsters who wanna take cute photos. Small area. You'll finish walking in less an hour. 
Very photogenic place,"I suggest you to go to the tourist information center first and buy a map. You would find all the instagrammable spots by doing so. You can collect stamps to put in the map and get postcards in certain spots.Colorful and artsy place, we even stopped every 5 minutes to took pictures.In some spots there were people waiting in line to took a picture.Easy to access by bus."
Look for Observation Decks!,"This was my first stop in Busan after checking-in at my guesthouse and I am glad I did not save it for last! This village is built on a mountainous area so roads can be steep and might require more energy to get around. Wear comfortable walking shoes!I bought a Stamp Map for 2k won and that made getting around a lot easier and more interesting as it gives information about the art work, buildings, and stores. There are about 9 or so stamp stops and 3 of those stops give out free Gamcheon CV postcards. It was so much fun looking for the stamps and meeting other tourists who were doing the same. It's easy to get lost because sometimes the signs are not very clear... Just follow the colorful fish on the walls! The head of the fish points to the direction you should follow. And if the fish disappear... use the map or just get lost and explore! Every nook in this village is beautiful. Remember to keep the noise down because there are still people living in some of the houses, and respect earns respect. BONUS TIP FOR GORGEOUS PHOTOS: Look for ""Observation Decks"" or ""Viewing Points"" at cafés and certain buildings... or if any building you enter says that there's a rooftop viewing platform... GO UP THERE! Many people skip these (maybe because they are tired from all the uphill trekking) and so most photos look the same -- taken from the same, easy access locations. Explore the rooftops/observation/viewing decks for even more gorgeous views of the village, mountains, and ocean! Total time spent there -- 2.5 hours (including 20 min at Avant Garde Café afterwards to catch my breath and rehydrate w a gorgeous view)."
Colourful and fun place,"Unfortunately I had a rainy weather while visiting the village, but it was great anyway.A lot of coffee shops, art shops and activities for kids.You can spend a couple of hours just walking around the cute streets and enjoying the colourful view."
Colour explosion,"Colour neighbourhood, instragramers will love it, if you can have a coffee or a drink in one of the rooftop coffee-shops, looking to the wharf"
Colorful Village,Very easy to reach via public bus. I have limited time when I visited Gamcheon and I was not able to walk slowly and feel the village. 
Colourful houses,Be there to see the housing structure and colours. There are shops there for little shopping as well. Some cafes but no decent place for lunch though. Takes about 2 hours to complete the walk. 
Colourful and traditional cultured town.,Its take about 2 hours to walk around the town. There's some eatery and cafe where you can relax and have some food. The people there are very helpful and friendly
e breathtaking view,"its free, and an actual residential area , I suggest knowing the spots of interest prior,it's more exciting that way than just walking around aimlessly.the alleys to these spots are small so if u don't know, u will easily miss, like going up to the highest deck area to view the whole village, o some cute picture spots, .its lovely n coloufull."
Beautiful,A great place to visit and get some insight into the culture and history of South Korea. Would definitely recommend it if you're in the area 
Photogenic and Great Place to Explore!,"I absolutely loved Gamcheon Culture Village. For me it was a bit tricky to find, somehow I ended up on the wrong side of the hill, had to get directions from locals, but eventually I made my way to the starting point. Gamcheon Village is still a residential area, so enjoy the sites and be respectful at the same time! There are small shops and cafe's scattered throughout. My advice, go without a plan and just wander around the small streets and alley ways. Bring a decent pair of shoes, there are some steep areas! Everywhere you go, you get great views of the colorful houses and surrounding hills. Make sure to stop by the little museum to understand a bit on what the village was prior and how far it has come along. There are several maps and markers along the trail. This village is very photogenic, you are guarantee to get great and fun pictures. I highly recommend adding Gamcheon Culture Village to your itinerary."
Colourful culture village,We were there around 5 p.m. so it was quite a relaxing walk. There’s a lot of photo stops for u you to take pictures but some spots may require a little bit of waiting time. Public toilets are available too. One should have a cup of coffee or drink while enjoying the spectacular view. 
Great view,It wasn't the best day to visit since it rained but we gained a spectacular spot to take incredible photos.
Lovely instagrammable site,"Love it! So many great photo stops; and get to see real people (people living there) and passing by their houses at very close proximity. It's really a privilege for tourists.I really enjoyed myself and would recommend this to anyone, except older folks with knee problems."
Nice view,"I traveled to Busan by Cruise (Costa neo Romantica) in October 2018. The Busan Tourism Board provided shuttle service from the port terminal to Busan station. Previously (Year 2017) the shuttle bus stop at Gukje Market. I took a subway from Busan station to Nampo station and grab a taxi at the exit. It costs around 4,500 won to the village entrance. If you wish to walk around at BIFF square, Jagalchi market, and Gukje market after the village visit, u can take a taxi at the opposite side of the village where the taxi drops you off. "
Busan Must Visit,It was definitely the Santorini of Korea. Great scenery with lots of things to see and explore. You can find absolute fine art pieces and handicrafts walking around the shops in the village. Grab yourself a cuppa coffee and enjoy the great view.
A place Must Visit in Busan,"Basically a place full of tourists. The peoples or the villagers are friendly and helpful. There is a mini map to purchase ( forget the price ) or if not you can take a photo of the map at the map board. Finish line of the village, you can take bus 17 to go back to the subway station or town."
Busan's style,"It's a peaceful & colorful place. The village is so large. It takes about 1 days to go around. If you have a little time, you should go anywhere, don't need to follow the map.The is a cafe (sorry but I cannot remember its name) where has a stunning view. The people are very kind and hospitable.Nice place & high recommendation !"
Beautiful place in Busan,Very nice place with Korean cultural art and shops. We found the shop to rent and dress in traditional costumes with hair set which cost 12000 won per hour. We took bus on the way back.
Wonderful place!,"We enjoyed very much strolling the village. Lots of nice street art, nice spots for pictures, a lot of street food, locals dressed in traditional costumes - all this creates a very nice and festive atmosphere. A must visit place in Busan!"
Loved this place ,Don’t make the mistake of walking from Busan like me catch the bus or taxi long and steep walk great place to visit 
It was nice and small,Holy that travel to this village was steap!!!! But it was worth it! Beautiful little colorful village with good food! 
Cute village ,"Nice place for taking young kids for walking, but from subway to this village it’s kinda tricky. They do have bus from subway to village but need wait for a bit so we walk all the way to the village, not far (1.3k)but very hilly. If no rush you can wait for bus or taxi."
"Scenic, touristy but quirky! Loved.","Gamcheon was one of the highlights of my last few months traveling. Truth be told we only went up for the token photos of the lovely coloured houses. But it ended up being much more than that - lots of activities, shops, stalls, snacks and everything else to enjoy. Who said you couldn't make fun out of nothing?The locals are lovely and are very warm to tourists, there are a lot of them. Expect CROWDS! We walked our way up from the city but take a bus/ taxi if you're more pressed for time. We enjoyed the walk and the calorie burning. There are queues for some of the most popular photography spots but it moves reasonably readily and everyone's there for the same reason so who can blame them. We ended up spending more than a few hours here, there was plenty to explore and enjoy in the end. Our #1 recommend thing for a holiday in Busan!"
Beautiful view,"Was there in Oct 2018.....This place is so much fun! Nearly every time you turn the corner or turn your head a different direction, there is a creative art display. You may think someone is sitting on the wall, but, wait, no. That's just a model of two people, made of clay.(Little Prince and Fennec Fox)That roof over there is adorable! You will never stop looking around you to see what else you can spot. There are fun shops and coffee/tea places along the way. "
Beautiful ,"It's beautiful here. You should go to check little corners. They have some nice murals painting. There are also many little coffee shop in this village. Every little house is cover in color so that the village look amazing. You should take photo near the bus stop at the main gate of the village, there is one photo zone there where you can take the whole view of the village. "
Beautiful place,A very beautiful village with alot of wall art and painting. You can get the village map at ₩2000. It's a must visit place!
Good place but too many people during weekend,"Ive been here for 2 times, too many people and tourist here and it requires you too hike . If you dont think you can walk until the top of it you can take taxi to drop you at there. Its pretty but quite hard to get a good picture esp during weekend. "
As posted ,"The village is on the top of a hill (obviously). Easily accessible via train and change to bus 2 so 2-2, there are tonnes of tourist so u won't miss the stop"
Unique Korean Village,"Situated in the valley between two mountains, this tiny, colorful village has been visited by so many tourist that the residents here ask that you keep a “soft voice” while seeing the sights. Take comfortable walking shoes and bottled water because the steep hills and multiple step levels provide a beautiful representation of life in early Korea but most travelers are not used to the workout.Easy to get here from the beach by metro and then city bus 1011, everything is well marked and people are very open to assist in direction.Recommend for a three hour visit, walk around, have a smoothie before heading back to the beach. "
hillside colored house,Houses built along hillside. Shops are overpriced.Crowded. There are mini vans near the subway station taking you uphill and downhill. You can use your Octopus card to pay for the fare.
Very touristy,"There were lots of people trying to catch various photo opportunities, some spots so popular that there were lines...not for nature shots, pictures of themselves with quirky paintings etc.It is nice to take a photo of the colorful buildings.The food options felt overpriced and set out for tourists, I personally enjoy more authentic food experiences.The town is interesting to walk through but not necessary to go out of your way for."
2nd Time Visit still worth it !,"Last time I'm visiting here on Oct 2015. At that time I only tour half size of the village & enjoy the rest of tour at Youzin Cafe. This time I eat teoppokki , odeng & drink milkis from vending machine .You gotta try this, It's so so so delicious :3 & so so so lovely ! To go here you must ride subway to Toesong Station ( Busan Subway Line 1, Exit 6) & after that ride a local mini bus to go to village entrance. (ride bus number Saha 1-1, Seogu 2 or Seogu 2-2)"
Cute village ,"I caught the 2-2 bus there from the metro, bought a map and wandered around. Lovely place to get lost. Reminds me of places like manarola in Italy. "
Nice typical place,Very nice place to see lots of local art. It was not crowded on Sunday. Not recommended for disabled people.
"One of a kind, crazy collection of houses, artists....AMAZING!","First of all, this place is on the top of a mountain, so very hard journey if you are walking. Once you get there you find a bunch of shops, restaurants, coffee shops and artist studios. Much of the area has no streets, but instead steep steps, narrow walkways and no rhyme or reason for where they start and stop. You can definitely get lost, but will find interesting shops around every turn. Homes are dispersed among the shops so care needs to be taken to not infringe on their property."
Quirky adventure,This village is probably one of the highlights of Korea. If you collect a map at the information centre you can buy a very detailed map. If you wish you can follow the trails and collect stamps on the way. There is something to see every corner you turn and alleyway you weave through. I also recommend lunch at this quirky cafe called Meolakano. It's an intense walk up the hill from the station so I recommend catching the bus up unless you're looking to get your heart rate pumping. Highly recommend!
Amazing,This is similar to cinque terre in Italy. Used to be a slum area and good for the government to refresh and refurbish the area for proper residences and tourists to give it new life. Well done. Its colourful and good to buy souvenirs and socks and snacks. Good photo opportunities everywhere.
My favorite day in Busan,"This place is so much fun! Nearly every time you turn the corner or turn your head a different direction, there is a creative art display. You may think someone is sitting on the wall, but, wait, no. That's just a model of two people, made of clay. But it looked like they were repairing the wall! Oh, look at the fish displayed everywhere. Each one is different, painted in unique ways. Every step on the staircase is painted with different designs or the trees have something colorful and fun dangling from them or hop on a wall for a fun photo. That roof over there is adorable! You will never stop looking around you to see what else you can spot. There are fun shops and coffee/tea places along the way. Just to be practical: there are toilets all along the route but none of them have any toilet tissue, so you might want to bring some. Enjoy your day!"
A different view of busan,"The village is on a really steep hill so if you are game for a good workout, take a hike. Else, recommend to take a bus or a taxi up. It's a nice spot to see murals and how the village stacks up on the mountain which makes it picturesque. There are shops selling food and drinks at the village and that is really for all the tourists that visit. Save the hassle, take a taxi. Your feet will thank you. "
Fun to explore ,"It’s a good hike up the hill to get there but it’s really cool. There’s lots of places to take photos (views, murals and art). "
Super cute,"I spent a few hours walking through the streets and it was truly lovely. While there are a fair few other tourists you can get away from them by goign a bit further. There were lots of tourists dressed in Hanbok that you can hire for photos, I didnt do it but if you were in a group it could be quite nice. There are also many small artists stores that I really enjoyed looking at."
Colorful little town,"It’s a great place to take a walk with friends and family here. There’s abundance of souvenir shops around and lotsa picture spot. Place is sparkling clean and lotsa colorful houses and my advise it to take bus to the entrance, because I walked and it’s uphill! Walk all the way to the back and visit the souvenirs shop on your way back out. :)"
Colorful village,"The culture village is full of colorful houses as can be seen from all the photos. There are also very cute tourist spots for photoshoots as well as little designs and decorations along the streets. The roads are rather sloped and many staircases, so be careful if you have elderly or young children around. Quite worth the visit to this peaceful village for colorful photos. "
Machu Pichu or Favela?,"I was expecting the Gamcheon Cultural Village to be a little different than what I had seen. This place is advertised as the Machu Pichu of Asia. Having been to Peru and traveled to Machu Pichu two months earlier, I did not see the stone architecture and structures that are characteristic of Machu Pichu. Instead, what I saw was a very colourful mass of closely build structures that resemble more of the slums and favelas of Rio de Janario! The main difference of course was in Korea, this are instead of being run by gangs are populated by artists and craftsmen. The village is very clean and is a good place to spend a couple of hours."
Greaaat View,"This is really my fave in Busan! Though its hot when we went here and is crowded, I didnt had the chance to take a pic with Prince, is okay coz I will come back here :)"
Nice walk through this hill side town,"We walked through the main street of the village, all very arty. Buildings nice colours and lots of little shops. Plenty of photo oportunities and good views of Busan."
An alternative to Temples,"Once you have checked out the Temples in Busan, the Gamcheon Culture Village should be high on your list of things to do. It is quite different from anything we have seen before. Our visit was on Sunday so there were plenty of local people there as well. Subway from Busan Station (US$1.50 each way) to Toseong Station is the easiest way to get there, then take a taxi (US$5) to the highest point in the village. The subway and taxi will only take Korean won. There is a self-service ticket machine in the subway, with an English option. The machine will only take coins or 1000 won notes. There is a cash machine that will break down higher currency notes. Not much English is spoken. Ask a local student if you get stuck - they teach English in the schools. The village itself is very interesting. It will take a couple of hours to walk through. Well worth a visit."
"Okay, but nothing more","If you have a day in Busan, put this on your list. Mostly because of the views over the city, and to get some other aspect of Busan. Apart from that, no need to spend too much time there"
Just okay!,"I come to google and TripAdvisor to find something to do for my very first time in Busan, after that i come here via Bus and take a look around. Just okay, beauty view ocean but lot of tourists and price for tourists. Recommend for everyone if you don't know where to go when you go to Busan. "
A highlight of Busan,"We arrived at Toseong Station (Line 1), Exit 6 and you can get any of the buses no. 1-1,2 or 2-2 to go to Gamcheon Cultural village. The path itself is quite winding and steep so I wouldn't advise walking!Easily spent a morning here - try to get a map at the tourist centre. However when we were there a lot of the restaurants and shops were closed (i am guessing due to heavy rain weather prediction?) Still very lovely to walk around, many photo ops. Hat and comfortable shoes needed!You just cross the road from where you caught the bus and catch the same numbers to return to the station."
My favourite place in the whole of Busan ,This place took number 1 spot for me out of all the places I went in busan it was just fun the explore and find all the fun things to see and take part in if you get a map from the information centre you can explore and find all the points of interest on the map so easily. Even all the houses are cute and pretty and all of the residents are so nice. There is a chicken shop on one of the routes GO THERE best checked I had in korea and that's saying alot!
100% positive Dont miss this experience,"This is one of the most delightful places I've ever been. lovely playful art at every turn. take lots of pictures. Be sure to get the free map, it adds so much to the experience. Just up from the entrance (take a taxi to there its cheap) on the left is a cafe coffee shop with a rooftop view rooftop and free WiFi, Lovely owner took pictures for us plus she wanted a couple for herself."
Cultural Field Trip,"The attractions in Gamcheon Culture Village was very interesting with fancy cotton candy, wall art work, store art work, etc. Not recommended for elders with respiratory disabilities due to the roller coaster type of terrain."
Beautiful and unique,This place is a traditional Korean suburb that has been completely refurbished by artists. This place is colorful and great for a nice stroll. You can enjoy nice cafes along the path. I recommend to take the map at the entrance of the village. It will take around 2.5 hours for the full tour.
Worth the climb ,"I highly recommend a trip here for the great views and quirky vibe. The murals and art dotting the village were fascinating to discover and whilst full of tourists, the place still manages to retain a bohemian charm. Do take the ""stairs to see stars"" to exit the village-- 148 steps down, winding through real local residents' houses and art along the way. "
good place,"i went there a few days ago with my family. It was very nice to visit this town, It's a community full of street art with friendly person, highly recommende,"
Get your walking shoes on,"What an amazing place, so many streets to explore and cute little houses. Grab a walking map from the info office and get your little passport stamped along the way so you know you're in the right direction! Loved it!"
Like a Rainbow,"Village is so colourful like rainbow.. like an art village with nice deco, very photogenic place, some cafes & shops, other than that, I find lack of some charm that will attract me to visit again.It's not big so we spend about 3 hours in morning include taking a break in café for cold drink & stop by for some snacks.From Toseong station exit 6, take bus no. 1-1, 2 or 2-2, alight at Gamjeong elementary school. Returning, we take bus at same bus stop.Weather is very hot 34 degree in Aug so guess will enjoy more if not so hot"
Colourful village ,"Beautiful and full of colours. Wish I could stay here as it's brighten my daily life. It's like a maze village with hide-and-seek arts. All you have to do is grab a map and start looking for them. Get ready to climb lots of stairs. If you're tire, there are some cafe around to rest while enjoying the view. Some of the colour or painting have been faded and seem like there is no maintenance on going. "
Colours Everywhere,"We enjoyed our walk tour here as there are maps provided and so much to see and plenty of fun photo spots! you can do your own tour and just buy a map from the tourist counters, no need for guides. :)"
Community of the rainbow,"My family and I spent 3 hours in the morning at this interesting “art village”. Due to too many stops for photograph taking, we could not finish the entire Village. Getting there: There are 2 routes. Firstly, you could go to Goejeong Station (105, Line 1), walk out of Exit 6 and take shuttle bus Saha 1 or Saha 1-1 to the bus stop opposite the Gamcheon Elementary School (not to worry, the bus driver typically will announce). Alternatively, you could go through Toseong Station (109 Line 1) Exit 6 followed by shuttle bus Saha 1 or Saha 1-1 or Seogu 2 or Seogu 2-2 to reach the same bus stop. There are Gamcheon Cultural Village staff at the bus stop with a signage that direct you to the information centre. Behind the bus stop is one of the artwork – 3 human sculptures “Becoming one with Gamcheon”. At the finish point (Message of Hope), you could walk across to the bus stop and take bus Saha 1-1 or Seogu 2 or Seogu 2-2 to the Nampo Station or Toseong Station. We went to the Nampo station where we ate our lunch and then took a bus to the Taejongdae in the afternoon. The attraction: There is no entrance fee. We enjoyed the fruits of this community whose residents vibrantly painted their houses with colours of the rainbow and decorated these with murals and sculptures, and the best part is they allow visitors to walk on the labyrinth alleys outside of their residences. Hence, the least you could do is try not to be noisy or take photographs, selfies or wefies in ways that invade their privacy.When you reach there, I recommend you could go straight to the Information Centre and buy a Gamcheon Culture Village Stamp Map. The map shows you 3 best tour paths (based on the amount of time you have), allows you to put stamps of 12 important sites in the Village, give all the history and information of the Village, and highlight the 54 locations of artwork. The profits from selling the maps and running the businesses for visitors actually are used for the welfare services of local residents, so you are doing some form of charity work.What we enjoyed: We liked the extensive artwork, especially the “swimming fishes” along the wall of the alley road, flower pots sitting on top of jeans, and the murals. We saw there was a long queue for photograph taking at the Little Prince and Fennac Fox. We also saw visitors renting and wearing the hanbok while they happily walked the Village. Of course we liked the beautiful scenery of the rainbow-coloured houses in which there are several locations for taking magnificent panorama photographs, selfies and wefies – the best location is at the Haneul Maru rooftop (you have climb several steps). What also strikes me about this Village is that because the houses are built on “terraced land”, most houses will not block the view of their neighbour’s house. If you are hungry, there are a few restaurants plus many shops selling ice-creams, drinks and other Korean “finger” food.As Gamcheon Cultural Village requires plenty of walking, do bring wear a comfortable pair of walking shoes and drink plenty of fluids, especially on a hot day. Have fun at this not-to-be missed attraction that’s often known as the “Santorini of Korea”!"
cool art neighbourhood,"This is a really unique area. It is an old neigbourhood that has been updated with cool art installations. Great for photos, shopping, and cafes."
Cute shops and sightseeing,"This village is cute and colorful. Our tour guide told us that many refugees live here. I found a hand-made flower tea shop, a bookmark with Hangul, and some earphone wrappers.She also told us that it is easy to get lost so stay on the main road. Also, the trek down might not be as easy as it looks because the paths veer sideways and there are inclines. Half of our tour got lost and they looked out of breath, sweaty and red when we picked them up down below."
Colourful Busan,"Loved the vibrant colours of the village. Instead of the usual taking bus up to the village from the subway, we walked up to the village. It is a hilly walk but you get to see lots of mural paintings on the wall as you walk up. Means more photo-taking points! oh yes, if you are fan of the little prince book. There is also ""little prince"" photo points you can take photo with.Thoroughly enjoyed the visit to this village."
"Nice walk, beautiful views","The walk through the village is very nice, follow the map and visit the art places, great experience. Enjoy a coffee at one of the roof top terraces!"
Nice project!,It was very nice to visit this Village! It's a community full of street art with friendly people! Recommended!
Interesting cultural village,Visited this village as part of our tour. Colourful place with very good spots for photoshoots. Needs a lot of walking too to explore the quaint little houses and shops. Worth visiting.
Interesting and Colourful Village,"It's easy to take a bus from Toseong Station, exit 6. Take buses 1-1, 2 or 2-2 to bring you all the way to the village. The village is representative of Busan. A must-visit to take a closer look at an authentic neighbourhood in Busan. The colourful houses and quaint art decorations brighten up your photographs. Entrance is free, but you can buy a map at the information counter. Visit all the suggested sites and collect the stamps from there. There are plenty of cafes and eateries around, so you can take breaks in between your visit. Bring a cap or an umbrella in summer as it can get pretty hot!"
Nice place to visit,"Use about 3 hours to complete and get all the stamps, nice place to visit and for photo shooting. Like this place "
Worth The Hike,"Went to this infamous attraction on foot from Nampo Station. It was quite a hike. If you enjoy walking, you can do so, but bear in mind, it's very steep. Alternatively, you can take Buss 2-2 from Nampo station for 1100KRW which will drop you at the front gate of the Cultural spot. Walk further to witness the beauty of the scenery. Definitely most recommended. "
A lovely place to visit in Busan,Beautiful scenery with colourful houses and surroundings. Nice cafes are available. Nice to walk around and shop for souvenirs/local products. Would definitely visit again should I come to Busan again in future.
recommended,"Good for village / historical view. Nice to work around , if you want to buy souvenir this a place. good walking area "
Gamcheon Culture Village,The village has been reborn as Busan’s most colorful and artistic spot. Trip to Busan wouldn't complete if you not visit this village. Enjoy your coffee/dessert with beautiful views.
A lovely place with colorful houses,"A nice place with nice scenery and cafes.Plenty of photo spots, beautiful views of the village and surroundings and lively atmosphere. Easy to get lost,recommend buying a topical map."
Colourful village,"This is one of the most recommended places in Busan. This village shows Korean tradition. There are a lot of points to take a photo and enjoy this colourful village. There is a tourist information centre at the entrance, you can ask for a map there. Keep walking and don't forget to say hi to the Little Prince."
Interesting Cultural Village,"Plenty of photo spots, beautiful views of the village and surroundings and lively atmosphere. Can be tiring as there is a lot of walking when exploring the village. Buying the Village map/guide (near the entrance) is advisable."
Gamcheon Culture Village,A nice place with nice scenery and cafes. Looks very much like Cinque Terre in Italy in some ways. A couple of hours there will be enough
A lovely place with colorful houses,"Just a short walk from toseong station, you can catch a bus to gamcheon culture village. And the bus stops right at the entrance of the tourist attractions. It was so hot in July since it's summer time. There are souvenir shop along the entrance and throughout the walk. They sell socks, traditional stuffs as well as post cards of gamcheon and little prince. The village itself is really pretty in every corner. Many people still live in the actual houses so some roads are closed for tourists. There are photo stops and artworks along the way that makes it more exciting to experience. The famous photo stop would be the little prince with the fox, for which we must queue for a while.Tips : Do buy a map (2000 won) and walk through the walking course in the map. By buying a map you can get free postcards in the postcard shops along the road. You can also collect stamps and get prizes. "
Brilliant!,"Very lovely place- must visit in Busan. Took the local bus after exciting the subway haha quite a ride I must say. Paradise for taking pictures and little craft shop lovers. Stopped at one of the cafes with nice view of the village. Take your time- explore, you might find some hidden gems of art."
Must-visit in Busan. Great views and just plain fun,"If there is one place that you should visit in Busan, Gamcheon is highly recommended. Formerly a slum village outside of Busan, the houses here have been turned to a beautiful collection of cafes, museums, shops and art installations. Residents still live here though, which makes the entire place even more intriguing.PSA: Before you start your journey here, it is strongly recommended to obtain a Gamcheon Cultural Village Stamp Map from the Village Information Center (at the entrance to the village, also where this pin is at).The map costs 2,000 won per piece, but it helps tremendously in navigating the place and finding the important tourist spots. The village is quite big and it's quite easily to get lost without a handy map.Aside from that, the map also gives you an activity to do around the village, other than just plain sightseeing and wondering around. You can go on a Stamp Hunt to collect stamps in exchange for free postcards. The map also gives you 3 routes suggestion to visit the place. TLDR: GET THE MAP.The village is one of the top highlights of our Busan trip for various reasons. The beautiful scenery with the village and the sea as the backdrop was enough to take our breath away, and there were a lot of vibrant and colourful places for us to snap those insta-worthy shots.There are also hipster cafes for you to just chill and spend time in, with souvenir shops that sells local items. We especially enjoyed the stamp hunt that brought us around the place, which showed us a side of life that we have never seen. Seeing the houses and realizing that people do live here is a humbling experience. The 2,000 won for the map was the best money I've spent in my trip. Beautiful, breathtaking and fun. Gamcheon should be the top destination for anyone coming to Busan.To get to the village, you can only take small public buses from the nearby metro stations."
Tourists only,"We walked all the way from metro station - not recommended. Too steep! Take a local bus instead. The village existed for the tourists only, IMHO but it is one of the place that tourist gets to do what tourist do, souvenirs, foods (highly priced) and lots and lots of photo opportunities. You get good view of the village at certain places, it’s colorful enough. It looks better in the photo than in actual locale, still, it is a “must” stop in Busan."
Fantastic must see sight,Really impressive but need enough stamina to stroll the myriads of alleys. Very impressive cultural village with the colours. Easy accessibility after getting off the MRT with direct bus....
Photogenic small city,"We went there on a sunny day, great for picture taking but took a toll on our energy. You can get there by subway then bus or taxi. We bought a map for $2 and completed the shortest route and got a free postcard."
nice colour...,i went there from busan station by bus. the village become popular among korean drama fan. the house painted with the vibrant colour and there so many steps and alley. it is a good place to take photo with nice background. there also some souvenirs shops and restaurant along the road. the best thing is they provide a lot of toilet in the village.
Pleasant & quirky stroll,"Nice stroll with quirky cafes & souvenir shops, and whacky art installations. Traffic getting up there can be a bummer and the buses are quite crammed, so a cab ride is recommended. "
Sightseeing,"Basically, i’m here just because of Fight my way drama series. Not much time to spend here. when we arrive here its still earlier (before 10am) most of the cafes still not open yet. Here have convenience store, souvenir store, rental hanbok store and hipster cafes. We just took picture and go back to our hotel to check out. If you have spare time come here and explore more. "
Touristy,"A very popular tourist spot, especially after filming Running Man. Quite a number of photo taking check points, girls should be happier than boys when they are here."
One of the must see places in Busan,I was there with a family of three. The way the government has turned this into an art and culture hub is fantastic. Working up or down the village may not be for every one but you can still take good colorful pictures of the village. Great visit.
A rainy day but fun,"We came to Busan on a very rainy day so at least we did not have to line up to take a picture with the Little Prince statue- the most famous spot here. We spent 1 2 hour there because of the rain, but my other friend took 5 hours exploring. Very fun."
Great place to take WeChat/Instagram pictures...but otherwise?,"I may not be fully absorbed in the cultural context to get this place....but all I saw was a bunch of older houses and lanes built into a hillside that had been aggressively made into a tourist attraction. Having heard it called ""Korea's Machu Pichu"" or ""Santorini"" beforehand....perhaps my expectations were too high.- Honestly there were some solid looking coffee shops and cafes there - perhaps that's worth it for some people? I was happy enough with the place I found with a good view - but it wasn't worth the hike all the way around town.- There were lots of places to take pictures - is this in something famous????- Do you like dressing up in ""traditional"" outfits? You've found the place.Anyway, fun for some - but not really a major destination worthy of any sort of ""must-visit"" status. Unless your WeChat feed / Instagram postings are short that day..."
The colourful village !,"This was the highlight of my Busan trip. I spent a good 4-5 hours here just wandering around the houses. Very beautiful, artistic and peaceful. Great for photos. They have these weird one rooms with strange levels of art that you must check out. It’s hard to explain but it’s very cool. There’s a cute little cafe there also where you can buy small gifts and souvs and get some food as well. Can’t wait to come back here :)"
Very refreshing air,"From Toseong Station Exit 8, I walked to Gamcheon Culture Village. When I asked a local girl about this place, she recommended me to take a bus or taxi because the place is so far away from Toseong Station. I read that I need to walk about 20 minutes to reach the place hence I decided to just walk. I forget that I a slow walker and with the uphill route, I arrived at the village about 45 minutes later. I did not regret my decision because there were so many new places that I saw between the station and village. It is a refreshing and interesting experience.The village was very nice, very organized. The view was so great, I could see the mountain and sea from the village. The air was so great. This is the reason why Busan became my favourite one. The air was so great. The lady seller were so nice and talked to me in a pleasant way.I really enjoyed my trip in here and while mesmerized with the view, I forgot to collect most of the stamps! There were so many art in there.I spent more than 2 hours in this place. We can buy a stamp tour map at the gate for 2000 Won."
Must visit!,"The place is nice,colorful,great for photography and shopping. We went there from Busan station on the orange line get off at Toseong station (109) then exit 6 and walk to the bus stop in front of Busan Cancer Center, take the minibus no 2,2-2 or you can check the bus number at the bus stop , the bus stop in Busan is quite modest, there are the screens showing the buses arriving and the Korean people are kind giving advices and answer yous questions,Languages are only a small obstacle get off at the Gamcheon is easy, it is in front of the elementary school there are shops along the wayand the goods there are cheaper than what we see in the cityfor me it is a must to visit"
Photogenic place,"Came here as part of a tour and glad I did not do it on my own and take up a lot of time. It is a colourful village, great for taking some photos and good to see how it changed from a slum. However, apart from taking a some nice photos you do not need to spend too much time here, it is very touristy."
Beautiful village,"The walk to collect stamps took around 2hrs, definitely a highlight of Busan. Some great photo ops here!"
Unique colorful houses,"It is good for a first look. People's houses are colored and we can travel through each of them. We could take a good view of the whole area too from a high area. However, we may not find many interesting attractions here. Thus, it may be good for a slow and relaxed short tour."
Nearly not as good as advertised...,"I found it sort of disappointing and very touristy. The view was okay but not really as colorful as they would make you believe. Wouldn’t recommend going there, you won’t miss much."
Busan’s most colorful and artistic spot.,"One of the tourist spot you must visit and very instagram-able! Colorful. If you going to walk around inside, remember to collect stamps along the way for collection. "
Beautiful charming quaint little town,Nice picturesque spots throughout this village. Does look abit like the Santorini of the East. Lots of souvenir and cafes. Only thing I found lacking was the number of restaurants- seems to be pretty limited here.
How to make from slums the Santorini of Korea,Poverty has gone and it is now a friendly neighborhood with up market restaurants but also room for the small wallet. 
Go See This Unique Place,Didnt really care about going here. I was so wrong. Very interesting with amazing views. Not for those that can’t traverse hills.
"Interesting history , very photogenic place","Great place to take lots of photos and get souvenirs. There are 3 variations of the route which can take 40 mins, 1hr 20 or 2 hrs. We got tired as there is quite a big incline/decline but still enjoyed the view.Would recommend buying the map to support the community and its very useful to find landmarks."
Art disguised as a village.,"If you want to take lots of photos and explore the village, this place is definitely the spot. I went here twice in the space of a few days. The first time I went there was with a friend and the second one solo. I am going to review the 2nd part since I did more on the 2nd trip. So the thing is it is easy to go there. There's a local GREEN bus going to take you and you should stop at the elementary school opposite of the village. Once you got there. do check the map of the village and find a so call stamp office where you can receive the map of the village and you can finish stamping certain checkpoints. This is the best way to explore the place. the map is gonna be cheap and I really recommend you to buy it so that you wont get lost in the village! plus every house is so aesthetically artsy and vividly colourful! Personally, I really recommend any future traveller to wear lightly but most importantly running shoes! The journey involves lots of up and down the hill and to a certain extent the stairs! other than that do not forget to bring the camera! There's also a chicken place in the middle of the village and I do recommend their food. Nice old couple were the owners there and the chicken was amazing. back to the village, it is best to be there around 9am to avoid the sun in the afternoon and the sunlight direction during the period is the best for photoshooting. so that's it from me! enjoy your time in Gamcheon Village!"
An interesting hilltop village.,"Nice views, friendly people interspersed with fun artwork and some nice cafes and stalls. Worth a visit, though often crowded and pretty manufactured."
Take the BUS! ,"Do not make the same mistake as I . So when you got off the station, you will see signage that says Gamcheon Culture Village 1200m or something, so I thought, ""hey it's doable, I'll just walk then"". Bad decision because the road there is DEAD STEEP! By the time I reached the village, I couldn't feel my legs because all the ""hiking"" . The place is quite big and if you love taking pictures, allocate more time here because cute spots for pics are everywhere. There are information about the village here and there, so take your time to read it. And after the unintended hiking, sitting at the top looking down a beautiful scenery of colorful houses and Busan from the top while sipping cold beverage is just what I need. There are a lot of cafes and souvenir shops around a few costume rental places just in case you want to do the sightseeing while wearing hanbok or Korean-high-school-uniform. "
My fave place in Busan ,"Wasn't able to visit 2 years ago when in Busan as wasn't feeling well. My husband had visited and recommended it so was looking forward to going. It's very touristy but you didn't feel unwelcome like at Ihwa mural village in Seoul. The main thoroughfare was interesting and quirky with alot of indie shops, one of which was a postcard place - love the concept but my postcards to my friends still haven't arrived after close to 2 weeks! The longer route on the tourist map takes you to some bits of the residential area where there are pods of art installations so you can end up spending quite alot of time there. I love the different art work dotted around, the sculptures and colours on the building. Everything was just so vibrant. We took a bus from the subway station to the village but walked down which was nice and took us through another village with good views of Busan. It's strange it's not mentioned in the guide books but I would defo like to visit again when I am next in Busan. "
Colourful,"We went by bus to Gamcheon Village and it was a direct bus to the starting point. The tourist information centre was very helpful and for 2,000 WON (roughly $2 USD) you can buy a map with designated paths depending on your fitness and on how much time you are willing to spend. It is still a residential area so the roads are quiet and there is a lot of interesting quirky attractions as you walk along the designated paths.You can't get lost and you will see markings on the wall in the form of wooden fish to guide you and people are very friendly. It was a pleasant day with lots of sunshine and being an athletic family it was a very nice experience. I would recommend dressing comfortable but nice if you plan on posting insta-worthy photos!"
Interesting Places to Explore if you take the time,"Went for a short visit to Gamcheon Culture Village and had planned to stay for 2 hours, but ended up taking 4 hours due to the many interesting shops and cafes that you can visit just off the main routes.Advisable to purchase the Local Map at Information Center for 2000 Won ( proceeds of these goes towards social services for the old and elderly in the village and other community projects to sustain this place). As you follow the map and visit some places where there are STAMPS for you to chop on your Maps, some stops actually give you nice Post Cards of the Village as well.Took the longest Route 2 hours and got to stop by many interesting arts and craft shops as well as the opportunity to sit down and relax to enjoy the fantastic views.Can be quite hot in the summer and best to be prepare to wait at some photo stops ( Little Prince overlooking the village and Love Locks) when big tour groups do stop by. Do bring along caps or umbrellas, sunglass and lotion to protect against the hot summer heat.As i had 3 persons in my group, it was cheaper to take the taxi down and down from the Village Entrance to BIFF Square ( Under 5000 Won )Overall, this is one of the Must See Places if you do come to Busan. "
Whimsical!,It’s summer and it was very hot when we arrived at Gamcheon CV. The crowds tend to gather at the first few sights. We walked ahead and found peace and quiet as we admired the whimsical paintings on the walls and steps. Would recommend this place for a visit in Busan! 
Very interesting place,Very colorful place! An interesting walk in this cultural village. Lots of steps to climb but worth it for beautiful photo taking. Was a little hot in end June as there are no trees so it is better to go in the earlier part of the morning and then to jagalji market nearby for lunch.
Cool area worth a walkthrough ,While there isn't anything truly amazing here the neighborhoods colorful houses and artsy feel is pretty unique for Korea. It is worth a walkthrough if you like funky neighborhoods. Be mindful that the area is really hilly though and wouldn't be good for people with mobility issues. 
Worth a visit,"Requires a lot of walking, with some hilly road, and halal food is difficult to find here. Best to come when there’s festival going on so it adds to the view experience"
Colorful cultural village,"Nice place to be visited. So many instagrammable photo spots. You can see the colorful painted houses, and you can find shops along the street. Here you can see the local houses uniqely arranged with very small alleys."
Great Spot for Photography,"The colourful houses, artistic murals and interesting little shops made this a must-go in Busan. I purchased a trail map from the tourist information centre and collected all free postcards at the checkpoints along the trail. There were like 3 or 4 options of trail we could follow. I did not want to spend too much time there and picked one that would take around 2 hours."
Overated,"I just got bored here. There is nothing to do.The houses is like you can see in the pictures, but after you take that picture (that is no that great to begin with), there is nothing else to do."
Amazing Place,"A colourful unique village with lots of photo opportunities. We had fun walking uphill and downhill for 5-6 hours exploring the longest trail and collecting stamps at various points. Along the way, you will discover lots of interesting houses, murals and arts. This is a great place to spend time wandering around. Just come with a good walking shoes, sunblock and water!"
Rich History,You will love it once you visit this area. It's a local residential and you could see the real bustling small town instilled with rich history.
The Santorini of the East,My family and I were extremely impressed with the beauty and charm of the place. It took us about 5 hours to explore the place and every part of the place were as captivating as the other. A thoroughly enjoyable visit to the Santorini of the East.
Must See when in Busan,Vivid and colourful small village nestled amongst steep and narrow streets. Excellent place to spend a couple of hours and very good opportunities to snap some great colourful photos. Be prepared to walk a lot up and down hill.
Nice place to have a look,"Old city town of Busan, lot of colors, nice and smiley people, can find some great vegetables and fruits around the small fresh market you could find.Be careful, some small paths are quite steep.I would advice to spend couple hours then head to the fish market not far from it.A good place to feel the old Korean vibes."
Must visit spot in Busan,I love these little village by the Nampo area. It is a must visit spot and let you get to know more about how ppl in here used to live. I will definitely come back to visit again!
Fantastic view with lots to keep you occupied,"Fantastic view with lots to keep you occupied! Lots of shops and cafes along the way, and don’t miss the hidden alleys and gems (sometimes good to tag along a tour group)"
Day Trip,Wow...I am amazed at how folks from the past lived in such tiny houses. A climb up the steep slope reveal many tiny colorful houses..
Made for tourist,"Do not be taken by the word 'Cultural,' as there was nothing cultural about this place. This place was created for the tourist to fill in their time when visiting Busan. They even created a 'traditional' market with mannequins who were supposed to be traditional traders with their products (all dummies). Only go if you have lots of free time to spare. Personally for my wife and I did not enjoy the visit. They could have added more colours to the homes of the village rather then shades of blue, cyan and green."
Gamcheon, Beautiful and colorful Village built on the hillside with lots of quirky art throughout the streets. Great place for wandering around.
Stamp quest,"Great area for art lovers and it's quite scenic. Friends and family can enjoy getting the stamps at various check points when they purchase a map for 2000 won , at the end you receive a token for completion. You can also enjoy renting the Hanbok for memorable photos."
Scenic,"From the train station, you will need to take a bus to go up to the village which is situated on top of the hill. The place has a lot of nice view for photo taking. Not just that, you will find a lot of nice places, tucked among the little alleys, with interesting paint work. There are little cafes and souvenir shops that sells their signature landmarks in the form of postcards, paper weights etc.. a place not to be missed if you are in Busan."
Nice place to get lost in,Better to visit around evening time before sunset. It makes colors play even more amazing. Be ready to climb some steps. Actually there are a lot of ways to squeeze between those buildings and each of them is uniques. 
"Busan, Jun 10 2018",Don’t forget to buy map @ the entrance (information center) and collect stamp while you’re exploring...
Colourful place for amazing pictures,"Recommended to buy the map of the place for KRW2000 and to go along the trail to collect the stamps along the way. When I went in June 2018, the weather was cooling and the trail was easy to follow and walk along. I took the longest trail to collect all the stamps. There are many places of interest there and a large variety of food cafes and shops along the way to keep you entertained and to rest for a moment so that you would not feel as tired. The exhibitions were interesting as well. The place is easily accessible through the metro and then by taking the bus ( bus 2 or bus 2-2 ). "
Something to do when you have time,"Went over late morning, a little overhyped. Some photo opportunities. Took bus 1 back to Gaejeong instead of bus 2, 2-2 because of the crowd. Don't try to climb up from Toseong. It's a very steep climb. "
Delightful walking tour,"The village itself wasn't very impressive, kinda touristic with many gift shops also people dressed in a Korean dress, but still delightful to walk along the hill and alleys, recommend to do the whole circle."
You can walk or you can take the bus,"We made the mistake of choosing to walk from the subway. The uphill walk is really steep and long, making this the first time I perspire in my 6 days here. During the approximately half an hour walk, we were overtaken by an elderly gentlemen, by a lot. However what greeted us at the end of the walk was one of the most beautiful village I have ever seen. You can almost see the soul of the villagers as they decorate each and every building - you will never guess that this used to be a slum. Amazingly. Make all effort to invest 2-4 hours of your trip here. "
Prepare for the steps!,"Gamcheon Culture Village offers beautiful views of colourful little houses on the hillside. You can take a bus all the way to the entrance of the village which I recommend since the roads are super steep and there will be enough climbing once you're in the actual village.The views make the climb worthwhile. You can also take part in a stamp collecting adventure with a map. There are spots everywhere in the village where you can get a stamp on your map and if you collect them all, you get some free postcards from the tourist info."
Colourful village,Very nice to walk through the various streets. Lots of things to see and places for photo opp. Worth a visit.
Colourful village with good view point,"There are 3 courses in which you can explore the village, each taking 40, 80 and 120 minutes.There are good photo zones where you could get a full view of the Gamcheon cultural village, with its colourful housing. I recommend to get a map of the place at the tourism information centre, which costs around 2000krw."
Nice Residential Village,"I expected a bit more in terms of colours of buildings and the murals and exhibits there. There is a 'Little Museum' after the entrance but it was disappointing as there is no English explanation and the exhibits are really sparce.The traditional souvenir shops have really nice products. I was tempted to buy little Lucky Paper Shoes but was too scared they would be crushed in the suitcase.You gotta queue to have a picture with 'The Little Prince'. Remember to keep your voices down. It is a residential area. Directions:.. Toseong Station.. Exit 6.. Walk to the right side.. Bus stop in front of Busan Cancer Centre.. Bus 1, 1-1, 2, 2-2 To return, the fastest is to take Bus 1 or 2 from the opposite side of Gamcheon Cultural Village to Toseong.The buses is available at Nampo and Jagalchi IF i am right. "
Beautiful place,"Came here on a rather wet day with light drizzle. Easy to get here by taking bus number 1-1, 2 or 2-2 and drop off at the elementary school. Recommended to get a map from the tourist info centre for easier navigation. Was not crowded when I came on a Monday morning, probably because of the drizzle. Good view from the top and managed to squeeze through the narrow alley to visit different places. Lovely. Would have been better if it wasn’t drizzling. Nonetheless, enjoyed it."
Art Roundabout or the View,"Rated a must see on a trip to Busan but not sure why I decided to make the visit - got to the village early evening - sun had gone down and very little light - thought is was a wasted trip as all the stores were closed - driver showed us the view of the houses - all in symmetry of height for everyone to have the view of the water - must be a beautiful sight during the day- we decided to walk around and make most of the trip - then we came upon the delightful murals - some were upfront for you to see - on the facade of the shops and houses but others were a find - the stairs with the row of houses replicating the village but most of all the bookcase stairs with the african themed pictures on the walls, the floors, the roof and ooooh the well cover- pictures of the art were stunning. In the most suprising places were different forms of art - the Gamcheon village was a thrill at night - I am looking forward to spending a day there just discovering all the pieces of art in the nooks and crannies - a good reason to go back to Busan"
The Machu Picchu of Korea,"This is an unique place where there are many pretty spots for photos. I love sitting at a cafe at the top of Machu Picchu looking down at the beautifully constructed houses. You can even see the sea,"
Love this place,Very quaint and nice village situated on mountain top. Love every corner and it's full of 'pictures-moments'. Highly recommend and not to be missed! 
Fun-tastic place for instagrammer,Parking was a challenge at first though we found a multistory carpark near the entrance. It was pretty crowded but everyone was queuing in an orderly fashion for photos. We strayed into the smaller streets and found the apartments to be quite cute. There were alot of spots for photos so do spend about 3-4 hours there. There were a couple of cafes along the way. Enjoy! 
A must-see in Busan,"Before you go, check the weather first. We only had 1 day in Busan, so we didn’t have much choice, and the day we went to Gamcheon village happened to be rainy. To get to the village, you need to be ready to walk a lot, mostly climb up the hill. It’s also possible to take the bus No. 1 or 2 near the sign to the village, but we decided to get there the hard way. The village itself is not big, you can see most important places from the map in 5-6 hours, I guess. If the weather’s fine, you can take awesome photos and no one will guess that it’s in Korea."
Santorini of korea ,A place that will take a lot of photos. And I missed the ice cream over there. There are people renting school uniform for photo taking as well. 
Great walk with some shops and amazing little houses,"We took the public bus #87 from Busan station. It is a steep/very steep 500 metre walk to the entrance of the village. It’s worth it. The village can be done as a loop walk or from one end to another and then take the bus back. There are maps for sale at the info centre but it’s not really needed.Souvenir and snack shops are lined on the route until you see the “Little Prince” which many say is where the best views are. Don’t worry, there will be lots of people there so you’ll know where.It is still a residential area so be wary of this."
Nice place!,It's a great place I want to in April really beautiful cherry blossoms you can see the cherry blossoms hide in a mountain on this place. Good view 
Once colourful and cute Cultural Village now a tourist trap,"Cute colourful houses with some very quiet side streets make for an interesting walk around. The main street running from the entrance at the top of the village is very over-run with tour groups which spoil the charm and character of this real-life residential neighbourhood. I feel that this was a ""hidden gem"" and a real cultural area a few years ago but now it's been over commercialized and feels like a tourist trap.We went on a weekend so it may possibly be better to visit on a weekday when it's less crowded."
Fun and quirky,Fun colourful streets with great views. Lots of options for souvenirs. Set up for photo opportunities especially great when the weather is good 
A Must,"Gamcheon Culture Village is a must when you are in Busan. Behind the colorful houses, there was a sad history but today, Gamcheon Culture Village is full of art installations, murals, cute little shops, galleries and cafes. You could easily spend a whole day there. We highly recommend you to take your time and slow down your pace when you visit the Gamcheon Culture Village."
Outstanding photo ops; arrive early to avoid crowds ,"This is the only attraction in Busan we actually visited twice during our six day visit-once during a city tour and the second time on our own (only 3500 won from the closest metro station Tonseong). There were lots of tourists even on weekdays, but we got there before ten to avoid the largest crowds. The map from tourist office was indispensable though it was not free. We enjoyed the many artworks and the nice views. There were lots of annoying cables dangling around ( not dangerous just makes it hard to take nice pictures sometimes) and lots of the houses were actual residences and off limits but there were plenty to see (we picked the 2 hr route on the map). Overall our top designation in Busan."
"Colouful, fish cakes, photography ","A popular place especially for young adults and families. Lots of opportunities for photography with colourful art all around. Enjoyed the fish cake stalls and taking photographs of the village. Popular for couples, friends and families. Accessible by public transport."
Colorfull vilage,Santorini of Korea. The street decorated with mural paintings. It's fun exploring the alley in this village
Very interesting,"Ex bidonville, now the place to see. Very nice even if too touristic now. Very smart cahnge for this arty place. With a nice view also."
"A unique, colourful place for art lovers","A landscape that is very different from the rest of the city. Plenty of shops, cafes and galleries... a must see for art lovers."
Must see,Its so cool. One of the first village local settles in. The road goes up and down quite extreme. So do wear sport or flat shoes. There are must eat and must shop nearby. Best of all check and plan your photo route. 
A few hours on a rainy day,"It is quite a walk up to the Gamcheon Culture Village, so I would advise you to take a bus. Most of the busses departing from the Jagalchi market go to the Gamcheon Village. Once up you don't have much to see. There is one very cosy street with most of the shops and cafes. There is not much to see from the ''village'' we want for our pictures for that you have to go in a small street to get most of the gorgeous shots. I wouldn't advise to stay here more than 2 hours, but it is a must visit in Busan."
Colourful sight,"I first came across Gamcheon Cultural Village when I saw my friend's instagram post with the prince. Some described it as the ""santorini"" of Korea. The view did not disappoint. Wall murals and photo spots abound. They have cute shops too. Initially wanted to walk up from the Toseong subway station seeing that it is quite near. However we decided to take the local bus, which we did not regret as the uphill climb has many twists and turns. Don't bother with the stairs to see stars though, it's just a super long staircase of 148 steps that you may get dizzy climbing. Be careful of cars on the narrow roads and keep your volume down as it is a residential area."
Color Blocks,"One of the greatest reasons why Busan has always on my Must Visit list. The alleys, the colors, and the people themselves were soooo niceeee. We met some locals who recommended us the best spot to enjoy the view (even with our limited verbal communication). Though great photo taking spots could be found almost everywhere, it was kinda tiring to walk around because of the slopes, especially for elderly. But the whole long walk is enjoyable since so many stuff like cafes and street arts can be found along the way."
Cherry Blossom Escapade,"We visited Busan only for a day. I recommend staying a bit long - 2 days or more. You'll love Busan. :DWhen we went to Korea, it was transition from winter to spring (March 28-April 2), so the cherry blossoms in Seoul were still not in bloom. Thankfully, we had our dream cherry blossoms when we visited the Gamcheon Culture Village in Busan. The perimeter of the village was lined with beautiful cherry blossom trees that bloom earlier than Seoul. It was cut straight out of an anime scene. Super nice! Other than that, there were tons of tourists. Some picture-taking spots are lined up with people, so wait patiently. The whole village is art so if you are into it, you'll definitely enjoy every corner of the village. The scene is lovely, and there are a lot of shops, so you won't starve. It will be a feast for your eyes and sugar loving taste buds. It is really big so wear comfortable shoes when walking there and check out galleries of artists. Enjoy!"
Lovely village,"Nice for a morning plan. We walk from our hostel near busan tower. Plenty of stores, cafe, street art."
Great photo-taking spots,"Nice place to take photos at as the background of the houses are colourful, along the way to various checkpoints, there are painted walls, sculptures for visitors to take photo with as well. Couple of cats along the way which are really cute too! Word of caution is to take a bus up to the village instead. Walking up seems like a short distance but the route are filled with uphill roads, steep slopes, winding alleys that makes you give up especially if the wrong route was taken. The signs around are not very clear as well thus safest choice is still by bus or taxi after getting out from the subway station. "
Attracted by the Little Prince,"Solely because of the statues of the Little Prince and its characters. Look great in the photos! Although the queuing line is not short, worth waiting!"
Cute but not a must see site,"The cultural village is cute. There are a lot of wall murals to photograph. The book staircase is probably the coolest of them all. But I didn't find there was much to do other than wander and the cultural area really isn't that big, so for the time it took to get there, we didn't spent that much time at the actual site. If you are pressed for time, skip it. There are much better sites to see in Busan."
Must go place,this is a must-go place in busan. where they have a saying that this place is also the asia's machu picchu. walking through gamcheon culture village and taking photos with all the street arts drawn. There is also the story of Little Prince in there. Do remember to take photo with little prince!
an enjoyable diversion,"Very fun for about an hour. We went late in the afternoon, 4pm. I could see how it could get very crowded to recommend going early or late."
Photogenic Tourist Destination ,"We took a taxi from Haeundae as recommended by our Concierge. The fare was around KRW25,000 & took around 30 minutes. It was worth the hassle since our hotel was not near the subway. Gamcheon Culture Village is worth the trip. Very photogenic and it was fun exploring the side streets. "
A must visit in Busan,"The colorful painting makes Gamcheon Culture Village really attractive. It's sad when we visited this April, it was raining the whole day so we couldn't explore a lot here.I wish i could stroll around a little longer."
Nice quaint town nearby Jagalchi market,"Brightly colored seaside town that was converted from pheasant quarters, now lined with rows of cafes and some 100 street graffiti art "
An interesting and artistic village to spend a whole afternoon,"The area is quite hilly so that you need to prepare well for a lot of walking up and down hill. You may find a convenient spot to park your car or park at a public carpark at the official entrance of the area up at the top of the hill. You may be thrilled by numerous tourists from Korea itself and overseas, as this area is very popular for tourists. There are lot of shops but also coffee shops to take a break when you feel tired. Do read the map carefully as you may miss one critical turn which lead you downhill so that it may take a tiring and longer journey to return to where you want to go."
"Fun, quirky, and full of cultural history about the village of Gamcheon.","I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised with Gamcheon Village in Busan, South Korea. It is bright, happy, and quirky. Originally a village that house refugees of the Korean War, and mostly hidden away from the mainstream, the city went through a revitalization project to bring positivity, history, and lots of fun to the city, its inhabitants, and people from around the world. There are people living in the village so please be respectful of their privacy. The village closes its door to the public each day at 6PM.Firstly, if you want to spend half a day here you can, then I recommend doing the stamp hunt and getting all the stamps in the village map that can be purchased for 2000won at the visitors information center at the gates of the village. There are plenty of shops where you can buy souvenirs, areas to take photos, and learn about the history of Gamcheon Village. It really is a fun day, especially for families and couples. There's even solar phone recharge station built into the benches at the top of the terrace of the first place to get a stamp and postcard!There are also lots of snacking places, a Korean restaurant I would recommend for a quick snack like gimbap and tonkatsu, or ramen. Then across the way is a wonderful little store full of paper made goods. We loved this shop. In Korea, many little shops are also the owner's home so it is sweet and humble to see that when you walk in. Just down from there is the wonderful Little Prince statues to take photos with. There's also one in the tea shop just down from there. If you want any Le Petit Prince souvenirs, you better buy them near the statue, otherwise they are really tough to find. Only one place has very expensive bags and packs by Le Sporte at the Incheon Airport. (I know this is a totally random thing but it was a thing for us since our nieces love the fox in The Little Prince). =DYou can do short and long walks around the village ranging from 1 hour to half a day if you like. It really is filled with a lot of interesting things. Towards the end you see some of the old stores and some cultural exhibits and get a peak at what it used to be like and see the current stores that exist that represent the recent past. All in all it makes for a wonderful day. We actually started off at Songdo Beach (busan sky cruise) cable car ride before visiting Gamcheon Village. You can do both, completely, in one great day. "
To visit Busan is to visit Gamcheon,I feel like Gamcheon is a place you have to visit if you are visiting Busan. Otherwise it would seem like you didn’t visit Busan at all. The view of the houses resembles Santorini. Cute small shops and cafe along the way.
Nice to walk around. Lovely view.,Gamcheon is lovely place to walk around. The cherry blossom was awesome. Buying a map at the tourist center will help to find some hidden spots.
"It was fun, which is worth a good rating","Beyond that. It's colorful, kind of a hippy (looking, don't know the people who live here) looking community. Colorful homes running up a slope. Yes, there are other places with pastel homes. Perhaps I liked it because this wasn't where I expected it. Shopping, restaurants, I missed the good ones. It is a big place with lots of cross streets to get lost in. Many people in costume, it appeared you could rent them. No one to explain that to me. Colorful hillside homes are small, most only a couple rooms, but there's a zoning requirement that your neighbor's view can't be blocked. Which is nice, and I suppose favors small homes up a hillside.Only spent an hour or two here, am told you could spend a day."
Visited in March 2018,"There is a coffee place that has a bird's eye view of the whole place. Can be abit crowded, so perhaps you can reach about 3pm, where there is lesser crowd. Shops close pretty early at 6pm"
Get lost in gamcheon,"This place is really quite cool. If you’re into art then you will definitely enjoy it. Essentially it’s just an area with very colourful houses, small alley ways to get lost in, some abstract art galleries and of course some shops (food, clothing and souvenirs). Some areas (especially photo ops) are very touristy & popular and long queues can form. "
nice but somehow nothing special.,"They make a big thing about this village... of course there are nice colours, nice shops, nice coffeeshops... and the rest..?? I think this is not really a must."
Sweet quaint town,The cutest place in Busan. A MUST visit for any first time traveller to BUSAN. Bring good walking shoes and look out for the Little Prince. 
So very beautiful and so very interesting!,"It wasn't on our list initially but it was a good last minute decision to visit the place. Rows of small colourful houses lined haphazardly up the slopes, interspersed with cherry blossoms trees. Shops also sold interesting souvenvirs, many of them are handmade locally and you will not be able to get it elsewhere. The place also well-planned with good spots identifed for that perfect instagram picture. One tip: please get the local map at the tourist office at the start of the village, it gives a good overview of what to visit."
A really cool cool place!!!,"Got to say, Gamcheon Culture Village made my Busan stay perfect! In this place, there is a cool game. Where you buy the map to the village in the tourist information center in the village, and it has 3 routes you can go through, and collect stamps. These stamps can be converted into a gift and postcards. Even if not converted into nothing. Its a cool and fun concept. The village itself is super cool and really beautiful. In my eyes its a must visit when in Busan."
Must see place in busan ,"We enjoyed our 3 hour walk in Gamcheon following the map purchased from the info Centre at the main entrance. The walk which allowed us to detour and take tons of photos of this quaint and cosy village was super worth it. We had a lot of friendly ahjumas and ajushis helping us with directions when we were abit lost. There are several quirky art displays along the way which was quite interesting. Be warned the queue for photos with the little prince is long and some groups of gals in rented hanboks took very long, much to annoyance of rest of us. "
Beautiful artwork incorporated into a community!,Our trip to Gamcheon Culture village was a workout for us as we did not take a taxi or bus to the location! I suggest taking some sort of transportation otherwise you will walk up the steep streets to get there. Once we got there artwork was everywhere. If you enjoy art this is the place to see. I am glad I read the reviews of this place to get a sense of what not to miss. We stood in a short line to get our picture taken with the lady and the dog on the ledge. There are a few places to grab a snack and restrooms in a couple of places along the way. 
Most colorful place!!!,"They call this the santorini of korea. It’s an actual village and people do live here. What’s nice about it is that the moment you enter the village, food stalls are everywhere and this is where you can buy souvenirs. Go up small stairways as it will lead you to spectacular views of the village. Try out food stalls as you go up the village. Tou can take the taxi or get the tour cuz buses wont take you to the entrance of the village. This is a must-see!!"
Fun to see,"Very pretty. The space is designed with tourists in mind.... there’s tons of places for a photo shoot. There’s cute shops, coffee, and street food along the way. Good to swing by, but you don’t need more than 2 hours here probably. "
Colourful place ,"Colourful place , many small house with different colour there . Nice hilly view there , great place for picture taking . "
"Colorful, artsy and a bit of hike",I was pleasantly surprised by this little village. The vibrantly colored houses make a great backdrop for pictures. Small shops and cafes dot the village. It is easy to spend half a day here relaxing and taking in the slower pace. There are lots of marked photo zones for those looking for the perfect pictures for social media. You see many couples and teenagers spending time here. Murals are also pretty prevalent here giving it and artsy vibe. I wouldn't bring the elderly or young kids in strollers here if you want to truly explore it because it is built on hills and the hike can be quite taxing. 
Lovely colourful houses and nothing else ,"It’s indeed beautiful. Lots of colourful small houses where people living inside. But nothing else (I mean nothing) don’t keep your expectations big, it will take long time to arrive after 1-2 metro subway change and a good walk. Don’t bother walking up to hill as nothing there. Nice place to take few photos though "
Gamcheon Culture Village - Santorini of Busan,This culture village was awesome. Full color and the area was hilly and uphill. Great location to take picture. So many interesting view. Easy transportation from downtown.
Good place for photo taking,"I visited this spot two times, one for the night view, the other in the morning. I like day time visit more because you can see those colourful houses. There are lots of fun & interesting places for photo taking. Souvenir shops & snacks shops are available for your selection. The fried fish cakes (with different flavour) are yummy but a bit expensive.We took Bus # 17 at Jungangdong Stop (passed through Nampodong) & showed the Korean name of the village to the bus driver who advised us to get off at somewhere to change a mini van # 2 / 2-2 up to the destination (the village name is shown on the mini van, it's not difficult). On return, we (2 persons) took a taxi to Nampodong at around 5,000 won+ (about HK$40), only a bit higher than the total fare of the bus + mini van."
Charming and colourful village.,Such an unusual place and really enjoyed our walk around it. The town is wonderful and the views down to the sea are lovely. 
Redeem your postcard by latest 6PM,"From Busan subway station, we took the Exit 6 of Toseong subway station. We then walked straight, turned right and kept walking until we passed by a hospital and we took a local bus nearby. You can take bus no.2 or 2-2 and get down at Gamcheon Elementary School. The bus ride was KRW1100. We purchased the village map for KRW2000 and followed the route to collect 12 stamps. Based on my reading, the number of stamps has been increased from 9 to 12 now, with changes of location. I thought it would be good so that all parts of the village can be explored and not to be neglected. Most of the time, we followed the painted fishes that swim through the village as they brought us to the major popular sites, including stamp-collecting spots. We took 3 hours to complete the task, of course we got lost few times and we took some time-off to rest and to find our way out. Although it was a leg-tiring journey, we had fun and enjoyed our time in this colorful village. At the end of this stamp-hunting, we were rewarded with 3 postcards of the Gamcheon Culture Village. One can go back to Busan via the same route but should take the bus at the opposite side of the road. We lost our way and we came across with a local bus NO.17 if not mistaken, and we got down at the Nampo-dong area, which was our destination. Although this took us longer time, yet we were happy as the bus took us to some other area that we did not initially plan to."
Cultural experience,"Expect to ride a neighborhood bus to get there and do lots of walking (with inclines). Worth the visit. You can get a map of the village for 2,000won at the Information Center "
Very nice and fun walk,The village is hilly. There are maps to buy for 2000 won.They give you 3 routes based on time 1-1/2 and 2 hours .It's very colorful and worth the visit .
Pictures authentic neighborhood ,Pictures authentic neighborhoodNarrow small alleys colorful houses artists workshops street food and restaurants beautiful views of the sea Highly recommend 
Highlight of the Trip,"This place was the best part of my trip to Busan, nice village with lots of places and corners to explore. Remember to purchase the stamp map at the information counter for 2000 KRW and collect the various stamps located throughout the village. They even give out postcards at designated stamp locations."
For those who wander,"Gamcheon Culture Village was one of the more interesting places that we visited in Busan. I suggest that you pick up a Stamp Map (2000 won) at the Information Center.There are 3 recommended tour courses (marked out in different colours on the map) of different durations- 40 minutes, 1h 20 minutes and 2 hours. The map ups the fun factor by letting you collect stamps (those with ink, not postage stamps) at several locations. However, to collect the complete set of stamps, this requires you to take the Stamp Course which is around 2 hours. I am sure that children will enjoy walking the route even if it's just for collecting the stamps! Take your time here to wander around the nooks and crannies. Lots of interesting art works screaming with vibrant colours. There were also plenty of cafes and food shops for you to rest your tired legs and enjoy some refreshing drinks or fill your tummies. There were also souvenir shops with beautiful items. Our elderly parents were not that interested in walking the trails (everything looked the same to them and bearing in mind the slopes as well) and were more interested in sipping their aromatic coffees. Overall, if you are the kind of person who likes to wander around and are interested in colourful artworks, this is the place for you"
colorful houses,"A very peaceful village with many wall paintings and colourful houses. A lot of beautiful spots for taking wonderful pictures. Truly a very nice spot to relax and enjoy a cup of coffee at a local café, to enjoy the beautiful scene and the peaceful environment there. It is a must see for tourists visiting Busan."
Fun and lots of photo opportunities with artwork,"I visited this a bit later in the day around 6pm and it was almost dark. We noticed that most stores closed at 6pm so the road is not that busy and actually we have good chances to take pictures without having someone else head in it. If you have limited time, you can skip the strairs to sky part as it is not as cool as it sounds. It is just a small alley with stairs. I think 2 hours is enough to walk around but if you want to visit the stores, allowed 3 hours. We got there by taking subway and get out at Denti station. We took a cab and it was only 5 mins drive or 3400 won. "
Fun hike,it was super cute.....I went for photo ops. The map 2000 won and the first half that gets you the free stap is about 90 mins.
A nice historical area,"Great place to visit and explore. With the history behind the place, it's worth to learn and take nice photos.Grab a few souvenirs and eat the street food."
Gamcheon Culture Village,"Gamcheon Culture Village was up the hill road, was very very windy and cold on 20 Mar 2018. We nearly flew off by the wind, we doesn't expect the weather to be so cold and windy. It is very hard to have photo shooting or walk around, everyone was cold and hide under a shelter or behind a vehicle. However, the whole Gamcheon Culture Village was awesome scenery and view, so colourful on every building. So many stairs as well, we climb on the alley to take some photos and then went off to next stop for sight seeing, however due to the wind, we walk back to the bus stop at 6pm, every shops seems to closed up at this time. An experience, a great ones."
late afternoon walk,"Gancheon village, is just another picturesque place in Korea. Just photo spots and shops, nothing more.. Roads to Gamcheon is more interesting as it steep and narrow. If you have 3 hours to kill and nothing else to do, then you might consider it.. otherwise, jut skip it"
Much to explore,"Imagine spending the entire day walking in this village! We bought the stamping booklet for 2000won and followed the path to explore. Having pit stops in between to have a cup of coffee at the rooftop of the cafe and busk in the sun while feasting our eyes with the beautiful view. We were there during the winter season so the walk was pleasant and cooling. It was an easy and pleasant walk, but the elderly may find it challenging as it will be a long walk should you want to cover all places on the booklet."
Good way to spend a few hours,"This was on our list to visit while in Busan, its not really cultural and historical, but its nice to wander the alley ways to enjoy the view and vibe. There is a bit of street art, and photo opportunities during your wanderings. We purchased the map for 2000won and this was quite handy. Maybe as we were on a week day some of the local shops were closed, but a few more places selling more local Korean food would have been good. It does give you an idea on some of the areas people live in. To get there, subway exit number 6, walk up past the hospital block C and grab the bus Saha 1-1 Seogu 2 or 2-2 ad get off across from the Gamcheon Elementary School, which is by the tourist info centre. "
Love this Pastel village!,"Had a short 3D2N here in Busan and of all the places we went in Busan - I love this place the most! We spent half morning here enjoying the colorful pastel building and the cold breezy weather. If you're with children, I think it would be fun to get the area map for 2000won (or maybe 3000 won...couldn't really remember) and besides the map to all the shops and places, there's this small activity that you need to get the stamps when u were at certain spots/shop. Doing that will actually bring you around the village enjoying different views."
Interesting place with lots of photography shoot,Went during lantern festival so most of the places are closed including the tourist center but we still had a good time walking around the hilly area with lots of good photos and memories back home...
Fun!,"Intended to do a quick drop by for a picture on our way to Jeonju but ended staying the full morning.Plenty of photo op. It’s an Instagram paradise. My kids could not get enough. Zany, colorful, quirky buildings, narrow alleys and food options."
Excellent and so many pastel colors here and there!,"As a pastel-lover, I loveee spent a day here. The whole area formed by houses built in staircase-fashion on the foothills of coastal mountain, and no wonder if this village earn the nickname of “Machu Piccu of Busan.” Vibrant decorations also can be found alongside the murals and sculptures created by the residents. Here you can also find a souvenir stores, there are plenty of them, cafe, and food. 3 hours just seems not enough to explore the whole village!(*) All of the photos were taken by Anggara Mahendra during our trip."
Gamcheon culture village ,"This is a beautiful place. A place cannot MISS! Don't need to follow any tour, very easy to find this place, if not can go by taxi. 当你去釜山，甘川文化村不可错过，独特，值回票价！"
Colorful & friendly villager,"I never been to Machu Picchu but this place theme is “Dreaming of Busan Machu Picchu,”Personally i love this place, this former slum area in the past has become full of color and mural decoration. Better to visit when you're not in a hurry, lot's of alleys to explore, while enjoy the street foods.If you want a little adventure without missing any interesting spots, you can buy a map and collect the stamps that spread all over the village. Because this village are open to the tourist, try not trespassing their property."
"Not Machu Picchu, but a nice place to visit","This is emphatically nothing like Machu Picchu apart from being buildings on a hill, but it is a nice part of Busan for a touristy wander. They've done a good job with a lot of art installations, the buildings are pretty and there are places to eat and drink and buy souvenirs. It's selfie-heaven basically. I enjoyed it. I walked from Nampo in a little under an hour, although be aware this involves a fairly steep climb!"
Worth a visit,Quaint town with arty designs and shops. The view from above is gorgeous. And the longest line is the one that leads to The Little Prince and The Fox :) 
so good view,good picture if you like a take photo. i think good destination and good view. so nice place and have activity about this.
A pretty place for some nice photos,A touristy place this is. Although we saw young locals renting handbooks and school uniforms () to dress up in and take photos against the artistic backdrops. There were lots of stairs and uphill/downhill walkways so we didn't venture too far into the village.
amazing place,"its an amazing set with steep streets, twiating alleys and brightly colored houses, its called the Machu Picchu of South Korea. its one place in Busan you shoudnt miss but not recommended for old people because of the steep streets. be sure to take a lot of pictures as each angle offers a totally different and beautiful view of the place. its on subway Line 1 Goejong Station Exit 6 then take local bus Sakha 1 or Sakha 1-1 to Gamcheon Elementary School Bus Stop."
"Nice walking tour of approx 1,5 hour",This village offers a walking tour through the village and is great for art lovers as you can find many mini galeries. 
Good advanture,"You need nothing less than 6 hours if you want to visit the whole village and received all the ""stamps"" "
Interesting place,Nice & Interesting but some directional signs need to be improved. We got lost towards the end and didn’t get to complete the route. You will need at least 2 to 3 hours to enjoy every corner of the place.
Must visit place in Busan,"Be there early to catch the morning sun, be prepared to walk alot especial climbing steps if you want to take good pictures from different spots. Spending 2-3 hours will be sufficient to cover the whole area. Be sure not to make laugh noises as they are locals staying there. "
Colourful houses and picturesque,"One of the places to visit in Busan and easily accessible by public bus. The village is soaked in colorful paintings, murals and it gives out a young vibrant vibe. We bought a map from the tourist info booth which came with ""rewards stamp"" and started our discovery of the village, steep uphills, narrow lanes, peering through the small houses. We easily spent half a day as there are some small shops selling souvenirs, cafes, postal office etc."
Adorable and lively atmosphere ,"I loved this little village! Lovely place full of colourful houses , cafes and small shops, most offering souvenirs and handicrafts. Prepare some time for walking around, taking photos and queue up for the photos with the Little Prince and his Fox ."
Way better than you expect - love the art!!,"Totally loved it here. The village worked really hard to change itself from refugee ghetto to a vibrant art community and it's really paid off. I didn't expect too much as I went on a day when it was overcast/raining most of the day (in early January) and quite cold; and some outdoor places aren't great in that weather. But it was 100% worth it and I actually really liked it! I can also tell you now that the experience is even better than what you judge from in the photos - so much incredible art is hidden inside those narrow streets and the colours were really vivid, even on that very drab day!!"
Must see,This is a must see if you are in Busan. Many cute cafes and little shops to visit. Wandering through the small alleys is highly recommended. 
Nice to see,"In the main street, there are many shops. It is very touristy, pittoresque place, but don't expect a very epic view."
Inspiring ,"We loved this quirky colorful village. Buy one of the maps at the tourist information at the very beginning of the town to make sure you don’t miss out on the many cool artworks around and get the story behind them. It was a bit difficult for us to find a place to eat anything other than dessert, but we managed to find a wonderful café with the best view on the corner just after the picture point on the map."
Scenic,Great little shops. Love the stamp hunting activity. Had the best Busan Pancake in one of the shops!
Nice view and fun,The place is a complex itself with lots of shops to explore and street foods. Just wandering around small corners was a fun experience
Arty and scenic,"Loved the trip. Though it was quite a hike, it was all worth it. Arty and quaint shops on both sides which offer food, art and souvenirs. A definite must-see."
Nice view!,Nice place to take some photos! Not really recommend it if you come with elders because the tracks are quite tiring.
Colorful Village,"I was here in 2015. This village is really unique, colorful and they also have a lot of foods up there. "
Artistic!,It was beautiful and enjoyable. This place is full of art! Many colors! It is better to go by bus! It is located the top of hill!
Interesting attraction,"So many attracation, so many photo spot. So big area! You need to take more time in here if you like to photo. The resident are really welcome. The street food taste Great! Please Visit the Ahjumma restaurant, it taste nice and she is really welcome you. (Check the photo)If you Have time, go buy the stamp map and find the stamp post. It really nice. "
Very interesting place to visit.,Take a few hours to walk around this beautiful little village admiring the art work (some wacky) and the great views to the sea.
For the community spirit,"Gamcheon village is an attraction a little different from those I am used to visiting. For most attraction, people like the scenery or the building or even maybe the shopping. In Gamcheon village, you are actually visiting someone's home exterior. The buildings are colourful and stacked next to each other to present a picturesque scenery. This scenery can become ordinary after walking around for a while.However I enjoyed the community spirit that goes into the making of this picturesque scenery. This community spirit is felt through the way people present the village and the thought that goes into revitalising the village.Gamcheon used to be a shanty town where refugees flee to after the Korean War. In order to help the village recover from its bad image, a community project was developed and the town was revitalised.One of the building situated in the middle of the town had only very tiny and narrow steps. This building connects the lower road to the upper road which otherwise would require residence to walk a long way. Such thought and careful consideration for living spaces and connectivity among residences in the village is evident in many of the buildings.Gamcheon Village taught me that community space need not be big parks or huge picnic grounds, just a space for human interaction is sufficient.Visit this village for the spirit in which it was built."
My 2nd visit and never fails to impress,This is my 2nd trip to Busan Gamcheong Culture Village. Revisiting the place in colder climate in OCT definitely helps. The walking around the village with the chill wind really makes it more easy. I love the colourful structure and creation of the wall murals. Its always photo ready. 
Cute and quaint - a nice way to rehabilitate an area,"While this area has become very touristy, it is for the better. One can easily spend a couple of hours walking around, stopping in a friendly café... This is one of the highlights of Busan, with a view on the sea in the distance."
Interesting place to visit ,We went to Gamcheon culture village with a hangover but the scenery was still very beautiful also with all the street arts. Very picturesque sight to visit. 
Beautiful scenery ,"We went there by bus and there are flooded with the tourists. There have beautiful scenery and clean good foods and street foods. We went to a small restaurant, which is owned by an elderly couple. She's very friendly and looks about late 60s, all of the price of dishes are very economical, the local food she made is very delicious and the serving is so big, a must to try her foods when u travel there."
A collection of heritage houses,"We visited in the afternoon, using public transport. Arriving at Toseong subway station exit 6, around the corner turn left, just outside the hospital, there is a bus stop. Catch bus 2-2 and hop off when at Gamcheon Cultural entrance. Cannot be missed as there would be a lot of tourists or tourist buses near the Gamcheon cultural entrance. As we have the T-money card (purchased when we were in Seoul), the bus tickets are also payable by tapping the T-money card.There are multiple ways to walk through Gamcheon. At the entrance there was a board showing the different vistas and recommended walks. Street art, cafes, souvenir shops, convenience shops were dotted everywhere along the main walks."
A must for Busan,"A must visit for those visiting Busan. I think many has reviewed this place. Just to add on, try to come as early as possible so that you do not waste time queing to take pictures, especially the famous photo spots. Downside for us was the sun was rising and at certain points, it was right behind us, so photo taking was a bit of a challenge."
Pretty as a picture,"This is a nice place to while half a day away. Nice Instagram pictures. There was a little cafe (we forgot the name) with a blue exterior and a rooftop sitting area which provided indoor seating with excellent vantage points of the village. Great place to avoid the cold and they served excellent iced lemon tea.We wandered around the little alleys which had little artisan shops. There are many cabs that drop off tourists so getting a cab is easy if you do not want to wait for the bus to take you to the nearest metro. Cab fare was about US$5,"
Rich in art and culture,"Visited this place after watching ""Fight my way"" a korean drama. The best way to truly experience this culture village is to get the trail map (from the tourist huts) and collect all the stamps following the trail. Be prepared to walk and climb lots of narrow stairways so wear comfortable shoes. It is also important to not make alot of noise and disturbance as this is a real residential area."
Worth a visit. Beautiful at night,"We had a bit of trouble reaching the place. Just take note that there are buses going all the way up the village.We got there at around sunset/early evening and sadly some of the shops were closed already. However, the place provides a beautiful view of Busan at night."
It’s a must! ,Very picturesque place. Don’t forget to get a map from enterance. You can follow the directions on the map. If u find the stamps shown on the map you will get postcard as gift. Transportation is a bit tricky but previous visitors explained it clearly. Just read below
good for your instagram,"The place is full of spots for selfies and Instagram posts. I like how the community is building their tourism in a thoughtful way, such as giving space for tourists to explore but also leave some spaces for the residents themselves. Also, the community is bringing in some gamification into their tourism such as finding unique spots and collecting stamps. It was fun and brought in the thrill to explore. Plus, the residents were all nice and helpful. Would love to visit again and get the opportunity to talk with the locals and community :)"
Nice View and Great Scene,"I’ve been here in the morning and the weather is very cold. The location is quite unique, you can walk wherever, the road is like in the hill, walk climb and walk down. And also many food stall around. Enjoy "
Instagrammable place,The houses are really beautiful and they are many paintings on the walls. Great for those who love to take pictures
Nice place in Busan,"Get ready your Camera, because it's a beautiful to take a lot of photos.The are many cute stores in the street. If you would like to send postcards to your friend, you can buy some beautiful postcards there, and the store will help you to send it. This place is worth to go~"
Lovely Village,"You can go there from Seoul Station to Busan Station by KTX. Took Busan Subway line 1 to Toseong station and go out from exit 6. You can take Bus number 1-1 or 2 or 2-2. Don't worry you will lost, they always help us.This place is unique, you can find many artworks which is instagramable, but you have to prepare more energy to explore this village, because it's location is in uphill.If you confuse or a little bit lost, they also sell a map to guide us."
Forever packed ,"Took subway to toseung station and got out from exit 6, a little further up the slope you will find bus 1, or 1-1 to the gamcheon village. The bus station is right outside the cancer hospital.5-7 mins ride will get you to the entrance to the village. You either come in early or late as starting from 9am groups will flood in. Beautiful village with loads of good cafe along the way. You can purchase a map from the info centre at the entrance and collect stamps along the way, you will have postcards in return. Go hike up on the other side of the hill and you will have the best view in the house. "
Nice place to take a picture,"Nothing really special with this place other than some unique wall art painting and the color of houses that makes them called as Machu Picchu of Busan. You can get a lot of nice picture in this village. There are shops (souvenirs, traditional snacks, drinks, etc). But nothing really impressed me."
Winter trip ,We visit this a normal working day so not so many tourists which was great. I really love the view and all colourful houses 
Gamcheon Culture Village,"Nothing special! Anyway, it is enjoyable walking in these narrows streets for half a day because there are a lot of little tea rooms and shop where having a good time with friends."
Artsy place; Instagramable photos,"If you must visit a place in Busan in winter, go to the Gamcheon Culture Village. You will have many photo opportunities and have a wonderful time exploring the village too!"
Be ready to walk,Interesting walks around Gamcheon Village which is actually home to Busan people. The local does make a huge effort to beautify the area and this is one place that have washroom at nearly every corner.Definately worth a visit... I took a taxi from Songdo Beach which cost only KRW 8000.
A very colourful and unique cultural heritage,"It may take you a whole day or just a few hours well depending on how many photos you would like to take. You may find a lot of sign board and map along the path. Won't be able to get lost. Up hill path is expected, but there are many delicious snack and coffee shops along the way for you to take rest and refuel. Mountain top is a hot spot for sunset but get prepared for long queue. "
Artsy Village with Spectacular View,"Gamcheon Culture Village was one of the stops on our private tour with Busan Tourism Center. There are lots of food stalls, gift shops, and art along the walk. Be sure to go up to the observatory, there are many steps, but once up high, the view is spectacular."
Fun Colorful Place to Explore but Extremely Crowded on Weekends,"We came on a Sunday (Christmas Day) and actually took a taxi from the Taejongdae Park for 12,100 won. The ride was less than 30 minutes. In general, we found it really easy to find a cab at these popular sights.There is no entrance fee but we bought a map for 2,000 won. It is a very large area. We probably only walked half of it. You could explore for hours. We spent about 1.5 hours here. The place makes for nice photography."
Nice scenery but nothing much about culture,"Exit metro station Geojong station (Line 1) and go up to the street on exit 6. You can either take a cab or a local bus 1, or 1-1 and alight when it’s at Gamcheon Elementary school. The bus journey will take around 15 minutes. When the journey becomes steeper, you are close to Gamcheon Culture Village.The scenery is really nice, up in highland and plenty of sunlight, clean cold air. There are many cafes for consumer’s selection but the price is not considered cheap. You can easily spend 1-1.5 hours here but there was nothing too much about show casing their culture. Maybe because it’s all in korea, but there was no performances or any introductory landmarks. It’s worthy to come at least one, but it can be skipped if the trip is short and tight."
beautiful place,"beautiful place with a beautiful view from the mountains, tight romantic streets with small shops on it....."
Spend a good time walking around,"We reached Gamcheon with an empty stomach and hence immediately headed to the closest eatery (as you alight, you can see row of shops, we went to the corner shop) for lunch. Once energized, we started roaming around the village. You can get a tourist map and get stamped as you visit different location spot, some will offer you a free postcard. Expect to spend at least 2hours walking around. "
Beautiful,"This is how you develop a tourism village. Gamcheon used to be a poor village upon a hill. They make it colorful and cheerful. Locals run their business here. Many interesting stuff to see and buy.In many parts of village you can still see the poor area. Alas, it still a nice village to enjoy. And it inspires many villages across the world to do just the same."
Beautiful village,"Scenic view of local housing estates. Architecture and wall arts are really unique. Just be sure to reach early in the morning (avoid large crowd to cut waiting time for pictures). Don’t try to go to empty balconies or rooftops for pictures, may upset occupants especially if you can’t converse with them in Korean. Approximately 1.5-2hours of exploring."
Quaint village,Its such an unusual sight. The colours and the art that such a part of the village make the nooks and crannies of the place so interesting. Worth the time to wander around and explore.
Colourful village with nice views and quaint shops,"A must visit location at Busan. For some peculiar reason, the colourful sight was indeed fascinating to behold.Take the subway to Toseong Station and walk out to exit 6. Turn right at the intersection and walk towards a bus-stop that is just outside a hospital. Board bus no. 2 to bring you to the village entrance. You can't miss it.The spectacular view that I wanted to share was from this cafe called Avant Garde just at the exit of the village. Highly recommended to go this cafe at level 2, grab some hot coffee and go out to their large patio area and soak in the marvellous sight before starting to venture into the village.Within the village there are many small shops with snacks, souvenirs and mini museums. Overall it was a pleasant experience."
Colourful village,"Remember get a map book from information center which costs 2,000₩. The staff will show u the direction to get the stamps in sequences. Visit each points and walk around the village to enjoy the beautiful culture. PS: Please lower down your voice volume as this village is a living place of local. "
It was worth visiting there.,"It is a old style village where you can see mural things on walls and it was quite interesting. If you have a chance to visit Busan, I would recommend you to visit there. "
Gamcheon Culture Village ,"This village is really picturesque. If you love arts & culture, this is a must visit place in Busan. You can find several street food, cafes, art shops, should you wish to rest or buy souvenirs. "
Interesting,I love the place!! Very artistic. So many restaurants and coffee shops. So relaxing to walk around the village
"pretty cool, but very trousity","This place is cool-very ""Instagram worthy,"" but pretty crowded. People are walking around with selfie sticks and tripods trying to get their Instagram and couples shots. It becomes pretty annoying after a while. It's fun to walk around for a bit, but I wouldn't devote too much time here. We walked in at the main entrance and cruised around top. It didn't seem worth to go through the entire thing and check everything off the map. We did enjoy a little British themed spot that had beer and good fish and chips, with a cool view of the village. The chocolate shop is also worth stopping in. There are a few gift shops as well. "
Unique but very touristy,"This was a small mountainside slum which became a famous tourist site after getting an arty makeover by the students. The houses and its roof have been painted in different colors. It is very touristy. Best time is to go there in the morning and roam around through various allies. Can spend no more than one hour taking some photographs.Metro Station: Toseongdong (Line 1) Exit 8. After exit turn right and walk for 2 minutes. There is a hospital on the right side and a Bus Stop in front of the hospital gate. Take Minibus No. 2, 2.2 or 1.1 for 10 minutes up the steep hill to the village. Get down at the village gate."
"Nice view, but nothing else to do","Went there because of the high ratings, but aside from the view (houses with blue roofs) nothing much to do. The viewpoint area was also hard to find. We couldn’t find any directions so we had to walk through the narrow streets and figure it ourselves as google maps doesn’t work well here. "
Explore,"Is my first time to Busan. I follow the day tour, save me alot of time. You can try 'ktourstory"" package. The tour only has 5 persons, not that crowded. Easy to move on. With English Speaking. The Gamcheaon village is located up the hill, make sure you prepare with a pair of sneaker. Get prepare to walk..burn calories..n fat."
Colorful house,"There many nice art work on the wall, can explore around for few hours if have the time ... there are café there to relax when tired of walking around.. anyway worth a visit!"
Fun afternoon,It is a nice area for walking around looking at colorful paintings on the buildings. Lots of cafes around as well.
Nice place,"We love this place so much.Its own culture,design,landscapes,etc.There are alot of shops along the streets.We will back this place again with my family.You must visit this place when you visit Korea."
Must Go,A definitely must go place in Busan. The scenery was beautiful and have many shop along the village street. But many slope and tiring to bring small kids below 4yo. 
Never regret place to visit ,A very nice area where you could take dozens of insta/postcard pics. Not much tourist possible due to the begin of winter. Overall a never regret place to visit 
Quaint Village Worth A Visit,Very picturesque village that is filled with Instagram worthy sites. Get there early before it gets dark. Don’t forget to try out the coffee served in many cafes. It’s especially nice in a very cold day.
Read up about the site before going to appreciate it better.,"It was a fantastic spot, if you were expecting a Santorini of course you will not be satisfied. The beauty of the adventure is the different taste of Korean culture presented in each of the houses / establishment. Do not rush, just take everything in at a leisurely pace, look at an appreciative perspective and you will see its beauty - it will show in your pictures!"
Great Culture Village,"Came here as a tourist with my family. Since we are used to visiting Seoul, we didn't know what to do while visiting Busan. We decided to go to Gamcheon Culture Village and was pleasantly surprised.Since it was the end of October, there weren't too many tourists around. The famous colored buildings were beautiful and the views, after walking higher and higher up the hills, were magnificent. What a cute little village. I deeply regret not buying a Starbucks mug of Busan :(. Would recommend a visit, but try to avoid high tourist season, especially during the summer, because I can imagine how busy it can be and how hot it could be."
Interesting!,I highly recommend to you go there like trip. I mean; if you don't have any problem with your health you can climb there and see lots of local things. The most awesome things was The Little Prince was there!!
Picturesque Village!,"This hilly village is located close to the coast, with colourful buildings, mimicking that impression of Italian coastal cities, or Brazilian favelas without the bad reputation.Be prepared to spend at least half a day if you want to explore the area as it is pretty big with plenty to see/check out. Make sure to wear comfortable shoes and bring cameras with you!"
I'm breathing hard,I got the map and went around searching for all the sites. I was by myself and felt complete safe. I had a great time seeing the art and enjoying the little shops. 
Interesting concept but really not much to see.,"The place was fairly interesting. It was more interesting to see tourists queuing up just to take pictures of a back-facing little prince statue and a fox. I'm not too sure if its due to lack of maintenance, the colors of the walls and roofs weren't as colorful as those pictures you see on the internet. There's a quite a number of steps, slopes and tight alleys you need to navigate just to look at the different murals, or little art gallery inside small houses, or souvenir shops. To me, the culture village is the kind of tourist spot that you just need to visit once. Thats it."
Very interesting destination,"We had a little trouble getting here by public transportation, but because of very helpful locals, we made it using the Metro (easy) and then finding the right bus (not as easy). (Hint: We bought a T-Card on our very first day in South Korea, which offers minor discounts per ride, but is easily reloadable at convenience stores and at the Metro. It makes taking the Metro and all city buses a breeze....and we used the same T-card throughout our 3 weeks in S Korea.) The Culture Village is a great example of how, with some paint and TLC, the locals can make an area appealing and fun. It's a little touristy, but we didn't mind at all because of how colorful and upbeat it was."
Very pretty village!,Walk around Gamcheon Culture Village and be entertained by the quaint little shops and restaurants as well as murals on the walls. Definitely a place to visit if in Busan. 
"Unusual, unique, colorful & picturesque village.....a must see! ","This colorful, beautiful & very picturesque village is built along the slopes of the mountain. From afar, the whole place looks like a simple huge colorful painting. But you soon realise how amazing this quaint architecture is. To reach each level, one need to climb up mazes of small unending alleys. Houses are built amidst the slopes & alleys.There are lots of quaint & beautiful cafes & shops along the way. And art is being portrayed generously in many areas including the steps.But be prepared for a tiring & strenuous upslope climb on steep & sometimes uneven slopes & walkways. It is tough to get right to the top.We took a cab there up to the top entrance point. Don't encourage you to walk up there.On descent at the bottom, there is a bus-stop where you can take bus to the city.Despite the tough climb, its worth visiting this unique village."
The Santorini of Busan,"Refreshing art village full of discover, galleries and small shops. Really something I did not expect in Busan. Worth 1/2 day excursion."
Very picturesque with lots of photo opportunities! ,"Definitely worth a visit - lots of photo opportunities, and time to see those scenes that you’ve seen in the Korean dramas! "
The journey towards Gamcheon is a physical drainage,"Probably if you follow a tour to get some pictures of this place, may be ok but personally, there's not much to be fascinated about. I thought it would look like a replica version of Positano, or as they claim themselves is like Machu Picchu, is absolute bogus. Sorry to burst your bubble but, the colour on the buildings have faded quite a fair bit. So basically if you see recent pictures of it, it was probably edited. The old photos of course looks fantastic but how long ago were those photos? Since I was on a solo trip, is an uphill journey most of the way. If you decided to walk inside the neighbourhood, is like a maze so, use Google maps. I won't go back there but a 1 time experience was enough for me to visit Gamcheon."
Not as vibrant as expected but still worth a visit,"First time here even though not my first visit to Busan. The starting of the village walk is rather ok but it gets too quiet till the end of the walk and is a little tiring. Overall, still can visit if you would like to. "
Iconic attraction ,"Instead of getting the map and get 3 post cards upon completion, I bought post cards as they were.. 500won! Top up another 500won for the stamp and you can choose immediate sending or have them sent ONE YEAR LATER (which is what I did)... Try the hotteok!! "
"quaint little village, colorful and picturesque","The ride up to the village is beautiful , , once you get to the village, it has very beautiful views and the contrast of the colorful houses is great. there are a lot of little gift shops, restaurants, ice cream shops. is a nice place to walk and enjoy the vistas"
Very neat village ,I visited this village with some friends. It has a lot of culture within the paintings and murals on the walls of the building. Lots of shops with reasonably priced souvenirs also. I enjoyed my time and got a little workout in too. All in all it was worth the journey. 
This was a hidden gem,I was marveled as I walked through the quaint streets winding up the mountain to the top. Lots of trinkets and lookout sites.
Small special valley ,"Interesting to visit! It is kind of Greek feeling but people around you speak Korean or Chinese....A lot of spot for photo, but also a lot of visitors."
Spent a full day at the Gamcheon Culture Village,"Had a fun time at the Gamcheon Culture Village. I was there since morning, following the route map to visit each spot. Nice place for photo-taking day and night. Take a rest at the cafe with great view of the village."
Nice place ,Gamcheon village is a really nice place to wander. The view from the top is amazing and all the small colorful house are so nice and beautiful.
Great place to visit,"Be prepared to walk long distances, and lots of steps to go uphill. Very creative in decorating their houses. Lots of food on offer."
Excellent place to wander for a few hours,"This is a very quirky area of Busan that is well worth a visit. It's easy to get there by minibus from the closest metro station. There are lots of interesting shops, cafes and restaurants and loads of local tourists taking pictures. The artistic features are really imaginative and interesting and it's very enjoyable seeing what you can discover. Allow at least a couple of hours as there's plenty to see and some great views."
Beautiful ,"Take a camera and take your time. Wander, meander and take it all in. Stop for a drink at one of the little shops, sit and stare and take in the beauty that initially was a shanty town."
loved the area but didnt have enough time!,"This was the last stop on our cruise excursion. Such a colourful area. lots of street food to try, lots of shops cafes and interesting streets. A photographers paradise. We had only a short time here so only limited exploring sadly!Food choices were amazing and what we had was excellent.Some very steep paths and steps."
Fun walking adventure,We purchased a map at the information center and walked downhill the entire time. We stopped for photos and ate lunch along the way. We found some gifts to buy for family as well. Our children were carried on some of the uneven stairs. We would recommend this place but do not bring a stroller. We did not bring a stroller and did fine without it. I saw others with strollers that were struggling with them. 
The Most Colorful and Artsy Neighborhood in Busan,"Gamcheon Village is a vibrant community filled with mismatched houses of various colors making the kid in us jump in delight while we unveil its secrets one step at a time.But first, you need to know how to get there, right? From Busan Station take the Line 1 and exit at Toseong Station, Exit 6. Go straight ahead and turn right at the corner. A few meters ahead, on your right side, you will find a bus stop which is right in front of an hospital (Busan National University Hospital). Take the local mini Bus 2 or 2-2 and get prepared for a bumpy fast ride up the hill. Don't forget to take your T-Money card with you to pay for the bus fare. In case of doubt, ask the driver or one of the passengers where do you need to exit for Gamcheon and they will help you out. To return you just have to take the same bus or simply take a taxi. We took a taxi from Gamcheon to Jagalchi Market and the total was around W4000 to W5000. I've posted a photo taken from Gamcheon Village Guide Map in which explain how to get there by subway, bus, car and taxi.As soon as you get to Gamcheon Village, go to the Tourist Information on your right side and get the Gamcheon Culture Village Guide Map for a small fee (around W2000) in which there is a scavenger hunt for stamps that are spread out around the village. You just have to visit the designated locations and stamp your map there and then move to the next location. There are 12 stamps in total and after you get them all Just go to the Tourist Information and they will give a reward. From all the stamps only the one from House with Puppies was missing so we used the ink and stamped our fingers instead. We then informed the lady at the Tourist Information about it.The map itself along with its stamp scavenger hunt is a great way to ensure that you visit the whole village without getting lost and if you do get lost (like we did) just ask a local for directions and they will gladly help you find your way in. Its amazing how well they know that place and swiftly navigate through it in a blink of an eye.You will find lots of memorable opportunities to take photos. Everyone's favourite seems to be the Little Prince and the Desert Fox. The queueing line under the scorching sun was super long and wasn't moving fast enough so we decided to skip it.Along the way you will find lots of interesting coffee shops and tea houses, some restaurants, art galleries and gift shops, just to name a few but the deeper you go into the village the fewer there will be so stock up with water and some snacks just in case. Gamcheon Village is open from 9am to 5pm and because it is a residential area (just like Bukchon Hanok Village) you will find signs along the way informing you to not take a certain path (so that you don't find yourself invading someone's house) or to not speak loudly. Also pay attention to cars and motorcycles. Even though they circulate slowly is always better to be aware of it.My advice to you is to take light and comfortable clothing and shoes. You will be walking a lot up and down its narrow streets and alleys and uneven stairs. Take water with you and do visit the washroom when you find one (especially if you are with children) because you might not be able to find another one so soon.If you have kids and are not sure if they will like it. Take the map (one for each if you can) and explain what they will be doing. Let them explore and look for the stamps (if you think they will have fun taking photos get them a disposable/ single use camera for the day). My kid was all thrilled exploring although when we reached the Little Prince and the Desert Fox statue she was tired but from there on I explained it would be always going down the hill until the exit so she was all ecstatic (for not having to go up the road) and we kept moving forward. It was well worth it. At the exit we went to collect our reward from the stamps."
Nice view for check-in on Facebook,"Go to Goejeong station and walk to a nearby bus stop on Saha road then took the bus no.1 or 1-1 to Gamcheon culture village. Carefully, read the name of the bus stop because the bus has no automatic announcement. On the way back, just go to the opposite bus station."
Lots of fun walking,"Visiting Gamcheon Culture Village becomes a must-do when you come to Bushan. We took a cab from our hotel near Haeundae Beach and it was only 5000W. That saved us a lot of time climbing the steep road.We were there around 10:30am and there were a lot of people already. We went to the information center to buy a site map (2000W). The map lays out the details of the village and highlights some of the interesting points. At the back of the map, there are spaces for stamps. You have to walk all over the village, hills, galleries and lanes to find the stamps in order to fill in all the stamp space. Some of the stamps are difficult to find but it is really part of the fun. And you also get a few free gifts too.The cultural village is kept nice and clean. It is actually a residential area for the local people. Most of the houses are small with colorful and fun paintings. They look like the Jelly Bean Row House in St John's, NFL, but much bigger in scale. Some houses are quite old and well preserved for the heritage purpose. There are signs here and there to remind people not to make a lot of noise as ""real"" people do live there. There are lots of cafes, restaurants, tea houses, bakeries, art galleries, gift shops, souvenir stores and street vendors near the information center. Price is pretty much the same as that in Seoul. When you explore further away into the valley, there are just a few places that you can find food and drink. Bear this in mind and bring food and water if necessary.You have to prepare to walk a lot going uphills, downhills, climbing staircases and steep roads. Streets and lanes are very narrow and cars use some of those streets too. You need comfortable footwear for all those walking. .....And the height of the steps of most staircases is not even. Despite all those ""negativities"", you will have spectacular views of Bushan at many parts of the Village. Bring your smart phones, camera and selfie stick. There are numerous breath-taking Instagram opportunities.There are quiet a few public washrooms across the Village. But since you have to walk from one point to the other, visit one when you see it. You don't know how long it takes to hit another one. We spent 5 hours at the Village and we got all the stamps stamped at the back of our map. It was an accomplishment."
a MUST in Busan,"Definitely my favorite place in Busan. It reminded me a lot of Valparaiso in Chile. It’s so colorful! Perfect for taking pictures, walk in the small streets, drink a coffee or smoothie and just enjoy the architecture. If someone ask me I would say that you can not miss this place. I’d recommend to spend a day there just walking relax taking photos. "
Worth a trip,A funky and quaint little colourful village.Go early in the morning before the crowd descends.Allow plenty of time to explore.Definitely recommend taking a taxi from the train station to get to the village which is about 5000 won - steep climb all the way up!
Nice but touristy ,"I've visited three art/mural villages like this in Korea and this is worse than the ones in Seoul and Jeonju. Of course, there's a history behind this village, so it's nice to visit. Direction: get off at Toseong Station (line 1) exit 6, then walk straight, turn right before the traffic light, walk up the hill and catch a bus 1, 1-1 or 2-2 in front of the cancer centre."
Art village,"The only place i visit in south korea that doesnt look like south korea more like latin america i would recommand anyone visiting Busan to go there amazing view lots of pictures to be made lots of cafes , restaurants and gift shops busy with tourists "
Instagram Heaven!,"Lots of cool places to take photos and explore. I had the taxi drop me off at the top of the hill then walked down. I walked around for about 2 hours, but you could definitely spend more time here if you're willing to explore everything and do the stamp rally. Be prepared to wait a little for the more popular photo spots (especially the Little Prince statue). Lots of cool little cafe's where you can take a break too. Highly recommend!"
We loved it,"Great place, we spent there more than 3 hours. Go to the small allies, sit in a nice coffee shop, taste street food, great!"
Very Nice,It is really worthy to visit this attraction. You will reallt experience traditional Korea. Highly recommended
"Of steep slopes, colourful buildings and crowds","One of the touristy places to visit in Busan. Took a cab from Haeundae to Gamcheon. Cost was about USD18. The cab stops right at the bus stop at the entrance of Gamcheon Village.One could get a map of the place from the Information Centre right after the entrance for 2000 won. It comes with 2 complimentary postcards. Explored the place and the advice is not to buy snacks from the first stall that you see as inside there are other shops available.Outside the first toilet (after the Info Centre) has an elderly grandma selling sugar biscuit for 1000 won..Think this is a childhood snack of Koreans. If you could draw on the sugar without breaking the biscuit, you'll get another biscuit (bbob-gi) for free.There are also shops with rooftop and you'll get good view of the place from higher grounds. Be careful when climbing up the stairs to the rooftop as usually these are pretty narrow. Not suitable for elderly folks. We enjoyed pumpkin porridge and lemonade drinks at such a shop. Had lunch at The Plate for some decent western-fare.Many interesting walls and buildings for photo opportunities, we-fie and selfie.The one with Little Prince statue has a long queue of at least half hour.We spent about 3 hours at this place with 1.5 hours walking, half hour queueing and the rest of the time having snack/food.Most tourist would leave the place around 5pm, so try to be earlier otherwise it'd be a challenge to fight for a cab."
Unique historical achitecture,One can use the tour bus from the Busan station to go to this pace. Food is easily avaible here too.
"Over-rated, not sure why we are here","The view is quite nice but overall the feeling is they have tried to do a lot with not much. There really are some great galleries here and it is great to see quirky street art everywhere. But by trying to make it into a big tourist attraction, they have ended up with a lot of the ubiquitous Korea tourist stuff (overpriced slushies in funny shaped cups, deep-fried cheese, giant tall soft-serve ice cream, expensive spheres of water jelly with flavoured toppings, souvenir papier-mache 'lucky shoes') that have displaced the little galleries and shops that were the original reason why we might want to go there."
Cool place,"Great quirky place. Could be anywhere in Europe rather than Asia. Colourful buildings, lots of art and knicknacks. Beautiful views. A must see."
A great way to spend a few hours immersed in art,"We had a great morning walking around the village. There were beautiful pieces of art around every corner. You can spend hours getting lost in there, admiring the works of multiple artists. Bring comfy shoes, and dress light, depending on when you go, it can get quite hot, and the streets go up and down a lot. You can buy a map at the entrance, and collect stamps, though we didn't find it really helpful, or that much fun. But it's 2000 won, so not a big loss. It helps you learn more about the art. We went on a weekday, and it was not that busy, so quite enjoyable to stroll around."
Very cool but very touristy,"We spent about to hours wandering from the top of Gamcheon to the bottom of the hill, and we could easily have spent another two poking our noses into shops, cafes and looking for more street art. This historically poor neighborhood chose to improve its appearance with paint, but I wonder if anyone would have anticipated the influx of tourists. We thoroughly enjoyed our time, our coffee, bingsu (Korean shaved ice dessert), and some unique souvenirs. It's worth a visit. I suggest a bus or taxi to the top of the hill."
Gamcheon Cultural Village: The Jewel of Busan,"Gamcheon Culture Village (Hangul: 감천문화마을; Hanja: 甘川文化-) is a town of Gamcheon-dong, Saha District, Busan, South Korea. The area is known for its steep streets, twisting alleys, and brightly painted houses, which have been restored and enhanced in recent years to attract tourism. You can easily walk around the neighbourhood in 1/2day, or catch a bus and get on and off where you want to if you don't fancy the walk --- that would be a shame because there is lots to discover on the way, including art galleries, interactive sites, a restaurant and other sights."
Nice art/craft stores. Too hot during summer.,"Throughout the village on the hill, there were many neat art and craft stores to satisfy tourists appetite for souvenirs, and public arts and sculptures for photo op opportunities. There were also some activities for kids - such as writing postcards and collecting stamps. (The postcards were nice but some of the stamp stations were not well maintained.) However, it was too hot to visit during summer time... we were soaking wet by sweat by the end of our 2 hr visit.You can take the taxi straight to the entrance of the village or express bus by the foothill right outside the subway exit."
"Beautiful view, tragic traffic","The view of the village is to DIE for. Worth all the effort to reach the place. Once you got inside and explore the area, there are some small gems here and there, nice to spend a day and just explore. Not for those who are in a hurry."
So much fun!,"The Gamcheon Culture Village was so much fun! Some of the stairs and streets are very narrow here, so it’s definitely not something you see every day. There’s artwork throughout the village, with special exhibitions by Korean artists inside some of the houses. Be sure to be on the lookout for those as some of them could be a bit hidden. Once you get high enough into the mountain, you’ll get a really clear view of the colourful houses and the ocean. The scenery was so beautiful and relaxing, I really wish I could have stayed longer just to watch the day go by. There are plenty of cafes and food here too; it’s really the perfect mix of everything.If you're taking public transportation, you can get here by taking Line 1 of the subway to Toseong Station. After that, you’ll need to take a bus. Follow the signs in the subway station for Gamcheon Culture Village and take the bus to its last stop."
It is a special place worth visiting,"It is a very special place. The narrow streets and great views make it a nice place to visit. Be sure you have time on your hands because a proper visit will need some exploring. We walked to the village and it was a good choice but for those who can't do it, can take the no.1 bus and it will leave you right at the entrance to the village."
Colourful painted buildings that brightens up your mood when you see them :),"It's like a mini fairy land village, really love the splendid colourful painted buildings, it really brightens up your spirits when you reach the village. Love the fishcake over there, it's so delicious. There are also cafes to slowly sip your drinks and enjoy the nice view. The Little Prince model is a cannot miss, people usually line up to take a photo with it. "
Unexpected!,"Such an interesting place with a wide diversity of art on display, well worth spending a couple of hours wondering around. It is easy to get to and from with public transport."
"Beautiful, peaceful and quiet in the AM",We purposely went in the early morning to avoid the possible crowds queuing for to take picture with the little prince and fox. The plan succeeded with no crowd. Guess one of the little price site is currently under Reno. Only left one more. Happy locating it with a little bit of walking required. 
North Korean settlers village,Be prepared to do a lot of walking. You find small houses occupied by north Koreans who migrated to Busan during the Korean war.
"Gamcheong Culture village, Busan","There are colourful small houses built along the hillside. We had a good stroll along the footpath and there are plenty of souvrnir shops and coffee shops for visitors. Take the tour bus ( W1100) across the road of exit 3, metro station 110. There are some interesting photo spots and be prepared to queue up for the Little Prince spot."
Iconic view of Busan,"Before you enter the village, walk a little further downhill to ""Coffee IT cafe"" where they have an open rooftop with a perfect view."
Historical place with street art,"This is the reason I love Busan so much. If you love culture-related and history-related place, you should visit here. And it's better to visit before 9:30am because it will be getting crowded from 10am, also you will enjoy the sunrise here, seeing those houses get their color. Btw, people live there, so don't take photos or get into their private place. "
Mini Santorini - A must visit place,"Gamcheon cultural village - also called as Mini Santorini is a beautiful place and a must visit place.How to reach there - Go to Toeseong station, line 1 and then take the bus 1-1, 2-2 to reach Gamcheon culture village.Once here, head to tourist information centre and buy a guide book for 2000 won. It entitles you for 3 postcards. That you can send to anyone to reach either in 3 weeks or after 1 year at a nominal price of 500 won each. Also they have wonderfully covered the whole place in the book and made a path for the travellers. A lot many good observation points where you can take lot many photos.A lot of walking needed. So be prepared for that.A must visit place."
Really nice place,Lovely place to walk around. You probably need 2 or 3 hours here. Nice houses and art work. Arrive early to avoid the crowds.
Not quite interesting for familes,"Most people I saw at the Village were couples, and they just took LOTS of pictures and pictures. Nothing quite interesting."
Good view,"Went to check it out, lots of tourist traps with souvenirs, food, etc. Houses were intriguing, very colorful and lots of art. Got a good view of Busan."
Cool place,"Interesting place when the weather is good (but there you can find a lot of cafes). We took a lot of funny photos there, I recommend this place for few hours. Metro Toseong (exit 6) - than 3 minutes by foot on the right to bus stop 1-1, 2, 2-2 about 15 minutes by bus and you are on the place. Enjoy!"
Loved it,Highly recommend for first timer to Busan. Having great time here. Be prepared for snapping lotsa photos!
Great,"Thought it was not worth it initially, but found it to be charming. The place has really been spruced up by the government, so it has both history, art, touristy spots and restaurants. Plus there are locals actually staying there going about their lives."
Nice view and very attractive for sightseeing,The house in gamcheon cultural village are colourfull. They have several cafe with good price. The location is not far from the central city. Good for sightseeing. Must enter WOIN cafe to see the good view
"Quite arty and commercial, supposed to be trendy","Disappointing when compared to other similar places around the world (e.g. Valparaiso). Quite arty and commercial. Lot of cafes, gift shops, some restaurants. Trying to be trendy but not really succeeding in our opinion. Worth a visit only if you have spare time."
美麗的甘川洞文化村,酒足飯飽後來甘川洞文化村沾點韓風，也搞個黄七力。  It's mimic to European village with colorful buildings. The view is gorgeous. 
Just for the tourist...but that is what we are,"The place is so focused towards the tourist with cafe's, shops and gallerys every inch of the way. The whole area is very pretty though and there is lots of free street art to be seen and they are very friendly towards tourists, I got asked several times by people if I needed any assistance. The best part of the walk through the village is the first bit along the top. Where the bus drops you off (most of the people get off at this stop so you won't miss it), go back up the road for about 40 meters and take the road into the village. Not the one just where the bus drops you that goes steep down. Then just follow the road round. Maps can be purchased (2000), but there are maps dotted around the village. The walk is well formed, but wear sensible shoes as if you decide to head in between the main roads, the steps can be small, steep and narrow."
"Art in life, life in art","Jagalchi Station Exit 3, walked down the road, turned right and looked for bus stop for bus 1-1, 2 or 2-2. 15min ride on the bus and we reached Gamcheon cultural village entrance. Whimsical, amusing, insightful, this Macchu Picchu or Santorini of the East hit us in all directions. A hodgepodge of multicoloured and odd shaped houses and buildings, everything seemed to blend into a perfect collage. A few visitors rented hanboks, especially the ladies, and walked around, taking photos of themselves. One could also rent public school uniforms to perhaps relive their youth.Combining public places with private residences, it felt as though we were in a local Korean suburb and yet a theme park, sometimes an art gallery. Some terrain was a bit challenging - steps & slopes but the sights made us forget the ordeal. An especially steep road at the end of our walk had giant fish murals line one wall - fortunately we were heading downhill. There were plenty of trickeye murals - no need to spend money to visit the museum :)After a 2+ hour stroll, we took bus 17 back to Jagalchi Station."
Nice place to spend the day,"Must admit that it's a touristy place. However, it's a pretty place littered with cafes, small shops that sell interesting and practical souvenirs like t-shirts and mobile phone covers, street food, etc. Explore the area on foot and you'll be rewarded with interesting views of the whole village and beyond. If you're not too mobile, don't venture too far in as you'll have to soldier on to the next exit, probably downhill. Lots of nice places for pictures too. "
Loved this village,We caught the bus to visit this area. Walked from our accommodation in Nampo and caught bus 1-1 or 2 or 2-2 up the hill. Wear comfortable shoes and be patient. Lots of people.Wonderful village with colourful homes seemingly spilling down the hill. Lots of narrow paths to explore. Lots if kitschy stalls and food vendors and small cafes.Wonderful views and great for photography lovers. We recommend a visit. About two hours was enough for us. 
A colourful hipster village,"Take your time to walk through this colourful and vibrant village filled with cafes, food stalls selling street food and food trucks. If you come in the summer, don't forget your sunglasses. Not many of the houses there are still being occupied as many have been converted into commercial into enterprises. Tip: to peek into the real thing, park your car slightly further from the cultural village and walk through the real lived-in houses occupied by the locals"
A must visit when in Busan,"As they say, a truly mini Santorini in Korea. The walk around the village can be steep. A great experience indeed. Not to be missed spot to visit when in Busan"
Quaint & Quiet,The village makes a leisurely walk for anyone who appreciates local culture and way of life. There are many cafes and arts shops for a relaxed afternoon. Picturesque place for photo buffs especially on a fine day! 
Get ready your camera. ,"A unique experience taking a leisurely walk around this village. Great place to take some spectacular photos. Wear comfortable shoes, all on hills. Take the 2 or 2-2 mini bus up the hill. "
Unmissable!,"Don't leave Busan without having been here. It would be a crime.Get to the nearest subway station and then take a little bus which takes you right by the colorful village. You can walk around and take pictures, but if you fancy a soft drink or another drink use the bar on the second floor by the main street going down into the village itself. Names in Korean so I can't remember."
Beautiful and colourful !!,What a colourful and beautiful landscape on the hills of Busan ! Was a little dificult to navigate and find our way there but we still managed ! 
Worth a look,This place looked cute in the photos so we went to see it for ourselves. I think it is alright. Slightly overrated. What is cute however is the shops and the steep steps. I also like the fact that these are people's homes. It's worth a visit. 
What a hike,"We should have taken a bus, but it was not easy with a double stroller, we couldn't make the hike. The vie from a random parking lot thou, amazing! "
Village atmosphere in the heart of a big city.,"If you have a few days in Busan, it is worth venturing out to Gamcheon for a wander around. Perched on the side of a hill, it's novelty appeal and nature belies the fact that it is a residential community. Good views are afforded on both sides of the village to two main ports of Busan and a number of eating options and craft shops are available. Easily accessible by metro and bus."
Colorful country view,This culture is a nice view and many young people. Having coffee and Food shop including gift shopsuitable every age to go there but little princess have a long queue
A very colourful village,"We visited in October 2016 using Metro line 1 and stopping at Toseong Station (exit 6). Then we turned right and at the bus stop, took a local bus to the village. You can take any Saha-gu town bus No 1-1, 2 or 2-2 which will take you to Gamcheon Culture Village. The area is likely to be crowded. We just followed the road and explored the area. It is a very colourful village with the house fronts painted in different colours. This is obviously a tourist attraction and photo stop and is quite famous. We spent about 2 hours here and enjoyed our visit. There are also many places for food and refreshments as well as souvenir shops."
Colourful and great giews,"Very colourful village that is worth the trek up, or you could also take a bus. You get a good overview of busan and in the village there are many art work scattered around that makes the trip up worth while. "
Colourful village!,"This village is located on the top of the hill so I recommend taking the taxi from the subway station if you have 3 or 4 people going together. Otherwise, taking the bus there is also a good choice (but I didn't so I don't have the details D:). The village is very colourful and it is located right next to the sea. The walk is not quite long but there are many stairs going up and down. There are loads of cafe, gift shops and places to buy drinks on the way. Overall, this place is lovely and I really like it!"
an attractive & beautiful houses in Busan,"Old houses area that beautified with art and colors and makes it an exciting travel destination. The area is so wide that I decided not to surround the whole area. May need to be considered to provide vehicles to get around. This area is easily accessible via Bus 1, 2, or 2-2 (bus stop in from of Cancer Hospital, which is walking distance from Toseong Station Exit 6). Highly recommend to visit this place if you are in Busan!"
"Quaint little village, perfect for long walks","Easily accessible via Bus 1, 2, or 2-2 (bus stop in from of Cancer Hospital, which is walking distance from Toseong Station Exit 6). The village is filled with colorful murals and other forms of art (every corner is Instagram worthy). Important to wear comfortable shoes as there are stairs and inclined streets. There are also cafes, snack bars and boutiques in the area just in case you get hungry or would like to do some shopping."
Great view,"We took the bus to the village. You can take bus 1, 2-2,2 just beside the cancer hospital. The hospital is just 5 min walk from Toseong metro. We bought the map and got all the attractive stamped. The route is quite steep and you need to be fit in this case. I love this place!!"
Take a little step back in time,"Old houses beautified by art and colour. A very interesting place to visit and see how they have mixed the old with the new. Unlike most people who took a u-turn/shorter route. We decided to go a round, and boy was it a workout but we got to see the not so touristy area of the village where the friendly locals pointed us to the way back. Highly recommend heading here if you are in Busan!"
beautiful village,"I love the colourful surrounding and the quaint and mysterious atmosphere of the village. Don't forget to bring a good pair of walking shoes, be prepared to walk about 2-3 hrs at least if you want to complete the full beginner course. I finish mine in about 4 hours, including resting and taking endless pictures. Prepare sunblock in summer, moisturising balm in winter."
my favourite spot in busan,"Sometimes, the most beautiful thing can emerge from great tragedy. I heard this phrase “collateral beauty” from the movie of the same name and basically meant that even through death or painful loss, we should still look up and see the beauty that still exists.Gamcheon Village is one example of that. While today it is a major tourist attraction, attracting countless visitors who would take endless selfies and call this place a beautiful picture, we have to pause and remember that the village is born as home for war refugees. Many Korean escaped to this little area by the sea to start a new life after the devastating Korean War. Starting over can’t be easy. With little resource, little help, even with little space, they thrive. Most of the residents who were here eventually left, finding new opportunities and the area has since been preserved into a cultural hub and we have much to thank for the beauty that remains. The area is commercialised now, but you still catch pockets of authenticity, if you venture further enough.One of the best ways to explore the area is to buy a local map and go off on some sort of a treasure hunt, trying to spot all the interesting hidden gems that pepper the area. Took a sneak up a stair to what we imagine to be a great view point. It turns out that many places within Gamcheon are actually still living quarters. Small, cramped at the same time. We completely missed a small sign that says ""no entry"", and we got up the stairs, there were laundry hanging out to dry, potted plants and the sense of someone's living space. Oops. Accidental trespassing. And we ended up stealing a view. Just off the main entrance to the cultural village, you can rent the Korean traditional dress called the Hanbook. I didn't see that many doing here compared to say Kyoto in Japan, but it's still pretty interesting to dress as a traditional Korean girl and enjoy the beautiful photos from the area's picturesque backdrop. Apart from renting traditional Hanbok, there are apparently other types of costumes, like schoolgirl uniforms. Perhaps people just love to play out their ""fantasies"". But I'm really really relieved that my group chose the hanbok instead. Otherwise, would have been rather awkward and uncomfortable. Gamcheon's mainstreet has rejuvenated the district. Hip cafes sprung for hip visitors in traditional hanbok. Gamcheon is a people watching haven. You can choose to watch, or be part of the story. The bus from hell. Bus no 2 takes from the metro station up to Gamcheon village. But we warned, the bus will swerve, skid, speed up, brake, drift and if you happen to be standing, be prepared for a challenge to keep yourself planted on the floor and stay put in the same place. It's going to be a roller coaster ride of your life."
Colorful and Vibrant Little Cute Village <3 It!,"I saw this place when researching of places to visit in South Korea, and after I saw photos of Gamcheon, I decided to go to Busan. The place was just as beautiful and colourful as the photos. It's ranked 1 out of places I've been to in Busan.It's actually a residential area that was built like steps. So there were signs to remind you to keep the noise down. But it is not as residential as Bukchon in Seoul. There are a lot of stores, cafes, restaurants and art galleries around. THere are also a lot of craft/arts decor around this area. Very vibrant and colourful! It's a good place to have a walk around, enjoy the cute decors and take photos. Please spare more than 1 hour to spend in here. I arrived around 4:30 PM at the end of Oct, so I only had 1 hour to look around. I wished I had more time. The sunset was beautiful though!I will visit again if I go back to Busan."
GAMCHEON CULTURE VILLAGE ,Beautyful place for taking picture. You should go to here in the Autumn and try on Korean traditional dress! 
The view worth the long walk along the village :),"One of a must-visit location when you're in Busan for sure. Just google around on how to get there, so easy with a lot of public transport that will accommodate foreigners there. Once you arrived, you will need to walk around and will find interesting places such as bright painted house, cute gardens, colorful murals and sculptures created by local residents there. Enjoy! :)"
Beautiful place away from the craziness of the big city; full of colour!,"Absolutely love it and well worth visiting! Only a short 10min bus ride from the centre of the city, with many busses on offer. Full of colour and good vibe, it is a must visit while in Busan. Unfortunately a few artist workshops were closed when we visited but there are so many things to do and visit that it isn't a problem. Highly recommended! And btw, there are not as many stairs as some of the reviews let you believe ."
So colorful - but a lot of stairs,"I really liked the Gamcheon Culture Village. At first I was only going to take pictures from the top of the cafe where I was having my coffee, but the more I walked around the more sucked in I got. I enjoyed all the little narrow alleys and the colorful decor along with plants and cats. The views from the top are beautiful, overlooking the sea.Would recommend it to culture hunters, photographers and architecture buffs and artsy people. A lot of great photo opportunities.A lot of walking is required but some streets are wheelchair accessible."
Artsy Village!,I especially love how colourful and unstructured the arrangement of the houses there which I spend almost 4 hours. It's easy to reach there by bus and the admission is free. But I bought a map of this village to get a stamp and later exchange it with a postcard. But beware to wear comfortable shoes as the walk is quite exhausting.
100% Beautiful,"If you are a beginner and have limited time to explore Busan as I was at that time, just visit Haeundae and Gamcheon would be enough. Those are places you would always find in every articles about Busan tourist attractions, must to visit places. To reach the village you can take bus Sakha 1-1 or Seogu 2 (it is kind of small bus) to Gamcheon Elementary School Bus Stop. There are two main entries, the one with Gamcheon Hanok Village sign gate and the other is entry with Gamcheon's famous landmark in the corner of the street. You can find souvenir shops, photo studios, workshops, hanbok rental shops, bakery, and cute coffee shops here. The village has not only colorful paintings on the wall but also landmarks and scultures. And one unique way to reminisce your trip here is that you can send a postcard for yourself or others by slow mail service that the recipient will only receive the postcard approximately a year letter after visiting the place."
Interesting place Gamcheon,"Quaint and interesting. This ""village"" is sited on a slope with multiple stacks of colorful houses on top of each other along the slope. Getting there is not difficult, get on the metro and hop off at Toseong station. Exit and find the Cancer Hospital and take a bus ride (short distance) for about 1,000 won. Would recommend to take the bus or otherwise, its a long haul walk uphill. Once at the dropoff, you may start wandering around the streets and find surprises here and there. For those who wants to shop, there are plenty of little shops and cafes around the area. Be prepared for lots of walking and climbing stairs and getting ""lost"". If somehow, you are really lost, use the purple color building as a point of reference to return to the dropoff point. Have fun."
You have to visit it,"This is o es of those places that you can't skip it, you need to walk a lot but it worth, the view is amazing and there are a lot of handcrafted gifts stores"
Hipster Town,Mostly hipster stores and graffiti. Just felt like another neighborhood being gentrified into a tourist location.
Cute little village,"We took a cab to this place sharing five of us from novotel hotel huendae beach. Cost us about 50000krw. This is the santorini of korea. You can walk up hill until u reach the point of the lookout and you take some touristy pictures of the colorful houses. There are a lots of spots where you can take nice pictures with the view. Some cafes also have sitting area outside with the view too. Rented a hanbuk (korea traditional dress) for a few hours costing us 12000won (i think, can't remember) and you can wear the dress walking around taking pictures. We took a bus and then train to go back which cost lesser and it was pretty easy to navigate. "
Gamcheon Culture Village,"Very colorful houses arranged in the form of terraced housing. The alleys look like a maze. There are colorful paintings and murals all over the place, so many beautiful flowers also. There are many souvenir shops and also food shops. It appears as though every house has either a souvenir shop or sells different kinds of food. There is even one house that sells wedding dresses. We bought colorful foldable fans, lipstick holders, keychains, ref magnets, cosmetic bags - which we gave to our friends as souvenirs, Enjoyed the shopping."
Prepare for a good workout!,Colourful houses and steep slopes of road to conquer. There is a coffee place at the entrance where you can have a nice coffee and a smoke break to view the beautiful village. 
Loved it so much we visited twice in a week!,"I love the art and culture that this project is pushing for! The village is bright and colorful, with art installations and murals in every corner. There were even small shops and cafés scattered around! Interesting outdoor places like this are so good for the local culture and economy. :) Good model for other countries to follow!"
Great place and short meeting with Little Prince!,"Yes! If you looking for statue with Little Prince - he is there! Sitting and looking at houses from quite high place. Unfortunately there is huge row to make a picture with him... But Village is pretty and definitely worth to see. You can try some Busan snacks there, get some funny stuff as memory. There is a lot souvenir shops, but i think what is more interesting is those buildings, going up and down, between stairs, small roads. Interesting thing is - that people live there. It isnt just culture village as many culture villages - empty after closing hours. Life is there. And you can feel it, even after all souvenir shops are closed there is still chance to eat something or walks around, because it never close for good."
A good spot for photo taking,Highly recommended to check this out for your busan trip. Its filled with colorful vibrant houses and alot of nice quaint cafes. There are some arty farty shops that sell handicrafts. Rmb to collect the exploration map from the tourist centre n there are various point of interest to affix the stamp for each stop you covered. The walls are plastered with lotsa of painting n can be used as a background for photo taking....Dont recommend to trek up as its very steep slope. We took a cab fm nampo and it cost us 4500won. Do make it a mandatory stop when u in busan! 
Scenic and colorful,This colorful village located at the hillside has become one of Busan's famous must see places. Its unique state and development with redecorated exterior walls is truly amazing. There are also cafes and souvenier shops available along the village path. Worth the trip just to experience their artistic decor and capture this village's unique ambiance.
Worth a stop for sure,Walking around the village is pretty interesting - take your time to explore and soak in the sights. Some of the houses are painted in really bright colours. One of the cafe serves surprisingly good coffee and fish & chips!
Interesting Visit,"This is a place that used to be a slum but they have transformed it into a tourist attraction. There are some odd artist buildings but overall, it is worthwhile visit while in Busan."
Love!,Gamcheon village is a must! I would recommend skipping the line to take pics of the little prince. I personally found other picturesque spots. Food available everywhere! You can take the bus or walk up the steep hills of the village (which I did). It took me about an hour to get to the village. Good exercise and worth the walk!
Colourful and refreshing sights,"To get to Gamcheon Cultural Village, take the subway to Jagalchi station and exit at Exit 1. Continue walking straight for about 15-20min until you reach a bus stop in front of a G25 Convenience store, Take mini bus 2 or 2-2. The bus is really small so there may no be sitting space, so be sure to hold on tight because the bus drivers drives really fast and there are many uphills and curves. If my memory serves me well, Gamcheon Cultural VIllage is at the last stop where almost everyone will alight from. It is good to spend at least 2 hours here, slowly exploring the area and snapping photographs. "
Wonderful experience,"We really enjoyed walking through Gamcheon Culture Village. The art, shops, views, and people were all amazing. We cannot wait to explore it again."
Beautiful village,"Gamcheon village is the large village on the hill side..it looks colourful,every house has different colour.This village is really Korean village..so you can see their activities.From the start point,you can buy map to know the way in and out,cause it is quite large and steep village.When you start,you can see beautiful and unique stores..you can take lot of pictures there.In the middle of your journey,you should walk 148 steps downstairs..wow...and you could get some stamps and also postcard from the house which is noted in your maps.like playing tresure hunt..haha..Quite tiring...many steps up and down especially very steep to their end point."
Beautiful place,"Cultural village built in a staircase fashion with colourful roofs, there were many variety decorative things all along the road. Didn't meet the expectation, still fine."
Beautiful Tourist Area,"Very beautiful and quirky cultural tourist area. Not so difficult to get to. 10 minute bus ride from Toseong metro stop. There are signs when you first exit the metro that will tell you we're to go to take the bus.The whole area is brightly colored with interesting sculptures and artsy themes. It is a large tourist area so expect lots of souvenir shops and cafes. Locals still live in this area so they ask that you stay quiet and respect their privacy. There is a ""tourist route"" that is clearly marks. If you get off that route don't be surprised if a local politely asks you to return to the route.Overall it's a nice place. It wouldn't be difficult for me to spend half a day here exploring. "
Interesting and unique ,"An abundance of colourful buildings, murals and designs to wander around. Plenty of places to stop for a rest and refreshments. A very enjoyable couple of hours. Take metro to Tonseong station on line 1, then take the mini buses 1 or 2 up the steep winding road to visitors centre. Best W1000 you will ever spend, trust me!Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful."
Great place to take gazillions of photos,"It's super easy to get here via tube and buses. There's a big information point where you can buy a map with this treasure-hunt kind of game.The pros: GREAT scence! There are so many good spots for photos at the very top of the hill. And from there, you can see the ocean further away. Also loads of shops (food, snacks, drinks, souvenir...) Hanbok rental is also available if you like, the ahjumma there doesn't speak English but she's extremely helpful and friendly.The cons: You can only walk around the village and as it's literally scattered all over a hill so there are loads of stairways, ups and downs. If you have difficulty walking, I'd recommend staying only at the very top.All in all, I personally love this village. I spent almost 5 hours there exploring and taking photos. If getting lost and wandering in small alleys to appreciate your surroundings, this is a must-visit.When I was here, the weather wasn't as great as it could have been. It wasn't gloomy or grey, but it also wasn't sunny. Having said that, I still managed to get some pretty sweet shots "
Beautiful but Touristy,"Was in Busan back in June 2017. Family decided to visit renowned Gamcheon Culture Village and hence we took the subway from Busan station to Toseong station on the yellow/orange line. Once we came out of the subway station using exit 4, we walked straight 20m and reached a cross junction. There is no need cross the road, but just turn right and start walking upslope with Pusan Cancer Center on one's right hand side. One should be able to see is a bus station in front of entrance to Pusan Cancer Center. Take (mini bus) bus 1, 1-1, 2 and 2-2 that will bring u uphill (5mins ride) to the entrance of Gamcheon Culture Village. Fret not if you cannot squeeze up the small mini bus as we notice the bus services are rather frequent. The whole village is built over the steep side of the slope on a small hill that oversees the Busan harbour bay area and the buildings around that area are all painted in striking bright yellow, bright blue and bright green that produces really stunning photos under bright sunlight. No wonder we saw so many tourists flocking to that area just to take photos. It was reported that area is still very much inhabited by locals... yes we did see a few locals (mostly old folks) here and there, nearer to the mid-hill area. We reckon most locals might have already all moved out (long ago) along the 'recommended route' uphill Gamcheon Village promoted by Busan Local Tourism, as most houses along the route have now been converted to mostly either cafes or souvenir shops. "
great for pictures,the culture village is great for pictures. Lots of picture perfect spots. I bought the map for 2000 Won. However it was a little hard to navigate for me. I've missed out a lot of places. remember to wear proper shoes as it is quite a walk. Lots of shops and cafes in the village as well. Perfect if you love my little prince.
Interesting village,Be prepared with walking shoes or track shoes. The walk in the village will be interesting with quiant small shops along the walking trail. Going there can be easy as there are a few buses to the place from the nearby station
Just another location,"I've read a lot about this ""village"", but the visit was just plain normal. The trip up is interesting as we were ""lost"" while getting there and with limited korean, manage to get a local to show us the way. The way around through the village requires lots of foot work - up and down slopes, stairways. So if you have problem walking, might as well give it a missed. The online photos looks nicer. There were lots of people there but most are just there taking photos."
"The ""must-visit"" in Busan",Gamcheon Culture Village have many artsy little shops and cafes. It's nice to walk around and take a break at the cafe looking at the hill full of houses. 
Instagram spot ,"Considered as the Machu Picchu of Korea, this place is filled with many beautiful and colourful houses. It can be quite tiring to walk up and down the area as it's located on a hill. Seems like there are a couple of good hidden cafes in between. But most would find a good spot on the top and take a couple of Instagram worthy shots! "
Beautiful village ,"Must visit for first timer to Busan. Perfect for wefie, selfies, photography. Need to walk a little and staircases around. Impossible to walk the whole village in few hours if you are taking photos along the way. "
Picture perfect!,"A beautiful picturesque view of a village with colorful houses, painted murals, shops and cafes. Definitely worth visiting as visitors can just stroll along the alley and take lots of photos worthy for Instagram and other social media! The houses too are uniquely built in a staircase-fashion on the foothills it a coastal mountain. It is also dubbed as South Korea's Machu Picchu, Santorini or the Lego Village. "
Lovely and colorful village ,"This place was a lovely surprise . Had a great afternoon , went on Monday to avoid crowds , anyway it was lively . A lot of ups and downs , many picture opportunities. Followed instructions of other people in TripAdvisor, we went by metro to Tonseong station ,line 1 and going out it , you could see the village up to the right , suddenly saw a bus with letters in English to it side : Gamcheon village, climb it , payed in cash , driver help us and went up in 5 min. At the marked entrance do not miss a little kind of museum painted mainly in light blue with old pictures of the place . Amazing example how those people transformed an old shanty town in a place to enjoy . Took a coffee in a kind of English pub, first floor overlooking the village next to a famous well and a stair painted in books like a bookcase. You also can rent traditional costumes and walk the village taking pictures , many young ladies do that : Hambok experience . Is called "
An adorable village with colors,"It was a nice place that you can discover the adorable illustrations on the wall when you walked around in the village.The most convenient way to go there was taking the taxi, and it really saved a lot of traveling time."
well worth a visit,"Spent a day here whilst in Busan. The village is in a stunning location and filled with craft shops and little pathways.It is lively and colourful and is great for photos. Beware the the number of people posing for selfies! Would not recommend the cocktails, though, undrinkable."
Lovely village on a hill,"This is a village with lots of street arts and a great view on the hillside. The village is facing the sea and it'll be so beautiful at sunset.- Bus #87 from Nampo stops at the bus stop near the village. After getting off, the entrance of the village about 5~10 min walk to climb.- At the tourist information center, they sell maps for 2,000 won.- There are shops, cafes and amazing street foods. They aren't cheap by the way.- People are kind. But, I guess they speak almost no English.- As well as paintings on the walls, there are many other things to see. I recommend to spend enough time to enjoy slowly. And walking through alleys on the hill will be tough for people in a hurry."
Nice place for pictures,"You have to take a mini bus going to the area. A bit slopey travel but it would only be a short ride, you can walk if you want to hike. Very cool area for photos. "
A nice place for a walk,"Gamcheon Culture Village is a nice place to go for a walk and to see a side of Busan that is less geared toward international tourists with great views. If you don't spend much time in Busan I wouldn't recommend that this is high on your list of things to do as there are much more iconic sites in the city, but for a nice stroll through some architectural marvels with a great view down through the valley toward the sea, this is the place to go. Visitors who live outside Korea might enjoy the opportunity to see this more common local Korean housing that is often not visible on the regular tourist trails."
Very interesting and beautiful artistic place!,"we took a bus there and asked some strangers along the way for the way up. it's a hidden gem!! get ready ur walking shoes cos it's quite a long walk/hike around the entire place. also it was very sunny and quite hot! so do wear ur hats.shades too but if you dont have...there's a shop selling these there too! many photogenic areas, perfect for OOTDs, selfies, groupfies etc and also interesting small quaint shops selling souvenirs, accessories, and even this SOCK shop with soo many designs for just $1000 KRW each!!! we didn't expect to shop so much there! there are also small cafes littered along the way.this may not be so suitable for the elderly as some parts are quite steep."
Very instagram worthy,"Is a definite must visit place if you are in Busan. Its like a mini art village and a tip if you ever get lost, just follow the wooden fishes. They will lead you to the exit or the next photo opportunity. Have fun exploring :)"
Fun Place to Walk Around,"We took a taxi up to the top of the hill and walked around up here for hours. It was a lot of fun, lots of neat little art galleries and street art. There was even one building that was entirely devoted to just letting people write graffiti all over the inside of it. There are lots of cute little shops up here too, but I don't really remember seeing anywhere to eat. There is a little map you can get (in Korean) that a lot of the young people had, I think there is some kind of selfie ""scavenger hunt"" you can do up here, where you go around finding the art pieces and taking picture with them and posting them on instagram or whatever (I think it's targeted to Korean high-schoolers). It was a lot of fun, if you like art, or just quirky things in general, this is worth a visit."
Spectacular views,"My wife and I loved visiting Gamcheon. When at the top of the hill you have amazing views of the village and coast. Also when walking through the village you are treated to lots of interesting and charming shops. Getting there is very easy - leave at Exit 6 at Toseong Station (Busan Subway Line 1), Turn right and go straight and outside Dunkin Donuts take the bus 1-1, 2 or 2-2 to Gamcheon Elementary School Bus Stop. It takes about 10 minutes.Top tips:- use the T-money card for your train and bus journeys- wear appropriate footwear as the roads are very steep- buy a map at the tourist centre at the top of the hill near the bus stop which has sections for you to collect stamps and receive free postcards- after the bus drops you off there is a coffee shop a little down the hill towards the coast where you can go to the roof and see stunning views whilst sipping a brew"
Colorful village,"View of the village is very colourful and very nice place to walk around. Murals and cute pictures can be found in many places and corners. There is a tourist info stop where you can buy a map of the village that comes with a stamping activity. You will collect stamps as you walk around the village. In exchange, for every stamp, you can get some gifts from the tourist info stop. Walking around the village can be tiring, thus there are coffee shops around where you can rest and have a drink. I had my lunch, eating cold wheat noodles, at a shop owned by a granny. It was delicious and refreshing."
Hilltop village,"Many residents still live here so it's not uniquely tourist destination with half abandoned houses. If without the colors and positive vibe, much of it would definitely feel like the slums and an area for the marginal. I didn't purchase the map and walked around just fine for a little over two hours. Some paths aren't marked and I veered off where it looked interesting but you can find your way easily with so many other tourists wandering around. There may be a lot of steps as it is a hilltop village but also cafes and areas to freely sit and rest sprinkled around. I would recommend taking the bus up from the station (I took 2-2 which stops right near the entrance) and walked my way back down. Going down is less than 30 minutes but incline is steep so not recommended for those with young children or the elderly. "
Uniquely breathtaking,"The view of the village from above is unique and breathtaking. Didn't know where the nice photo spots were. I followed the crowd and got to the best view spot. Tip: upon entering the village via the village arc, walk straight and there is a fish-shaped art on the right. Right after the art, go up a flight of stairs and you will reach the best photo spot. Also, there is a mini bus up to the village which is very much recommended as it is a steep slope up to the village."
nice place with little cafes,"it's a nice place with little cafes so if you have time to chill, can drop by this area. however, do note that there might be some steep steps and slopes if you want to fully explore the whole village and not just the central stretch of food and shops."
Great day out!,"Good news is that there is no entrance fee to enter.We purchased the map for 2000 won and they have it in a number of languages. The map shows you the points of interest as well as where to get stamped. You collect 12 stamps and out of the 3 places you will get a free postcard.You don't have to buy a map but it adds it to more fun and in that way you will know that you won't miss any spots or any photo opportunities! It took us about 3 hours to walk around the whole thing -including taking plenty of photos, going into the little shops and eating and stops in between.There are some amazing view points as you go along! And I highly recommend coming here! They call it the Santorini of Korea... now I know why! :)"
Enjoyed it ,"Known also as the Santorini of Korea , it was a hippy town,although touristy but you could check out decent small shops and good finds !"
Good photo-taking spot,Took plenty of photos here because it was just so pretty. We went around late may so it was pretty warm and some spots you have to queue to take photos. 
An eclectic mix of Korea,"Our family of four visited Busan over a long weekend and our last tourist stop was Gamcheon, and glad we did.It was an easy place to get to with a T-money card. We took the Busan Metro to Toseong station (109), walked out exit 6 and then hopped the 1-1 bus to the top of the hill.The place is akin to a touristy artists colony with young Koreans taking selfies everywhere, some even dressed up in costumes like you may see in Tokyo's Harajuku. The beaten path has been well trod and photographed. If you go, venture into some of the nooks and crannies for some cool stuff.By the way, Along the beaten path there are plenty of bathrooms. In the nooks and crannies, you will experience an old Korean village with communal washing spots and other smells of the country."
Village,"Be prepared for a long walk. My advice would be to take a taxi from Toseong Station all the way to the top, we walked and is a long one. The view at the top is amazing. You can see the sea, all the houses with different colors. I don't regret the walk. Lot of people going around all the place. Some coffee places amd souvenirs shops can be found."
Full of wall painting ,You need to walk for 1-2hours at the village. I personally feel that is quite tiring and is so so. Since you visit Busan you have to go Gamcheon Village. 
Tiring and long walk,"While the first part of the stamp card is quite easy to follow, it's hard to actually find the places on the second route (which we were told was added later) without asking locals for help/directions. We also ended up coming on an unexpectedly hot and sunny day, which makes the often steep hills and stairs tedious to walk along. All in all it took us about 3-4 hours to complete the whole stamp map with only short breaks.The art works are often in contemporary style and are definitely worth a visit, though, and there are many shops along the route where you can grab a coffee or buy souvenirs and accessories."
Favorite experience in Busan!,"Quaint little village, loved how unique it was. Lots of postcard shops you can mail a letter anywhere in the world. Sent a postcard to my family in the US and postage was included in the price of the postcard. Lots of cute shops and cafes, unique gifts/souvenirs. And great photo opportunities! "
Must See!,"One of the best sightseeing point in Busan. Go to Toseong Station and take bus 2-2. It would drop you opposite the tourist information center. Wear good shoes as you would go up and down slopes/stairs. Go after 11am, so that the cafes are open. Take a good time walking this area. As long as you stay on track, toilets are available once a short distance."
Beautiful,Place with great cultural. Local council painted the whole village in order to remind the younger generation. Great place to take photos. Remember to have a map when sight seeing as there are location where by you can get it stamp to get rewards. Also there are some houses selling local delicacies and their roof top serve as look out point.
"""Recycled village"". Something different.","This hilly village was given a new life a few years ago. It has become a well known tourist attraction for foreigners as well as for Koreans. Tips :~> For your visit, choose a sunny and clear day to be able to admire - to the fullest - the site and its vibrant colours. ~> Wear sensible shoes because you'll need to walk up and down quite a few alleys and stairs. ~> It takes 1 1/2 to 2 hours to walk around ... or more if you want to enjoy the view sitting at one of the cafés' terraces.~> There are plenty of photos spots, local ""fast food"" eateries, workshops/art galeries, clean toilets.~> Try to read the information boards at each arty attraction. They are very informative and written in Korean as well as in ... English ... which happens to be a rare occurence (even in musea), at least in the Busan area.~> Right at the main entrance of the ""Culture Village"", and to the right, you'll find the Tourist Information Center where you can buy a map of the Gamcheon Culture Village for 2 000 Won (+- € 1,60). You can apparently also get maps for free at some hotels/hostels.~> The local Gamcheon district busses Nbr 1 and 2 will take you there for a fee of 1 100 Won (+- € 0,90).Description :GAMCHEON Culture Village is kitschy, colourful, clean, entertaining and peaceful (except on week-ends and public holidays . Try to avoid going on those days). It's build on hilly slopes and all the houses are painted in bright joyful colours.There are lots of Curio ""Art"" pieces created by local artists spread all over the village as well as a few interesting galeries showcasing the works of local and foreign artists. New ""Art"" pieces continue to find their way to the Village every now and then. This won't be a monotonous visit.Residents of this village are very discreet as they try to live normal lives so - please - be quiet and respectful of this. Aside from all the touristy ""Art"", one can feel the love put into maintaining a clean and attractive village as the residents enhance the beauty of their homes with flower pots and kimchy jars.If you value open spaces and your privacy or if you are challenged in any way, then this isn't the place for you to live in . Lucky me, I'm just visiting .The houses are literally built on top of each other. There is hardly any privacy to be found. On top of this, there are so many stairs and... up and down ... you go along the alleys and said stairs. This village is picture perfect but one has to wonder how the older residents (who might be physically challenged) manage to remain here till they join their ancestors. I also wonder what Vincent van Gogh does here . Strange. Try to find him . I recommend this place as it is something different to enjoy for a few hours... a ""recycled"", well kept terraced village decorated with eclectic pieces of ""art"" and surrounded by hilly garden fields. Enjoy !"
Interesting place,This cultural village is big and hilly we cannot finished it. By following the map we bought 2k won we were lost coz most of this places was written in Korean and confusing.but this place is interesting with a lot of shops selling things. There were location for us to take great picture shot. This place is just across the bridge and by going by taxi it's cost about 5k won. This village to visit is not suitable for elderly person coz too many steps to climb up n down. Also don't go during summer it's going to be sweaty n hot.
Lovely,Lovely project of the goverment which painted a whole poor neighburhood in the city which became a tourist atraction. 
Wonderful Place infilled with Cultures,"It was nice for photography, The place has many colourful houses and cafes with snacks along the street. There is sakura around mid April ."
Nice but with restrictions,"It is unique village. It would be very interesting to walk through little streets but everywhere is written, that we should respect the local people and avoid doing that. It is annoying. I live in touristic area and we don't forbid tourists walk around our houses."
Fun place,"Please choose a cafe and enjoy yourself a coffee or ""red bean bing su"" (red bean ice), many of the cafe have 2 to 3 floor which you can really enjoy the great scenery from the top and get a good photo shot. The whole place is really big, i just walk around about one quarter of it. Many small shop selling different interesting things (more to youngster things). Recommended to spend at least two hours here."
Vibrant colors houses,Nice spots to take photos - very creative to color all houses in such colorful & attractive scenery. 
Worth a trip but not that special,"Would be worth a trip to see the Santorini of the east, but just feel it is more commercial than ""real life"". The photo spots are tough to find as the map is simply no good.Do you research if going for the ""stamps"", would take an hour and a half, assuming you don't get lost."
You will fall in love with Busan ,"Gamcheon Cultural Village isn't difficult to get to. Once we exited out of Toseong Station, we walked a little to get to the bus stop that has the bus to bring you to the village. Mind you the buses here are the local buses and the bus stop names are mostly in Hangeul in Busan so you can ask the bus driver if you are taking the right bus. You will know when you reach the village because you will see a beautiful archway with the sign that says ""Gamcheon Cultural Village"". This village is still an area with residents so please be mindful and respectful of your language, demeanour and tone of voice. There are many spots all over the village that are instagram-worthy. Also if you collect a brochure (have to pay for this) at the cultural office at the entrance of the village, you can collect stamps in exchange for a complimentary postcards. Whilst there, you can make purchases of souvenirs if you want to. There are quite a number of little cafes all over just in case you feel thirsty or hungry. Oh, do wear comfortable walking shoes because you will be doing a lot of walking up and down slopes. If you are heading between end of winter or early spring, the temperature can be quite chilly so make sure you are well covered. "
be prepared to be awe by the views and the slopes,a good location for photo shoot with all the nice views and simple arts fixtures around the place. been there 2 time during the day and night. the scenery just worth the walk up and the walk down. take things slowly on your way down the slopes can make your knees shake if you are not prepared
Favourite place in Busan!,"Gamcheon village was easily my favourite place in Busan! I started my visit to the village by tracking up this very steep slope to the top of the village to arrive at the information centre where I obtained a map of the village. On the map, there are spaces for you to stamp on for some of the spots you visit in the culture village. You can even obtain free postcards when you reach some of these checkpoints. I got lost wandering in the village a few times but the villagers were very friendly and helpful in helping me get to where I wanted to go. There are also many unique murals, cafes and souvenir shops along the way. I spent about 3 hours walking around the area and obtaining all the stamps on the map. "
Great view,"go Toseong(토성) station! And go out exit in 6 ! When you get out of the subway, go right (in meters from exit) then go strait until you see the bus stop, and then you need to take local bus #2, you'll arrive into the last station, it's Cultural Village. The view is great and I suggest you to go back on foot, all the way you'll go down the hill "
Awesome and so colourful,This was my highlight of my trip. It wasn't on my original plan but we decided at the last minute. You can easily get a train and then from the train there are little buses that go up to the area. Sorry I can't remember the bus numbers. You do need them as its a hill :-)
A second visit to focus on the missed area,"I came to this beautiful village for a second time for cherry blossoms. My first trip of early April 2016 was one with a little shower and a grey sky which made a short stay with camera for photography a little unpleasant. This past April, I arrived with a nice blue sunny sky and I explored the section of road down from the bus station and coach parking ground further. That was the portion of the village that I missed in 2017 as there was always not enough time to see everything while on a package tour. I managed to stay there and missed out the more popular road up from the bus station which I spent most of my time in 2017 completely again since my stay was not long. Experience suggests that a good full stay should last 2 hours, or longer if you care for a tea-break or lunch in this romantic village with a number of interesting houses, shops and eateries. There were only a few cherry trees which were within my arms' reach next to some of the colourful village houses during my stay as spots full of pink cherry blossoms scattered around green vegetation further up the hills at far ends from the bus station. Though there are other villages with wall paintings on walls and houses, Gamcheon Culture Village has been the most publicised after a local TV programme filmed in this village was shown in South Korea. It is also the largest and most colourful and romantic one for visits and as subject for good photographs. Walking across the road from or to the bus station and from or to the coach parking ground must be doen with great care as the roads are narrow ones on a slope and traffic is heavy in peak seasons like early April weekend."
Very very VERY crowded during weekend,"Its a nice and artistic place to visit, try to avoid visiting during weekend as it will pack with locals and tourists (especially PRC)."
interesting to visit,"Catch the local Train and bus, its a lovely place to walk around, quiet hilly so wear good walking shoes"
I just keep going back <3,"This is a quirky little part of Busan, that I have visited many times with friends. There is something different to see around every corner and filling up my phone with hilarious photos each time I visit. I don't recommend going during the peak summer season, as it get very hot and crowded. Cherry blossom time, as always, provides the best views over this amazing city."
Nice place,"We do not know there's public transport due to lack of time for research. We thought it is near to the train station but it is quite a distance and the slope is quite steep. It is better to take public bus such as 1-1 or 2-2. It will stop right in front of the culture village entrance. However, there is some renovation on the road which makes it a little unpleasant especially when it rains."
colorful and happy village!,"Went during cherry blossom season and it was beautiful..a bit of a walk but fun and worth it seeing the colorful houses, little souvenir shops and cafes, friendly locals. such a happy view and nice weather! easily accessible by bus. take lots of photos!"
Fun and quirky street art,"We had a fun outing at this culture village. The street art begs to be photographed. The small alleys, up and down steps and quaint little shops selling souvenirs, snacks make for an interesting experience. A must-visit place in Busan! "
Enjoyable experience,"We spend quite some time there. Weather was really nice. I've found it very enjoyable. When you are there you need to go to tourist information center and buy a map for 2 000 won, it highlights all interesting places and got spaces to be stamped. For 3 of them you'll get 3 postcards with picture of village. Village is very colorful with lots of art objects. Try some local food as well for example unique jelly drops made of seaweeds. They look very pretty, as for taste it's more from syrup but still nice. Village is definitely worth to visit, just try to go on good weather also it's pretty windy there and use comfortable shoes cause you will go up and down and through narrow streets as well."
Best in Busan!,"Really interesting place. A lot like the art villages you find in Chinese cities like Shenzhen and Beijing. Lots of souvenirs, locals wearing traditional dress, restaurants, cafes and a great atmosphere. Very walk-able from the town but its a big hill! "
Great place,"Spend an entire morning walking around this quaint cultural village. Browsed shops and the neighborhood with several great vantage points of the harbor in the distance. Volunteer guide Mindy, a college student, personally escorted us around during the second half of our tour."
How to get there by public transport,"A nice place to visit, choose a day that is not too sunny i would recommend.See the foto's for instructions how to get there, you can't miss it. If you have a T-money card, don't forget to check-in and -out at the bus. Ohw and hold on, its a bumpy ride. Don't walk... its only 1000₩ by bus."
A little Murano in Korea with colourful housing,"A really nice sight in Busan.A nice place for landscape photographyIs just like Murano in Venice with the colourful building.Alighted at Toseong Station to take a bus from there to the culture village.Best to go during the day to explore the entire village.While during the evening, you would be able to catch the nice skyline due to sunset."
Colourful and a decent walk ,"We took a taxi from Busan station given that we didn't know where or which bus to catch. Cost us 5900won, which took us to the entrance of the village (beat taking the subway and then figuring out the bus system from the bottom of the hill). You can easily spend a good two hours walking around exploring the various nooks and crannies. We actually took bus no. 17 back to Lotte/Nampo as it was right there once we finished the walk. "
Best thing to do in Busan,"This was my favourite thing to see in Busan. A great way to spend an afternoon walking around here, and taking Pictures. It is colourful, and different."
Wow,I escape from Thailand hot weather. Really good atmosphere and fresh air with unique picture. Many travelers visit here but keep silence for residence
Fun and interesting,"Beautiful views, we spent a great couple of hours here. I'd recommend getting a cab from the metro station as it's a long, uphill walk. There are some fun little shops and some nice cafes to get drinks, snacks and ice cream. Not a lot of restaurants though."
Interesting architectural view,"it is interesting to see the buildings. you can't help but wondering how did they build it? its colorful and around you can see beautiful cherry blossom. a recommended place to visit during autumn/ spring. the view of those colorful buildings, beautiful flowers/ leaves and topped by hills/mountains nearby.. picture perfect."
Great!,Very nice and cute little village in the middle of Busan. A must-see if you like art and interesting places
"Culture, Scenary & Excercise ...","Get a coffee, try local street food, walk around and relax. Colorful house. great postcard....take a bus ride...."
Manchu Pincchu of Busan,There are many colorful houses built in staircase fashion on the mountainside. We see many creative colorful murals on the wall and many interesting shops and cafe. We got a map from the information center.
A great spot for an afternoon of exploring,"The village is easily accessible by public transport, and well organised for tourists with maps and signage throughout. If you follow the tourist map and get stamps from key locations you can collect a couple of free postcards as a memento.There are lots of installations, murals, and great views to enjoy. Please do respect the residents as I think it must be hard for them to have people trampling past their houses all day! "
Cool little place,You can see here some artwork on the walls and exhibitions. Very colorful place. A bit dar from city center but I think it's worth it.
Village taste,"This is living place of the local. You can see the actual daily activities they ate doing.You can try stamp hunt by taking a map from the tourist center. By doing that, you walk into the daily live for the local.There are few spots to take pictures of this good views of colourful village."
Not worth,"Not even close to being similar to Naples. Most people just went a short distance, took some pics and came back out. My family felt that it was a waste of time. There is a rather rude cafe owner near the entrance. "
Beautiful cultural village,"This is one of my favourite places in Busan. Pretty much everything you read online is what it is here. Just make sure if you would like to do some shopping for local stuffs, be there before 6pm. All shops close around 545pm-6pm. If you arrived later than that, most shops already closed. The city is still beautiful with night lights and all, but those shops selling local food and little souvenirs are fun to visit too. In one of the shops u can also buy postcard and you will only received it one year later, which I think is quite cool! I will put this as one of the must visit place in Busan "
Colorful Walk,"If you want to walk streets with an artsy vibe then this is for you. The village is full of shops colorfully rendered and contains good finds for souvenirs and small trinkets from Busan. In some shops, you could paint your own souvenir of miniature Gamcheon Village houses which I find really cute and which families and friends could bond over. If you're looking to wear the traditional Korean Hanbok, you could also try it here. You could even rent the costumes for several hours and roam the village wearing them. They have a good selection of Hanbok that are clean and well-maintained. Another thing to try is of course the food! South Korea is a haven of yummy street food finds and this place s no exception. As you walk around the village streets, you could sample ice cream, cotton candy, Korean desserts and pastries and seafood on-sticks. Try Korean cuisine on any of the small cafes and restaurants. I have no particular recommendation so you should sample them all! For a fee, you could get a program/map at the tourism office and the would entitle you to claim stamps and some freebies as you go around the village stops. My friends and I opted to just roam around sans map and we still had a great time and we did not get lost. If you're interested in photography, there is a lot of picture-worthy places and things so pack your tripod and your selfie sticks as well. Overall, it was a very good experience. It's worth a second trip back to try all activities and sample all the food :)"
Vibrant colour village ,"This village is quite big,colourful and holly.There's a lot of murals on the walls and a lot of nice backgrounds for photo taking.But this is not a must visit place if you are in Busan."
Must see in Busan,"Considered as Santorini of Asia, this is a must-see spot in Busan. Coming here in April when cherry blossom in full bloom combined with the colorful village, it is absolutely an unforgettable experience."
A nice day out,"I read from tourist booklet that this is the Santorini of Asia. Well, Santorini it is not, but i agree, it is quite a nice and scenic place. Nothing outlandish, but a very nice placeto spend anything between 1-4 hours, depend how fast you walk and how long you want to hang out there. The area is pretty big, but there are about 2 main lines that are most pictoresque and have nice murals on the walls of houses. Also there are longer walks up into the mountins and down tho the bottom of small valley, and lots of small places to visit inside the village. But the people in the village, were not that nice, the tourist information, drivers and some cafe owners were quite undfriendly and the general impressiion of people walking there was not that positive. Too many prudish, inpolite, rudely behaved people - a general problem in Busan by the way."
Amazing village,Very cute small culture village with walls covered with art works. Little shops and art galleries. A must visit place while in Busan.
Loved the village and stamp challenge! ,"One of my favourite areas in Busan. We first went to the tourist information centre to buy a map (which included the stamp challenge). We then followed the directilons and collected stamps as we explored the village. Upon visiting two special buildings for stamps, we were also given two free postcards of the village. A wonderfully colourful village with a lot of culture and many photo opportunities. It is also interesting to see the locals living among such a touristy area. Many tourists also rent out special korean dresses for their visit to really up their photo game."
Should be known at Art Village,"This place is nice to spend a bit of time but not a full day. There isn't any real culture there. Just some street murals and small art galleries, plus cafes and street snacks littered along the way. It's nice but I wouldn't put it on a 'must do' list for Busan. Nice for a date or just to chill out for an afternoon."
Little Prince,"I went there when they were filming a movie and it was hard to understand why we couldnt acess the places. Even though after that I got to see little prince, colorfull houses, walk around there full of art. Great view. A must go!"
Great views nice village,"Based on the fact, that this area of Busan was actually slums, it has turned pretty well.Certainly the residents in that area must feel stressed out, as the dramendous amount of tourists who are walking through the little alleys and roads are already on the max level of acceptance.However the presented arts on the streets, combined with all little souvenir stores and coffee shops makes the place kind of magic.If you're in Busan or around, it's worth to visit.Go by public bus or taxi as the roads are crowded!Be prepared for up and down hill walks all the while. My younger daughter 7 years old, was complaining about it and needed some rest stops with ice cream...Enjoy your time there! "
Vibrant Colours Village,A must to visit if you are in Busan. I love the colourful village with several interesting landmarks & architecture. Nice place for photo-takings.
A Must go in Busan,The village is so dreamy on the cherry blossom season. Taking a taxi to the village is easier than the subway and bus if you are staying near Jagalchi station.
colourful village lined with cherry blossoms & beautiful murals,"Beautiful village stacked with colourful houses surrounded by great view from the sea lined with cherry blossom trees. To get here, take the metro to Toseong station Exit 6 turn right and take bus 1, 1-2, 2 or 2-2 at the bus stop in front of Pusan Cancer centre. There is usually a sign on the side of the bus that is heading to Gamcheon cultural village and alight at Gamcheon elementary school stop. Although most of the drivers do not speak English, there are English announcements on the bus announcing every stop. It is best to travel with a T-money or cashbee card if you travel using the metro and buses for the convenience. They can be bought at convenience stores with a T-money logo.The village literally takes your breath away if you are not physically fit enough as there are a lot of stairs and steep inclined slopes to get around, but the view is worth the climb to see the village that was once with a sad background. It is better to visit here during cooler seasons as the climb up and around is really hard and will make you sweat even at 15 degrees. Travel light and enjoy the view here!"
Great time for the whole family,"This so different from the other areas in Busan, but it was a great day out on a nice spring day. If you walk all the way down you see all the different houses, cafes, restaurants and great for both adults and ids if you don't mind to walk. Would be something I would return to in Busan."
Vibrant Colors,"Happened to go on a super rainy and somewhat foggy day just went a ton of tourist buses arrived. Even so, it was a nice visit. The fog cleared briefly so we could take a decent photo of the hillside homes. There is a little visitor center that gives historical background on the area. Restrooms and food along the route."
A nice day trip,It is a perfect place to walk and enjoy the cultural sights. But from the Metro its a hard way up! But I enjoyed it!
A must in Busan,"Took the bus going up, free and easy. Not so many people on a typical Sunday. Experience was great especially if you're into Arts/Architecture. Local resident are very discipline. The ceramic art work attached to a stair caught my attention...simple but nice. Overall, the experience was awesome. I would recommend to other traveller going to Busan...and it's free:)"
Gamcheon Village was established in 1955 as a refuge for South Koreans displaced during the Korean War.,"The location offered obstacles created by Mother Nature herself. The homes were built in a staircase fashion into the sides of the two mountains that face the sea. I thought the village had re-created itself from a refuge into an artist community and cultural collective, I was wrong. According to sources close to me, and after visiting the village myself, I've realized its a cheap imitation of an artists colony to bring in tourists dollars. The artwork is neither good nor professional and the inhabitants themselves aren't exactly thrilled with having the walls of their community decorated with primary level artwork. I wandered around the street wondering why it all looked so amateurish, and now I know. In my research, I also found that many people refer to Gamcheon Cultural Village as the Santorini and/or Machu Picchu of Busan. There is no doubt it is pretty from a distance, but in my limited experience, when anyone offers up that kind of comparison it usually falls quite short of the target. This village, while unique for South Korea and should make your bucket list, is no exception to the rule.Stop into the tourism office to pick up a map and guide to the village for 2,000 Won. All points of interests are numbered and if you visit a few namely, at 5 and 11 observation decks. At stops 5 and 16 you will receive a postcard that you can mail on the spot. There are several photo stops that offer great opportunities to take pictures of the colorful homes on both sides of the mountains. The most popular seemed to be the statue of the little prince sitting precariously on the edge. I watched young girls club over the railing to sit beside him gazing off into the distance. "
Cultural Village Hike,Colourful village up on the hillside. So be prepared with a good pair of walking shoe and stamina. be on a lookout for picturesque painting on every corners and you will be surprised.be prepared to que a little for some famous landmark statues / paintings ya.
Nice place ,Beautiful place..I took the bus which lead us to the top. Very nice scenery. I enjoyed every single thing here.
Picturesque and colourful village,"You can take bus no 2-2, 1-1 and 1 from the bus-stop outside the Jagalchi subway station, which costs each passenger 1000 won. It takes you right to the top and you can then take a slow stroll down the steep paths and roads and enjoy admiring the colourful and quaint houses. There are also numerous cafes and shops and photo stops along the way. Try to be there before mid-day as the village is really popular with tourists all vying for the best spots to take pictures and it gets noticeably more crowded after 12pm. Well worth a visit!"
One of the best experiences,"After breakfast, we head to Gamcheon Culture Village. Wake up early for the best. If you want to avoid the crowd, just go earlier in the morning. How to get there? Take Subway Line 1 to Toseong Station. Come out Exit 6 then you will be facing an intersection. Turn right at the corner and walk straight. You will see a hospital on your right. The bus stop is right in front of hospital. Take either bus 2 or 2-2 and then alight at Gamjung Elementary School. The bus ride is only 5 minutes.On site, follow yellow line (on the road) to visit the village. Please keep quiet to show your respect.You can either walk down to take another exit or walk back to where you came from. It’s better to walk down instead of walking back to the starting point. It is much more fun and interesting.We kept walking down to bus terminal for the bus 17 which goes to Jagalchi Market. We however, found a very nice restaurant which served real local pork reef plus kimchi and soya bean powder so we did not return to the market for lunch as previously planed. The meal was so well tasted and costed us only 28000KRW (6people). Sadly all information is in Korean so no further details to let you know on address. From bus station (bus number 17)- walk down the road for about 3 minutes, it is on the other side of the road and the owner is a big- warm hearted lady"
Nice view with colorful artsy buildings ,We took taxi to the top entrance and walked the entire distance descending through the village al the way down to the city . Lots of cafes with restrooms . Stores open selling local crafts and arts . The walk was over 2 miles were comfortable walking shoes . Very nice views overlooking colorful village with murals . We passed a nice monastery on the way down . 
"Worth a visit, half of their routes is enough","Pls do take their small bus like 2-2 yellow or green 1-1 from toseong station, unless u like 'hiking'. Place is free. If u follow their routes, its gonna be a long road up and down. My personal advice, take until the top of their view and going back to their main entrance. Im expecting a lot of murals but shops though. However a nice place to take a pic if u know the right anggle"
Worth a visit,For those interested in art. Plenty of murals and sculptures to see and plenty of sites for selfies. The area also has some photo zones where you can get great shots of the area. The best is Hangul Maru about 200 metres from the main entrance and up some flights of stairs. From that era you can get a good view of the colourful rooftops of the village as well as the port areas. Plenty of cafes to pop in when you get tired.
