Beautiful lake with nice boardwalk ,"Perfect for brisk walk, mostly flat. Come with walking shoes. Need 2 hours to complete the whole circle. "
"Great, flat east walk for young kids",We went with our 3 year old and 11 month old on our way out of Gwangju and this place is perfect for a ~2 hour walk. All flat and stroller friendly. Toddler brought his scooter and scootered most of the way. Some very nice gardens and art. 
Nice Green Space near Great Restaurants,"You can arrive here by bus (Green bus, 187; Damyang Bus 225) or a taxi from the bus station will be about 25 USD (40 minutes). This is a lovely green space for a walk and just relax reading or chatting with a friend. On the way here from the city, you pass 3 excellent country restaurants near the dam. Amazing fish and beef and pork rib meat patties, with dozens of fresh side dishes. There are also restaurants right across the street, but I have not tried them."
"Not a natural lake, but who cares","More of a man-made reservoir than a lake, this eco park still gives you some nice views and walkways to follow. Great for couples or some personal reflection time."
