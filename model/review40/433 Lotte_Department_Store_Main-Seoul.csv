review_title,review_body
Staff there is very rude!,I went at 12 F and looked for cosmetic product. The staff there dont even know english. And when i asked this one counter. Cannot remember what the shop name. But its near escalator. Maybe pop up store. She was playing with her phone. Then i asked few times and she refused to answer my questions. Keep on playing with her phone. Then after few times then she answered its a toner without looking at my face. And keep playing the phone. Really disappointed with what happen.
MAC counter has a rude staff,"Well, tonight I have very bad experience on MAC cosmetics counter in Lotte Department Store ever as a tourist in a quite luxury place with some other luxury brands inside together. The girl staff in cashier looked to inside my wallet 'twice', somebody in charge who see this review just check your cctv, I'm sure all recorded,it was around 8:15 pm until 08:30 pm, November 22nd, 2019, before I paid and after I paid and gave the money to her friend, they don't speak English well also, and nobody said sorry at all. Is it their manners sell as quick as possible without consideration to serve customer well as I am as a tourist??? For sure I won't be back to this cosmetic counter ever, when I visit Seoul next time. Here I put a picture of the receipts showing time and date of purchase."
Huge food hall; gorgeous store,"Every floor in this store is eye candy for a shopper. Every brand I’ve ever heard of and many I haven’t can been found here. I bought an adorable purse from a Japanese women’s golf clothing designer. They have a huge makeup and skincare department, and even a Lush Bath and Body section. Then there’s the basement. It’s a grocery store, food hall, and confectionery. It’s huge and it’s a delight to the senses."
Mall,You can find everything in this mall Mall that is close to Seoul Station. Very easy to get and also very large to shopping in.
Nice shopping,"We""ve spend 1.5 hours there. A bit expensive, but very posh.Nice clean and a lot of brands there. Not many people. Parking in front with parking service. "
Huge nall,"After visiting Lotte world, a visit to the department store just flow naturally. The mall is huge and as per instinct we drifted unto the basement and in search of food. Not disappointed as I am able to sample and buy some of the local delicacies. We also bought some food items and wears from the department store. "
Good mall to kill a few hours but be prepare to spend!!,"The mall is huge and will take a few hours at least to walk though every level and every wing.Lots of international brands and boutiques charging prices that are more or less the same anywhere else in Asia, even if you factor in the tax rebate. There are some floors dedicated to local designers and brands and even those seemed very pricey to me. I looked at some casual weekend dresses and that ranged from about KRW 250k (USD 200) and upwards going to multiples of that amount. The best part of this mall is the basement food level. Lots to see and choose and try. Similar to the foodhalls you would find in Malls in Tokyo or Harrods in London. I enjoyed browsing and choosing gifts for friends and family. I snacked on quite a few things as I went along. Lovely few hours I spend in there but did actually buy much other than food and gifts. "
Excellent food hall,"Of course the store sells all the items expected of any and all high-end retailers which one can find almost anywhere in the world -- but the basement food hall and grocery store is worth the trip. Yes, you can purchase ""street foods"" and sit in the dining hall to consumer, or peruse the limitless items in the grocery to take home to cook yourself. Either way, foodies will love this place -- though we have found prices of identical grocery items to be a bit less expensive at the Shinsegae Department Store a few blocks away."
Very nice mall,"I really liked this mall, particularly the basement area where the grocery, food court and bakeshops are located. The food available here are all so interesting and varied, from cakes, breads, kimchi, Korean side dishes, to hot dishes that can either be eaten on site or brought home. "
Lots of lots of shoppers,"Came here on Korea’s Memorial Day and there were many shoppers, mainly Mainland Chinese tourists. It is mainly the high end stuff, such as cosmetics and clothing they come for."
Upscale; Wonderful Food Court,"This massive multi-floor department store stood across the street from my Seoul hotel, so I went over to check it out one day. It seemed to be a typical upscale store, similar to myriad others in the world, with many boutique shops and most prices on the high end. I noted many Korean-made items available. All floors looked well maintained and had nicely displayed merchandise. It was early November and the whole place was already beautifully decorated for the upcoming holiday season. I didn't interact with any employees so cannot comment on the staff and service. The food court in the basement, however, brought me back to Lotte twice. I ate two very good dinners (Chinese and Korean) there and found the staff upbeat and pleasant. The cashier for the food court and at least one person at each order counter spoke good English. The area became crowded in the early evening, and I shared my table with a local resident on each visit. Both became lovely dinner companions as we discussed many topics, including what not to miss during my exploration of Seoul. For those looking for good buys, I cannot recommend Lotte, based on what I saw. But there are plenty of other places nearby, such as Namdaemun Market with its estimated 10,172 stores. It offers bargains at many shops and provides a totally different experience from typical department stores"
Upmarket ,It’s a nice upmarket store with some high end brands. It’s not so where to go looking for great shopping bargains. Quick visit to realize out of my price range
Things seemed more overpriced than other places,I stayed at the lotte hotel right next to this main store. I felt the prices are a bit higher than other places. It is very convenient if you don’t like leaving the hotel and things. Overall it is very nice mall.
Mixed service levels,I am not how to start. I needed some travelling supplies while on vacation and went to one of the boutiques in the store to buy some. When the clerk realized I only wanted travel size products her English skills suddenly evaporated. I made my way to the luggage department hoping to find something there. They didn’t but the staff led me to the department I could find it in. My thinking is the staff in the high end shop should be trained by the people who trained those in luggage. I have shopped in other “high end” stores and my expectations are that the greater the value of the goods the more valuable the service is. I don’t expect attitude only good service. This experience has coloured my opinion of Lottie’s as a “high end “ store. My rating is based on Lottie’s being a high end store.
Not what I expected!,"Lotte Department Store.. THE MAIN STORE??Yes it is big. Yes there are 3 /4 floors for duty- free( enroll first)But to me, I didn’t know the limitations till I had a look see !Other than the duty- free section( absolutely packed with tourists) , I would not be bothered ( cf Hk’s malls,)Made in Korea is the theme... the best section is 5he ground floor FOOD.. yes, a world wide selection of imported/ local foods... impressive!For a resident Korean.. RATE... maybe. 8/10(what other choice is there?)It’s the biggest shop in the country.. the FLAGSHIP... I am a tourist, and can compare!!!"
Many brands here but bizarrely missing a toy section,"Came here to see one of the major departmental store in Seoul. One thing to note:. They close at 8.30 pm on weekends (8pm on weekdays). Didn't notice this unusually early closure for a Korean business. Anyway lots of brands (luxury) here as with major departmental stores do. But in a bizarre twist, there wasn't a toy section here. A sign indicated that it was relocated to Star Avenue but subsequently was not found either. More about that later.If you are looking for bargains, there won't be any. If you ask me, they seemed targeted at the Chinese market primarily. They even have Chinese translators at the ground floor with many staff who can speak Mandarin. So we know who are their target customers.Anyway, about the Star Avenue, it was first a waste of time looking for the toy section there as it turned out to be a passageway outside featuring famous Korean stars. Now they have these palm imprints (of the stars) on metal plates along this passageway where u r supposed to be able to bring up a video of this star when I place your palm on it. It didn't work for most of them. So don't waste your time. Stick to YouTube."
Luxury items all in one place!,"Everything that you would want to buy under one roof. Easy access to public transportation and very convenient and easy to get to. They also have supermarket with food court available, for you to have coffee after your long shopping trip. Nearby are Avenue L and Myeongdong Shopping area."
Large mall great food court ,"The mall itself was no biggie, just like any other big brand mall in Asia. Was pleasantly surprised with their foodcourt in the basement. Reminded me of those high standard ones in Tokyo. Getting to an elevator took a lot of patience.."
Everything is here,"The place is composed OF The whole Building. IT has everything you want to buy. Above floors are for shopping whole The basement is The supermarket and Food court. After shopping, prices are reasonable, we ate at The Food court at Panda express. There are a lot OF choices for Food, desserts and confections. A good half a day to spend."
Massive,Staying at the Lotte Hotel Seoul gave us the easy excess to this department store as it's just a walking distance down the escalator from the hotel lobby. It is so huge and down below the department stores are the supermarket and dining area. We manage to grab our lunch here at the food section.
Shopping,"Many things to buy. Lots of brand. Nearby Lotte Mart like a supermaeket for buying some food, snack and beverage. Also, price is cheaper than other supermarket."
Very crowded popular shopping mall with a few floors dedicated to duty free,"It was a weekday yet so very crowded! The mall is very big and has many floors. I recommend to check the directory for what each floor offers, so that you can better understand where to go. Otherwise you spend a lot of time navigating thru the crowds and floors. There are some floors dedicated for duty free shopping, which seemed the most crowded with shoppers pulling trolley bags to contain their things. Be prepared for the long queue to make payment for your shopping goods!"
Too crowded,"It is a huge shopping mall, be prepared by wearing a pair of comfortable shoe wears. We went during the weekend, despite the size it was still very crowded. I would advise do some reading and know at least a little of the mall map, or else you'll have to spend more of being lost. "
Great store for shopping,"This one of the main department stores in Seoul. It is comprehensive in that it has a large food court, clothing, beauty, travel and many other features.It was an easy walk here from my hotel Prince hotel. Directly across the street is a large street market area in Myeongdong.A great store to shop in. It gives you a cultural understanding of Seoul."
Big,It’s a very big shopping mall with also small booths around Many restaurants of different food types starting from fast food to fresh Korean food and also the stores have quiet good sales and reasonably good price and also cinema NiceManalOman
Impressive shopping area with plenty of food!,"This Western department store is massive, with endless amounts of shopping! The food options are fabulous (but don't eat at Elbon on the 14th floor!!!). They offer substantial dining options downstairs, and nicer restaurants on the 13th and 14th floors (only accessible using the hotel elevators, the department elevators only reach the 10 floor).There is a Krispy Kreme in the basement if you're homesick for America, and go deeper to find the Euljiro 1 metro stop on the #2 line (green line). It's a pretty impressive destination if you happen to be in the area."
everuthing in 1 place,not the top mall in Seoul but you can find everything in 1 place from food to clothes. the surrounding area is great. 
All the brand names are here,"A large department store filled with tourists, we were here on a weekday And it is jam packed. Lots and lots of brand names and luxury goods items. We were a little disappointed that they didn't carry more Korean local designers . But there are a few floors dedicated to duty free shopping. So spend away ! "
Typical large dept store,"A large department store along the lines of its Japanese counterparts with lots of eager Chinese tourists in the luxury goods ( particularly cosmetics dept- well actually in much smaller numbers already due to recent strained ties between the two countries). Lots of brand name goods, but if you are looking for more diverse fares there are lots of other options in Seoul"
Cheaper to buy LINE friends stuff from the tax free ,"Every morning, there is a long line of Chinese tourists forming outside the building and they’re only let it when the department store opens. The tax free floors are between 9-12 while the rest of the building stays closed till their opening time of 1030amThere’s a LINE shop somewhere between floors 9&10 and though it’s not a full fledged shop. They sell most of the popular items like stationary or plushies. They sell in both USD and KRW. But even with the USD conversion rate to KRW, the items are still cheaper to be purchased here than the LINE friends shop! TAX FREE for the win! Enjoy and don’t forget to check out the supermarket on B1. It’s not huge but some of their offer items are damn good! And value for money! "
Feedback on the Food Departments!,"Just a feedback on the Food halls at Lotte Department Store at the basement. If you are looking to buy tidbits, snacks, seaweed, etc. To bring home, the choices here are rather limited and do compare prices if you are buying a lot. We bought our items here but was disappointed to find prices for the same snack elsewhere in independent marts cheaper by 10,000 won and others by a few thousand won. Sharing so you won't have the same experience. Check out before buying. Of course they may still have items cheaper just that we didn't buy those perhaps. "
Not many choices,Items are highly priced. Shopkeepers are arrogant and not friendly. I feel that Koreans are arrogant in reel and real life. 
It has almost everything,"Amazing shopping center that seems to have anything that you wold need. It is really large so it can be quite hard to find specific items. We stopped by before heading off to get tteokbokki chips, among other things. They have empty boxes available at the checkout for carrying items. There is also tape and ribbon to pack the boxes. We essentially packed what we brought and left for the airport."
Love it!,"We stayed at Crown Park Hotel which is across from this mall. It is huge dept store that sells duty free brand items. Global Blue tax free shopping onsite. It has many floors with clothes that are pricey. I love the food court!!! lots of choices, appealing display of cookies, pastries, cakes, street food items... etc. We eat here all the time before going back to our hotel."
Lotte,"In Lotte Department Store you can find a lot of shops: Chanel, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Kakao friends, Line friends and more. Mostly I liked basement floor. There are many foods and drinks. You should go to Ops! and Tea Museum. W Lotte Department Store można znaleść wiele różnych sklepów np. Chanel, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Kakao Friends, Line Friends i wiele innych. Najbardziej polecam poziom -1, gdzie można znaleść jedzenie i picie. Polecam szczególnie: Ops! i Tea Museum."
A must see for all those who love department stores.,Wonderfully decorated and presented. The most caring and beautiful people everywhere to help you. I was amazed at attentive every clerk was to my questions and needs.
"Window shopping, nice interior, luxury mall, high end brands ",Lotte Department store is a luxury mall with high end brands inside of it. There's some food court on the basement. We visited this place just for window shopping and seeing its nice interior. 
Department store without other retail shops,"It's department store without any retailers' shop inside. I was looking for merrel shoes here, but it seems like in Korea shoes size 8 is too big for them. They said7.5 is the biggest, 8 is too difficult to sales, What!!! "
Not Your Typical Department Store,"First impression see the main floor with your standard beauty booths. When we arrived the top floor; we decided to leave immediately. The whole top floor was filled with Chinese tourist lined up to purchase their duty free expensive things. The rest of the floors are pretty standard with different items for each floor. Finally, we arrived the basement. There were so many different variety of foods, looking delicious and tasty- it was heaven."
Good service from Lotte World Department Store,"I bought a shirts in the Lotte Department Sore at the men's floor on Dec 31 17, i told one of the sales lady that she is the first lady i met in Seoul with smile, but she told me she is not the Korean, she is a Chinese that got the working visa after graduate from University in Seoul! I also bought a down jacket at the DKNY counter, but there is no stock, i told the salesman that I'm leaving Seoul on the next day, the Manager Mi Kyung, Ahn told me that she will got the jacket from the warehouse and deliver the jacket to my hotel at around 21:30, and she did it as promised, good service! To shop at Lotte World, split the voucher for each below Krw200,000.00 so that you can get the tax refund there."
Another department store,"Nice, worth a visit. Many tourist especially from mainland China. Not all are cheap but not all are expensive. U have to know the price at other place before comparing. "
Excellent Choice of Food down at the Basement,Was in Seoul for Christmas and stayed just next door at the Lotte Hotel Seoul with direct access to Lotte department store. There are just so many varieties of food at the basement of this department store. The one that we liked most was the Korea restaurant somewhere at the end of the store. They served very good seafood SUNDUBU JJIGAE (KOREAN SPICY SOFT TOFU STEW). They have also so many good bakeries that are tempting and delicious.
large selection high prices - limited food options,"Large luxurious department store. Luxurious prices too!Food halls in the basement are nice, elaborate and offer a wide selection of gourmet foods. If you're looking to have lunch, the choices are mainly Asian food. Not much in terms of diverse western cuisine. However, for Korean, Japanese, Chinese food you're well taken care of. Self service, but stalls offer a broad variety of choices.Upstairs this is a typical department store. You can find many brands that are popular in Asia, but perhaps less so in the USA. Restaurants on the 13th and 14th floors are Asian as well. Again mainly Korean, Chinese, Japanese."
It’s not necessary for shopping.,Lotte department store is a hub for all of the world class brands and also the korean ones. The basement have a huge gourmet stores and a grocery store. Also it have a huge cinema theater next to it 
An affordable & excellent Department store worth repeated visits.....,"Without fail, we always make it a point to visit Lotte Department stores in every visit. Whether in Seoul or other cities ( if available). The Lotte ambience is cosy, a great place to shop here.In particular we love their nice & huge supermarket; with its interesting, wide, excellent & beautiful range of products. And the food section here is great especially the bakeries, & eateries too.Prices at Lotte are more affordable compared to the very upmarket Shinsegae or even Hyundai Department stores. We always buy alot nice of stuff from the supermarket here.This store is within walking distance of Myeongdong shopping street where we stay. There is another branch just outside Seoul Main Station."
Amazing basement food hall.,"You must visit Lotte Department Store, the main branch. If not for shopping but to visit the huge food court, food hall and supermarket. The supermarket takes up one side, then there are hundreds of small food stands selling every food item imaginable. Bakeries, wine shops and food shops line the exterior of the room. At the far end is a large food hall with many food counters where you order food and then take to tables. The presentation of the food, the high quality and wide selection is unbelievable. One bakery OPS has luscious pastries, as do most others. Difficult to pick one over the other. To reach Lotte, take the green line 2, and get off at Euljiro 1 stop or you can take the blue line 1, and get off at City Hall stop and just walk over. Take a browsing of the basement food hall. You will be impressed."
Lotte has it all,"Duty Free, check!Variety of food in its foodcourt, check!Grocery shopping, check! High end and millenial shopping departments, check! No wonder a lot of tourists flock to this mall for great food and shopping that caters to young and mature customers alike. There is a good Japanese resto in Avenue L that is a good discovery. Or if you just want to ease hunger pangs then it is the food court where a Japanese conveyor belt sushi can be found or traditional Korean food or Chinese and Asian delights as well, not to mention endless well loved street food snacks in the convenience of a Mall. Coffee-holics and dessert hounds? You’ll surely find the relaxing atmosphere at the basement your thing. It is a good respite from the shop-a-holics of Myeongdong."
High end shopping mall,"There is a food court with local food. Side dishes sold at the supermarket is quite reasonably priced but do note to be more firm with the sales assistant. They will attempt to purposely packed more for you and get you to commit to it. Loads of food varieties to choose from and it's a great place to get snacks back as gifts. When there's sale, prices here is cheaper than their market. "
Luxury ....,There are several Lotte department stores. This in the Myeongdong seems to be the most luxuruous one. In the same building there seem to show the global brands. Tax free Trade seems to be worthwhile because there are some floors dedicated to it.
Lotte Review,Centrally located. Possible to find everything in many different shops. Especially food court in basement floor presents many tasty selections. Prices are above medium. Worth visiting.
Fantastic Mall,"Lotte department store is one of the best shopping centre in Seoul.It Interesting and there are many products.Also,It next to Lotte hotel.There are Taxi free in (9,10,11 and firsr floor).There are many good shops .In my opinion if you have kids you should comewonderful design cloth and cool deal.Women products Paris and Milan are more cheaper for woman hand bags and shoes."
3 department stores all connected,"Lotte department store, Lotte Young Plaza and Avenue are all interconnected so you can shop comfortably in air conditioned space. There are food halls and clean modern washrooms in all 3."
Fantastic Standards & Service ,Really nice department store. Interesting product mix. Great visual merchandising and impressive standards.
Overcroweded and overrated,"Spent few days in Seoul for Business purposes and as it was next to the hotel went there in order to check out any eventual bar gains...Was a quite disappointing experience as it was overcrowded, people pretty aggressive and when checking out the prices couldn't find anything worthyIn my opinion spend your time somewhere else"
Good shopping,"This is definitely a good place to go if you can afford such brands: most of the brands there are more on the high end side e.g. MCM, Gucci etc. There is a bargain basement (where most people were there) and also a great food court (I hanged around there for most of the time). I am not sure if its a must go place because it is just a department store full of stores that are in fact on streets as well."
Nice Mall. ,"You can find a lot of high end brands here like Gucci, the bread section has an overwhelming display of different kinds of breads and they comes with a free taste which is a good thing. I enjoyed shopping in this mall. The grocery has a lot of fresh fruits to offer, clothing and cosmetic section are so great! I love this mall. "
Decent mall at shopping area.,Just another mall in seoul. locatated in the central and close to local shopping area. free wifi is the best park. many branded products at cheap price. so worth a visit if you are in that area.
Bargain Basement Not Good Finds thou :P,It's connected thru the subway underground shopping place and once you enter the door ...you will be surrounded by crowds of people and bakery booths and food booths plus some local specialty booths that range from anything you could think of to be as a gift or for self enjoyment. Too bad I was not hungry but it is a good place to have some decent food while shopping there.
Great place to shop,A departmental store selling a wide range of items in the heart of Myeongdong. Clean and organised. Don't forget to bring your passport to claim tax refunds!
Hope it open earlier,"The mall won't open until 10:30 so it's not something for those who wake up early.The mall also have 2 floors full of duty free counters, though I think it's possible to find these products cheaper even with tax, if you have time to shop around.Overall a nice, would come again when travel with my girlfriend."
Family Friendly,"The mall has got everything from apparels to household to food and groceries. In short, this mall is for the whole family of all ages.The highlight is the baby room on level 7, not only was it fully equipped with the necessary (changing stations, hot and cold water dispenser, etc), it provides all necessities such as wipes, diapers, creams, even a cot room for your child to catch a wink. The amenities offered were so comprehensive that any parent can just show up with a child, without bringing anything else."
Attractive department store,There are many attractive shops here. I go to duty free shops whenever I come to Seoul. I saw some event in front of the store. It's so fun.
China Chinese Everywhere,This place is good if you are looking for Made in Korea F&B items. Here you can find a whole battalion of China Chinese buying and grabbing everything in sight.
"Beautiful, clean, organized facilities with lots of shopping options though pricey","I don't like to shop much but the Lotte department store is definitely a place to see if you are visiting Seoul. It is enormous with beautiful clean and organized facilities. There are all kinds of shopping options though it is pricey. It's also located within the complex of Lotte attractions so there are all kinds of things to do nearby (nature park on a large pond, amusement park, aquarium, etc) for those who don't wish to shop."
"位置方便, 應有盡有","最吸引是9/F,10/F 的duty free. 我選擇住在明洞都因為這個duty free! 拿著visa credit card 有9折, signature visa 有85折, 吸引到不得了!!!! 不過, 唯一就係早關門. 無法, 我們是瘋狂購物者, 一行就忘記時間. 放心, 我一定會再來, 等我!"
Lotte Department Store,"Nice place, conveniently located for us near our Lotte Hotel Has just about something for everyone, including foodstuffs, and is a pleasure to shop at."
Lotte,Similar to the Shinsegae. This store is pretty big with a lot of shopping options. Pretty good location too
Great department store!,This in my opinion one of the best department stores Asia has to offer! When you come to shop be sure to bring your passport because you can get a percentage back for duty free. 
All sorts of items can be found. ,All items from head to toe and from all the age range can be found in this mall. And all designer things is here also. Its a one stop shop for everything. 
Expensive!! ,What a mall! Lots here for anyone to choose from and it surely is expensive with all the high end brand name clothing. No outlet prices in this mall. 
The Harrods of Seoul,"I had never heard of Lotte World, Mall, Department Store, etc. before our recent visit to Korea. Upon walking inside, I was instantly reminded of Harrods in London. It is a luxury department store of that scale with a huge food court in the basement. We didn't buy anything, but it was fun to shop. "
Break from the old stuff,"Nothing much, just a department store and a supermarket within a big lotte complex. Had a good Korean meal on the top floor. Born-ga by some famous chef from Korea. Big building are seldom in Hanoi. This is way off the tourist area."
Very Subjective,"It's nothing but a multi-story Department Store with many International Designer Brands and an incredible number of cosmetics counters, comparable to Saks Fifth Avenue or Henri Bendel in New York or Harvey Nichols in London. If I lived in Seoul or a tourist looking for tax-free Brand Name shopping, I would likely shop here. If you are a tourist not interested in buying brands that are not available in your home countries, save yourselves the headache and avoid fighting through the crowds. With the recent travel recommendations from one of the neighbouring countries, you may be able to enjoy walking through the Store without getting bodychecks these days.The Poor Rating is not a reflection of the Department Store itself but simply the whole retail experience. It was extremely crowded and noisy when we visited."
The Store in Seoul,"This is the Store of Seoul. This time, I have seen so many more pretty things from France than ever before, which more than a decade ago. The duty free shop on top floors were replaced by visitors from China rather than Japanese tourist as before.Not much of a shopper these days, in my tender age, I didn't get to see everything but food court was a necessary visit. I gave 5 star rating for it being the hub-bub of MyeongDong attraction. Things can be more pricy compared to other areas in Seoul. I am glad that the place maintained its popularity and evolved to cater the younger crowds & foreign visitors as even for choice of food in the lower floors.Somewhat crowded but this is the story of Seoul.I give credit to Koreans that tried their best to meet up to the standards of westerner or foreign visitors."
One of the big department stores in Seoul,Lotte Department Store Main is in Namdaemun which is easy accessible on foot from Myeongdong. Mature clients are their main target.
"Convenient, huge and inter-connected with Metro , Malls and hotel","We were there on Silent Night and Christmas Day, which was crowded with people, in particular on floors 7 or up for imported brands and tax refund service. There are almost every leading world brands of bags, cloths and accessories coming. Just coming out from Incheon Airport, special shopping coupons at Lotted Department Store are seen everywhere. But the terms and conditions are not user friendly such that deterring customers from using it eventually. The inner design and layout of the department store seems a bit old, in compare with its entrance and ground floor design. On floor 8th, there was a bridge connecting to nearby Lotte Young Plaza. One catching note is, there are mouth wash steriliser and cups facilities for customers to have mouth wash, fantastic!"
"A lot of shops, excellent food court","In terms of budget shopping, this isn't somewhere you would necessarily go to, but I wouldn't say the things are completely expensive. The food court + supermarket was definitely a highlight."
Excellent department store in Korea,"C1 ( 2016.12.12 ) This Lotte department store brand was number 1. in Korea. I didn't like Lotte, but it was certain that there was very good department store. There was always crowded and many stores located. Especially, there was very good place to shop to foreigner , but too crowded to me."
Luxury and high-end brands,"Almost everything can be found here, however its not cheap. Easily accessible, can take a look around if you have the time."
Worth visiting but very expensive,"Very well equipped department store but expensive. All European brands presented but at least double in prices. An exciting visit, nice Asian designs."
Huge luxury shopping mall,"This is a huge luxury shopping mall with a lot of high end brands - think Burberry, Coach, etc. There is a small supermarket and a food court, as well as some restaurants. Since this mall is higher end, there didn't seem to be too many sales worth going for, even on Black Friday. It's a nice place to walk around though. For younger and more trendy brands, there is the Lotte Young Plaza mall that is attached. You can browse this mall all the way to the top floor and take the walkway over to the Lotte Young Plaza from the cinema."
Overpriced ,Crowded and overpriced is your first hit.Counterfeit and unhelpful staff are your next.I wouldn't recommend going.
Large department store - similar to department stores in Japan,"If you haven't been to large department stores in London and Tokyo, this is the one you can definitely go to experience the feeling of walking through a massive department store that not only sells clothes, but also groceries and food. This flagship department store is similar to other department stores in that it sells plenty of clothes, home kitchen supplies, and other items.However, you really want to visit the basement of this store to see the groceries and food sections. It did seem to be a little smaller than the basement food sections of department stores you see in Tokyo (e.g. Ginza), but it is still worthwhile to visit. There are plenty of high end groceries (especially meats and seafood - and your expensive fruits and melons) at really high-end prices. There are also plenty of small restaurants and stalls selling take away food and snacks, so allow yourself some time to go through the basement...The store is also conveniently located next to the subway line so it makes it quite easy to visit."
Most popular with tourist...especially supermarket,"Good ambience with all the christmas decorations. Plenty of stuffs to see. But supermarket is quite small. However, if you are looking for the top 10 snacks to buy, you can find it here"
"Big Lotte Department store in Seoul, South Korea","This is a big department store the way Bergdorf Goodman in New York, Harrod's in London, El Corte Ingles in Madrid, La Rinascente in Milan are. It has a lot of high street and high end luxury brands. Cosmetics on the first floor to draw customers in and clothes on the upper floors. One could spend hours in it..."
Crowded,Very crowded department store. Suffocated during my visit. Beauty products are offering at better price. It is a good place if you are planning to buy things in bulk.
Terrible and Irresponsible Staff,"So I bought a watch in this store and as I needed to obtain it in the airport, I handed my air ticket and passport for the shop assistant to arrange the pick-up time. The assistant wrongly inputted the date as 16/11 when it should have been 6/11. This mistake made me unable to obtain my item for which I had already paid, so I had to stop the transaction made via credit card immediately.What makes it even more frustrating is that the airport staff, after understanding my case, was unable to solve the problem for me. I left Korea without ever obtaining my item.Therefore, I truly found the staff irresponsible and unhelpful."
Convenient,"This was our first family visit to Seoul with the in-laws, stayed at the Lotte Hotel World which is close to where family lives in Jamsil. As an American, I prefer my South Coast Plaza/Nordstrom/Macy's, but this was convenient to have close by. We were able to purchase a nice birthday gift duty-free for my mother-in-law's birthday celebration. However, most the items were high-end luxury items, not necessarily the brands I would shop at home. The food court and grocery store in the basement were convenient to have around, as were the Korean restaurants on the 11th floor. Don't eat at the other ethnic restaurants--the Indian, Italian, Vietnamese food taste weird and are not authentic. Stick with Korean, and the Japanese is OK. The customer service is OK. I feel smothered because they tail you as soon as you enter an area or show interest in an area. I like having my independence and personal space. If you are looking for more affordable shopping, go the the sections of the store bordering Lotte Mart -- there are some domestic low-cost brands there as well as a Zara. Or walk further into the new mall at the Lotte World Tower, there is a Gap, Banana Republic, etc. Or go to the basement into the subway area, there are tons of local stores and chains that sell items for $10-20."
Brandname shopping place,"If you are looking to get some brandname goods, please visit here. Some staffs could not speak english but they are ready to help (i strongly suggest to get direction or location of particular shops from the interactive sign, as sometime they don't exactly know where it is and gives wrong info).Lotte duty free is always busy and should visit before lunch time.Supermarket on the basement is very busy in the evening and quite small."
Everything in one place ,"I have been here on all my visits to Seoul. Not only does it have Korean and luxury brands, they also have a wing called ""Young World"" where they have youth oriented fashion and designers. They even have a shop selling Line (Line Messenging app ) character goods. The only Muji store in the area is located inside Lotte as well. In the basement, they have the food emporium with restaurants and vendors selling various foodstuffs. While not the cheapest option, 1st time visitors who have never experienced a Japanese or Korean department store should check it out. "
Busy and well managed,"Bring your passport to get duty-free benefit. The Lotte department store is usually busy with tourists. The staff were friendly and helpful despite being overrun by so many people. Overall a nice mall. The food court is busy and good eats. Prices are good too, especially with discounts and tax free if you have a foreign passport. "
Convenient and Duty Free,"There were a lot of fashion, watch, bags etc in the department store, prices were not cheap but lots with good quality. I managed to get some fashion that I liked, bought some stuff from the Lotte Mart, had yummy meals in a restaurant called Bowl in the department store, had a quick tax refund in the same building so I was happy. Just remember every Lotte Department Stores has different operating hours and many close around 8pm. It's good to check if you are a late shopper."
Lotte mart,"We only explored the lotte mart. If you want to buy korean supermarket things, this is the place. The market is crowded so it feels the market is small. You can also buy kimchi packs here."
Lotte Seoul City Plaza,This is a very nice shopping mall. It is huge and the selection here is outstanding.The food court is amazing as well.
4 Department Stores in One,"The Lotte department store comprises of three different buildings with 4 slightly different styles. AvenueL, Lotte department store, Duty Free, and Young Plaza. We found Young Plaza to be the best for us. As, we consider ourselves younger. It is also a bit more affordable. Great service throughout the department store. It is quite large and lots of shopping to be done."
Different service standard at Duty Free,"The service downstairs at the 'normal' stores seems perfectly nice as one expects at this kind of high-end department store. However the customer service changes once you entered the upstairs duty free department. But it's probably due to the free market like atmosphere given by so many tourists at once. Counselling is not possible at this stage, you better get informed before you go there and just grap the things you are looking for. There are also many multipacks offered if not only. "
World-Class Department Store with Excellent Customer Service,"The Lotte Department Store is a classic, great department store, the kind that is now difficult to find in the US. It is many floors of high-quality merchandise. If you miss the great department stores which were once so common in the US but are now scarce, you will be in heaven here. Prices are fairly steep, but they were having good sales when I was there. They have a small army of staff - everywhere you look there is a smiling sales clerk waiting to assist. I must say, they put the American department store to shame."
A huge duty free stire,This is a huge store with most brands available. Often crowded on weekends. Ideal for those looking for branded and duty stuffs.
Big Department Store,"This shopping mall is located at Myeongdong, very accessible by train and a popular shopping place for tourist. There are many floors in the building just like any other shopping mall and it's duty free too.We went to the basement floor where they sell food, fresh ones and packaged ones... the whole section is big, you can really get anything you want here and the staff here are very helpful, some can even speak multiple languages. It's a good place to get food souvenirs since there are many choices and you can even sample some of them."
Huge high-end shop,I went shopping with a collegue to buy clothes because her luggage did not arrive.The store was huge with a wide variety of items. I was surprised at how expensive clothing was. For example a regular dress could be 300 or 400 US dollars. The ground floor had a huge food market.
Nice shopping complex,"It contains 3 blocks of building, linked with footbridges, suitable for different people from young shopper to luxury brands lovers.You can find all you want here. Not too crowded except the top few floors of Duty Free Shops, with all the chinese crowded buying different cosmetic items.Convenience location near subway station."
A nice shopping complex,"U must visit when you go to south korea, lotte Department store selling a lot of thing, especially the lotte mart, the fruit and vegetables are fresh, the bread is attractive and delicious. It is worth to go"
Lots of options but crowded in the weekends,"This huge shopping model is located in one of the shopping areas in Seoul, the Myongdong district.It has a wide selection of stores, however it can be get quite crowded (at least in the weekends) hence if you need to use a fitting room you might have to expect to queue for a while.Best option: get there early to do your shopping."
Hugh shopping Mall,"There are more than 10 floors of shopping with the Lotte Hotel in one of the wings. The duty free shop is on the 10th Floor, Supermarket on the lower ground with food court. We took subway and exit at Euljiro 3 to get to this HUGE MALL after our visit to Nami Island"
A relax and good place ,"This place is awesome .Nice ,big, staff are friendly .Clean There three building there There cinema Prices reasonable Raining day still provide plastic holder for wet umbrella Love this place "
Superb,"A great place for shopping or just hang around. Good touristy places too like the ""Stars avenue"". Located right in the heart of Myeongdong shopping district. 10-15 minutes walk from the metro station."
World class service!!!,"My wife and I went to B1 to buy Korean seaweed, cabbage and radish kimchi and other assorted Korean groceries to bring it back to Singapore. We bought so much that we felt that we needed to put them all into a cardboard box. One lady staffing the seaweed section really went out of her way to get us not one but two boxes, sealed it up with masking tape and even made a handle so that we could carry it more easily! We tried to tip her W10,000 and she fought back!!! Lotte is clearly doing a great job with their customer service. Well done!!!"
Don't miss it - Definitely worth a visit,"This is one of the most famous (or at least most advertised) department stores in Seoul, and hence, from the time it opens till the time it's closed, there are huge crowds all over the place. It is still possible to navigate through, but be prepared for a very busy area. Use the escalators, as the lifts are packed! There are 11 floors with top 3 of them dedicated to Duty Free shopping. That's where the ""madhouse"" begins :) - in a good way!You will be able to find any kind of cosmetics there, and the prices are good. Don't forget to bargain and ask for freebies!!! I know, it is a large department store, but you still allowed to ask for discount, gifts, and freebies - and get them!All assistants are helpful and speak ok-ish English. Have your passport (or the photo of it) and your return flight details, and have your VAT removed from your total. If you pay by Visa you can get 5-15% of the total bill. Negotiate it - with gold visa you can get 10%, with platinum -15%. In the main store you could find great fashion - local and international. The interns one isn't a bargain, but go for the local designers and objects - you will be pleasantly surprised both by look and by price. There are restaurants and cafes all over the place, so if you need to rest your feet and boost your energy - there are plenty of opportunities to do so! "
No After Service !!!????,"I bought a ELLE 양산 from Lotte department store Bucheon branch last year, and used it for several times last summer . Because of its quality problem(a screw was off), I brought back to Lotte Bucheon store to repair it. However, there is no more ELLE . The ELLE counter left Lotte Bucheon. So my purchased product became a homeless without after-service. Lotte Bucheon 's second floor cashier/customer center lady asked me to pay 15,000won to repair the parasol. I told her it was caused by its poor quality, I didn't break it. But she said that there was no free after-service for every brand's parasols & umbrellas. Very shocking. Can someone from Lotte Department Store explain it to me, or follow up with it?"
Good shopping mall,"Is good shopping mall with five floor for family clothes, accessories,shoos The price its far with quality products and design "
"Groceries, clothing? It has everything","Bought some local snacks, Happy Call cooking pan cause its wayyyy cheaper than backhome! No plastic bags for free, but boxes are provided! fun shopping experience!"
way too crowded,"Massive mall with ten levels of shopping but way too crowded even during off peak hours on weekdays. There were big groups crowding around the more popular cosmetic counters like Sulwhasoo. The food court was really packed and the prices were on the high side as well. It really felt like a war zone with people just pushing around and I didn't enjoy shopping there, I'll go to other malls which are not as crowded."
Shopping,"The place is crowded with China tourist. No toys section for children. The food section was very crowded. Could not enjoy. We went to MCM store, the shop assistants were rude. Wont be come here for 2nd time "
"For all shopping needs, and food!","Right next to our hotel (Lotte Hotel)- next to Euljiro(1)-Ga station. This is a huge 10 storyed mall with the top 3 floors dedicated to duty free goods. Other floors have everything that you want to buy when in Seoul, but the food and bakery section in the basement is to die for!"
Duty Free Heaven!,"10th floor on ward is Duty Free! Bring your passport if you want to shop here!At here, only need to show your passport and they will do everything in order for you to shop for duty free product.Must visit the concierge first in advance to know all sort of promotion for all sorts of credit. I gotten my Silver VIP Privilege Card for free due to credit card promotion. (Forgotten which bank promotion). But not all shop giving extra discount for VIP Privilege Card though. Better than nothing."
High class mall with good food,"Two large buildings connected with many shopping choices and a very well kept food court with many choices in food. Food is a bit more expensive here but you're paying for quality food with excellent service. There are also a lot of different stores for shopping including a one-of-a-king Kakao Friends store which sells the hottest characters in South Korea right now. If you're looking for the department store setting, coming here is a must. It even connects to the subway system so you don't have to walk outside if you don't want to. The establishment also has their own aquarium and Lotte Mart (Walmart equivalent) and a larger basement food court. Quite an eye-opener."
Love the Duty Free department ,"Always is a ""MUST"" for me visiting the Lotte Duty free products for foreigners while visiting Korea . Is easy to walk from Dongdaemun or Myeongdong . That's few floors for foreigners to shop for branded goods , foodies and skincare that we may pay but collect at airport , we can enjoy buying as much and won't affected our baggage weight because goods will be collecting after check in baggage and security check . Some months may have super special deal for different credit cards holder. Nice."
More expensive than lotte mart,Very crowded with tourist you can't even get basket to shop. It was luxurious compared to lotte mart and lotte outlet but the price were also more expensive that it was ridiculous. We went there to buy snack for gift and compared the price to lotte mart in seoul station. Our heart break each time we found how we lost so much money for the same brand of lotte snack
Crazy Shopping paradise,It is so convenient to buy all those famous brand over there and all the items are tax- free already. You can't leave until your pocket become empty!
Massive! ,They Have many lotte malls and shops where I live in Jakarta. It was refreshing to see them in south Korea too where they are booming. They also have lotte world here and lotte hotels! The world is going lotte mad! Pay a visit just to say you've been and experienced it!
Still the same two years on,"We last visited here around two years ago and this is still a typical mega mall with branded apparel, bags, cosmetics and a duty free on the upper floor. Do note that some items in the duty free are much higher than what you can get for them in other stores like Shisegae, so shop around. We loved the food court and supermarket in the basement though, and it had almost everything imaginable from vegetables to cakes and sauces and fruits, We bought a couple of punnets of strawberries for 8000 won each and they were sweet and ripe."
Great food court,"This review is only about the food court level at Lotte Main. It's an excellent place for eating and shopping for food items to take out, with the exception of wine and liquor (very limited selection, especially of liquor). There are several casual restaurant style places where you can order mainly noodle/rice bowls and sit down at a table to eat. And of course there are dozens of counters selling everything from sushi to pastries. There's also a more traditional grocery store area with produce, meat/poultry/fish and other items. If you go during the day it is quieter and easier to navigate, but one advantage of going within an hour or so of closing is that many of the more perishable items such as fresh-baked goods and prepared meal items with meat or fish are marked down for quick sale. We were able to get dinner for two for about 10,000 won (less than $10) and a bag full of excellent pastries all marked down by 20%. It's very crowded and bustling at that time but you can get some great bargains if you're willing to fight through the crowds."
Nice Shopping Avenue,"If you willing to buy a lot of stuff, you should go to the lotte duty free.Most of the brands are high end and still expensive (for the luxury bags), but if you want to get korean beauty products in low price, it's the best place even if they don't have all of the brand in it (such as odbo or clio)"
As crowded as night market ,"Yeah, this place is super super crowded, particular at the Duty Free shops at 9th and 10th floor. It feels like you are at a fish market or something, except that you are shopping for luxury brands and cosmetics. And don't be surprised, most people there are Chinese and even the staffs speak Chinese. They seem to have special promotion for foreigners from China. "
complicated mall-THE GOOD AND NEED TO IMPROVE,"THE GOODThis mall have the american brand and branded ones. If you want to buy the expensive brand this is the right place for you. YOu can have your Tax refund here.THE TO IMPROVEThis mall is very complicated when you are transferring to another, you can get lost. It close very early. it close 8pm. hoping they extend it."
Congested stores and not great specials,"While the Lotte Department store is huge, it’s still just a mall with overpriced goods. If you like shopping with a tremendous crowd and pushy customers then be my guest and shop at Lotte Main Department store. There were some sale items but most stores appeared to have relatively few discounts and even the specials and promotions they had going on were worthless or useless. Try going to the outlets where there are still hordes of people but at least there are some pretty cool deals if you look hard enough or are a comparative shopper. Avoid this department store if possible."
High end shopping mall,"Lots of expensive brands names here and some duty free shopping.The B1 food hall and supermarket was the standout, has one of the best sushi trains I have eaten at in a long time."
Great mall,I would recommend start the visit at main building from Bottom food court and super market for best experience.
Paradise for shoppers,"Really a paradise, especially the duty free with special amazing prices. I wish they have more brands and clothes at duty free. But it is too crowded and payment is separated at each store so it takes a lot of time in queue waiting to check out at each store."
Shocked With The People Flow,"Despite being pre-warned by my friend to either go early or before closing time, I was totally shocked with the people flow in the duty free section of the department store located at 10-11 floor. This is particularly true to the cosmetic and/or skin care section, Here, they needed to register your passports or foreign ID for tax free price. You can take the purchased items right away under Korean brands, otherwise, you need to pick up the goods at the airport for foreign brands. This duty free section will be opened for business 1 hour earlier than regular business hour - there is a special entrance at the back (near car park) to go up."
The go to department store for shopping and duty free,"I've been to Lotte dep store last year and this November when visiting Seoul. The dep store has everything, if you're looking for one place to do your shopping- this is the place. When visiting in the end of November the department store had beautiful christmas decorations- it's worth seeing. Positives#great selection of brands and mercendies, helpfull and serviceminded staff.#lottemart on basement level where youbcan buy all kinds of korean tea, snacks, cakes to bring home#dutyfree on floor 9-11 with great selection, if you're from Skandinavia or countries with heavy import taxes, you can save on your purshases#excellent foodhall with very reasonable prices and amazing selection of high quality food, #subway connetion to the nr.2 lineNegatives# if you're impationt in crowds, you might want to avoid afternoon and weekends. #this is not the place to go for cheap shopping #may not be abel to save that much on US brands in the dutyfree if you're living in the US"
Top notch department store in Myeongdong District,"In the heart of the Myeongdong district, shoppers will find the Lotte Department Store. This is the flagship for the Korean based chain and it is huge, providing many hours worth of retail shopping opportunities for those who haven't had enough from shopping the streets of Myeongdong. Lotte reminds me of the SOGO (Japanese) Department store that we have in Hong Kong. There is a bit of everything that department store shoppers might need; jewellery, clothing, handbags, shoes, accessories, make-up, electronics and a wide range of other goods. There is also a good lower level food court and supermarket at Lotte Department Store. The supermarket is enjoyable to browse even as a tourist. It is nice seeing the quality of foods available here. Overall, not sure if this is the best department store available in Seoul but you can certainly do a lot worse. Lotte Department Store is directly accessible from the Euljiro Station for those interested."
Checkout slow,"If you come here for the regular dept store vs duty free (on floors 9-11), be prepared for large crowds and line ups at check outAll the mandarin speaking customers flock here and go crazy buying. It's enough to drive yourself crazy. I hate crowds and don't recommend coming here if you are claustrophobic. The day I went, you got 5-10 percent off for using your Visa card. That was a bonus. Much better discount than the Dongwha duty freeSome things are cheaper here, and some are not"
Amazing store,"Incredibly large store with every designer offered. LOVED the food court for a quick bite, as I stayed at the Lotte Hotel."
I don't like shopping...,Just following my wife around the mall for hours. Lots of nice wares. Lots of good restaurants and excellent food court. But a mall is a mall for me. I did get fed and watered so - all in all - no complaints. 
Nice high end mall with few negatives,"Next door to Lotte hotel which I stayed for 4 nights.Pros: big, clean, nice mallAttentive sales people Big cosmetic areaCons:Very rude Chinese lady at the currency exchange. No hi, thank you, how can I help you? She acted like she was doing me a favor and didn't like her job. I thought she was unpleasant to just me but she was also rude to a Chinese couple behind me. She really needs to quit or get fired. Needs better ventilation in the food court. My husband felt sick with all the smells in the tight, poor air area.Food court needs to provide sandwiches or other alternatives besides Korean food. This food area/store doesn't even come close to Thailand which accommodates to some Westerners.Besides that, it would've been a pleasant mall."
Overwhelming size and sky high prices,This is not for the faint of heart. The size is amazing and you'll find lots of HIGH END merchandise here. It's in the heart of Seoul in Myongong. 7 levels of shopping in the main store and multiple side areas. But the prices are very high end. TIP: you can get here very easily by subway.
The biggest Mall chain,"My first visit to lotte mall is at the olympic park area including lotte theme park, and the second one is lotte mall at Myongdong Area. The Mall is huge really huge with a lot of visitor. They area in the main location of Myongdong shopping area, including lotte hotel and korea star walk at the lower lever near hotel lobby. The mall is completely with many shop and restaurant, since we eat at myongdong area so we don't eat inside the mall. But I think you must try. Interesting."
Because of,"I didnt like it and i didnt waste my time in that place not because it was not good, but because the prices in my country are cheaper than the prices here. It is well organized and has lots of choices"
Biggest store in Seoul for all taste,"The Lotte Department Store main branch is prominently located in the hotspot and busy shopping district of Myeongdong. It is the largest department store in Korea offering high-end shopping to Koreans as well as visitors. It is directly connected to Lotte Hotel Seoul and is 5 minutes by foot from my Hotel, The Westin Chosen Seoul.You will find in the building a a wide variety of goods from reasonably priced Korean labels to world-famous luxury brands and also a duty-free shop. The food court located on lower level is huge. Lot of restaurants and food brands.The store is opened every day from 10.30am to 8pm."
The best mall we've gone to in Seoul,"We only stayed in the capital for 4 days, and this was the nicest mall we were able to visit. Not big enough for me, but maybe I am just used to the large malls we have in Manila. Was able to eat a salad at the food court. Supermarket was disappointing though. Not enough seaweed in my opinion."
High end shopping,"We were a bit let down by shopping opportunities in Seoul, we thought it would be more like Tokyo and it isn't, so when we found Myengdong area and it's shopping opportunities we were happier :) Lotte department store was mostly out of our budget as it sells mainly higher end cosmetics and clothes, bags and other goods but if you are looking for higher end goods this is your place to go. The Shu Uemura section here is quite large as well and the staff was very helpful in getting us what we were looking for plus gave us a large pile of samples for free as well. Otherwise I'd suggest the neighbourhood around the department store- good quality, but cheaper cosmetic and clothing stores (even the western ones) and lots of cafes, restaurants and food stalls. The department store has a nice toilet though hahah :)"
Lotte Mall,We were disappointed with the selection of stores. We got the impression that Seoul would emphasise it's fashion outlets but there was little in the way of decent clothing. The entire mall contained sportswear shops and restaurants. Though there is an aquarium and cinema.
Lots to love,"The Lotte Duty free is great for me because many of the luxury items that I love are not popular with Chinese tourists or Koreans. This means that luxury items that might be full price in New York are being offered at a discount in Korea.I've purchased designer frames, bags, watches, skincare, etc. All great deals and so convenient to retrieve before your flight. You can take the Korean brands home with you on the day of purchase.It's worth the trip...Don't go on the weekends unless you are wearing mental armor."
Duty Free Shopping and massive food court,"All major cosmetic, luxury goods and electronics are sold here at the Duty Free Mall. You can even shop online and have the goods delivery to airport for pick up, skipping the hassle of queuing! On the basement lvl is the grocery mart and food court. Worth your time to explore and try the food, kimchi and desserts. You will not regret this! "
Over pricing place,"I asked price of few items in parfume department, there was no price sighn , I asked price for Chanel Madumasel, 100 ML AND got answer with f..... 210000 won which is double priced, and chanel blue same story. Prices for clouthes too high, I avood to do any shoping here. After I went to duty free wich is on flor 9 to 11, Prices here was beter but still not cheap, for example suveniers has double priced, same u can buy much cheaper in marked. Parfume prices was in USD dollars, wich is not handy for me.So I very disapointed, avoid this place. To many people to crowdy, and nosy"
So overwhelming! ,"This department store is for the SERIOUS shoppers, especially the duty free floors with all the branded goods! Very overwhelming in some areas but if you're keen to shop, then head straight here. Also the Lotte Young Plaza is really cool too for people aged from Tweens to mid 20's"
A+ Department Store,"The mall is crowded with tourist from China, especially the duty free floors. I love the brands. A power house of all brands. Korean brands are expensive but with great quality. Toilets are clean and very accessible. The food court is overwhelming with choices and my teens are very happy to find Rocky Mountain apple candies. I only have problems with some sales assistant because they don't speak good English but they are very friendly."
Plenty to see here,There is certainly a lot on offer here. the best part for me was the food court in the basement. Worth a look.
Koreans set the standard of luxury very well,"I'm American, and I frequent places like 5th Ave in NYC, Michigan Ave in Chicago, and Rodeo Drive - luxury, right?No.Lotte mall is ridiculous. How you have all the luxury brands all on top of each other in one building is insane. Who buys all this stuff? Apparently, lots of people do, bc the place is packed with buyers, not just shoppers!If you are a foreigner, go upstairs to the duty free floors, where the best deals are. The supermarket downstairs is cool to check out, and it's also the best place to get something to eat, like at the noodle bars. Don't eat on the higher floors - it's overpriced and underwhelming.There are also 2 related malls next door with more designer goods, and the other one caters to the younger set.If you're American, realize that English isn't a standard out there, so you'll have some difficulty."
Face masks,"I will put it very simple. Go to the duty free floors, bring your passport and flight details and start to shop masks and cosmetic at excellent a prices. You will find any brand with unbeatable offers and sales. Be careful with the Chinese crowds cause they buy buy and buy more than anyone else :)"
Good Shopping but a Stifling Atmosphere!,"Make no mistake, the Lotte Dept. Store in Central Seoul near Euljiro 1-ga offers world-class merchandise. You will be completely overwhelmed by the breadth and quality of what you can buy at Lotte, whether it may be high fashion, food, or practically anything else.That said, the shopping experience leaves a lot to be desired. For example, half of the B1 level is an amazing food store, with Korean groceries, international delicacies, prepared food to take home or to eat on premise. But the floor itself is not optimally laid out, there are too many people and the ceilings are extremely low. I am also not a fan of the faux Baroque architecture typically found in Lotte stores.Once you experience B1, try to get to the Duty Free floors (9th-11th), which is likely the main reason to visit Lotte. First of all, I challenge you to find an elevator, let alone one you will be able to fit into. Once you get to the floors you will be completely overwhelmed by tourists! Times Square at Christmas is a cakewalk compared to this. My wife, who loves to shop and grew up in Seoul, swears she will never visit the Lotte Duty Free area again.The other issue with Lotte is the relative lack of subway access. You can directly access the subway #2 line at Euljiro 1-ga but this is the loop line. You will likely need to transfer or walk to a better Metro station. Even if you are staying north of the Han River (Kang-buk) you are better off visiting the Shinsegae branch at the Express Bus Terminal south of the river in Kangnam. It's less crowded and the overall experience is better. There is no Duty Free floor but that's a plus in my book. I recommend staying away especially if you have kids with you."
Department store with style but no Mastercard accepted?,"Great and stylish and huge department store! However when trying to pay with MasterCard , my understanding was (told by a salesgirl with lousy English skills) that MasterCard is not accepted in Lotte. Then another girl on interpreter desk ( yes that was really the name...) told that MasterCard is not accepted in while Korea. That i already knew to be rubbish and told her that i had been uusina the sane card several times in stores much smaller and less fancy. Because of the poor English skills of the personnel they lost a customer and trust in their expertise- and I still dont know why my card wasnt accepted. Would like to send them feedback but apparently their customer care does not have any email address or another channel either - loading an apps should not be the only option..."
Luxury goods for sale,This place offers a great variety of luxury goods. All clothing brands can be found here. They have a great food court and you can spend a whole day shopping here.
Great place to shop but it's not cheap,"This is a great place to shop but it's not cheap. My favorite place was their basement which had different types of food. If you're looking for quality name brand clothes, they have a large selection. "
Loved it,So much fun going through the department store. Spend a lot of time in the food hall trying all different kinds of foods. My favourite was the mochi filled with different flavoured ice cream fillings. Didn't really browse the clothing departments but spent a but of time upstairs in the home wares and event hall. Left with a few good buys and a satisfied tummy!
Cosmetic on top floor - lowest price,"Cosmetic on top floor - some how the price is lower than shops in Myendong street.Sometimes, can get additional 10% off during sales or credit card promotion like using Visa card.Love the supermarket on the Basement floor. All the instant noodles, pork meat in can and Korean products can be found here."
"Great choose, great shooping!","If you think whatever to buy, in this department store there is it! Fantastic to find everything you want! Absoluted recommended! Sometimes the prices are not very cheap."
Great Shopping,"Lotte department store has many brands for men, women, kids, sports, casual, house needs, cosmetics, and many others, it took over 2 hours of walking just to explore the place and do very little shopping, it is very busy and crowded. Once you are there I would recommend that you take a nice break for coffee or tea in the middle of your shopping time."
Not well designed,"I have to say that the entire Lotte World is not well designed. Maybe because I am a foreigner, I am used to things being designed for the masses, where everything that can go wrong, will go wrong, so you try to make things idiot proof for the first time visitor. Like, this whole complex, the department store, the amusement park, etc, are all integrated into downtown Seoul. Not the city center, but a side city, Songpa-gu. In other words, Lotte World is the majority of Songpa-gu. That being said, it is hard to figure out where Lotte World begins, and where it ends. There is no guidance on where to go. It is just there. Park somewhere, figure it out. No shuttles, no monorails, no people to tell you where to go. Just start walking and figure it out. But this is true of all of South Korea. All of the signs inside, like where to find the bathroom or this or that, only get you half way there. Seriously, you will follow a sign, and then there is no sign, and the thing you are looking for is nowhere to be found. It is the most frustrating thing I have encountered. It is almost like they said, we'll do you a favor, but not really. And that could not be worse in a city where the temperature and the humidity both hover around 90. You will need a shower before you find a drink of water.Sticking to topic, the department store: So, the front entrance is kind of there where the hotel entrance is, and I see people getting off of buses, I guess for the amusement park. But where do I go? I just want to buy this damn toy helicopter that my girlfriend's kid who keeps asking for it over and over and over. So, inside, am I near the department store? Hell if I know. Finally, after wandering around, I find a long hallway that leads to some stores, and hey, there is a toys r us. I found the helicopter, but only after my friends bus had left. Different cultures, I guess."
