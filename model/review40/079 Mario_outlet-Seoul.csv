Not a must to visit,"Easy to get here by Gasan Digital Complex station. A short walk of perhaps 5 mins.It's mostly the local korea brands in here without those international branded brands. Good to visit this place if you have time to spare and not a must. Can't really figure out how the pricing works here. Sometimes, there are additional discount off the tag on items we bought. Spent half a day here and we didn't buy much either.We got quite a good deal of 50% at the North Face over at the nearby Lotte outlet."
A lot of shops,There are few malls around that area and it is easily accessible by subway. The Lotte mall also nearby but a bit more expensive. Worth to drop by.
Outlet?,It’s my first visit. But not many brand shops without few big brand. Price also was not outlet price.
Much better and bigger place to shop,3 buildings for you to shop. Lotte factory outlet building is just next door. Don’t waste time there. 
"Basically if you plan to shop in Korea, come here first","Compared to the other places around, I find Mario to be the be the best in terms of coverage and price. It's a bit crowded but that's to be expected. There're a total of 3 buildings connected. The price is the same as the Lotte outlet next door, but Mario has more brand and choices.I recommend spending at least 3 hrs+ here to hunt for the best deal."
Good for Korean Brands,"I was disappointed because I thought I could find some western brands here such as Coach, Gucci, Prada among others but this outlet mall mostly has Korean Brands. The shoes options such as adidas and nike weren't also as extensive."
shopping,"travel very easy to go, more more shop and more hawkers area (product cheaper than Hong Kong, good quality)"
Pass,"Brands are mid-range or parochial, prices are not impressive and it is comparable in both price and selection to the Hyundai department store across the street. Doesn't feel like a real value proposition- if you want cheap stick to underground malls/street markets. Neighbourhood is boring and out of the way to boot. Nah. "
Must visit for shopaholic,"Location is near if compared to outlets in paju. Price is little more expensive if compared than paju and the collection is not as large as ones in paju but price wise and time wise it is better to shop here.By the time we get there, we got free car parking. I think it is because some technical error of the operator. But still nice!Oh. And there is lotte outlet too nearby, right next to mario outlet."
Many items. ,Tons to choose from a lot of great clothing decently priced not too much money and it's really conveniently close to the subway In addition there are good restaurants and there is the movie theaters.
Many clothes,"If you need clothes and discount, come there... there are a lot of stands of many brands, you can negociate a discount to buy all you need"
Nothing to buy,"Maybe it's a bad time to come where the place is stocked with mostly thick and long sleeves. Not particularly trendy clothes or cheap since it is an outlet. For those that are not expecting the usual US standard premium outlets and not looking for any brand names, maybe it's worth coming since there are a few buildings of such outlets linked to each other."
nice outlet - fun,"it was nice- there are 3 separate building that connect which contain many clothes stores for all ages and styles. many sales which can bring clothes down to $6/7 (when I went) . there are restaurants too, including a buffet called Ashley that i love. be sure to check out the ""mall's picks"" area which contains the best limited time sales!"
"Come here if you want TONS of affordable, stylish Korean clothing","I have been to Korea three times now and usually Myeongdong is enough to fulfill my Korean clothing needs but I had heard about Gasan Digital Complex on the internet and decided to check it out. I was not disappointed! Oh my goodness! If you fancy anything fashion related come here! There are 3 major outlet buildings with a block from exit 4 Gasan Digital Complex. K2, Mario Outlets (3 buildings!) and Hyundai Outlet across from Mario Building #1 I believe. Trust me - after coming here you won't ever see American fashion in the same light ever again! Actually, all my wardrobe is now Korean - I don't have any American labels in my closet because they are sooo plain, ill-fitting, and unstylish. Next time, I come to Korea, I will buy suits. You can buy a well made suit for 200-300 tailored same day in an endless variety of colors and patterns. For women, the choices are even more extensive especially if you are looking for a cute coats! Endless varieties for sure! And what's great in Korea are the many independent labels! In America, most clothing is branded, so everyone looks the same or boring. If you do buy an American independent designer, they are usually very expensive. In Korea, fashion can be expensive but it needn't be. They still have an extensive local fashion design and manufacturing base, so the latest trends reach the Korean consumer much faster (and cheaper in my opinion). Look around and notice Korean men. You will see their clothes are tailored and fitted properly. While Korean clothes are more fitted, in Asia, it is customary to offer onsite tailoring so you can leave with properly fitted shirts and pants. I would suggest to get any alterations done in Asia as it is quicker and cheaper."
Huge shopping complex,"massive shopping mall, lots to buy. There are food outlets too to stop and grab a bite. Prices are slightly cheaper, but look out for sales, can get good bargains."
