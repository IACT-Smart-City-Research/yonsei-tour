Best football team in Korea,"Went and watched jeonbuk fc in Jeonju for my very first Asian Champions League match. Although the stadium is rarely full to capacity like you would find in most English Premier League or European Champions League matches there is still an impressive atmosphere with Jeonbuk fans singing through their repertoire of songs and chants. You can really see the pride this city has for their club with the words ""Pride of the City"" printed on their football tops. The team is very good with some South Korean international players in the team and some up and coming talents including Jaesung (#17) a very good midfielder. The stadium is in the outskirts of the City and is only a two hour bus journey from Seoul. The ground also has good Korean food available and there doesn't seem to be an issue with bringing outside food so bring some snacks and enjoy the game."
Come to watch a soccer game!,This is the home of the Jeonbuk soccer team and they play here during the weekends (usually). The ticket prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is quite fun :) There is a large selection of food you can buy here too ... including cup noodles and dried squid:)
Impressive to look at but you can't get inside,"Unless there is a match on, you're restricted to just walking around the grounds, and while the stadium is impressive, it would've been nice to see the inside too."
Free shuttle,"The stadium is not in the center, but they gave us free shuttle from certain points in the city. Also free shuttle back to the city after the game. Great atmosphere inside. We can eat pizza and chickens while watching the game. And also we can have beer inside! "
Go Jeonju!! Go Taehaminguk!!,"World Cup Stadium is quite the experience whether you want to watch a game on the jumbo screen or to watch a live game of Cheonbuk National University's soccer team. Both are highly recommendable and adviseable. Whether its the smell of the dried squid, noodles, or shrimp chips~there's something to be said about watching a sporting event at the stadium vs. anywhere else in the city. "
