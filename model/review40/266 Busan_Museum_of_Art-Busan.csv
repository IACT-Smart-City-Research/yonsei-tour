Don't waste your time,"No actual Korean art within. ₩5,000 and all I saw was a bunch of Finnish (think Ikea on steroids] stuff of which I saw a larger and nicer collection st the Manchester Museum of Art in England. "
peaceful,I wish there would be more art pieces when compare to the space they have.All of the staff are friendly and can speak English.
Beautiful Museum with Small collection,"Visited here on a Sunday afternoon. Very small crowd so it felt as though I had the place to myself. The outside of the building is rather plain, but the inside is quite beautiful. The exhibits were quite good, but very small for the space. The main hallways on each floor seems bigger than the exhibition space. The shop was very small. Still, the collection is nice and it is free so worth a visit."
Surprise! One of the truly great Contemporary Art Museums in the World!,"We had heard about the reputation of the Busan Museum of Art, as being a terrific museum for Contemporary Art. The art displayed, and the execution of the display of this art, is above reproach. There is apparently a second space with more of their Permanent Collection displayed, which we did not visit. But this is a MUST for CONTEMPORARY Art lovers. And our admission was free!"
Large but empty museum ,Such a large building but so little to see. The special exhibition was of little interest and no permanent exhibits. English translation of Korean captions very poor. Cafe was nice but that’s not what we went there for. Avoid.
Wonderful collection,"The current exhibit about the history of art in Busan is really interesting and informative. It covers Japanese occupation, art during the Korean War, contemporary art, etc. The recently acquired collection was good too. There’s English translation for most galleries. The museum is easy to get to by subway and the main galleries are free! "
A perfect Saturday/Sunday afternoon,"This is probably one of the better modern art museums in South Korea, and a perfect place to spent a lazy Saturday or Sunday afternoon. The attached restaurant id good but pricey so try the foodtrucks nearby in the sculpture park as a yummy, cheaper alternatives. Some exhibitions require additional payment, but you should be able to get right around in a leisurely 2hrs."
Nice Collection of Modern Art,"Probably one of the better modern art museums in Korea. The exhibits were interesting and varied, mostly early 2000's works from Korean artists (unfortunately all of the piece descriptions were in Korean regardless of the artist). Not sure if there is seasonal renovations, as when I went lot of the space was empty,including the entire second floor."
Don't miss the Lee Ufan annex,"The main building has a few small exhibitions and is free, although several floors were closed, including the main sculpture garden. However, the Lee Ufan annex is worth the visit if you like his work, with walk-through sculptures of starkly lit boulders, white gravel floors, and giant plates of metal. There is a small fee to visit the annex but it is minimal."
Museum without art,"Two exhibits were advertised, but they filled maybe 10% of the museum, which was otherwise as empty as a new fridge. So unless current exhibits sound compelling, it's not worth your time."
Hints on this place,"1) Strange museum — almost no visitors on a week day, building is quite big, but exhibitions are tiny. Lot of empty space without people.2) Closed on mondays.3) Free admission for permanent exhibition.4) Children' museum."
Museum of modern art,"Visited while in busan in November 2016. Easy access via the busan metro. I only was in the building with the gift shop which had some French impressionist prints to purchase. Modern art style in exhibits. Multi level museum. In one exhibit you could enter a large mountain created out of thousands of Japanese cranes. It was to symbolize the end of the Korea Japan war. In the bottom of this building, there was an area for children to play and create their own art work. Located near BexCo."
For ufan Lee,"Art museum is so so, big and they have nice collection, but i would like to recommend Ufan Lee's museum. It placed inside of Busan Art museum. there is extra charge. but the collection and building is so beautiful. "
nice exhibitions,"The building is not that special for a museum of art, but this does not matter because the two exhibitions we saw were nice. The museum only has temporary exhibitions. Whether you enjoy the place, it really depends. And I am the lucky one.Try the pumpkin latte at the restaurant. It is actually milk with pumpkin. This special drink tastes good and is suitable for children as well."
Amazing exhibition by Busan Biennale 2016 team,Pleasantly surprised with the theme of the Busan Biennale and the exhibition in celebration of the 100th anniversary of Lee Jung Seob. Both exhibitions were impeccably curated and it was enjoyable just wandering around and learning more about Korean art.Definitely worth a visit if you are an art lover. The museum is closed on Mondays though so do take note and it's about a 5-8 min walk from the Busan Museum of Art station. The exhibitions always change so perhaps the ongoing exhibitions won't be everyone's cup of tea at certain timing. 
Pick your exhibition carefully,This museum doesn't have a permanent exhibition. It offers room to temporary exhibitions for which you pay separately. So when you enter the museum make sure you buy a ticket for an exhibition which interests you. Otherwise you end up paying an amount of money (we payed 12.000 won per person) for something which isn't your cup of tea. 
Everything is closed,"when we arrived, all the exibhits other than the ""statue garden"" were closed, so we went to look at the statues. Let's just say we soon found our way out of there. "
Not a must see,"We had read that this was quite a good shelter from the rain, otherwise not a key sight, however, it was disappointing. When we walked in, we were told that they were setting up their next exhibition so I thought that we would just see the permanent exhibition, which did not exist!!! I'd look up the website next time!! "
Wonderful Relaxing Discovery,"Well designed, airy, spacious. Take your time to explore the exhibits, indoors and outdoors. Lots of seating made available on every floor.The gift shop is a disappointment though. Sells more touristy bric a brac with highly inflated prices vs souvenirs of the artwork exhibits at the gallery."
Excellent modern and contemporary art museum,"Excellent museum, mostly with modern and contemporary art from local artists. Also hosts some temporary exhibitions by some foreign artists.Nice and modern building.It is free entrance.Not all information is in English."
Stopped by out of necessity and discovered a lot of new and amazing art,"It was a rainy day, and I did not feel like going to a variety of places that morning. After a visit to Shinsegae Department Store, the Busan Museum of Art was in the same neighborhood, so I thought I would stop by. The end result did not disappoint. I am so happy I paid this Museum a visit. There were amazing works by Novello Finotti on display, some interesting Asian oil paintings and Japanese print works, as well as new and modern art from Chinese painters. I thoroughly enjoyed this visit. I am happy it was free, but had I known these works were on display, I would have gladly paid. The museum space is wonderful. It is open, airy, and very modern."
Exhibits not so attractive,"The size of the museum is quite big but their exhibits really not so interesting and attractive. However, the park around the museum is much more beautiful and attractive. It is because it was autumn time when I visited it. Red maples leaves was so eye-catching."
Almost no art,"It had a couple of sparse galleries, not very much to see really. The children's area had a few magnet boards with some shapes on it. There was a few statues of dogs peeing around the place and a spot for children to colour. Not worth the fee ( it was free). There was a gallery for a fee of Andy Warhol. I was there expecting Korean art couldn't find any."
Glad it was free,"This museum has art on level two and three with a kids area on the B1 level. It's free to visit but special exhibits will have a fee. There's enough to occupy about 30 minutes max so if you're looking for something to do and have low expectations, this is an option. The art is very redundant. "
Nothing here ,Everything was closed except one exhibit with sketches and the museum shop. I'm sure this place would be nice if the art was actually on display. I would definitely call to find out how many exhibits are open first. 
Free museum to explore eastern art,"Certainly worth 1.5-2.5 hours of your time to walk through two floors of exhibits. the Korean art on the 3rd floor was something new; obvious connections to Chinese art in the (much) older exhibits. Currently there's an exhibition of German art on the 2nd floor, some of which was quite interesting as well. All this said, some of the ""modern art"" doesn't do much for me.Our youngish boy enjoyed the chance to color a sheet in the basement and hang it on the wall next to works done by other adolescent artists."
Gorgeous.,"This is such an interesting and multi cultural experience, worth the trip to find this museum. The art pieces are fascinating. "
"Better than we expected, pity we only had one hour","We went to the Busan Museum of Art on a rainy afternoon before leaving Busan for Gyeongju. We had less than an hour to spend in the museum (as it takes at least 45 minutes to go to Busan station), which we really regretted once we arrived at the museum. The museum basically has two floors displaying artworks (above the ground floor with the reception, museum shop and restaurant. The second floor hosted a special exhibition on German art after 1949, and the third floor had contemporary and modern art of Korean artists. If you only have little time to spend in the museum as we did, I'd recommend to focus on the third floor. We found it fascinating to see what contemporary art in Korea is like and how it differs from Western contemporary art and we saw several excellent pieces. One room was devoted to modern interpretations of traditional arts in Korea, which was also very interesting."
what a beautiful little museum,"Wow, we really enjoyed the visit to this museum. The art shown is very interesting because the upper floor is reserved for Korean artists. Also the outside area with the sculptures is very interesting. This museum was one of the highlights of our trip to Busan."
Wonderful Way to Spend an Afternoon in Busan,"The Busan Museum of Art, which charged no admission fee, was a very refreshing and soul-strengthening experience. Museum staff explained the system in English and gave me a map and guides to the collection, also in English. The exhibition, ""Line, Color, and Space of Korea"", was a very nice variety of works from the Museum's collection, curated along those themes. While I wandered on my own, there was a guided tour in Korean and the visitors seemed to be attentive and satisfied. I was especially interested in the way that the museum gathered the paintings for the area of ""color"".One thing that could possibly be improved is the location and dimension of the threads intended to keep visitors from getting too close to the artworks. This is very low, thin, and dark thread and more than once I ran into it and nearly tripped while trying to get a good look at the painting.The New Acquisitions were also very exciting, especially the surprise when you round the corner and are faced with Jennifer Steinkamp's video installation, ""Madame Curie"". Although it was a Saturday afternoon, the museum was not crowded. It was enjoyed by a mix of Koreans and foreigners, some accompanied by their children.I also visited the Art Library. The librarian was unhelpful: when I asked her for books about textiles, she pretended to use the computer and then said no, no textiles here. There were, however, many books on textiles which I could easily find myself, and probably many others she could have helped me find if she had just said ""sorry, no English"", and I could have used Google Translate. The collection was very useful and I learned several new things - while I was there, some professorial-looking types were taking notes on what they were reading, so this may be a good resource for artists in the community as well.After visiting the library, I went down to the gift shop on the first floor. Some of the things they sold there were the same as you can get in every museum gift shop in the world, for example, umbrellas and mouse pads with ""Starry Night"", but there were some particular to Korea or made by artists whose works are part of the museum's collections. I bought a model of the Geobukseon (Turtle Ship) for my niece to assemble.The cafe was spacious, and floor-ceiling windows make it a very beautiful place to have a snack or drink. Prices and menu were in line with those in other cafes in the area. Overall, I really felt lifted by beauty and wish I lived nearby so that I could go back to the Line, Color, and Space Exhibition before it closes on April 12. I hope to be able to see something else there later. If I have more time, I'd like to see the Outdoor Exhibition."
Small N Pricy,"Getting there is easy , just need to find a metro station and go to Art museum station but 10$ is not so cheap for such a small gallery , i can say some arts was amazing speciality if u are fan of post modern art . "
worth to visit it,there is a variety of arts performed ion there to understand the culture and arts of Korea. interesting and good spot to step in. 
"Averaged Sized, Non-Air Conditioned, Art Museum","I went through the Busan Museum of Art somewhat against my will - I have no interest in art, my wife does... Those who legitimately appreciate the paintings will probably believe a visit to be of more value than I did. The museum is not tiny but it isn't large either. I could have walked through and seen everything in well under an hour, my wife took a bit over an hour to peruse the pieces of art on display. Also, the vast majority of the museum was not free. If we had not paid the 12000 won fee to see the special exhibit we could have seen everything in 30 minutes or less. When we were there it was summer, there were a lot of people, and I could not detect any air conditioning. I stood by the open windows whenever I could but it was still stagnant and muggy. I was impressed with the gift shop which had several great gift ideas that were cheaper than I could buy online so I got some of my Christmas shopping done; at least the visit wasn't a total waste!"
too quiet,this museum of art is free admission. Setting up for upcoming event. So no much for the time i visited
relaxing space close to shinsegae,"There is so much space in the museum that allowed us to get away from crowds for an hour or so, but that also meant there is a lot of walking up and down stairs!Overall neatly presented museum that is worth going if you are in the area!"
Worth a visit if are in the neighbourhood,"This museum gives its name to the nearby (300m) subway station, so if not anything else it is easy to find on the underground network (but you still need to be careful and go out of the correct (signposted) exit. All of its various entrances seem to play a game of hide and seek with the visitor (which may have something to do with the humour of contemporary art, but I personally only found plain irritating). Once you manage to get in, in spite of the mammoth size of the building, the collection is not very large, with humongous empty spaces, which feels disturbing considering the fact that normal housing in Busan is often seriously crowded. The style of the building is very minimalistic, not to say heartless. The best feature is the café with its free hand cream samples and views of the adjoining garden. Overall I did not particularly enjoy visiting this museum and would not go back but it might still deserve a second chance if there is a specially interesting special exhibition on the time."
Brilliant!,"An excellent museum: free to enter and an extensive, varied, exhibition programme. I was impressed with range of work, all from the 21st century and from both home and abroad.The building is not a lot to look at and the ciculation spaces fail to inspire, but the exhibition spaces are large in size and in number. The size of the exhibition space worked well with works on show and i happily spent a couple of hours walking around. Outside are a collection (more of a clutter) of bronze and stone sculptures providing a hint to what might be contained within the otherwise anonymous looking building. Worth a visit but takes a while to get there."
Modern Art Museum worth a look,"We visited in September 2013 when the featured artist was Shin Sang Ho - tile work and sculptures, referencing Star Trek and called Final Frontier. Appealing and thought provoking. We also were taken with 2 large cloud paintings by Kang Un and the extensive collection of Henry Miller paintings. A very disturbing charcoal collection about forced labour camps was quite moving. The sculpture garden's giant coffee pots were striking as well. There is a nice shop and a cafe in the gallery."
Good artsy visit,"Museum is just a short walk away from the Busan Museum of Art station.Good exhibits from local artists and even got a chance to view some amazing collection from other famous artists like Warhol, Dali and many more. Its not a huge museum, so expect a good 1 hour or so.Had a choco patbingsu (redbean ice shaving topped with creamy chocolate ice cream) at the museum cafe. Big enough to share with 3 people for each dessert. Lovely end to the visit :)"
Nice art museum,The museum was closed these pass 3 weeks I was in Busan and re-opened today but I did visit last year. The museum is located close to the subway station and is about a three minute walk. I can't comment on this years exhibits but last year there were some local artist exhibits the were fascinating.
The Museum is closed till September,"Both the main collection and any special exhibitions are currently closed while they prepare the next main collection. Only two small children's art collections in the basement can be seen, and the shop and cafe are open as well. I obviously visited (or rather, tried to visit) at the wrong time and it could indeed be argued that I have NOT visited this museum, since most of it was off limits. However, based on my personal experience, I have to give it the lowest score. Front desk staff speak absolutely no English, as usual in Korea. The building was not even air-conditioned. I feel that taking all of ten days in order to prepare the collection changeover is unacceptable, and made all the worse by it happening during Busan's peak tourist season. Keeping the shop and cafe open while almost the whole museum was shut felt like a fraud attempt -basically withdrawing the free offer while continuing to try to extract money through the accessories. The staff were obviously spending day after day doing nothing on their taxpayers-funded super salary except ordering the odd visitor to stay out of the barred areas. Profoundly disappointing to say the least."
Some Creative Korean Artwork,"Several pieces by Korean artists were very creative especially the ""Felis Catus Animatus/Mus Animatus"" by by Lee Hyung-koo and ""Busan#2"" by Park Sang-ho."
Fantastic collection of local modern art,"A mid-size gallery space, with very cheap entry (free on Saturdays). Every time I've been there the exhibitions of Korean artists' work have been fantastic. Sometimes there are international exibitions too, but I tend to give those a miss. "
Nice contemporary art,"Great place to enjoy the art works and self reflect. Impressive modern art on display. Give this 1-2 hours, worth dropping by. Seeing a place's museum is a way of understanding a bit more of their culture ;)"
If you are a Museum-natic,I love museums what can I say! It's free on Saturday and its interesting to see only if you are into Arts. I spent hours there but others might just walked out within 15mins. ;)
Beautiful space,I am glad to stop by. There was free admission. I got so see some cool Korean contemporary art exhibit there. It is very accessible by subway and very spacious. Sad there were not more people there when I visited on a Thursday morning.
Not worth the effort,"I felt underwelmed by this museum. Worth visiting on a rainy day, but otherwise not worth the effort. Perhaps the museum is more impressive when it has special collections."
Interesting...,"I've been to a few modern art museums and this would be the one I would say is the most interesting.One room was just a bunch of white reindeer heads on the floor and a track playing over and over again saying 'the reindeer was hit by a car' in English and I can only assume the same in the other languages it played.I really enjoyed the news headlines/short stories of Korean history. They covered war, technology, foreigners, music, movies, and so much more"
"Check out Busan Biennale Garden of Learning which opened today. Some awesome, creative pieces.","Highlight for us was Olaf Nicolai's Innere Stimme, a sound performance performed in the library. This is one of the most powerful performances I have experienced for a long time. The effects resonated within for a long time after leaving the museum. Go along and appreciate the beauty of this performance."
Should be called Museum of Modern Art!,"This used to be called the Mueum of Modern Art and then the name was changed, resulting in temporary confusion and, even worse, now a permanent sense of disappointment for those coming here hoping to see how art in Korea has changed over time. It can be a fun place to wander around for those with no prior expectations, with plenty of space for the art in large airy rooms, and there's certainly no knowing what to expect! Just don't come here looking for art in the conventional sense ... this is strictly a museum of modern art (except for the shop dowstairs that has souvenirs depicting some of the classical works of art displayed in other galleries in other cities!)"
