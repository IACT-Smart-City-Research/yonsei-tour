Airport Shilla may be better,"If you are buying cosmetics and skincare, you are likely to get better deals at Shilla duty free, airport. Here the staff are rude and roll eyes at you if you ask for samples or gifts. There isn’t any! At the airport, with the purchase of 2 pieces of Sulwhasoo ginseng Eye cream, I got 20% off duty price plus gifts and sample sets! So hold out here unless there is additional discount on top of duty free prices. Get the vip discount card on the spot at level 11 to get 5% off. "
Remember apply membership if you are ordinary tourist,"It always have good bargain with membership. If you do not have any limited edition items to buy, please do not go in the morning, it was hectic ! Long queue at elevator no matter if go up or down."
Disgusting place with disgusting services,"This place serves nothing but grabbing money from tourists’ pocket. For popular products you have to buy a set of rubbish before you are “allowed” to buy the thing you really want, they just don’t sell their best sellers solely. There are many hidden events and discount that they never tell you until you ask for. More worse, there are many discounts that you think you are eligible for, but they have thousands of excuses to not apply them. I will NEVER visit this place again."
Department Store,Lots of options here - some very expensive concessions and others cheaper. Had some good food on the 14th floor and good value for money. Lovely clean toilets. Good to escape in here when it’s hot! 
I just bought some really nice souvenir products for my family !!,"My buddies studying in KOrea recommand me to buy some souvenir stuffs here. And I found some really nice skincare products here. These are pretty cheap and easy to bring. Anyway there were really many tourists from China and Japan wanna buy these, so i tried it too. Anyway there were really good products in this duty free shop."
Shopping,"If you wants to looking for branded bag such as Find Kapoor, this is the place. I went to this place because my cousins wants me to buy Find Kapoor Bags. It's expensive, but I didn't buy it for myself so it's interesting to be here. And you got directly tax refund in here."
Extensive Range of Products But Prices Don’t Seem Competitive,"We were staying at one of the Lotte hotels in the city and, on check in, were given a voucher for 20,000 Won to be spent at Lotte Duty Free. This peaked our interest. I don’t think we would have bothered going without the voucher, but were visiting the Lotte Tower, so decided to visit which means the promotion did it’s job I suppose!I think we were expecting a shop, not multiple floors of branded goods, laid out rather like a department store. The individual stations or mini ‘shops’ ranged from the high end - Louis Vuitton, Dior, Breitling etc to more modest brands such as Innisfree and Tony Moly.To be honest this is not the kind of outlet where a voucher for 20,000 Won is going to make much of a hole in any purchase, although with those brands with which I was familiar, there really didn’t seem to be much saving to be made.It was interesting to go, but if we had made a special trip to visit I think we would have felt very short changed."
Average expensive mall,Just another expensive shopping mall but in a great location right across the road from the Grevin Wax Museum. The other redeeming factor here is that there is a Star Avenue at one of the entrances for those into K-pop and Korean drama culture.We checked out the price of a Samsung mobile phone and the price was no cheaper and even more expensive than we can buy in places like Indonesia and Malaysia. So unless you are planning to purchase lots of designer goods or into Korean drama/k-pop culture then I don't think this mall is very interesting.
lot of products but very expensive ,"This place has lot of products, three full floors for duty free products but the things are really so expensive that I couldn’t buy anything from the store."
Nice,"It is Lotte should I say more?! It's huge, lots of brands quite helpful staff you'll love to shopping here"
Quality for the product questionable.,Seoul is really a good place for shopping. Bought a perfume in the city but collect it at the at Incheon airport. Not difficult to find the collection counter. When I arrived home and opened the perfume. The smell of the perfume was not the lasting as I tried at the duty free shop. The smell last less than half an hour.
Don't go... ,"This place is a trap, you can find much cheaper duty free else where... It has a large selection of luxury goods, but don't expect it to be cheaper than other duty free shops in Seoul... "
Discounts For All!,"If you want additional discounts while shopping at duty-free stores, let me know. Up to 20%, and additional discounts from the duty free store."
Representative,There is the beat shopping mall for tourists who want to buy some souvenir. There are many choices for us and which souvenirs all can represent Korea.
Worst shopping experience ever,"I purchased in intercontinental coex duty free when the staff never warned that the airport pick up experience was going to be a nightmare. I arrived the airport 2 hours before departure, and I reserve 30 mins to pick up but very unfortunately you need least 1 hour just to collect your purchase at gate counter.I expressed my urgency to the staff that my flight was about to take off but no staff could speak English and offer help.Ended up I failed to collect my purchase and I had to take off. And this is not only my experience but many other travelers faced the same situation.I strongly do NOT recommend buying anything in downtown duty free because the pick up experience is just the worst shopping experience on earth. "
Could spend all day here shopping...,"If you're staying close to the area and interested in some duty free shopping, it doesn't get much better than this store. It's absolutely ginormous!The lower levels are regular shopping and the upper levels are specifically designated duty free. Tons of premier European designers shops. Compared to the US, it's variable if something's cheaper or not, so you should do your research ahead of time. Same thing applies to the cosmetic department, we found that occasionally you can get the same thing for cheaper out the in the regular stores.Pick up is all done at the airport, and the pick up location varies depending on which airline you're flying out of. It's quite a busy but efficient set up, but I would still make sure you leave enough time for yourself before the flight out."
Disgusting Loccitane service,"One of the staff was very rude, pushed me away when I tried to take the products. I would not comeback again."
Luxurious shopping ,"This duty free store has many worldwide famous brands, both Korean and western. Staff spoke good English and Chinese so me and my partner were able to buy everything we needed. The only drawback is closing time at 7.30PM, but they start to refuse customers at 7.15.YSL had many things out of stock.Chanel - many things in stock but you pay first for your items and then use a receipt to collect items in the airport.3rd floor - didn't accept cash, we used wechat to pay. Bought 2 masks packages (5 masks in each), got 3rd package for free.Tiffany&Co - prices a little cheaper than in Europe. Didn't buy anything there though. Friendly staff."
Disgusting Hèrmes sales associates,"Dear shoppers of designer goods, do not go to the Hèrmes store in this department store location, absolutely terrible service on the 10th floor duty free. Walked in with my mother to inquire about a scarf and showed an image on my phone and was literally harassed by 2 sales associates yelling ""WE DON'T HAVE IT"". Then they started to proceed complaining about annoying tourists requesting for items all the time, in Korean (which they didn't know I understand). As I thanked them for their time and walked away they started to give nasty stares. I have shopped in stores around the world and never had such terrible service. Absolutely rude and disturbing. Don't waste your time and/or money here, go to another Hèrmes location in town. Snobby and rude, they make the brand look so tacky and bad, what a shame, I love this brand and it's history. "
Location location location ,"The duty free shop is located just next to the lotte hotel, on top of the lotte department store. If you need to buy some dutyfree, this is the place to go, then you don't need to rush when you are at the airport. Sometimes they have special promotion, maybe 10-20% off. The downside is there are lots of mainland Chinese tourist and they speak super loud and jump the queue. Be mindful!"
The All-in One Duty Free Supermarket,"We only went to the store on our last night in Seoul mainly because when we tried this on our second day in Seoul, they asked us to check-in our shopping bags from Daiso to their locker which is not FREE. You have to pay money to use the lockers although I am not sure if this refundable as it did not say in the instruction monitor. Anyway, on our second visit, we entered the mart form the parking area since we came from the Lotte Duty Free shop mall inside the Seoul KTX station. The second floor are basically clothing and other homestuffs. Proceed to the ground floor for the grocery stuffs and fastfoods. We have our dinner at the fastfood area within the mart. You can actually get a taste of all foods by trying all the FREE taste kiosks scattered inside. The nice thing about here is that you get an immediate tax refund for all your shopping exceeding KRW30,000. Take note that I noticed that they deducted the bottled kimchi we bought form tax deduction, so only grocery items and clothing are tax refundable. You get cash money refund even if you used your credit card for the payment.For those asking how tax refund is computed in South Korea, the VAT in Korea is 10%, you get the tax refund but 30% is retained for the service charge for the tax refund processing, so actually you are getting only 70% of the 10%. In effect, you are just getting the 7% refunded."
Crowded place with bad customer service,"Lotte duty free is packed with chinese tourist and shop attendant expects instant sales without any services rendered. If you so much as to ask any question, expect a curt single line answer from store attendant. Go to the first floor of lotte department store if you need to try on any cosmetics product, the staffs at the counter are happier to serve you and give proper recommendation. Yes you do have to do the extra step to claim your tax return, but i gladly do it for a better shopping experience. "
unexpected in season finds,"I stopped by here and Shinsegae DF to see if there were any differences in offering for some local cosmetic brands as well as European brands (Bally, Gucci, and Celine). For local brands like Innisfree, Etude, too cool for school; the promotion and prices seem to be same at both stores. However, when it comes to European brand selection Lotte wins hands down. There's more brand representation here as well as stock available. I found my amazing Celine belt bag FW 17; which means DF doesn't always have to be a year or season behind. Checking against the French website price, it certainly is DF and not marked up unreasonably here. Spend more than $1k USD and you can apply for Gold VIP membership which will entitle you to additional 10% off most products (the usual exception luxury brands excluded). Currently, those who have VISA Signature or Infinity are also eligible for an additional 5-15% off depending on the brand. Another win here.Summer promotion is going on, I would download the app as well for additional free points that can be used as credits towards purchasing the same products at slightly lower prices through the app. Only thing is that it will have to be picked up at airport but I found the entire process worth it and easy at the airport as well."
Huge shopping complex !!!,"Well it says duty free so don't think its cheap too. The place is full of all the world reknowned brands and it is as expensive in any mall . Sales make it a bit more affordable but still expensive .It's a huge place with more than 10 floors of shopping ..One floor dedicated each to shopping for men, women kids bags sports etc etc So go for designer wear shopping, enjoy and lighten your pockets !!!!"
Good Discount for local brands ,It's worth the visit if you like their local brands . Many promo and freebies instead of buying on the streets.
Amazing food court. Highlight for the foodie in me ,Wow and a must see. The food court is amazing and has everything you could ask for. It had numerous sushi offerings that I was looking for and didn't disappoint. Great service as well. Go see this spectical if you are a food lover like me. Plus the 7 floors of shops is pretty nice also. 
Good shopping place for tourists,"You can get most of the brands here, be it luxury brands or popular street store k-beauty, fashion. There are discounts and generous amount of samples/freebies given with your purchase"
Huge shopping mall,"You'll need at least 3 hours at the Lotte Duty Free. There are many levels of shops and a wide variety of food available at the food court. I tried the sweet potato latte and tiramisu at the food court and both were so good. If you have a Visa platinum card, you may sign up for their VIP card which gives you 20% discount on your purchases."
Great for cosmetics!,"This is an absolute Godsend for travelers. Instead of going to the airport early for some duty free shopping, get it done here. If you're flying out of Incheon, I highly recommend still allotting some time at the airport since it's one of the largest and consistently ranked best for activity and shopping. There are four floors for duty free shopping: 2, 9-12. Ranging from fashion, cosmetics, accessories to tobacco/alcohol. Just bring your passport! TIP: if you're shopping for cosmetics. PLEASE allow some time to browse through Myeongdong markets across the street for what you want, scope out the promotions and deals and then come here. We did the opposite and ended up realizing we could've saved some money by purchasing here. ALSO, the great thing about Korean brand cosmetics is they give you a TON of samples! My main go-to kiosks: Etude House, Missha, Amore Pacific, Clio, Nature Republic. Incredible deals and discounts. Everything is also priced in US dollars! Side note: I did find less English speaking here compared to their Myeongdong branches just across the street. So do your homework! "
Shopping,"A shopper's paradise. Many international and local brands cosmetics and luxury items. Service level could have been better, especially at the Laniege counter. Eventhough there weren't many customers, the salesgirls seem to just want to rush through your order. Not much ""expert"" advice as to what might really be good or suited to your skin type. Language was also a slight barrier as they seem to prefer to converse in mandarin instead of English."
Love this place!! ,"Ive been visiting Seoul for a few years now and always love my duty free shopping for Korean brand beauty products. For the first time in years the place was relaxed and a bit quiet - for reasons I wont go into but if you follow international current affairs you will know why inbound tourism may be down a little at the moment. As far as duty free goes this place is awesome, spread over several floors. It is very easy for a foreigner to shop here so don't be shy. There are some great priced products however because many of the brands only have a small floor space they may only carry a sub set of the products their domestics retail network carries. Further it pays to check the shops in Myeong-dong shopping precinct as sometimes the sales offers in the high street stores may be better. Today for example I bought Nature Republic products both in duty free and in one of the stores at Myeong-dong and got a better deal by doing it that way. Anyway you look at it Lotte is a fantastic experience if you love a good shop! And if you do enough of it as a foreigner you can earn further discounts. "
Expensive but great quality stuff!,Ok I agree it's a bit expensive when you enter if after passing though Myondong and the underground markets of Seoul metro but the quality of the stuff is spot on .. it's worth a visit.
Know what you want before you enter,"Extremely packed with tourist, especially for cosmetics. Know what you want to get before entering as most tourist just grab whatever the salesperson puts out. It can get rowdy. Some brands only allow you to pick it up at the airport, you'll be asked for your passport and flight details and given a receipt to pick up at the airport after immigration. "
Probably the best duty free shopping in Korea,"Lotte Duty Free in Myeongdong in Seoul is considered the best and the biggest. It gets super busy during peak times (late afternoon). It has at least 3 floors (8,9,10th floors? I think) of shops and global brands. Floor 1 to 7th are regular department shops with similar brands. You can get tax free claims on lower levels but my experience is that Duty Free shops are better priced than regular department stores below even with VAT credit. Just double check the prices. If you are taking taxi from another location, you can just say ""Lotte Baek-Ga-Jum"" which basically translates to Lotte Department store. Every taxi driver knows this place. Duty Free is in the same building as ""Lotte Department Store"" and connected to ""Lotte Hotel"" so if the first one don't work, you can just say ""Lotte Hotel Myeongdong"" and every taxi driver will know this place as well as it's a 5 star hotel and pretty popular hotel. Almost every sales associates in Duty Free speaks Chinese which is good for Chinese tourists. English speakers are available but not that many but they know enough to help you. You need your passport and your printed (have a printed version!) itinerary. You should be traveling within 1 month to buy at Duty Free shops (double check but I just found out today). Sometimes each shop may have specials on additional discounts if you use certain credit cards such as Visa or Mastercards. ALWAYS ask if there's any DISCOUNTS! It's always not posted if there's any discounts, so don't be shameful if you ask and your pride gets hurt if they says no. It don't hurt to ask. :)"
Not cheap,Prices here are rather expensive but items here are mainly branded and targeted towards tourists. There is a supermarket below where locals will shop. Outside at level 1 there is a place of korean stars hand prints.
NO GOOD DEALS HERE,"Don't get sucked in. The prices here are not cheap. Huge and fancy store, but not good deals. Maybe you need to negotiate...not sure about that."
Don't go to this DFS,"This place is packed with China tourists. Every single Brand counter is flooded with tourists shouting and demanding attention from the counter girl.I can feel that the promoters are frustrated and annoyed most of the time. Don't let them treat you this way unless of course you are China tourists... then this place is for you. They speak Chinese all of them.Otherwise go other dfs like Donghwa, Doota...They have all the Brand there and of the SAME PRICE! It is not true that the price is cheaper in Lotte than other... No! I learned my mistakes! I was very very regretted to go Lotte dfs!I wanted to get refund and return all the things I bought there. But again you cannot do that... once bought no refund unless damaged goods and only exchange."
dutyfree downtown shopping with helpful staff,"at the main entrance,there is information counter with helpful staff taking care me and other customers. Inside the store ,there is 3 -4 floors with variety of products and sale agents helping you to make your choice of cheapest dutyfree shopping,esp. korean made brand,like sulwhasoo. it's very exciting ,if you come at period that you get special deal or discount.process for picking up the merchandises at the airport is also very quick and easy."
K-pop street,"Lotte duty free main store ,the middle of city in Seoul, south korea . The biggest store for lotte duty free and the special thing is star avenue . "
"Better for big ticket items (luxury brands, especially Korean cosmetics) and bulk buying","Come with a list of items you want to buy (better value for History of Whoo, Sulwahsoo than retail stores) - note that payment is in USD - check for credit card discounts and free gifts. Most items are bundled for bulk sale. Tourists shopping here are mostly from mainland China so Mandarin is spoken by all sales staff ( same situation everywhere you shop in Myeongdong). If buying Korean cosmetics, better to go to Myeongdong shopping street where you can find all the brands within walking distance of one another and due to fierce competition - get better service and can buy in smaller quantity ( nowadays they only give you free samples after you make purchases). Although I find shopping at Garosugil a much better experience ( hardly any crowds on a weekday afternoon) and there is a history of Whoo standalone store where you can make payment in KRW ( but price at Lotte in USD still cheaper)."
BUSY....try to go to other locations.,"This is an extremely busy place with tons of foreigners battling for cosmetics. If you’re able to, I’d recommend going to other duty free locations such as CoEX for a less busy, better shopping experience. I’m greatful that I picked up most of my must buy duty free items at the CoEX location or else I would have killed someone at the Myeongdong location. They offer discounts if you use your VISA and additional discount if you have a VISA infinite card. Discounts vary depending on the brand 5-15%. Also, don’t forget to redeem your free gift at the counter by presenting your receipts. For some reason, every Lotte duty free has different promotions and offers. For example, a lot of the items sold at the Myeongdong and COEX locations require you to buy in bulk whereas the Busan Lotte Duty free allowed me to buy single items. Wish I had known this in advance, as I missed out on a lot of purchases since I didn’t need 3 of each item. Korean cosmetics here are definitely cheaper than the stores, however, be ready for the crowds. Compiling a list prior will help with the shopping process to get you in and out."
Mr,Shore located at level 9 to 11 and Opened at 9:30 am. But it is a bit hard to locate the entrance before 10:30am until the main gate is open. Plenty choices and reasonable price. Very crowded. 
Go if you don't mind the large crowds,"I mainly visited the cosmetics department. You will get good deals here especially the Korean brands such as Laniege and Sulwasoo but be prepared to brave the chaotic crowd. It's noisy, very crowded and the sales staff look hassled and unhappy. They aren't likely to give you individual attention and explain their products to you. I prefer buying from the regular stores and take the trouble for tax refund. The Sales staff are more likely to give you attention and give you more freebies. By the way for non Korean brands you pay for the products first and they will send it to the airport for you. Bring along your passport and proof of your e-ticket ( plane ticket)."
Chaotic,"Prices are way cheaper here, but this duty free is really the most chaotic shopping center I've been in South Korea. Recommend to go early in the day, as it gets really really crowded in the afternoon & night ~ the wait for the elevator takes so long."
Overhyped and overcrowded,"The duty free floors in the Lotte Main Store as when as the Jamsil branch is packed with mainly Asian tourists at all hours. Shopping here is a noisy and rushed affair, and sales staff are cursory at best when attending to queries. The variety of goods is also limited to past models in many of the stores (including timepieces).Claiming tax rebate is easy in Korea, so those seeking a more pleasant shopping experience may want to look elsewhere."
Bad customer service,"This place is way too crowded. I felt that the workers did not want to help me, and judged me from the beginning (maybe cause i looked like i didn't have any money? I don't know). I wanted to buy some cosmetics during my stay in korea. I did a lot of research in the skincare product line that I wanted to purchase. I made the trek all the way to lotte duty free and asked the worker for help in selecting the product. She said the products are not for my skin type and ran away to cater to a Chinese customer. They are in a rush and probably did not want to answer my question or help me with the purchase. Never coming back here again as I think I might get run over by people."
Crowded and average at best,"Just came back from the Lotte DF. As many have said, it is crowded. The price tags are in USD and the sales girl will quote the conversion price in RMB assuming all Chinese descent are from China. One can't help but get the impression that unless you buy in bulk or have a bottomless pit as a wallet, you will not get much attention. Clearly this DF is meant for Chinese tourists primarily. Are things cheaper there? Not really. The prices in Myeongdong is comparable to what's on sale there and the atmosphere in the former is more authentic in the Korean spirit.Although there are many brands there, the brand itself doesn't carry much variety.Well, do carry a Visa card. You may get an additional 5-15% discount. Not sure how they calculate which card is entitled to the amount of discount but I get 10% with mine."
Duty Free Shopping in Seoul City Center,"This occupies the TOP 3 floors (8-10) of the Lotte departmental store next to Lotte Hotel in Euljiro (1) area. Branded stuff at duty free prices, with certain items even cheaper than airport DFS prices."
Unpleasant experience ,"Been there first time and will not go back again. This place is crowded with Chinese tourists competing buying all over the place. You never have a peace of mind finding your right luxury products as they look hurry and not respect the queuing. Moreover, the signages look very confusing. It took time for me to follow the signage for the elevators as found out it was not there as it said (we thought perhaps it was a fake signage to guide you walk all around with some shopping potential)."
Sardines.,"We came here around mid-day to pick up some things from the DF beauty department on the top floor. It was so full and busy, it was borderline impossible to move from one counter to the next for brands such as Sulwahsoo, History of Whoo, Hera etc. The queue for service was at least 15 minutes, the wait for payment was 20-30minutes. Thankfully the Belif counter was quieter and we were able to leave there."
Not sure whether I'm at Korea or China ....,"This place is full of China tourists ... And the sales person will actually tell you the price in RMB and assume you're from China if you look like a Chinese. The place is very busy and packed which will make you kind of frustrated because it will be damn hard for you to walk around unless you wanna push your way through the people . It is only worth your visit if you plan to buy your Korean skincare & cosmetics in bulk . If not, please go to those stores at MyeongDong, some of those shops will have promotions and it will even be cheaper than Lotte Duty Free . The shops at MyeongDong street will even give you free samples and masks generously !"
Save your money and shop elsewhere,"While the duty free at Lotte is nicer than the airport with a rather huge inventory and a myriad of different stores, the prices are better at the airport. I didn’t find things to be cheaper at all and found much better prices at Myeongdong even while paying taxes. My wife wanted to compare the prices of sunglasses and cosmetics because she had just recently purchased many of these items as the quality is far superior than those of Chinese products (we live in Beijing). I told her no to do that as she would be sad disheartened had she found out she had paid more for the same items. She walked away from the Lotte Duty Free quite content because she did not overspend on her items compared to the same items at Lotte Duty Free."
Busy shopping place,"If you 've plans to do huge shopping, this place is worth it, since its duty free and also slightly low priced than in store. Remember to bring your passport, return ticket to get the tax refund and discounts. You can find luxury brands to mid range brands here. Also cosmetic floor has Koreas most famous brands like Sulwhasoo, Whoo, Hera, iope, Innisfree, Tony Moly, Nature Republic, Holika Holika, Etude house, The Skin Food, Etc."
Don't bother unless you like to push,"Was really excited to go visit the Lotte DFS at Myeongdong until I saw what was infront of me the moment the lift door opens.Full of Chinese tourists, some of them even brought their trolley with them as they go around buying the stocks in bulk. I was already perspiring in 20mins trying to move amongst the crowd. There's totally no space for you to view the products as the other Chinese tourists are standing there hogging the area.Service staff are overworked and seemed exhausted, but some are just plain rude.I asked for the price of one of their item (at Banila Co.), the salesgirl didn't even bother lifting her head up, and just quote me a number while still looking at her own clipboard. The number felt wrong so I asked her is it in KRW? She just said its in RMB (Chinese currency)! I couldn't believe it. Am I in China or Korea? The place seems to cater to the Mainland tourists I guess. I would suggest you to just buy from the retail shops in Myeongdong if you're not buying in big amount, as the tax is really not much of a difference (2000W for receipt of above 50,000W? The way they calculate differs for each brand)Or you can just claim your taxes at the airport (though it's recommended to be at the airport 1hour earlier than the time you planned to reach the airport)Alternatively, you can make a trip to Donghwa DFS, about 20 mins walk from Lotte DFS (or you can take the metro). The place is alot more empty and you can shop peacefully without being pushed around by the Chinese tourists. The service staff had a more mixture of Koreans/Japanese (who could speak Mandarin/some English) than China staff, so the service is really alot better there.When I brought my Mom and brother to Donghwa DFS, both sighed in relief to be able to shop peacefully as they also had a headache at Lotte and gave up after 10 mins.Really, don't ruin your holiday mood."
Forget about it,"If you have hours to spend for lineup, then you will like this place since it has so many brands to shop till dead, esp on Korean cosmetic. I would prefer dutyfree shop downtown than the airport. All you need is your passport and the details of your return flights (date, time and flight number)But the lineup for payment is unbearable esp with hundreds *literally* of Chinese tourists. Fortunately, they are not rude, quite ok as they do line up. No Korean language is needed for the good part, like most tourist places in Korea. If you speak Chinese, you are good. English, not easy to get around, this place is ok though. I would suggest you go to the other dutyfree shop at Guannam, next to CoEx, no lineup at all, more comfortable and not crowded, offer the same numbers of counters and 10 times fewer people."
"Lotte departmental store , myeongdong ","Went to the store to pickup the whoo range of creams. The counter staff was disinterested to explain anything .the focus as expected to service the tourists from the mainland .The prices at the incheon airport are cheaper than at the lotte departmental store , so pickup your stuff from the airport ."
Nice and helpfull staff,We have been in lotte duty free shop at coex and at the 7th floor in avenuel. And they are very accomodating.. They even offer us and give suggestion on what to buy.. Especially the branch manager of prada duty free in coex mall he even gave my youngest daughter some give away for kids and also thanks for your assistance and your jokes...
Shopping Place,"Very crowded!!The Main Store of Lotte Duty Free is proud of more than 30 boutiques and a wide collection of products, which are just convenient stores that meet various needs of customers."
Shopper's Dream Come True,"Lotte is a destination department store. This store defines the word ""selection"". There is so much to see. A shopper would enjoy the experience. I especially like the ""duty-free"" selection, especially the duty-free cosmetics floor. The only draw back on the cosmetics floor is that you have to fight the long lines at point of sale."
Don't miss this place for shopping,Fantastic three floors of duty free within a large department store. Exceptional prices especially on luxury goods. Crowded but manageable. Great special offers for tourists if you spend a large amount. 
Not a big mall,"It had several floors though. Popular Korean brands were there, and boy the lines were long. Very crowded."
Discrimination on nationality for discounts,"Noticed that Lotte Duty Free has been doing different promotion for different nationality e.g. Japanese, mainland Chinese but not apply to others even if spend the same amount in the store; and last weekend when I tried to use a designated credit card (Bank of China Visa) to get coupon according to their ads, their customer service responded by saying even if my credit card is right, but since I am holding a Canadian passport, not a HK SAR passport, I could not get the coupons.I can understand if promotion for different credit cards, but Lotte Duty Free should not discriminate based on nationality. This is very ridiculous management in a developed country like Korea. What a shame!"
Know What You Want To Buy Before Going...,"Quite a lot of brands available there. Sales staff can converse in Mandarin, but attitude is rather bad, possibly due to the hard work they must endure day in day out.Been here on 2 different occasions, both times flooded with mainland Chinese pushing, shoving, talking loudly (or rather, shouting), and queue-cutting (they are quite well known for that).My advice: know what you wanna buy, get in, buy, get out."
Do not visit this store Duty Free Department,"The experience is so bad that I am not going back any more. I went over to shinsegae and got my Korean brand. Cosmetics instead. Why is this so bad ? It is a china mass market ! Chinese are flooding buying bulk packs. Queue are long, boxes stacked all over, noisy and the staff are burnet out. Noise, queue and it just like war is going on and not civilized culture. This is defining not up market in feeling and ambiance I don't even feel like stepping into the boutiques at that floor. . Safety is also a concern. Don't expect service level to be good. I strongly suggest Lotte take a serious look at its whole duty free concept for the china buyers versus the foreign tourist and make improvement in overall retail experience. "
Bad attitude,"Try to enquire about Laneige products but come across a staff which is busy with her stuff and don't even bother to look up at us. When we ask her about 1 particular product, she just answer ""don't have"" without any eye contact. We realised that many of the Korean sales staff do not have any good customer service. "
Put on your shopping gear!,"Head to the top few floors for duty-free shopping, look for the signage. Be prepared for queues at cashiers and renowned brands at cosmetic counter and do remember to ask for tax refund when making payment. Visa credit cards entitle additional 5% discount, not sure when will this promo last though."
Get ready your shopping list,"I only bought things from the cosmetics level so can only comment on this area. The prices of the products is the best draw for this place, for it is DFS after all. Be prepared to fight through the crowds and crowds of tourist from China. Do your homework beforehand, know what you wanna buy and check the prices of the items (if possible) before entering this DFS. I would suggest getting the mid-range and higher-end products here as the price difference is much more significant.Most of the staff speak both Korean and Mandarin and will get you all your items or write your items on a checklist and pass to the counter thus saving you loads of time. That said, you need to get the staff's attention first, which is already pretty difficult. Anyway, it would be good if you know the name of the products in either of these languages, else you will be squeezing through the hordes of tourist from China to get the products yourselves. Do be alert and ultra thick-skinned for some people may jump queue and you might end up waiting in line, like forever."
Good buys but crowded!,I've been there several times and it is really great to buy Korean make up and face products/masks etc. It is usually (the times I've been there) super crowded though with large groups of Chinese tourists. Go there prepared for the crowds and lines! 
Duty free,"The duty free shop is on the 9th, 10th and 11th. Go visit them, purchase, show them your passport. And you get the Duty Free items after you clear the customs at the Airport. Easy peachy. "
Decide on your shopping list before going there,"If you plan to buy cosmetic products (especially premium ones) in Seoul, this is the place to go. It is extremely crowded with tourists from mainland China, so the place is crowded, noisy and stuffy. It is not the place where you can test the cosmetic products in a relaxing way. The main attractive point about this place is of course the price. For premium brands such as Sulwhasoo, the price is definitely lower than their counters in department stores. But if you plan to buy the cheaper brands which many of them have their own shops in Myeongdong, you can check the price in Myeongdong before going to Duty Free, because often they have promotions in Myeongdong and the price can be cheaper than in Duty Free.If you plan to buy popular brands such as Sulwhasoo, be prepared that it will take you a long time to queue up to pay. ( I queued for more than half an hour)"
Lovely on the wallet but very crowded,"This is the place to get all your beauty products. Laneige, Face Shop, Nature Republic, Sulwhasoo, SkinFood, Innisfree, even international brands that you see in the airports like Estee Lauder, Laura Mercier, Benefit, Chanel etc.For Korean skincare lovers, you should stock up as much as you can here. Local products + tax free, it is really worth it and cheaper than what you get off gmarket. Be prepared to slot in an hour at least for shopping though, because it is very chaotic with a lot of tourists crowding around and queuing for payment."
Ａｎｏｔｈｅｒ　ｓｈｏｐｐｉｎｇ　ａｒｅａ,"Get all your food products, kimchi, Ginseng, Seaweed, Ttokboki and tidbits here!It opens at 10.30am but there＇s always a queue waiting outside before the mall opens"
"Crazy crowds, not a place to hang around","Located on 9F to 11F in the Lotte Department Store. Chaotic. Crazy crowds. Lots of Mainland Chinese visitors purchasing items in bulk. They are very pushy and may jump queue. Not a place to hang around to try and test products and ask questions. Best way to brace the crowds is to have a targeted shopping list, stick to it, ask the sales assistants to pick it up for you, pay and move on to the next counter etc. Do note that many items are sold in bulk, especially the cheaper brands and cheaper items (like cleansers, masks, hand cream), however, this is not an issue with the high end brands like Laneige, Sulwhasoo, Amore Pacific. Only the popular items are available as each brand carry limited items. This place is good for the cheap prices and the freebies. If you want a more pleasant shopping experience, go to the actual retail outlets at Myeongdong just across the street. I also much prefer the Lotte Duty Free branch at Coex (below InterContinental Coex) as the crowds are lesser and the staff slightly friendlier and will only come to this branch if it's a brand not available there."
"good but chaotic, go without the kids!","all the cosmetics brands that you can possibly think of are here, so it's good because it's a one-stop convenient store. however it is very very crowded. people squeeze and push to get the sales person's attention, some shout and scream to get their friends to join the Q, babies sit in strollers and cry their hearts out, plus the place is rather warm and lacks proper ventilation ... in other words, it is chaotic! at least when i was there. i'm so glad i left the kids with their dad in the hotel and went alone!my advice is, do your research and know exactly what you want to buy. go to the counter, pick what you need and Q to pay. stay focus, this is NOT a place to browse and try the various products cos' the sales person are really too busy to answer your questions properly. this is especially the case for popular brands such as laneige, innisfree and faceshop."
Great place for shopping,The Duty Free Shops from 9F to 11F. So many people（mainly Chinese Travel Groups) in 9F(Cosmetic products). 10F & 11F for luxury brands. Most of staff can speak some Chinese. Customer place the orders there and pick up the products via the windows of LOTTE at the airports (Incheon & Gimpo) before they depart. They don't need to carry the shopping bags to next place. This is a very smart sales model in Asia and accepted by most of people. Also there is a supermarket/food mart on basement besides food court area.
Bad experience on Credit Card Billing & VISA Discount,"I visited to Lotte Duty Free at Myeongdong during my recent trip to Seoul. I had charged more than 1000USD in SGD offered by the counter staff. I was told billing credit card in my own currency was better. BUT it's NOT. Charging in USD is cheaper than in SG!!! The rate before bank cross border charge of 0.8% was already high at 1USD = 1.287SGD. Plus the 0.8% , the rate had become even higher 1.297.If I would to charge in USD, the rate would be 1.279, as reflected in my credit card bill.PLEASE TAKE NOTE!!! DO NOT CHARGE IN YOUR OWN CURRENCY !!! The VISA card discount 5-15% offered by Lotte is different from staff to staff. One offered 5% another offered 10% from same store. I have tried number of stores. Either they are not trained to identify Platinum/Ultimate card or they just don't want to offer discount to you. You have to explain and reason with them with the discount ads shown at counter. End up only buy from store with discount. Try your luck!!"
expired cosmetic products!,"Be careful buying cosmetic and facial products at this duty free shop. And also at other duty free shop in seoul. Most of them selling the expired products, especially the discounted price. Watch out!"
Great bargains...,"There are two whole floors for duty free purchases, we got some fantastic bargains. The Lotte store is a great place to go when the sales are on, we were there in December "
Great place to get your duty free branded items in the middle of the city!,"Love this one stop shopping place to get branded luxury items. I came here twice before because of its convenient location at the Myeong-Dong area which is also the main shopping area in Seoul. It has a Prada, Chanel and Dior shop in here amongst other brands to keep me happy. There's quite a lot of cosmetic brands too. Shopping is a breeze. Just pay and get your transaction slips and collect at the airport later. They will give you instructions exactly which counter to collect from. Only downside is make sure they print your name in the slip correctly as per your passport. Otherwise, you will have a problem collecting later. I once spotted errors and the rest of the slips follow. Had to trace back to have them re-write all over again."
"Buy your seaweed and snacks here, especially if you are out of time.",One doesn't really need to spend time finding seaweed and snacks from local shops as you have a pretty good selection and variety from the Lotte Duty Free shop. Cosmetics and facial products are quite abundant too.
