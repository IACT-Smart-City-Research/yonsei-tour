Straw House?,Nice house in this village. photo stop place. Go there for the scenary . I think there are still people living in those houses.
lovely walk,"really busy as long holiday weekend, but the houses are all boutique restaurants and souvenir shops so really quaint. Had cockels in one of the restaurants...superb!"
A living museum,"Naganeupseong Folk village is an UNESCO world heritage site, established in late 10th. century with the Confucian ideology of living in harmony with nature. Even today time stands still here. There are about 280 people lives here and maintaining their old culture, a must see place if you are happens to be in Suncheon ( South Korea ) . . . . ."
Awesome Traditional “rural” Hanok,"This traditional village (hanok) was great. It was fascinating to walk through. Best if you speak/read/understand some Korean, but you can get by with English. Not only did they have mannequins and setups with the houses, they had live actors. There was a Lady playing drums and a calligraphy Master. He performed traditional dances and instruments as well. There was a flute maker who was also giving lessons. They had traditional games in the open square and people were flying kites. Very interactive. The fortress wall was also quite impressive. A good hike if you’re up for it. We went in late October, so we also got to see beautiful fall foliage. Worth a visit to see traditional rural style living, especially if you're nearby anyways. This hanok shows the more rural, middle/lower class historical way of life. If you’re interested in the higher class, aristocratic style of historic life, this is not it. Head to the Jeonju Hanok for that."
Really great cultural site,"The fortress wall around the traditional village and homes is beautiful and worth a visit just to wander around. The different informational stops inside the village are fairly well done but only offer basic information (which is just fine for the average tourist). Overall, worth a visit if you are in the Suncheon area."
Cultural Village in the fortress,"Old village in a fortress. One of few well-preserved old villages in Korea. Even though people living inside don't follow old lifestyle(I mean hundred years ago), this is nice place to feel old atmosphere.Must-see place in Suncheon and I recommend.- Location: About an hour by bus from city center of Sunchon. The bus stops at the entrance of Nagan Eupseong.- Available with 2-day attraction pass of Sunchon. Or just buy the ticket for this only. Seniors with 65+ are free.- Speaking of eating, places inside are cafes and old pubs. Good restaurants are locating outside the gates. It's not strict about entering and escaping in a day. Just hold the ticket, eat outside and enter again.- Since there are only Korean minbak(homestay) pages on the web, it's really hard for foreigners to book in advance. But, I recommend to stay for at least one night in the village anyway. It's really calm before 10 am and 6 pm because most tourists visit for a day trip. Having one room is mostly 50,000 won per night and it's a modern facility inside.- There are various activities and events. Enjoying together rather than visiting solo will be much more fun.- Southwest end of the fortress is the view point. I guess it'll be crowded with photographers during the best season.- Ogongchi Observatory is 5 stops away from the village and is a place to watch from higher area. But, the village is so small from there and hard to identify during bad weather."
Really beautiful and authentic,"It was a long taxi ride away from the city center (Suncheon Station), especially as the roads were frozen. However, the view was worth the ride! It was a very quaint and quiet little village, perhaps we reached too early (we reached at about 9:30am!), perhaps the weather was too cold, there were hardly anyone around. Shops were closed and there were no performances, but it was so lovely to be walking around the place. It gives off a completely different vibe from the bustling streets of the city. I absolutely loved the place! "
Authentic working farming village ,"It was great to see a real working village where the old world is kept alive in a modern day. Many things to see like fortress walls that you can walk on and see the view, shrines, prison and homes with thatched roofs."
A must-see,There are still living 200 people here. It is definitely worth a visit. You can walk on the wall to have a good overview of the village.
Favourite traditional village in Korea,Most definitely worth a visit. Excellent trip to see a traditional village that is still used today.
Very traditional village with about 200 people living in it. True heritage coming to life,"This was a pleasant surprise. I was expecting a mockup of a village all recreated but this is the real McCoy..... It's mainly old people living here working hard to keep many traditions alive. Thatched roofs and small village houses and gardens are full of character.It's almost like a living museum (yes they do have power and modern toilets available), but it's all been incorporated in a very sympathetic manner.There were some working demonstrations of thrashing etc and the opportunity to try and imagine what life must be like eking out a living here.Do take the time to walk around the walls as it gives a great insight of what going on below.All the residents seemed genuinely friendly. (We had a private guide which helped us tremendously).Fruit and veg for sale just outside the village along with restaurants and coffee shops.A very worthwhile visit. "
Traditional world heritage,"Spent much of the day (arrive early and have the place to yoursef, crowds grow rapidly, especially around holidays) and you will heve much of the place to yourself. This is cultural Korean heritage that is treditional, abd alive. People still live and work here, but other parts have blossomed into an area of education and display of Korea of the past (and in some part the present)). Can get there by car, train and bus."
Better to avoid long holiday in Korea ,"It's crowded during chuseok festival, so there were so many Koreans. Took us half hr from the train station to the village by taxi, cost was about 28000won. There were some traditional shows, and inside there's a shop to rent hanbok, 15000won for one hr. Anyway, it's a good experience, you just have to avoid their long holiday."
The highlight of our trip to Suncheon,"The folk village gave us a glimpse of traditional living in Korea many centuries ago. We had a leisurely stroll to see the walls surrounding the village, the little fields of flowers and ponds, the huts where the people used to stay and their way of life. There are also a few free museums and a square where traditional games are available for you to play. We had a lot of fun here. There are not a lot of tourists here as the patrons are mainly locals."
Truly authentic and traditional Korean village !,We have visited this site last year end of November. This place is recommended place to visit if you are in Suncheon area. Get to the wall that surrounds the village from the north and you have spectacular views of the mountains and the village.
"Forget Jeonju, cone here instead!","Definitely worth the effort to visit. As we were pressed for time we took a taxi from Suncheon (₩28,000) but the return bus home took 35 mins (₩1,350). We arrived at the village at 9.30 and pretty much had the place to ourselves. Its really quite and beautiful with the mountains in the background, although it is slightly touristy, people actually do work and live here. Suncheon station has a tourist info inside the building with a map and bus timetable, so does the tourist info just before the entrance to village after the ticket booth."
Heritage mirror,Village was main planned town established during Chosun dynasty approximately 600 years agoThe village well preserves natural resources including ancient trees & traditional folk heritage items There are still 98 household having a population of 228In 2011 was listed as UNESCO world heritage cultural site 
A great escape,This little tranqil gem is 40 mins outside of Suncheon. Its beautiful anytime of year but in my experience fall is its peak beauty time. Wonder the streets of the village while taking in some traditional culture. One of my favorite spots. 
good place for 1day trip,"This place is really traditional, and well reserved place with beautiful mountian, and You can try many traditional korean foods. "
Far away from Seoul but worth it,It was a long way to go to Nagan Eupseong Folk Village from Seoul. We took a train then bus but it was worth it.Weather was not so friendly when we arrived as it was pouring but we just continued walk around this place.If you like Historical Korean Drama then this Folk Village is a must to visit. I enjoyed walking around the village and experienced a local bimbibab. It was clean and enjoyable walk. The Staff in the locket was helpful when we took a wrong side on the way back to Seoul. We waited quite long time for the bus to the station. Love to go back there again one day. Beautiful place to visit. 
good feel for historic korean village life,"worth the trip, good food on site, most of the people working there were very friendly and were eager to show you their crafts"
Folklore and historical stories,"We did enjoy visiting this place , since there is more attractions offered when we were there. Besides it is the shooting location for very famous serial film Korean .The places is more artistic with all the houses have roof made from dried ilalang like in Balinese traditional house. It is worth it to visit compared the Hankok village. "
Nice few hours walk about,We took a cab from our hotel to here approx. $20. Great place to visit.Very interesting. Some nice little restaurants outside too.
A UNESCO World Heritage site since 2011,"This village is home to two hundred Koreans who still live out their daily lives much the same as Koreans did during the height of the Joseon Dynasty. Although the site of the village has actually been inhabited since the beginning of the first millennia, the area was selected as a fortress village in the early 10th century by the Goryeo Dynasty but bean to flourish in the late 1300s under the Joseons."
"For history buffs, one of the most authentic and traditional fortress village left in Korea!",This village is huge with about 85 households left staying there. Traditional built houses can been seen with fortress walls around it. Not only is it rich in history but very well preserved. Worth a visit definitely.
昔の世界に戻るみたい。,"Here you can saw what is the living in the past of south area of Korea. is my first time to saw pumpkin on the roof. When you come here, you will feel time is slow compare you in town. there are guesthouse, restaurant here. For vegan, you still able to enjoy bibimpap 7000won if not mistaken, here. i do recommend come in early morning to take nice picture. i came here on noon ."
Best Folk village in Korea,"The folk village was huge and spanned a history of 700 years. About 100 families still reside in the traditional houses, going about their daily lives with tourists milling around. It was a village of traditional huts with roofs made out of straw framed by an imposing fortress wall built to fend off intruders in the past.You can find out more at honjatravel.wordpress.com!"
Very nice but...,"I've seen too many Korean folk villages. This may be one of the best, but don't OD on these places. It was raining when we went and that didn't help."
A Unique Korean Experience,"I thought that it would be difficult to get to this village by public transportation but it was actually a very smooth trip! I took bus #63 from Chung Am Dae Hak (which is close to Suncheon Bay Park) and it took about 30 mins, plus you get a scenic view of the countryside. There are restaurants right across the bus stop when you get off, but I suggest you wait until you go inside the village for some great bibimbap (7000KRW) and pajeon. It took around 2.5 hours for me to explore the whole village, as well as climb the wall that surrounds it. You get an amazing view of the straw-roofed houses if you climb the left wall at the very end of the village. I loved how the residents of the village invite you to explore their houses and have different activities (dyeing cloth, live folk music, calligraphy, wearing Hanbok (traditional dresses), etc).The only slight problem I encountered was taking the bus back to Suncheon. The bus does not run frequently and I didn't know that the bus comes at 6PM (I started waiting at around 4:30PM), so I waited for approximately an hour and half. I was the only one waiting until about 5:45PM when people started lining up. So remember to plan accordingly!Overall, it was a truly great experience and I have never seen anything like this village. It was also my first solo day trip in Korea, so I was in high-spirits!"
Better than Jeonju but still a zoo,"Early in the morning this fortress/village is relatively quiet. As day gets older, it becomes more and more like a zoo. It is NOT a real village at all. Everything is organized and fake. Every person who lives there is employed by the state/city and is wearing appropriate period costume. It is like Colonial Williamsburg in the USA except we do not try to pretend that Williamsburg is real. By mid day every street gets filled with school students and bus loads of domestic tourists. No more quiet. Take a bus from the train station or bus station. There are 3 different bus numbers that go there. You do pay an entrance fee and honestly, it is not worth it."
Not Your Typical Folk Village,"Very nice people working there who were very nice to our son. Beautiful village, well worth a one night stay (not longer) at one of the ""minbak"" places in the cillage."
Still reside traditional village,"Unlike Hanok houses with tiled roofs,here are straw-roof houses, and still dozens of families live there, very nice attraction with old traditional houses, with verandas ,kitchens ,various carved wooden folk imagery."
Alive Folk Town Village,I love it so much because it was really interesting. There were games to play and old houses to see that actual people are still living there and they were welcoming tourists to the place. and you can do stuff that people did many years ago like dying clothes We spent about 2 hours there which was enough for us to explore the whole place.
Great little village with houses that have straw roofs.,"It was a great visit to this folk village. There were many people there and I can see why. People still live in the straw-roofed houses though there are also shops where you can buy souvenirs, and my husband bought a nice sturdy mug made from bamboo. All around the village there is a high path made of stacked stones and rocks, which I thought was very unique. It is easy to imagine how people in the olden days lived here. You can also see some plants being cultivated in the backyards of some of the houses, and it is amazing to see people still living there today. "
Really interesting,"This place was really cool, and we loved the visit. A photographer dream really. Unfortunately we got here later then planed and only had an hour to explore, I would recommend 2hrs minimum, because we probably saw less then 50% of the place.Also it's quite far from the city and might be difficult to reach by public transportation. But well worth it."
Good stopover for a historical walk,It is a good place to learn about older folks living style. The architecture is special and we had a nice walk during the winter.You will need to spend an average 2-2.5 hrs walk for the whole village. Slowly walk around and you'll enjoy the view. Some old folks are still staying here...thus you can get to know their living style as well.We drove from busan to here and not hard to find this place with the help of waze.
Different type of fortress. ,"Different type of fortress. Generally fortress is located on the mountain in Korea. On the other hand, this is located in village. Actually village is inside fortress. Therefore, this is a different type of fortress. Merits: - We can source more food. - Civilions can support soldiers. - Soldiers can protect their family closrly. Enjoy: - traditional vehicle Dalguji (on weekends). Depends on weather conditions. - Performance - traditional buildings. "
Interesting 2-hour visit near Suncheon...,"I visited this old fortress village in an organized trip from Gwangju, with a further stop and dinner in Suncheon. I think it's worth the visit to see a bit of Korean history in a rural environment. The wholevillage is like a museum. There are a few colorful temples, some of them reconstructed, a beautiful Wall around the village (with nice views of the rice fields from the highest point), and it is quite interesting to see the people still living in the very old straw-roofed houses which lie inside and outside the walls. It is a touristic place, so you will see some souvenirs posts, and other posts selling locally grown godos, such us beans, tea, plants, ... I found both, healthy and delicious, the dried pumpkin strips....About 2 hours should be ok for this visit."
A beautiful village,"It is a lively village, since it is still occupied by villagers, I think that's what make it more unique. Surrounded by fields and mountains, no matter from which angle you look, it is really superb and picturesque."
My adventure,Really enjoyed this place spent 4 hours therereally impress the weather was beautiful i stop and had kimche and rice wine simply beautiful
"Peaceful and pictureque village, but would be more interesting with festival going on","I came here on a rainy day and though there seems to be no activities going on, it was calm and peaceful to be in a old village deep in the suburbs. Bus trip was a challenge, I took 68 from the bus stop right in front of the train station and it was really crowded with the elderly people with large bags of stuff from the market. There are mostly old people staying in the fortress village and i saw the person making clay bowls. The view from the walking on top of the fortress wall is nice especially in the early morning light. I stayed in a minbak overnight in the village and it was simple but with modern restroom and heated flooring inside. I am sure it would be even more interesting with the festival going on."
A quaint Folk Village near Suncheon!,"I've actually been here a few times, as it's near my home and a great place to take visitors. There's always some kind of performance or reenactment, and the performers are generally friendly and photo-ready! It's bright, well-kept and a nice way to preserve culture and tradition as South Korea, even this rural area, keeps on developing! There is food and snacks on sight, with more options just across!Don't forget your camera!!"
How people used to live,"Man settled down at the spot as early as 5th century (I hope my memory is correct). And it has been a rural village ever since. Looks very much like the folk village in Yongin but unlike the folk village, this is where people actually lived. There are still some families living there and you can't walk into those houses. Most of those houses are b&b so if you want to stay in the village during the night time, you can have a go.I think staying there for a night could be quite an experience.The place is well known for Pansori art (traditional musical monodrama) and one of the famous performer actually lived in the village and taught his protoges.Having said that, people working at the office are not very friendly and the sign posts say that they have guided tours for free, but when I asked for one, the guide manager (pretty old man) refused because there weren't enough people. (This never happens at palaces in Seoul or any other places where they have a guide/docent!!!)So, my suggestion is just go walk around the place and just get soaked up in the atmosphere but don't expect to learn anything.  "
It's like being in Chosun dynasty.,"Naganeupseong is a real village. When I got off the car, I thought this is just like any other folk village. I was mistaken since. Real people live here and aside from the common folk houses and the market, there is also a town office and a plaza. One could really feel and imagine what life was like during the Chosun dynasty. The only thing missing is the costume. This is by far the best folk village for me..."
Folk Village within a Fortress,"Nagan Eupseong is a old village surrounded by a well preserved fortress.The fortress is build up of huge block of rocks stacking up on one another.The first thing you should do when arrive is to climb up to the fortress wall at the entrance.Take a slow walk along the walls , you can see the entire village from top.And the backdrop of the village, the beautiful mountains behind blend nicely into the whole picture.After finished walking on the fortress wall, you can enter and visit the village.Within the village, there are some olden korean houses with display of artefact like governor house, court house, punishment of civillians.there is also a playground with two huge long swing.A recommended tourist site when you visit Suncheon."
Back to the past,"A trip here will transport one back in time to the past. If you enjoy watching period drama like 大長今, you will have a great time here. One can't help but to wonder if anyone dressed in period drama costume would be coming around the corner. Love the thatched roof houses too!"
Folk Village,There are Namdo Food Festival held in Nagan Eupseong during autumn. There are so many Jeollanam-do origin food that worth to try.
"Naganeupseong, Town Fortress and Village","Naganeup village has two defining characteristics. It is not a village of the aristocracy, but one of the common people, with thatched roofs and simple stone walls. The second important detail is the village is protected by a fortress wall that encloses the village built to protect the inhabitants from Japanese soldiers or pirates. People still live in the village, and some of the homes have been almost completely redone or refurbished, but numerous preserved homes remain. As well as some of the town government buildings. Strolling around the small alleyways within the village is a highlight, and to get a better sense of the layout of the town, walk around the relatively small fortress wall. The location in Suncheon is ideal for its nearness to the ocean, and amidst fertile lands in Jeollanam-do."
A trip back in time,"The place was not packed with tourist. It was really peaceful and quiet, making the scenery even more enjoyable. The houses looked as if they were coming from the past. There was man making pottery there, his house and his small garden looked like it was coming straight from a Miyazaki picture. "
