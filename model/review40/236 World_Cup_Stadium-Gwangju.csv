Great venue for a Kpop concert!,"I was there to watch the SBS super concert, and I think it's a great venue to watch a concert. The toilet was provided well and many stalls so you don't have to worry about that. Although, the entrances/exits was not big enough, so expect a slow-bottlenecked exit after the show. However, I'm pretty impressed with the seating arrangement, even you get the side tribune, you'll get a good view of the stage!"
HUUUGE,">>> roughly 30 min from Ssangchon station walking and 1o min by car.>>> songam74 bus/cheomdan20 busHuge Outdoor stadium hosted the 2002 FIFA WORLD CUP. has the capacity of for 40,245 seats.really huge venue but due to the seats being really up high, itn gets cold at night, so be sure to grab a jacket with you!"
Worldcup worldcup,Next to a Lotte Outlet mall.. nothing much to see except u know that worldcup was here. Went here by taxi as quite far from the downtown or city center
A great stadium and now the home for Gwangju FC,"I went with my son, now an adult (so doesn't fit with trip advisor categories) to see Gwangju FC loose 2 - 1 to Seoul FC. It's a great stadium. I hope that Gwangju can improve and get more supporters as it must have a 30,000 capacity. If it's sunny there is shade for one side of the stadium and the other you just get sun blasted. It's tempting to review the teams, I'd say that the game would be like the English first division level (two levels down from Premiership) but the stadium itself is worth a visit for an event.There are burger , doughnut stalls etc to get food and drink, all reasonable priced. Plus a large department shop right next door. "
memory of Universiade,It has a near Lotte Mart and a large indoor swimming pool.It is where various events are frequently held.The opening and closing ceremonies are held here in the last Universiade.
Generally worth the visit.,"Gwangju World Cup stadium is about 25 mins away from Downtown Gwangju. It is easily accessible by bus and taxi, and there are a wealth of motels, hotels and shops near by. The stadium is aesthetically pleasing and has held its design well. There are actually plenty of food outlets nearby, and Lotte has a huge department store right next to it. I last visited here in 2013."
Universiade 2015,"Went here to see the Universiade Athletics in 2015. The stadium looks great and getting around inside is easy. Viewing of the pitch is excellent almost regardless of where you sit. It could be easier to get to though, we took the number 6 or 74 bus to get us there every day. Busses are 1200 won a ride and generally quite easy once you know where you are going. Sadly not much in the way of food nearby."
Working day trip,"Great location to do some shopping, hit the driving range and other sports. Had some great Asian food in the lotte mall and enjoyed the architecture of the stadium."
It's a Stadium!,"It's interesting to look at, but I've not seen a game here yet. The Lotte Outlets are right here, though so if you're already in the neighborhood shopping, pop outside and take a look. Or go see a game here."
Eh...,"I've never made it to a football match here, but there's a large complex surrounding the stadium I visit frequently. There's a large mall next door, a gym (with skating rink!), and a park to walk around. The mall is standard; nothing special unless you live close by, and you need to go grocery shopping. The skating rink is nice, and although the park isn't the prettiest, if you're just looking for an area to walk around, it's nice. "
It's a Soccer Stadium,If you are into soccer/futball you will enjoy the visit to the World Cop Stadium in Gwangju. The group enjoyed watching a match.
You're average football stadium,"I went here for a football match between Gwangju FC and Pohang Steelers. The stadium is just a normal, average stadium. It has quite good facilities, such as clean toilets and food/drink stalls just outside the tribune."
"Great stadium, small crowd","The World Cup Stadium is a fantastic arena that was a cauldron during the Football World Cup in 2002. Since then it has rarely seen the same attention. Gwangju has only recently formed a K-League football team and with little full time support in a city obsessed with baseball and the Kia Tigers match days can feel a little souless. There is a park and a large shopping centre right by the stadium and you can take drinks and food in which is great. The tickets are also cheap at 10,000 won. If you have a spare couple of hours in Gwangju on match day then grab a pizza and some beers from the store next door and give it a try but I would not make it a ""must do"" by any means. "
