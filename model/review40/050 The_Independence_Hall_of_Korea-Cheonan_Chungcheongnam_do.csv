Get the audio guide!,"There is so much information on this campus. It's a wonderful, FREE place to learn about the history of the Korean people. Using the audio guide, you can hear about almost every artifact in the collection, spanning seven exhibition halls. Additionally, you can walk or take a cart around the campus to see various memorials and observation areas. The Path of Maple Trees is a beautiful walk that encompasses the entire campus. You would have to spend an entire day here to see everything, but the pamphlet offers suggestions of the tours: History/Education Tour or Memorial Tour in Nature are approx 3 hours each or the Patriotic Poems and Quotations Tour is approx 2 hours."
Korean history,Pretty cool with a lot of impressive statues... worth seeing in Cheonan. Feeding the fish was interesting too
Great Place to See Overall Korean History,This is the place where the local Korean middle/high schools add in their yearly school trip. The exhibitions are well organised and easy to follow. Recommend to those who wish to know the overall history of Korea!
Educatonal,The grounds are beautiful. The exhibits are very detailed and help you understand what happened when Japan tried to take over
History of Korea.. Enjoy with your family here!,"This location is far from Cheonan but really must be visit!!! It was built in huge area so you have to arrange your time like a day. You can learn everything about Korean culture and civilization..Moreover you can enjoy with your family for walk around and sightseeing. All season is great to visit there.! But especially autumn and spring are gorgeous. Weekends are really crowded so my opinion choose weekday if you have a time.You can reach this place from Cheonan bus terminal by local bus (381, 382, 383, 390, 391, 400, 402). Entrance is free but if you come here with your car you have to pay for parking fee 2000 won."
Great ,It is far from the city but it worth to visit. You can enjoin the stamp in each building you went. All the history from the start until now you can learn from this hall.
A great place to enjoy with family and learn South Korean history ,"This is an excellent place to enjoy with family and learn South Korean history. We stumbled upon this place while our visit to nearby Daemyeong resort in Cheonan. It’s only 2000 KRW to park and entry is free. There’s information center where you can information about the Independence Hall and exhibition. We were able to rent a baby stroller for free for our visit and enjoyed our visit. They have activities for kids including a train ride across the park. There are 8 exhibit halls with different theme of Korean history and takes 1.5-2 hours to go through all. There’s a quite a bit of walking throughout the visit, so better to wear comfortable shoes. Ample places to enjoy food, ice cream and Korean snacks...overall we had a fun day in early Spring...."
"Great sight and sound museums in Korea, often missed","I went to this history museum about an hour south of Seoul with my Korean relatives. It is on a large track of land with many separate halls and a 4D theater that the kids might like. Each hall was filled with different eras in Korean history, but most concentrated with the Japanese occupation era from the late 1800s to 1945. It was great to see all the set ups as you walked in and out of displays (ALL areas included English explanations). Did not pay a thing for the visit, except for the parking."
Interesting views of Korean history,"The grounds are large and impressive and there are many exhibits about Korea's history and struggle for independence.Perhaps predictably (considering the name), some parts are strongly nationalistic, maybe even biased. One exhibit has a video that explicitly claims Japan and China have 'distorted' Korea's history. Most exhibits are well described in English. Well worth a visit to get a Korean perspective on Korea's history. "
Memorable place in Cheon an,It’s a big place and there are 6 buildings to see in. I’m not sure there is a guide for foreigner but I recommend this place to see around and learn about Korea.
Very interesting!,"The Independence Hall of Korea is a very interesting place to learn about Korea's long history. There are several different buildings, each housing a different chapter in the country's past struggles and triumphs. The Hall is big and on a sprawling piece of land and is a good way to spend a day or long afternoon, depending on how much time you spend on the exhibits."
Cheonan main attraction,Located very close to Cheonan bus terminal take 400 or 401 bus . Entry is free with special events on National Independence Day March 1st. Take the toy train up the hill charges are 1000Won per person and enjoy the history of korea along with a 4D cinema show. There are many park and fountains to hang around with family. Lastly dont forget to feed the fish on the bridge to the main entrance. Have fun ..My mom loves this place..Love from India.
Perfect Place for History Lover,"This place located not too far from the city of Cheonan. From Seoul, you can take bus or train for one hour trip. After that from Intercity Bus Terminal or Cheonan-Asan Station, you just need to take bus number 400 or 401 and drop at Korea's Independence Hall. They hold an event for National Independence Day celebration every March 1st. If you like and want to know the history of Korea I recommend you to visit this place on that special day. Parents and teacher usually bring their children on weekend so if you prefer quiet trip, visit on weekdays."
Good for history lovers,We went there in the Children's Day where there were a lot of activities for kids.... good if you enjoy history and museums....
Korean Independence and Occupation,"The architecture of Independence Hall is striking and slightly Stalinist. The surrounding parks are quite beautiful in the Spring. The highlight for me though was definitely the museum. While I don't doubt that there's a fair amount of one sidedness and the exhibits can get a little propagandaish, the museum is an interesting look at the Japanese occupation. It's a good way to gauge how the Korean government and many Koreans view their past relationship with Japan and why there is so much bad blood between the two peoples even today."
Interesting Exhibits,This is a huge place with interesting exhibits which showcases the history of Korea. There's also a 4D Theatre. 
"Great Museum, very interesting","If you're into history or museums, this is a very well put together display that chronicles the history of Korea throughout generations. When I went there I had no idea some of the oppression and turmoil the country had gone through so it was a very eye opening experience for me. Very large place, takes the better part of the afternoon, if not day, to walk through in detail. Definitely worth a visit if you're in Cheonan for a while and enjoy history. A large portion of the displays are inside, but there are several separate buildings so outside walking is required."
Dynamic 4D theater & Experience Hall of Independence ,Parking fee is KRW 2000.Tram one way is KRW 1000.Don't miss the 4D theater ! Its FREE.中国的沈阳九八的。Mostly Chinese explanation. It would be good if include english notes.The exhibit is surprising still in good condition.30 mins interval.
Very large and educational museum,"I can only explain this museum by saying that it's architecture is VERY similar to the soviet era artwork. Everything is absolutely enormous and it takes ages to walk it. A very popular place for children to go on field trips because it teaches them about the origins of Korea and its war history. In my opinion, the content is very anti-japanese, so take the information you read not as accurate history, but South Korea's views on the war instead. Again, you SHOULD visit the museum because it's nice, but don't take too much time reading the content."
Awesome Place To Visit. ,"Independent Hall of Korea is best place to visit in Korea, near of Cheonan. By Taxi or Car Just Only 20 minutes. Beautiful natural scenes, artificial monuments are awesome. Heavenly peace place. I love It. "
Huge Place!,The shear size of this compound is impressive. They definitely did not spare any expense. I only spent about an hour and a half here because the people I was there travelling with were short on time. *Spoiler Alert* You need much more than 1.5 hours to see everything.
Very good place to understand Korea,"Good facilities, worth to visit. But no taxi service available, need to take a bus first then change to a taxi."
Very Excellent place to know Korea history,"C1 ( 2015.07.03 ) There was very excellent place than I think because there was very good exhibits about history and well be prepared a design. Frankly, I have not expected, but there was very good museum and good monument. There was consist of one main building and 7 museum with theme. Excellent place and recommendable. And free for entrance."
The biggest tile roofed building in Asia!,"The Independence Hall of Korea is a fantastic experience. Be aware, it has been founded by a private charity, and in places can be slightly biased, but it is still a very good historical overview, as well as some seriously impressive architecture."
This is most import place for independent of Korea. ,"This is most import place for independent of Korea. This place is huge (larger than War Memorial Park in Seoul). This place is focus on specially on independent of Korea (South Korea n North Korea) from Japan. Therefore it is essential to understand Korea, especially modern history. Huge buildings(exhibition halls), lake, big square. Enterance is free. "
"Huge, historically important to Koreans, but not in tourist guides","I can't believe this site has so few reviews and is hardly mentioned in guidebooks. The Hall is actually a huge grounds including a man made lake, a large monument, a massive hall (as large as a soccer field and 15 stories high, it is apparently the largest tile-roofed house in Asia), and a large museum along with a 3D theatre for the kids. The scale of this place is on par with the War Memorial in Seoul, bigger actually, and admission is also completely free. In many ways this Hall is similar to the War Memorial, although the focus is squarely on Korean Independence and past battles and injustices that were mainly perpetrated by the Japanese. The museum offers up a unflinching view of past wars, and is particularly critical of historical Japanese aggression. While some may find the tone and explanations (all available in English) to be almost propagandistic, I just think the translation was just poorly done and too many unnecessary words make the explanations seem overly militaristic and harsh. I wish they would find a proper english speaker to tone down the language but perhaps such a blunt re-telling of the wars is the only way to communicate the truth of what happened. I can't help but think this is an important field trip location for Korean school kids to really learn about the country's history and the oppression it endured in the past. That said, there are some subjects such as torture and comfort women that may require some parental guidance.Highly recommended, it definitely offers a glimpse into the Korean national psyche and how it came to be."
Fun cultural experience.,"The revisionist history was fun. Ie the Korean War. Some excellent examples, and artifacts. We took the bus there from the Shinsegae and it was a nice ride. I was there in Feb so it was a bit chilly, but overall well worth the visit. I suppose when your neighbors have been trying to conquer you for thousand years you get a little touchy."
Interesting historical museum,"The Independence Hall is a well-designed and laid out historical site that offers so much of Korea's rich history. The grounds are beautiful, the dioramas are intricately detailed and the Hall offers so much for the entire family."
Nice historical review,"Great review of Korean history. As with most cultural venues, minimal entry fee. Fantastic photo ops, good English translations available. Picnic area available. As the other commenters noted, heavy focus on Japanese atrocities, but as with all things historical, It is what it is. Fantastic sculptures, seldom crowded."
The independence hall of Korea,"If you are in Cheonan this is well worth a visit as a cultural distraction. It's a huge place, 2 quid to park a car and free to get in. There are some excellent sculptures, and some fine exhibits, you'll need a few hours. It's main theme is the development of Korea after the oppression of the Japanese, there are plenty of really good examples of the brutality during the time of that Japanese domination. It is immaculately clean, most exhibits are annotated in English. There is a 4D cinema which is quite impressive too, showing a short film OK for kids. It's the only thing in Cheonan I found that was worth doing really."
Beautifully Designed Museum,"This is one of the best museums I have been to. It is well laid out and the exhibits show great care in their design and maintenance. There are English brochures available at the entrance and the English translations on the exhibits are surprisingly good. By the time we were done with the museum I had at least doubled or tripled my understanding of Korean history. The only reason I am not giving it five stars is because of the very narrow focus of the museum. The first exhibit hall contains fascinating information and artifacts from the beginning of Korean history and goes into some depth concerning the three kingdoms era, however, the remaining halls are all focused on one topic - the atrocities of the Japanese occupation. For a Korean national, someone of Korean heritage, or a scholar of Korean history I am sure it would be fascinating; but, as a foreigner with only a basic knowledge of Korean history, the depth of coverage of that period became wearisome. Even so, I would still highly recommend a visit to this museum. Admittance to the majority of the museum is free with a cheap 2000 Won fee for one of the exhibits. Parking is also cheap, 2000 Won for the day. We chose to take public transportation and had no issues taking the number 1 line to Cheonan and then the 400 bus to the Independence Hall. Leaving was a bit trickier as the bus that leaves the museum continues west and you have to get off and get back on an eastbound bus. The 401 bus also makes frequent trips from the subway station to the museum."
World Class Museum,"Since we live in Cheonan, we have been here many times. There are six or seven inter-connected buildings, so plan on several hours or more to take it all in. The Grand Hall is spectacular, and the exhibits fascinating. There is enough English to make this history come alive at this National level museum."
Impressive Museum,"The Independence Hall of Korea is massive, the outdoor monuments suprised me. I decided to take the long (but comfortable) metro train.all the way to Cheonan. The exhibits are interesting, focusing on Korea's long hard period as a colony of Japan. The largely unknown (in the west) history of Korea's resistance is something worth learning more about, and the exiled Korean government located in Shanghai is also covered. I enjoyed my visit, and the grounds were worth exploring. My only complaint is the target audience of the museum seems to be students on school field trips. In fact, there wasn't a whole lot of visitors, probably because I visited earlier in the morning on a school day."
A magnificent display,The frankness of the history with Japan left a lasting impression on me and a lot of my friendsI was hoping more more in depth info on the split between north and sought Korea
Eye opening,I went with my school for a half day visit. There was an english translating service available:basically a headset that works like a bluetooth device so that you can listen to all the history tafbits that every hall has to offer. The layout is very fluent but it can get tiring after sometime. However there are loads of benches aroumd and the food court serves a pretty decent meal at low pricesses. I was there in fall and the outside senery was spectacular. If you like history this is a must see...or if you have a free day and would just like to enjoy the grounds.
Informative and free and nice.,Took a bus to the hall during my business weekend. Was told by the lovely lady in tourist information to take bus 400. Bus driver do not speak English (and looked serious) but yet helpful enough to let me know when I reach the destination. The independence hall is decent and very interesting to watch. You can easily spend 4-5 hours in the hall if you are into history. Going back is yet another adventure but all is good. I guess the easiest is to get out at train station. This can be identified when many ppl with big bags are going out of the bus at the same time.
A great memorial to Koreas fight for independence from Japanese rule.,"The Independence Hall is much more than that. It covers a lot including older history. There is even an entertaining 4D theater, which I quite enjoyed. though it is a bit childish."
