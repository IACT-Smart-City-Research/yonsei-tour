Well situated facility dedicated to the hope for Unification,At the confluence of the two key rivers this place seems dedicated to convincing all comers of the case for a Unification despite the series of provocations
First view of DMZ,Very nice facility offering panoramic views of the DMZ and North Korea. With the aid of binoculars you can see across the river and glimpses of life in the north. Folks farming and on bikes on dirt roads. A chilling experience when you think about it. You can see the narrowest part of the DMZ 461 meters. Facility is well done and thoughtful.
First look at the DMZ,"My friend, his mom and I drove to the tower to check out the view of North Korea. It took about an hour by car to get there but as you got closer you noticed barbed wire, fencing and guard towers laid out on one side of the freeway. Definitely an interesting view and sensation.Once we got to the entrance we were told that we had to park down the street and take a shuttle up the hill to the tower. One can park along the side of the street or drive into the parking area and pay a small fee and be close to the shuttle drop off/pick up point. Longest wait was about 10 minutes.Once at the tower, you pay a small entry fee and you have full access. On the second floor there is a theatre that showed old footage of the Korean War with narration in English and Korean. On the third floor is the observation deck where you can look at North Korea for free. I recommend you enter the atrium area where a small 3D panorama map is displayed. Using that as a guide you can see a few more interesting things on the scope. On a clear day you can see Panmunjom off in the distance. You could also see North Koreans working in the fields across the river. On the fourth floor there is a small snack shop and area to relax.I did enjoy the visit there and recommend it as an inexpensive and easy way to check out the North."
Not accessible currently,"We were unable to leave the bus. Indeterminate how much longer that restriction will last, however, we were able to drive by a Checkpoint Charlie and the Bridge of No Return, which were not often previously accessible."
A view to the DPRK,"A visit to the Tower afforded a view into NoKo lying across the Imjin River from South Korea on a cold, dreary day. The observation point also overlooks Southern forces facilities and defenses. The interior of the tower looked to have some very interesting displays but we had arrived late on a winter day and the facilities were in the process of closing so I could not see very much of them. I was happy with the visit but wish I had had more time there."
Well worth a visit,"The observatory gives you a great view of North Korea. There are free binoculars to see the northern side. On a clear day, you will be able to see the ""fake village"" as well as real villages and the people who iive in them going about their daily life. There is a short documentary in several languages available to watch that is informative as well."
Observe and get a glimpse of daily northkorean life,"Me and my boyfriend went here after benig recomended it by friends. It only costs you 3000 won. You can look in the binoculars and zoom in pretty good on the north side, only 2 km away. The only thing between the separated countries are the river. You can se houses and humans at the fields working. We also saw a man on a bike. Even though it might seem like nothing it made it feel so much more real that you could see these people living their everyday life so close to the border but still so far away from us. I was fascinated. The center of unification though was kind of boring if you dont know korean. The texts to the pictures only had headlines in english but no explanations. There was a short movie that you could watch in english but I found it kind of dull.A big plus for the very friendly staff there. Everyone was so nice! "
Somber memorial to the division of the Korean people,"The observatory allows visitors a view into close-by PDRK including some of the propaganda towers and ghost towns built by the PDRK to project an image of strength, if they were actually occupied. Chilled air blowers are a welcome comfort in summer."
Unmissable much better than taking a guided tour,Very respectful exhibition and video is excellent as well as viewing platforms this is well worth a day trip
Koreas,This place gives you an insight of north Korea and its living conditions there. It also tells you about the korean war. From here you can observe and actually see parts of nk which is a once in a lifetime experience.
Good place to check North Korea (if there is good weather),"Very well organized observatory where you can see North Korea territory. If it is a clear day, most probably you will be able to see some people walking or working in the fields. We went on a weekday and there were few people."
Understand your history,"Visiting this place is so emotional, knowing that this 2 countries are 1 family and there are many relatives are separated.We can see some part of North Korea. There are several locations, but if time is your concern this place is worth it to consider.There is a shirt video available in Korean and English while you can see the view of North Korea while you are sitting in the room."
Unexpected but recommended,"When visiting Paju for a day we visited the observatory and what a surprise! Totally unexpected we had a good view accross the border to observe their daily life. The 20x binoculars that are free to use make it possible to see more about their daily life, to observe their agricultural activities from the viewing platform. A presentation is english spoken and explains good details. The shuttle bus from the foot of the hill to the observatory is free and access is KRW3,000 normally, now during the renovation reduced to KRW1,500 per person."
See North Korea!,"The visit here was part of the Panmunjom tour I joined. There's a short educational video explaining the 2 Koreas but the highlight is actually being able to see NK from the viewing decks indoor and outdoor, that are equipped with powerful binoculars. Viewed from here the physical landscape difference between 2 sides is apparent (you'll know why there, no spoilers) and I actually saw North Koreans moving about outside their homes, it was quite exciting."
Views over North Korea,"The views over the merging river Han and Imjin are very nice and you can see a North Korean village on the other side with people going about their business. We came here as the Dora observatory was closed, I have been to both and think the views are, if anything, more impressive from here."
A good place to see North Korea from the border,"The observatory is nothing special but the fact you can peep over North Korea and you can see the defences of both countries over the border, makes this a worthwhile visit of you are in the area "
Good view of North Korean side of DMZ.,This place was included in our DMZ trip but the stop was relatively short allowing mostly for a great view of the North Korean side of DMZ way across the Hun River. It is a good place for taking panoramic photos with your camera or phone.
"See North Korea with 3,000 KRW from a distance","This is a nice to visit if you are in Paju area near Heyri Art Village, English Village and Provence. You can see the border and the North Korea via binoculars offered for free from the main building, and see real life in North Korea, which is pretty quiet (at least on the day we visited) across the channel of water. The theatre had traditional Korea dance presented, and it was very nice. Also a few mock up of NK school and home to give you some understanding of commoner's life in NK. Good place to know a little more about the SK and NK relations and partnerships, as well as tensions."
Beautiful view of Mount Odu and border of NK without breaking the budget,"Admission fee is at 3000 won (per individual adult) as of April 2015. For us on budget & can't afford the Panmunjeon tour, Odusan Reunification Center is the place where there is informative learning & also, beautiful view of the place and surrounding area itself. This the closest thing we can be at the border of North and South Korea within our budget. To get there, we stop at Geumcheon station & took bus 900 there (we show the bus driver the picture of our destination with name on it & asked him to inform us once we reached there)After that, there is a free shuttle bus that takes us all the way to Mount Odu. Along the way, we loved the beautiful view of the blossoming flowers on the tree. And don't forget to get souvenirs of NK products too, which is also at reasonable price."
Good but there are other places,"I enjoyed my visit here, but even though it was overlooking the border, it seemed removed. There was some interesting information and views of North Korea, but it was from afar. There are other places where you can ""feel"" the uneasy tension...like the DMZ, the Freedom bridge, the third tunnel, etc."
A beautiful building high on a mountain overlooking NK,"This is the place from where one can view North Korea and it's citizens going about their daily routines. It is rare to catch a glimpse of them across the river, but on the day we were there we saw quite a few people out and about. There are displays here depicting a NK school room and typical home as well as artifacts and monuments."
views and information,"Lots of steep steps but views with free binoculars worth it. Museum very informative, all from South Korea viewpoint, but does show school room and room for N Korea family. Our N Korea defector added a lot to understanding."
Can see many North Korean houses,"This is the place where you can be able to see more North Korean buildings. It is tough to go to this place. After getting down from GeumChon subway station, you will have to use taxi which would cost around 10 US dollar to go to this observatory. Keep this observatory name in Korean language also or show the picture of this observatory to the driver then the taxi driver would understand and take you to the observatory. While you return, you can get into the free shuttle bus and they will drop you at a bus stop. You should take a bus and get into the nearest city and you can find a Metro station then you can go to Seoul city. This observatory is over 3 KM away from North Korea, but you can see many buildings with your naked eyes. Also there are binoculars, you should use 500 won (around half dollar) for few minutes of usage. This place is totally safe. Mostly the crowd is less. I have been to this observatory in 2009,2010 and 2011"
Great views into the PDRK,"Best place for taking photographs into the PDRK. The drone of propaganda of the South can be exhausting, though."
Be aware of the fog!,"This spot offers a great view of North Korea. Showing the closest villages and landscape. But, unfortunately, when I visited this place, it was a foggy day. Therefore it was almost impossible to see the location of the main cities and building.It is still interesting to take a look on the other side of the border."
Good stop on Panmunjom tour,"This was the first stop on a DMZ tour offered through the Panmunjom Travel Center at the Lotte Hotel. It is pretty much right at the DMZ, so you can see into North Korea from the viewing platform. It was a great overview of the DMZ and North Korea and a good way to start the tour"
"Nice panorama, but no good pictures","You'll have a great overview of the DMZ and N. Korea, but since you have to take all pictures from behind a yellow line that's behind all the tourists using the pay-for-use binoculars, don't even bother. (You might get a decent picture if your tour goes into the VIP viewing room.) Anyway, it's on the tour, so enjoy."
Unique insight into North Korea,"Odusan Observatory offers a very good view of North Korea, which is located directly across the river from the site. On a clear day you can see miles into North Korean territory if that interests you. The atmosphere is far more relaxed than Panamunjon, which is full of tourists. Odusan Observatory is a easy trip from Seoul, and if you want a different kind of souvenir their are plenty of North Korean made products for sale. I've been told North Korean beer tastes better than the South, at least DPRK has THAT going for them.The observatory also offers small exhibits about North Korea life, society, and fashion. Overall, my visit here was interesting and worth the trip."
