Lost in the mountain,"We arrived via subway (Oncheonjang Station) and up the cable car; we followed internet directions to reach the South gate, after that we got lost.The fact that it was raining on and off and the few signs didn’t help us. After a while we went through a little village (main dish they offered was duck bulgogi) and afterwards down (bridge/little river/rocks) and up (steep part). After hiking for 5+ hours through the mountain we finally reached Seokbulsa temple and it was worth it!It started raining again; there was only a couple walking around and soon we had the place all to ourselves. We have seen several temples, but got to admit the wall carvings are truly unique. We were thankful for 2 things: the drink vending machine a little before reaching the temple and for not slipping down the rocks along the way and being hurt.Arriving through the road (not the cable car) there are taxis that can save you around three fourths of the steep ascent, but missed one going the opposite way so had to walk down and had some food mid-way at a nice looking café.Once we reached the bottom since we arrived from a different place and there was no subway around we asked a guy waiting for the bus and told us to cross the street and take the bus; we did and arrived at Minam subway station to change to line 4.I enjoyed the hiking, but my teenage son hated it. My body hurt the next day, but I was still smiling."
Peaceful half-day from Busan,"We left the Busan Tower area at 7:15 am and were back by 11 am - an easy half-day activity. Not sure why everyone says it‘s so hard to get to. We took subway line 1 to Dondae, then took bus 46. Just put Seokbulsa in Kakao Map, and this is the path it shows. The bus drops you off right at the 1.5 km path through woods and onto a sort of street to the temple. It took us 30 min. from there. The last 500m were the steepest. English and Korean signs all the way up. And it seems you could drive/get a taxi up if you really needed to. There were only 2 others there when we arrived. It was so peaceful and beautiful - the rock carvings, the views... a true highlight on our Busan trip. We were too early for the cable car on the way out. Thought we could take the cable car down, but the signage to find that path from the temple was questionable, so just took the same path back down. Would suggest going up with the cable car and back down toward Mandeok to the 46 bus. There are plenty of signs down. "
Unforgettable,"This temple was the highlight of our Busan visit. You can reach after taking the Geumgang Cable Car, but there is also a bus stop not to far away from the temple. We took the cable car and had a hard time finding the temple. We had to ask for directions, but luckily found a very friendly Korean gentleman who showed us the way. The walk to the temple was not easy, so you'll need to be in shape.But when you reach this temple everything is forgotten. The view on Busan is breath taking, but what makes this temple truly unforgettable are the magnificent rock carvings. What a tremendous feat!"
In the middle of no where ,"This temple is very hard to get to. We took the metro and then we hiked for a good 1h before we got there and the path is not an easy one. Since the temple is on top of a mountain, the hike is straight up. But honestly, once you get there, it is SOOOOOOO worth it. The views are breathtaking and the carvings on the stones are so beautiful. Once you get there, there is such a big sense of piece. I would really recommend it. "
Unique carvings ,"Firstly, we came here by car and the journey up was quite something. Basically just keep going until you can’t go no further! It will mean going up some rather steep roads but there is a small car park at the top (just a level down from the actual temple - much better than parking early and climbing the steep slopes up). The stone carvings are like nothing I’ve ever seen. Really interesting and impressive. I also tried to find the room with loads of buddhas but was unable to? The air up there is very clean and fresh. Good views in places."
Beautiful Temple besides the sea,"Nice relaxing place for worship and scenery in Busan, Korea. Public bus transport at Won12,000 from outside Haeundae station to bus stop along main road from temple. Then a nice stroll to temple ground. Temple have simple route to main hall complex. Entrance is free and relaxing place to pray too. A spring head provides cool refreshing water to drink too. Avoid morning tourist timing and the crowd is manageable. Stroll around the temple complex and toss a coin from small bridge, visit the temple prayer hall and then walk to seaside area. Under ground room is cool and half a day is sufficient. "
Favorite Temple in South Korea,"My husband and I spent 6 long months working in South Korea. During our time off we often visit temples and this by far our favorite. It is a little difficult to locate, but not too bad considering we didn't know the language and were still able to find it. We drove most of the way up to it and parked along the road. We were not sure what the road would be like further up and had a large vehicle, so pulled over and parked where we could. This place is AMAZING. Large carvings in the cliff. A room with thousands of buddhas. Very, very quiet and peaceful. Not a lot of people. It felt like a real sanctuary on top of a busy city. Definitely recommend! "
Unique Stone Carvings- Worth a visit,Seokbulsa is small but different than other temples in Busan due to the huge stone carvings behind the temple. Certainly worth checking out. You can come most of the way by vehicle or you can hike from the Fortress if you want to combine the sites and get a little exercise.
Breathtaking! ,"The most beautiful temple I've seen in Korea! Most authentic and impressive compared to all those ""mambo jambo"" touristic temples. Worth the visit in Busan! "
Peaceful place for nature lovers,"This place is seldom be mentioned in any guidebook in Asia. I just found this place accidentally through a news website. Before visiting this place, my husband n I found there r lots of routs to go to the temple on the internet. So we choose to take the subway to Mandeok Station( exit 2) first as our plan. Once u got out of the station, u'll see signs in English all the way which indicate the direction to Seokbulsa. So u don't have to worry about getting lost in the mountains. But I still recommend people who wanna go to Seokbulsa better learn how to read Seokbulsa in Korean. Cause there r signs indicate shortcuts in Korean on the way. Actually we should walk for at least 1.5 hr to get there, but we took the shortcuts n got there less than an hr. I don't know how to type ""Seokbulsa"" in Korean, but it's at the right n top of the 1st pic.The path is kind of hard for climbers especially the last 600 meters to the destination. U'd better not to take any little kids with you. The path is kind rough even for an adult.  The views on the way r really great. Once u got to the temple, u will feel it really worth it."
Peaceful mountain side temple ,"I visited the Seokbulsa temple with some friends and we were all impressed. We parked about 1km down the mountain across from a little cafe which was very nice, the owner provided amazing service. The hike up to the temple was a good little cardio session! Once walking through the gate of the temple and breathing the fresh mountain air I felt relieved. It was very tranquil and quiet. The stone carvings were amazing to see, very skilled and detailed work. It was a great experience. "
Impressive stone carvings from the 1930s,"Seokbulsa literally means Stone-Buddha-Temple which is an adequate name for this comparatively small but beautiful temple on a slope of the Geumjeongsan.There are many descriptions of the tricky hiking route through the mountains, but there is no temple anywhere in Korea which is not accessible by cars. Temples need provisions and all kind of things that cannot be transported by mountain trails. You could use the subway line #3 til Mandeok Station. Take exit 2 and then try to get a taxi, but unfortunately many drivers don’t know the temple. Having a plan at hand might be helpful. Or you take a taxi from your hotel and clear all problems with the help of the bell boy. The taxi won’t go up to the entrance, so you’d have to walk the last 30 meters or so. The view is stunning and the stone carvings wonderful. Three sides of the temple are 40 meter high mountain rocks, adorned with superbe carvings of Buddhist figures. There are also two small caverns with shrines for prayers and offerings. On Buddha’s birthday (eighth day of the fourth lunar month, i.e. 2018: May 22; 2019: May 12; 2020: April 30; 2021: May 19; 2022: May 8) the whole precinct is covered with lanterns. But even then the Seokbulsa is a quiet place, more a hermitage than a temple.(Spoiler alert!) But be aware that this temple is much much younger than most other temples in Busan. During the 1930s when Korea was part of the Japanese empire, a monk named Cho Hyeon selected these rock formations. Over many years he made those carvings combining traditional and modern elements and thus creating a sacred place that resonates perfectly with our imaginations of old hidden treasures of the Far East."
Peaceful walk and pretty scenery,"Really enjoyed the beautiful walk from the top of the cable car to this temple with its cliff rock carvings and beautiful buildings. Instead of backtracking, we kept heading downhill to the Mandeok metro station, easy to find all of these walks on Maps.Me"
Tricky to find but worth it,"This is a hidden gem. Small but worth the hike. Think along the lines of Petra with figures carved into the natural rock. Very unlike the big temple sites we've seen in Seoul or Sokcho it breaks the mould of what we had come to expect. If you are following the Lonely Planet guide, you probably have a map that makes it look close to the top of the cable car... Not so much! It's still a good hike and whilst there are good signs throughout these woods there are not many to the temple. Hike to the South Gate of the fortress. Standing within the fortress, follow the wall to the right (i.e. keeping it to your left hand side as you walk). There is a trail off to left that takes you up to a helicopter pad at a peak, then follows the ridge down to the temple itself. 2km overall. We did the route in reverse having lost our way getting to the temple. We ended up in Nammun village, walked down the valley to a concrete road which we followed up the hill to the Temple. "
Interesting temple but require fitness,Interesting temple with sculptures made from the rocks. Highly recommended but require a certain level of fitness as the route near the temple is very steep up sloped. 
Hidden Secret of Busan,"People choose to go to the Sea Temple, that I personally, do not fin spectacular. For me, the Seokbulsa Temple, is more beautiful, but perhaps because is in the middle of the mountain, with view of the city. Also, you can go to a certain point in a cable car, then hike less than 5 kms. The temple has carven rocks, and perhaps I love this temples, because there were not tourist and in my case, when I went there were not even Korean in the temple. You can find some hikers in the way to the temple, very kind hikers that you will give Makoli and offer to take you pictures. I totally recommend this activity if you want to scape for the noise life. "
Beautiful carvings complement the location,"We went with my parents, and so got the cable car up to the top. After a bit of investigating we found the place, and it was beautiful. I reckon it would be even better at sunrise or sunset. We then hiked down which wasn't a problem!"
Worth the hike n sweat,Went on a morning hike with girls. It was a bit confusing caz signs are all in Korean. but we met many very helpful uncles and aunties along the way. Took us 2 and a half hours to get to the temple from the cable car. But we were rewarded with the best site ever. Totally tranquil n calming. Worth all the ups and downs of the muddy trek across the mountain. The lazy way is to get a taxi to drive you up from the mandeok subway station (line 3). Go on a hike n think of it as making a pilgrimage. 
"Hike it, OR take the cable car","I did some research before taking the trip to find this temple. I found an article that had pretty good instructions on how to get to the temple if you are hiking from the entrance (which if you do it will take you all day). There is a cable car that goes up one portion of the mountain, if you take it you will save yourself about 2-3 hours hiking but you will miss some AMAZING views of Busan. We pretty much hiked up one mountain, walked down, and then hiked up another mountain to get to the temple (which does have road access and we discovered people driving up about 3/4 of the way and then walking up to the temple). The road is steep so be prepared for that. When we realized people could just drive up and then walk a short distance we felt a bit defeated. BUT the whole trip ended up being very spiritually cleansing for us. When we finally got to the temple there was only one other person there. We stayed inside and rested for about 20 minutes with the place all to ourselves. You can't beat that! By far my favorite temple in Korea. If you don't want to do the hike, you may be able to ask the cab drivers around the immediate area if they know how to get there. (That is if you speak Korean or have a Korean with you)"
Nice temple with stone carvings,"We took the metro to Oncheonjang Station, went out from exit 1 and walk about 10 mins to the Geumgang Park. There are signages along the way, but I would recommend that you took pictures of the places in Korean words and show that when asking for directions. From the park we took the cable car up to the mountain. Where the cable car landed, it was a very nice mountain top. Didn't have time to explore the area and immediately set off to look for the temple. Signages are all in Korean, so photos of the Korean words are useful to have. Look for direction towards the South Gate or South Gate village. From the cable car, it took us 2 hours to reach the temple but it was a nice leisurely walk. From the South Gate to the temple, the signages are few and far in between. Don't walk through the South Gate! We continued on the path where we came and it was descending, away from the South Gate. Continued to look for sign to the village. Even though it was not weekend, there were hikers and we kept seeking confirmation that we were on the right track as there were more than one trail. When descending from the temple, we followed the paved road all the way down. We didn't enjoy the walk down as it was hot and not shaded. However, this was the fastest way to get down. Once we reached the main road, we turned right and walked for about 10 mins before we come to the entrance of Mandeok station."
Breathtaking ,"Now if I knew how far it is- I would not go there. But I did not - and we went there with two kids (one per parents shoulders) Started at the top of the cable carWent walking. But it is worth it - MUST do in Busan, make it TOP of your list.Like I have never seen before. Perhaps being so far away is what makes this spaces unique and not touched. Way back is a little cumbersome - no food connection. But just walk down a day get a cab when yui see what one. "
"Hiking to a small, scenic temple","Seokbulsa is a small and secluded temple located high up in the mountains whose best features are its huge rock carvings and beautiful mountain landscape. I liked it but I don't think I can recommend this to everyone. I got there by getting off at Mandeok Station (Line 3) and hiking for 50 mins all the way up to the temple. I'm 31 yrs old, travelled solo and love hiking so I didn't think the walking part would bother me but it kind'a did. The signages going to the temple greatly put me off my rhythm. About 15 mins on my walk, I saw a huge direction signage saying “800m Byeongpungam Seokbulsa”, so I just kept on walking. After another 15 mins uphill, I saw the same signage saying “800m Byeongpungam Seokbulsa”, I felt cheated. It was a cold, foggy morning (8am) and it was hard for me to appreciate my surroundings, or have an idea of how far I needed to go.20 mins hike from the train station, there's a shortcut trail on your left with a signage written in korean, I suggest you take that. The signage says walking along the road “Seokbulsa 2.2 km” whereas if you take the trail on your left, “Seokbulsa 1.4 km”. The trail is bit steep and can be slippery so be careful but it's a short one and very much worth taking to save 800 m of hiking :) About 40 mins in, you'll see the entrance/ exit trail on your right leading to Geumjeongsan Fortress. Just keep on walking up the paved road and you'll reach Seokbulsa at the end of it.It was a really foggy morning and I only got see bits of the mountain silhouettes but it's still a very beautiful sight. There was no one else around but a live chanting is heard throughout the site via speakers and it puts you in a nice meditative mood. The stone carvings are huge and impressive. I tried to stay for as long as I can (40 mins) so that my hike will be worth it but the temple area is small and except for immersing yourself with the view and details of the carvings, there's not much to do here (unless to pray of course, if you're a Buddhist).(I've uploaded mostly photos of the road/ trail going up.)"
Quarter of a day attraction that takes a full day,"I was choosing between this temple and Haedong Yonggung when I came upon a colorful review about this one. The reviewer was very influential, describing the place as ""one of the best temples in Asia"".It was pretty easy to find based off the simple directions online, but holy mackerel it was exhausting. The climb up was steep and long but decently scenic. And when I finally reached the temple....... womp womp womp. Anticlimactic. The view was basically what are in the pictures and the whole area is pretty small. The stone wall carvings I'd have to say are breathtaking, but after that hike I had no breath to take anyways. If this temple didn't so closely rival Azkaban in terms of accessibility then I'd have given it another star. Its a nice temple, but I`ve worked less for nicer."
a small marvel nestled in a wonderful landscape,"This temple is located in the hills about one hour and a half from Haeundae Beach by public transportation. Getting there is quite an expedition as there are not many buses going there, but presents no major difficulties even for totally non korean speakers. But the effort is worth it. The temple is nestled in a wonderful hill side, facing an opened plain and overlooking a quiet streaming river. The buildings complex is also definitely a architectural marvel. the old wooden buildings are beautifully set in a nice peony garden along the hill. As one climbs to the highest levels, the view unfolds with in the forderground the beautiful Korean old tiled roofs of the temple structures set amidst the lush green. A nice place to laze, sit down several times and look at the details, take your time, bring a few snacks and eat them sitting on a bench on the small opened space in front of the temple overlooking the plain and valley. "
"Amazing view, but hard to get there.","We took a taxi to this temple, what an adventure. The taxi driver got lost and had to call our hotel for the address. The hotel wrote it out, but apparantly it was incorect. The ride was interesting as the taxi drove up and up the hill. The hills were STEEP! At one point he stopped and lost his momentum and then backed into a curb. Therefore it dented the back of his taxi. We asked him it was ok and we'd walk, but he insisted to drive up as high as he can, so he did. We had to pay him extra for his minor accident which techncally wasn't our fault, but whatever. So after the drop off, we still had to walk up some hills, maybe 5 mins. When we finally reached the temple, it was breathtaking. I literally thought it was bigger but it was rather small. It was just a couple of cravings on the wall, but I thought it was more from websites that I saw. Anyway, it was worth the trip. Then we had to walk back down which took about a good hour and then walk to the subway, so maybe 2 hours!? I am so GLAD we took a taxi because it would of taken me hours to walk UP!!! There wasn't much people there when we visited. Thank goodness it was sunny, else I wouldn't recommend going when it rains."
Amazing rock strewn temple with great views!,"A ways outside of Busan this temple is worth the effort going to. It is literally in the middle of 2 cliffs which have various images carved into it.... Very hard to get to which requires quite a harrowing and complicated trek.... Take a taxi, especially if you're more than 3.. Do your business, as toilet facilities are horrible to say the least, and could be your worst experience of your trip."
AWESOME,"This temple is quite difficult to find. We actually went there by walk from the Northern gate of the fortress, so we walked around 2 hours to reach it, but that was definitely worth it! You can also access it by the cable car and then walk for 30-45min. "
Most beautiful temple in Busan!,"The way to the temple was a bit hard on a hot sunny day, but it was totally worth! The view was breathtaking and it was absolutely peaceful. Eventhough it was a saturday afternoon surprisingly nobody else was there. Don`t miss this wonderful place!"
One of the best temples in Korea,"This is one of my favourite temples to go to. It is quite, serene and peaceful. The views are stunning and it really has a good energy about it. "
Small temple with breathtaking views,"Seokbulsa does not seem to be one of the more popular temples - whether because it is smaller than others (like Beomeosa) or because the hike is much more challenging than some can be debated.What can't be debated is the stunning views you will be rewarded with when you finally make it up that final steep incline and turn around. The temple itself is built into stone and - when we visited - had no more than 6 people at a time.There are several ways to go about getting to Seokbulsa, depending on your hiking ability / motivation. We took bus #203 Oncheonjang Station (Orange line) and got off at the Nammum Village stop. From here, you can hike to the South Gate of the Geumjeongsanseong Fortress.Walk through the Gate and you come across Nammun Village. Don't be afraid to ask for directions along the way - it can get a little tricky! You'll walk to walk through the village until you can't go straight any more and then take a right on a dirt path; take a left on a larger dirt path and go until you reach a paved road.The paved road will lead you straight up to the Temple, but be warned - it gets pretty steep! The view when you get to the top, though, will make it all worthwhile.As I said... don't be afraid to ask for help! There will likely be many hikers in this area and most are more than happy to point you in the right direction."
"Great Day Trip, Beautiful Temple","Since I live in Daegu, I took the KTX train to Gumi station. From there it's only a ten minute subway ride to Mandeok Station. Take exit 2 and walk along the road for 15 minutes or so, you'll come across a bus stop called ""Boung Pung Temple Entrance"" (병풍사입구) walk past the bus stop and make a left heading up to Mandeok Duck Village. From there I found it easy to find. Just keep following the signs for Seokbulsa Temple which will be written in Korean (석불사). I've attached pictures showing the bus stop sign and the road you should take after passing the bus stop and walk under the underpass. I didn't find the hike very difficult, it took me about an hour from Mandeok Station but could take longer in hotter weather or with picture breaks. I'd say it's a moderate difficulty hike but not too strenuous."
Wild during lantern celebration,"We came here around Buddha's birthday and the temple was covered with lanterns, illuminated floats out front. We could roam around the temple. You could see the women who run the place napping on the floor of the temple. There was no music that night but there were drums and gongs everywhere. Bus #15 comes here, a roller coaster of a ride. "
"Strenuous Walk/Hike... but, Great View!!!","I followed the online directions to get there. Not too hard. Yet, I do recommend taking a taxi to the park location rather than walking. It is a far walk from the subway exit when coming out from the train. I took the cable cart up to the mountain area, and followed two older Korean men on the location I was trying to get to. Upon arriving at the main area, you have to travel back down to go back up. (Doesn't make since now, but you will see once you get there) After about 35-40 mins of waking. Finally made it to the temple. Great view. It was well worth it! Honestly, the temple is pretty small, but the view make up for it ;-) And I actually met a solo traveler at the temple as well. We both decided to walked back down when exiting the temple. From my knowledge their is a much simpler way to leave the temple without traveling back from your original location. (Sorry, forgot the directions)Overall, it was a great hike and experience traveling to this temple. If your not a walker or active person,. I do not recommend this. Since it is a very strenuous walk/hike to get here. Wear comfortable walking/hiking shoes."
Never give up,"We took the cable car up from Geumgang Park. Then we followed the trail to Nammum. From Nammum, we followed the path indicated by the Mandeokchon sign, leading us to a collection of restaurants and volleyball courts in Nammum village. At the village, we also saw many small plots of home grown vegetables. We kept on going straight, with the stream and rocks beside us. Please copy the name of Seokbulsa temple in Korean, so that you can show to any hikers to ask whether you are on the right path. Luckily, we met a hiker who pointed to us where to turn and looked for the sign Seokbul-sa entrance. At the temple, we saw Buddhist images etched into stone. The carvings are still well preserved and look magnificient. The place with the carvings is now a sacred place and a place of worship. From up there with the auspicious Buddhist images, you can also have a view of the surrounding mountains and Busan. The stone carvings makes this temple unique."
Busan's equivalent of Jordan's Petra,"Took my girlfriend and I no more than 1.5 hours to arrive from Mindeok subway station. The trail is neither easy nor difficult (I'm 27 and my girlfriend is 24) for us. Signs and maps are in Korean. So what we did was say ""Seokbulsa!"" to every hiker we passed, and they pointed us to the right direction.The views from the temple are not very awe-inspiring, but the buddha carvings on the huge boulders did impress me."
Hard to get to but worth the effort,This temple is small but interesting how it is crafted into the rocks. The hike to this temple is challenging but scenic. Not well marked so bring a map and don't be afraid to ask for directions.
Well worth it,"Very peaceful Amazing carvingsLovely place to sit and meditate: you have the carvings area and two small temples you can go insideWe didn't find it too difficult to findWhen leaving we followed the concrete road all the way to the bottom of the hill and met a highway, there is only one bus but t will take you back towards the east gate I think or a decent hub area.. Or taxis were going past.. It's about 30 mins quick downhill when leaving.. And there was one trail that peeled off te right which must have headed north west, which some people took.."
Amazing,"This temple is totally cool and worth the trip. The directions can be a little confusing, and it really depends on where you are coming from. We took the easier route directions-wise, found at this blog: http://meetyouinkorea.com/2014/05/13/how-to-get-to-seokbulsa-temple/Also, the previous comments on Trip advisor are really helpful as well. We just took the cable car to the South Gate and walked from there, probably about 45 minutes of walking. Not very difficult of a hike. We wanted to do the long walk from the South gate then up to the North gate but made our priority the temple instead and it was well worth it."
Getting to the temple,"Continuing onto M9000's description:mandeok station is probably a good starting point, I followed his steps. The highway, very good sidewalk.Second overpass has the bus stop under it, stop's name is something else than seokbulsa.Then onto the left is a smaller road, which has a brown roadsign stating seokbulsa and the other name which is on the bus stop.This road makes a sharp left turn and then another onto right, with a new brown roadsign.Just a little bit left there's an nondescript path to the left, with a water hose. I went to it, wanting to fill up my waterbottle, and noticed cement path leading uphill and a purple sash tied around a stick with symbols for seokbulsa.That lead to a shortcut through a forest, path turned into a trail, but one can easily see that it is well travelled. Sometime later i found couple different colored sashes tied onto a tree branch, which confirmed that I had to be on the right track.Finally the road emerged from the right and I followed it onto the left, maybe 50 meters to a makeshift parking area, over a bridge.From there I just followed the road uphill, steep uphill. For a long time, until a building with a vending machine. From there stone steps on the left, seemed better as the road had a rope blocking the way.It took me 40 minutes to get down, maybe 1,5 hours to get up, i'm not sure.Really guys, hard place to reach.Can't give full points, since it's so difficult to get to."
Getting to Seokbulsa temple,"I will not review the temple as many others did that (and yes it is absolutely astonishing). I would try to provide a more detail description on how to get there (hopefully it will help someone). Based on the online research there are two ways. One is using the metro line #1 and getting off at Oncheonjang Station and the second is via metro line #3 and getting off at Mandeok Station. Getting to the temple via line #1 seems longer and more complicated (you need to make many right decisions and correct turns before reaching the temple). At the temple I meet an American couple who took that path and they said they got lost (but thankfully a local help them and drove them to the temple). I reached the temple by getting off at the Mandeok Station, taking exit 2 and then I walking straight (uphill) besides the highway for about 15 to 20 min. It was a proper sidewalk. On your right there is a highway and on the left there is nothing much but woods. Eventually you will see a bridge above the highway (the first bridge). Under the bridge there is a bus stop and on the left there is some small temple. Perhaps 20m further up there will be a small road on your left and a sign with the temple name will be visible. From this point there were no proper sidewalks and I did not see many people walking (there were long stretches of the road I only saw cars) – not sure it there are some alternative ways to reach the temple without using the main road. So basically I was walking for about 50min on this main road uphill. At one point a small village with many motels (there is also a convenience store) will be visible but otherwise the road is surrounded by woods and I did not feel very comfortable walking on the main road alone. After reaching the road (without sidewalks) I think the way is pretty straight forward (you just need to follow the road). Approximately 10-15 min before reaching the temple the road will split and you need to keep left. Despite being in relatively good shape walking for almost an hour at the angle of like 45degrees was very exhausting and I would not recommend do people who are not very fit. But yes at the exhausting journey is rewarded with an amazing temple and astonishing views!"
Worth the Effort - very beautiful and serene,"Went in August, which is when Korea gets surprisingly hot and humid, and the final 10 minutes will leave you drenched in sweat. Beautiful rock carvings and peaceful surroundings. The area to look around is not large at all but there are interesting nooks to explore."
Korea's best kept secret,"The temple and rock carvings are stunning. It is difficult to find, especially if you don't speak Korean, so start the hike in the morning so you have plenty of time to find it (we climbed down the mountain in the dark!). The surrounding mountain tops provide incredible views of Busan as well."
Totally Awesome,"This is one of my favorite temples in Asia so far. It has a serious Indian Jones vibe. It's quiet, hidden and pretty difficult to get to, and I hope it stays that way. We were one of 3 couples who were at the temple at the time of our visit. It made it feel sacred and deserving of respect. The carvings are incredible and the views of the city are spectacular. The surrounding area is beautiful and the hike up to this temple is a serious added bonus. The landscape feels ancient. It has been shaped by the immense power of the earth and littered with boulders the size of cars. It's movie worthy for sure. If you are feeling up for the adventure, I definitely think this is one of the best hikes/day trips in Busan. "
