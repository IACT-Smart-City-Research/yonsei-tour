Simply stunning especially on a fine day,We spent two days exploring the gardens and wetlands. We rode our free hotel bikes on the first day and left them at the West Gate. We bought a 2 day pass for the 6 local attractions but used it for two entries into the gardens/ wetlands (which I don’t think is meant to happen but we did!) We then took the monorail (sky cube 8000pp return) to the wetlands to catch the last boat trip (7000pp buy tickets at the wharf only) at 16:40 - check times as the timetable depends on the tide). We caught sight of the Observatory across the famous reed beds which we planned to climb to the following day. We were advised that the last monorail back was 5.30pm but we saw them running after that and even up to 6pm on Saturday evening as we were cycling back along the river in the dark! It’s definitely worth a trip and it was busy but not too bad even at the weekend in November and the weather was absolutely stunning. The hundreds of hooded cranes flying across the mountain tops at sunset was a sight I’ll never forget. Trainers are ok and don’t forget to use the compressed air blowers to clean the dust off your footwear after the trek to the observatory! 
Creative board walk in the wetland,"I appreciate the work of those who built the boardwalk for visitors to be very close to nature surrounded by reeds. From the entrance to the top observatory, it is about 2.5km walk. Beautiful scenery. "
Grassy Wetland,There is a low observatory inside the park where you can view the wetland at a height. The path to the end of the wetland is walking along a long wooden bridge with long grass beside. I cannot see any wild live living in the wetland as they are covered by long grass. Maybe the koreans should trim the grass so that more wild live can be seen. Overall the scenary there is good. 
Great way to relax ,"We were here back in August and despite the burning sun we had a wonderful and relaxing time. The area is big and peaceful, and lots of areas with shadow that can cool you off. At the top of the Observatorium we had a great view and we were lucky because a guide approach us and gave us some information regarding the bay. We didn't saw as much birds as I expected but it wasn't the season for this. At the end we stoped at the local restaurant and we drank magnolia tea and eat a delicious desert. It's a must see in this area and it gives you a pozitive energy. "
very nice,is a hooded crane reserve but not the time of year for them migrating. But lovely watching over the wetlands
Must go in Suncheon,I visited here on March. They mentiioned November is best time to visit. Plan to visit again in November
Fabulous day out,This parkland is serenely beautiful and teeming with wildlife of all descriptions. Excellent cafe and visitor centre. Great for everyone and very accessible.
Really prrtty,"Went there right at the hottest summer. To see the sunset, bc of the dusty weather, couldn’t see anything. But it worth to go . "
Suncheon Bay wander,"Suncheon Bay is lovely, it's also very different depending on the season. I would be careful about going in summer, it's very hot and there isn't tons of shade. Spring is beautiful and there is a lovely walk up to the viewpoint."
Beautiful place to enjoy nature,A peaceful place to take a walk and enjoy nature. Suncheon Bay Reeds Festival happens every october and the view here is spectacular. Spend about 1-2 hours walking and enjoying the view.
Very large wetland reserve area,"The sightseeing area is really huge, we only reach until the mud area, and it already takes 1 hour for the round trip course. The museum is also interesting to visit."
Good place for take a walk,Suncheon bay known for its ecoreservation for reed and mud skippers. Quite nice to take walk and enjoying the view. Its quite fun to see the mudskippers and crap too. Dont forget to stop by the local product store near the exit gate. Bought the famous suncheon salt too super nice for bbq
Immerse in nature,"There is something peaceful and calming about the wetlands. When you go deep into the fields, the mountain looks like Tahiti hehe. Find small carbs and mud skippers if you look closely. They were so cute that I got a mold as a souvenir. Also found dried persimmons there, never seen them elsewhere so grabbed a few for the family. Definitely recommend if you are in suncheon"
Bay cruise is worth it. ,"Arrive at Suncheon Wetlands abt 3 pm. Just in time for the evening sunset. As we had to drive to Yeosu we take the ECO cruise. 8000 won each for 30 mins cruise on the bay. Reeds, sea gulls, .... beautiful scenery. Parking is expensive (5000 won). Entrance is 7000 won. Cost a lot. Haha. "
Very pleasant boardwalk stroll and a moderate hike to great views,We spent about 1.5 to 2 hours enjoying the reserve by doing the walk along the boardwalk through the reeds (and looking for mudskippers) while then taking on the more challenging hike up the trail at the back of the reserve to get a beautiful panoramic view of the area. This is a lovely spot to enjoy the unique scenery that Korea has and get in some activity while you are at it.
Beautiful reed trail and wonderful observatories,"This is a wet land park south of Suncheon.It's good to visit together with Suncheon Bay National Garden and Reed Forest Trail.One of the most famous and the best nature sites in Korea. I definitely recommend if you're in Suncheon.- Main attractions are trails in a wet land and observatories on a little mountain.- Seniors with 65+ are free of charge.- If you have much time to visit several other attractions in Suncheon, purchasing 2-day pass can save money. 12,000 won ticket includes Suncheon Bay National Garden(순천만 국가정원), Suncheon Bay Wetland Reserve(순천만 습지), Nagan Eupseong Village(낙안읍성), Suncheon Drama Set(드라마촬영장), Ppurigipeunnamu Museum(뿌리깊은 나무 박물관) and Nagan Folk Recreation Forest(낙안읍성 자연휴양림).- The best time is near sunset. But, Yongsan Observatory at the end is quite far and it's a bit of mountain climbing. You'd better reach the entrance at least 2 hours before sunset to avoid rushing.- The last entrance is during 18:00~19:00. If you can hear yelling at ticket office at that time, it's pretty likely to close.- You can see crabs and mudskippers on a mud or climbing up grasses.- After watching sunset at Yongsan Observatory, it was starting to be dark during our way to leave. For the safety, you'd better escape the mountain before being completely dark. wetland trails are okay. It's even romantic. We were surprise to see no staff everywhere until the ticket office.Location:From Suncheon Bay National Garden, we took Suncheon Eco Trans(Sky Cube). The entrance is 20~30 min walking along the reed forest. Or there's a direct bus from the city center. Bus stop is very close from the ticket office."
Not worth it unless u are a true nature eco freak and that is your true passion,Not worth the trip there. Indeed according to the photos one may get the chance to see. The grass red or white in snow but most of the year it is not more then a trail in the grassland with some water around. Maybe with kids it can be nice.
Great stroll around the park ,"Came here on a really wet day with the rain and gust I couldn't really move, nonetheless this is an absolutely beautiful place especially with the reed field. Would love to return some day on a bright day!"
Excellent Eco park wetlands and museum. Ideal for families,We went here on a Monday in November and here were quite a few visitors.... so if you planned to go I would avoid the weekends if possible when it must be overrun.....All very well laid out boardwalks through the reeds and marshland. Chance to see the hermit crabs and mud skippers.... Lots of birds around but you would really need a good pair of binoculars to appreciate them.There is an extended walk over a small hilly area that I wish we had completed in hindsight... I believe it takes around one hour to complete that circuit and is not too arduous.The museum is laid out mainly for the benefit of children and there is a presentation video of the park in Korean but still easy to pick up the gist of it.Top of the observatory was not open when we were there however here are about six sets of binoculars to look through.All in all a pleasant an easy walk. As I said earlier an ideal family activity. Just avoid the weekends.......
Suncheon Bay Reed Festival,"In November the marshland at Suncheon Bay is filled with beautiful reeds. There is a pathway through these shoulder high (or taller) reeds so that one can walk through the marsh. There are many migratory birds this time of year, traveling from Russia on their way to Australia. Bring your field glasses and enjoy."
Good place to have a walk,I visit this site via a package tour from HK. This attraction is a open area that travelers could have a good relaxation over there.
Loved it,We really didn't expect much when we went and instead found ourselves having a wonderful time and loving the scenery. We really enjoyed watching the crabs in the reeds. the birds were nice. and enjoyed a beautiful sunset. We were really glad would love to visit again in another season.
Loved it!,"We weren""t quite sure beforehand whether we should take the detour through Suncheon while travelling from Seoul to Busan, but were so glad we did it. The park is beautiful and well maintained. We went for sunset and enjoyed great views. Not sure what it's like on weekends, but we went on a thursday and it was not crowded at all. Great place for photography too."
Great place to take photography,Well maintained ecological park where you could view migration birds during winter season. Strongly recommended. This place was selected for Unesco's World Heritage places. 
Wildlife and a spectacular sunset panorama ,"We rented a car in Busan and drove to see this attraction in mid-June, arriving around 5 pm. The walk through the mud-flats and reed beds was very pleasant, with a nice breeze and the sound of oriental reed warblers in the air. The boardwalk kept sightseers out of the mud, but below, mud-skippers and burrowing crabs were easily visible. The sunset view from Yongsan Observatory was well worth the short hike. Don't forget to bring mosquito repellant for the walk back. Once the sun goes down, the mosquitoes and midges will attack en masse."
Unique sunset views,"We visited this place in the late afternoon and made our way to the top of the observatory passing through the reeds and marshes filled with crabs. The view of the wetlands from the top is impressive, especially at sunset although be sure to pack the right camera equipment as any regular phone camera will obviously capture subpar darkened images against the sunlight."
Peaceful place for a walk,"I only stayed here about an hour but enjoyed a peaceful walk around the wetlands, looking out for crabs in the mud. There were boats offering cruises down the river and a museum but I did not have time to visit these. "
Nice stop to see the plants & flowers,"During the summer when the flowers are blooming this would be beautiful. The plants from all over the world were beautiful but I think we were there a little before their prime bloom season. This is a huge area, so there is a lot of walking involved. It is mostly flat though so a stroller or wheelchair would be easy to use."
The most beautiful natural area in Suncheon. Definitely a Must visit!,Great nature with constructed landscapes. Beautiful bay specially in autumn season when the riddles turns to brown. The whole bay is a great spot for photography. Ensure you walk up to the view point on Yongsang Mt. It is easy short walk but view is amazing. The city itself is small with convenient transportation and friendly locals. Local food are absolutely tasty with many side dish.
Nice walk in November ,"I went with my family there for around two hours. If you like to walk in the nature then this is for you. Nice scenery, with mountains in the background. If you like photography, be prepared with your gears. You will need a wide angle and a zoom lens to catch the birds. "
A world-class huge wetland to visit,"This wetland park is a huge one and among the largest globally. The reeds were just all over and the scenery would have been better had I been there on a sunny day. You may think that there is not much to see as the sea of reeds is so spacious that after a long walk the scenes do not look too different. Do not forget it is the imposing scenes of such a scale which count. If you have time, stay there for more than 90 minutes to enjoy it. The colourful ducks and flying birds around will be missed out if you have neither a binocular not powerful zoom with your camera. They make good photo subjects especially if you get make use of composition with tree leaves of different colours and the reed waves around. Remember to watch and take photos from all directions in order not to waste your visit! A visit time with a setting sun will be most ideal."
Beautiful Natural Sceneries,The wetland was beautiful and well preserved. The walk up and down to the top was pleasant too. We went on an overcast day and couldn't see the sunset. I could imagine it would be spectacular on a sunny day.
Suncheon Bay Wetland,This is a natural wetland where when the tides go out it exposes a lot of surrounding land and exposes the marshland exposing different kinds of marine creatures.
huge area,"try to squeeze in 1 day if you can! this is a huge place. try the monorain one way, so youdon't need to take another long walk back (when you had it RT). need to add more english signs."
Easy walk and great landscape,"That's a cloudy day, cross a reed field and took a easy walk to Yongsan Observatory. Failed to see the sunset but wonderful experience there."
Nice place for a stroll and to learn about conservation,"Suncheon is an Eco-friendly city and the place is carefully set up with that in mind. A good place to visit especially during spring and autumn, may be a bit too warm for summer and too cold for winter."
Well managed eco park ,"Since we had a limited time to visit the whole eco park , we just spent in the museum and the planetarium . Otherwise we had to walk ca 1 hour to reach the observatory place at the end of the park to see the whole wetland. But indeed our visit in the museum also worth it , we know to learn about the ""wet land"" with their ecological system and their benefits for human being . Why we have to preserve this important area to support the nature as it is to the benefits of the whole eco system . Planetarium visit is not so comprehensive as I expected , so no Wasting time visit this. But on the upper floor you have the telescope that you may. Enjoy the surrounding . Another place in adjacent of this is the museum shop is worth it to visit with their exquisite collection with reasonable prices and also other consumable items that you may need to buy as a gifts It is worth to visit for the nature lovers and environmental enthusiast"
One of Sunset mecca in Korea,"All season can enjoy fresh air, beautiful scenery and delicious food.Specially clean Autumn day Sunset is gorgeous."
"Unforgettable views, great for eco-lovers and scenic wetland views","This place is unmissable. For its lovely walk to the Observatory which allows you to see some spectacular mud flats separating with riverine ducts. In November, look out for the cranes. Great place all year round to see why and how Suncheon is trying to be THE ecologically sensitive city of Korea. The Reed Fields look gorgeous in the sun. Plan for a minimum half day out here. Bus no 66 or 67 gets you here and the place is now called Suncheonman Bay Ecological Park. Tip: If you are traveling Korail to get here, show ticket to get entry discount. Restaurants close to the bus stop in this pension like village can help with picking up picnic stuff. Enjoy a stroll staring at crabs, birds, open fields and a walk upto seeing a spectacular sight in Korea."
Beautiful,If you are lucky enough to get to visit on a weekday you can really enjoy the beauty of this park. The reed fields are beautiful. The walk way has some cute photo spots that are fun to take pictures. If you have the time take the short 45 minute hike to the observation deck on top the small hill. It is a fairly easy hike and the views are really beautiful. If you go on the weekend be prepared for huge crowds. If you do the hiking then I would recommend skipping the boat ride but if you don't want to hike pay the extra $7 and take to boat.
Midsize but still charming,"This place is worth a visit when you are in Suncheon. But do not expect it to be grand. Just like any tourist site in Korea, it is midsize but still charming. If you go there on early evening you will be able to see beautiful sunset from the hilltop where you can look down on the whole Suncheon Bay Eco Park. But before this view, be prepared to walk through the towering reeds and do some moderate 45 min. hiking to the top."
A great place to see coastal Korea,We went on a chilly morning and it was beautiful to see the sun come up and observe the birds. The boardwalks are well kept and the connector trail up the hill to the observation platforms give a great view of the estuary. I'd recommend going early if on the weekend - there were lots of people by mid morning coming in on droves of buses!
A Bit of a Rip off,Yes this is a great place to come to try to see rare birds and the reed beds however the track to the mud flat bird hides was closed for some bizarre reason and you could not get a close view of the tidal flats or the birds. Yes saw plenty of birds but only from quite a distance. 
Nice bay but very crowded on Sundays,"Avoid the place on Sundays, very crowded. The park is quite small and can be visited in 3 hours. Therefore, we highly recommend to stay in the city of Suncheon rather than Suncheon Bay which has no place of interest except the park."
A real eye opener,"We only had time to walk partway through the reed field here. Initially we had planned to take the boat ride but as the staff members were on lunch break when we were there, we could not take the boat. However, viewing the reeds from the boardwalk was rewarding enough. Even during the short visit, we could see herds of birds flying overhead and of course there was a lot of the reed field that we did not have time to cover. It was just a pit stop to check it our en route to Boseong. We will certainly plan a reasonable amount of time/days to do both the Gardens and the Ecological Park on our next visit. Highly recommended for anyone who loves to escape from the concrete jungle for nature."
No regrets making my way here!,"This place is totally worth a visit when in Suncheon. The most beautiful sunset can be seen here. But before this spectacular view, do be prepared to walk through the towering reeds and enjoying the views of the different migratory birds, and do some hiking."
Suncheon Bay Eco Park,"Youn can see sandbanks and reeds there. In winter, lots of migrant birds come here to pass severe winters. You can walk up to a hilltop where ou can look down on the whole Suncheon Bay Eco Park. I think that the sun at the hilltop is very beautiful and the sunset is a must-see. Also, you can see international gardens, remnants of International Garden Expo."
Best Sunset ever,"Imagine walking through towering reeds swaying in waves along with the wind and spotting flocks of migratory birds flying in the distance. It was surreal and almost magical. It was also fun to spot cute mudskippers who looked like they got stuck the stages of evolution and tiny crabs crawling sideways from hole to hole. There were also small wooden boats just hanging out along the streams, adding a nostalgic touch to the scenery. The bay was so huge that I felt like I had the whole place to myself. You can find out more about Suncheon at honjatravel.wordpress.com."
Beautiful and educational,"Come for the beauty, but get an education while here. Plan on a 45 minute hike at minimum. Beautiful and easy to walk."
Come to California for better bird watching and nature too,"What a disappointment. I lived in the marsh area of SF bay where the nature is ten times more beautiful and number and variety of birds are many times more. It was really like a circus in Suncheon Mar. Hoards of people wearing rain coats started walking over the assigned path to see birds. A few Egrets and Herons were there but with that many people all stomping, talking, taking photos, one can imagine what the birds will do. Admission fee is hefty and it is yet another place for Korean domestic tourists to go in tour bus loads. Also, it is in the middle of yet another ugly Korean city suburb. Suncheon, however has good, inexpensive food."
"Beautiful park, must see if in the Suncheon area","We stayed in Suncheon during the last weekend in May on our way to Boseong and were so happy we visited the Eco Park. We were lucky to have blue skies that day, so against the green reeds, the area was very picturesque. We took a 15 min/$12 taxi ride from the center of Suncheon to the park. It takes around an hour for a leisurely stroll through the reeds and another hour to hike to the top of the mountain for a great view of the marsh (definitely worth the hike up). There is also a 30 min boat ride (closed on Mondays) which takes you through the marsh, but buy your tickets as soon as you get there as they can sell out quickly. If you're in the area, definitely check out Suncheon bay for a relaxing afternoon in the park."
A Sanitized Visit to the Marshes,"We visited during the last weekend of April/first weekend of May. There would have been a lot of visitors over the weekend, but it happened to be raining when we visited. The Suncheon marshlands are famous so I was looking forward to this visit. However, I realized that being a famous site means that there would be a lot of visitors so having a huge crow visit a tidal area could wreak havoc on the natural environment. The powers that be have solved this by putting in a zig-zagging boardwalk over the marshes. So once you get past the minor indoor exhibits, you are essentially walking on a wooden walkway situated about 3-4 feet above the marshes. As you go buy you can spot a lot of crabs and a type of fish that lives in the mud. All in all it makes for a nice walk but you don't really get into the marshes. There is no opportunity to jump in the mud and catch crabs. This was a disappointment for my 9 year old son but I guess I see the reason. Having tourists walk directly in the mud and catching crabs would have destroyed the place in a matter of weeks.After a 10-15 minute walk through the boardwalk area, which is relatively flat, you arrive at the entrance of a small mountain. At the end of the hike up the mountain, there is a vista where you can take pictures of the marshlands. The hike up was not that easy. There are some tough uphill stretches, but the hike up is rewarded with the view. My wife and 9 year old decided to wait while I hiked up the mountain. It was worth it and a good workout.So in the end was it worth it? It's do-able once, but probably I would not return. There are other more natural areas around Korea like Namhae and Songdo where you can go into the tidal areas and run around catching crabs, shrimps, octopus, clams. This was a bit too sanitized for us. If you are looking for a picturesque walk for an afternoon, this would fit the bill - although I am sure the crowds would be an issue if there is nice weather."
"Great place,but bad luck with weather","We were there about 2.5 hours and all time was drizzling rain, but scenery with reed fields, and low tide marshes was amazing, and when we got to the top of hill above bay ,view despite of rain was great, just wish sunny day to other tourist visiting this place."
Interesting,I liked how the staff in the observatory explained the diplays in detail and the displays were really good. Walking on the tracking bridge was fun and they had a really good view and good air but it was windy that day in spring so we didnt get to see any birds but fortunately we saw some crabs and we had fun.
A great scenery,"Our visit was at the early spring. The view was outstanding. But because it was a wide open area, the wind was a bit strong. "
Great scenery,Great for pictures. The reed fields are beautiful and the walk to Yongsan Observatory is very refreshing. Better not go on Mondays since the trains and boats inside the park stop services. The canteen near the exit is quite good. The soup with fish cakes and rice dumplings is delicious. 
Worth visit in different seasons,"I visited in the early winter so the place was quite bare of the migrating birds other than the ducks. Still it was as beautiful! The dried reeds had its own way of swaying in the wind that made the picture beautiful. The walk on the boardwalks was wonderful as you could take marvelous pictures of people and the scenery.The walk to the Yongsan Observatory (remember to walk till the end) was a walk not recommended for those who couldn't take steep slope and steps. However, for whose who did, you would be repaid with a spectacular view! We didn't get to see the sunset but am sure it would be marvelous. The 'S' shape sea route was obvious and great foreground for the mountains behind it.The front and the cafeteria may be visited after you finished your climb to the top. The weather didn't allow us to visit the garden but I am sure I would love to visit this place and the garden again in different seasons to see its different colours and beauty."
Beautiful,"It is beautiful, and with this ticket you can also see the garden in the same day, I would recommend going at sunset, but make sure you leave atleast 40 ish minutes to get all the way to the top or you'll have to be rushing if you want to get to the top to watch."
Stunning,"Make sure the sky is clear when you head to Suncheon Bay. Try to be at the ticket counter about 1-2 hours before sunset, then you'll get a view that you don't forget so fast!!"
Beautiful colors and nice park stroll,"We spent about 1-2 hours walking in this nice park, with beautiful flowers and nicely sewn grass, apart from the city noise.It is advisable if you have a free afternoon and wish a quite place "
Superb great scenery on the hilltop,"At first, I thought that Suncheon Bay Eco park is a wetland with just reeds, crabs and mud skippers. We walked the long boardwalk and managed to walk till the end of the steeply hilltop and we realized that the scenery from the hilltop is omg spectacular! Worth visiting!"
Surprisingly good,"We visited in May 2014 to do the ""sunset walk"". This was further (and steeper) than I expected. The walk accross the boardwalks to the start of the hill was lovely and the climb to the the observation point through the woods, with the smell of wild jasmine, was much better than I had expected. Although the first part of the park was a bit ""contrived"" with the planetarium and cafe and manicured gardens, the rest of the park is wild and beautiful."
Check if it's open first,"Apparently, this place closes when there are Avian Flu scares in order to protect the birds. We arrived a little after it had reopened, but even then, there had been measures put in place to protect the birds: one, you go through a purple xray looking machine to disinfect you; two, the boat tours were out of commission. So, if you don't want disappointment at the door, do call ahead and make sure it's open. Their website might not have anything up about the park being closed.If it is open, you're allowed in up until one hour before sunset or so, which mind you, is not exactly enough time to get from the entrance to the top of the mountain for the famous ""sunset"" view, which is quite pretty. We arrived at four pm and leisurely walked through the reeds and up the mountain to the main observation deck (note that there are a couple of observation decks..., you'll know you hit the main one when the road ends). The observation deck has three levels, but it fills up with tons of people with big cameras. From above, you can see the birds lining the waters. There are tons of them. Once the sun sets, most people leave, though no one will kick you out. People just seem to want to get out before the park gets dark (there are zero lights). As slower walkers, we ended up using moonlight on our way out. Overall, a nice experience. The boat tour might have been nice too, but then, you never know what you're carrying on your clothes or what not."
Splendid and serene,"It was a regret that I couldn't spend more time there. The huge reeds field and the bay, I felt very tranquil taking a stroll in the park. I would love to visit it again during the autumn season, where it will be filled with exotic colours of flora."
"Suncheon Bay, green, green reeds in September","A coastal wetland more beautiful in April/May I was told because of the colours. At only ~2 USD (2,000KRW) too, though access is not too convenient from Yeosu town. I took a bus then a taxi there because the connecting bus was just hourly. The reeds are taller than the average person though you cannot stand inside it as I had imagined when viewing the internet photos. Not that I was trying to hide from the police or something. A breathtaking view to me, nonetheless. Don’t forget to observe the various mudflats inhabitants that could just escape your sight if you pass by too quickly, not to be missed by nature-loving persons. I walked maybe more than 2 kilometers to a hill within the wetlands to have a spectacular view of the mudflats and loose some fat on the go. Worth it. On the way up the hill one can see the green padi fields far reaching to a small mountain range. There was also a boat ride along the meandering stream through the wetland but I didn’t try that. Yes, I would not mind coming again in April/May to enjoy the brown, brown, reeds of Suncheon Bay."
Suncheon Flower Festival,"If you love touring botanical gardens, waterfalls, and garden features while seeing hundreds of varieties of trees, flowers, flora, and fauna then this is a site NOT to be missed! Bring a Korean-style picnic lunch or snacks though as the on-site restaurant was pricey and left much to be desired."
A Beautiful Display of Nature,"It was a blasting experience of scenery. From the moment I walked into the main wetland area, I was greeted with a vast area of reeds which swayed and rustled. There wasn't a crowd when I visited the place and hence could experience the full power of the serenity of the place. Behind these reeds were mountains added with a very blue sky and pretty clouds. It was therapeutic. Looking down from the sides of the board walk, there were many crabs scuttling around minding their own business. Occasionally on wetter patches of the mud, I saw mud skippers. Following the board walk, it led me to the path up a hill to Yongsan observatory It was quite a long hike but it was very worth it. The view which greeted me was too satisfying. I would recommend taking the hike an hour before sunset and do make sure the weather is not very cloudy (else it is likely that the sun would be covered by clouds). Do go there if you are a nature lover."
No place like this in the world,"Suncheon is an extremely beautiful and serene place of South Korea. We arrived there by KTX, grabbed a taxi driver to take us several places for 8 hour shift day $150 flat rate. This park was the second stop after temple visit. There is a train ride inside the park with a small fee that will take you around. I thoroughly enjoyed relaxing coffee time in the Cafe. It is a romantic place to visit with a lover....indeed, I have a fond memories of this place. We spent about two and half here before we headed to old traditional village which was located not too far from here. Scenery of late Autmn was absolutely breathtakingly beautiful. A MUST place to visit while in Korea. The World flower festival park was also worth visiting if you are serious macro photographer. You can easily spend a whole day here.... I shall return in Spring time of 2014. By Sunny.Kim65"
Suncheon bay is great but...,"Last time I went there, the ecogeo Expo has begun and it kinda ruins the serenity another reviewer mentioned. Go there after the expo ends. There are too many people that you have to stay in a queue to look around. "
Serene!,"I expected that Suncheon Bay would ""wow"" me and I wasn't disappointed. The view from the hilltop is magnificent! My son enjoyed the short train ride to the Literature Center. I enjoyed my walk on the boardwalk. On the day we were there, the tour guide said 100,000 visitors came on the previous day. Wow!"
Quiet unexpected....,"the whole of the Suncheon Bay area is a designated Eco park and there is a lot to see. Take in the Bay, walk across the boardwalks through reeds, up the mountain for the view and watch the hooded cranes. Also go to the Wetlands park with its newly created gardens and traditional buildings and just absorb the experience. The 6 month long International Garden Expo is located next door where you can explore many gardens from across the world. This is relatively new so these show gardens and their installation are still rather hit and miss - its certainly not Chelsea Flower Show or Chaumont, but give it time, in a few years' time it will be quite something else. I hate crowds so make sure you are out early if you want to miss the masses of visitors that will invade these Eco parks."
Where you can enjoy the panoramic natural.. Very good.,"CYC ( 2013.4.19 ) There was a great place to walk and enjoy nature. This place consist of tidal flats, reed, small river and sea. view of things consisted was complete harmony of nature, I think. This place was massive, so if you enjoy this place, you need to walk and hiking about 4 km in round-trip. About 1km walk through a forest of reeds, and should be approximately 1km hiking. If you enjoy this place, go until observatory. I would like to recommend here."
An easy way to experience the beauty of tidal flats,"Although much different than the mangrove swamp and tidal lands of the Sunderbans in West Bengal, India, the tidal flats of Suncheon Bay are very accessible to the public. Its extensive system of well-built boardwalks makes it easy for all to get right up close to the different sections of the flats. Excellent documentaries in the experience buildings showed how beautiful and diverse the area is during the seasons, thus making it a great place to revisit. The upper floor of the observatory building has some free high-powered viewers which allow visitors to see birds farther away, or just to enjoy during inclement weather."
Excellent hiking site,"Trails up the mountain, gift shop had lots of interesting items. Beautiful natural setting with changing landscapes according to the seasons. Very unique ecological experience."
Simply Breathtaking,"This offers a great breakaway from the rustle of City life. The endless fields of reeds and tidal flats offer nothing but picturesque sights. For those who are physically fit or those into photography, invest some time to go a hike up the hill. You will be well-rewarded with an unparalleled view. Do not forget your camera! There's going to be a huge event here next year."
Suncheon Bay,"One of the most unique and beautiful features of Korea's southern coast are the tidal flats. These tidal flats are of enormous ecological importance. Suncheon Bay is one of the most picturesque tidal flat locations in southwestern Korea. The site is spread out over a wide area, protecting various endangered species. The natural formations of the reed fields are a wonder of nature.I believe Korea has 4 natural areas that are truly exceptional. Within the mainland Seoraksan National Park, Jirisan National Park, and the Southwestern Coast Tidal Flats. On the volcanic island of Jeju, the entire island is full of natural wonders above and below ground.Visit Suncheon Bay in the spring when the reeds and flowers are spectacular sights. Suncheon Bay is one of the highlights in Jeollanam-do, one of Korea's best regions for nature."
Treasured Gem,"Having lived in S. Korea for two years, this tops as one of my favorite places to visit! I went down to visit the Yeosu expo and that was just crazy full of people, I'm not a fan of crowds so this was a literal breath of fresh air. It was peaceful and beautiful and I could hear nothing but the sounds of the reeds swaying in the wind. Hubby and I decided to trek the hike up the mountain at the end of the deck trail and it was worthwhile to see the view. The drawback is that it's sorta in the middle of nowhere but I suppose it's the price to pay for such beauty."
Suncheon Bay - Eco Bay where you can meet real nature,"reed, migrant birds, little baby crabs in the mud with very cute goggle eyed goby!! this goggle-eyed goby who sleeps 6 months during winter, pops up from the mud field and digs in the whole of the mud. that was nice secene I ever saw. wonderful nature. if u hike a bit to the top of the observatory, u can see whole Bay with nice rustic & peaceful, pitoresque secene... if u go to the little muse at the left side of the gate, there is introductory filme which takes 5~7 mins, in English, French, Japanese, Chinese and Korean! Year 2013, they will open gardening fair next to this bay for several months from spring to fall, so it would be better chance to visit here together. Personally, I prefer the fall season for the sightseeing in Korea so I recommend u to visit here in fall... u will gonna love it."
