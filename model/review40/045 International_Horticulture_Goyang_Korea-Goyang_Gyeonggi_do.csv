One of a kind!,"So happy I got a chance to visit this place! It's an annual festival, and I ended up coming on the last day. There are lots of flower displays, outdoor and indoor. Also some competitions and exhibitions. Since it is located in the Ilsan Lake Park, it's a really nice place to hangout and unwind as well. Not many food options as it is just a festival and there was only a few food trucks around. But it is one of a kind, and it's not too far from Seoul. Definitely a must visit attraction during Spring!"
