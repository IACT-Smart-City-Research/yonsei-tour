One of the most Important historical sites in South Korea,"If you are visiting Korea, you have to visit this site. Instead of visiting one of those highly Sinicized Joseon Palaces, it is great to visit this site and the museum to understand the true classical heritage of Korea. It is one of the most serene and peaceful places I could visit."
Too far but it is ok to visit,Well this is too far but it is ok to visit. There are nothing much inside but the area is huge. As it used to be temple in old time so the preserve well. 
Historical temple site..,"C1 ( 2015.08.05 ) This place was old temple site, and there was a little relics. Though this place was famous for Baekje's site, but not many things to see. Big temple pagoda was restoring and had wide site. If this pagoda finish restoring, this place was very beautiful place."
"Remember the word, ""Site""","There WAS a temple, hundreds years ago, but now? nothing. If you're fond of history, or majoring in Korean or East Asian history, this place might worth a visit. Otherwise, spend more time in Jeonju, or other major cities."
Quite interesting,"Although the site was totally destroyed, one of the stone pagodas have been rebuild, and tge other one is currently been rebuild too. The museum, free of access is very interesting, and it explains very well how the temple used to look like. The people in the museum don't actually speak english, but they are very nice and try to be as helpful as possible."
Currently undergoing reconstruction,"Although at one time it must have been very impressive, it is currently being repaired and it's not possible to see the big stone pagodas which used to be 30 meters in height because they are behind some wooden structure. There was a small scale model of how the temple used to look and it was a bit difficult to get there by bus as it was about an hour bus ride and then a quick look around, and then waiting for a return bus. Unless you are very interested in this temple, I would recommend waiting until they finish their rebuilding before going."
