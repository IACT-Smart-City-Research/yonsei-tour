Unique experience,"Quite a unique experience, scenery along the ride is quite nice as well. It is a good activity to relax though you need to put some effort to get the nice scenery. "
Surprisingly fun. Awesome views,Didnâ€™t expect to have as much fun as I did pedaling through the sceneries. Pedaled with my sister and parents and we all had a blast. Adorable dogs at the entrance of the attraction. Good stop after Nami Island.
Great view!,"Despite the cold weather during our visit, it was really nice riding the rail bike with my friends because of the different views that we enjoyed a lot. There were mountains, farms, caves with beautiful lights and houses to be seen."
Good for all ages,"We went here last Dec. 2, 2017, it was cold but we wanted to do something adventurous so we decided to try this rail bike with them. I thought it would take us an hour and a half to get to the end of the trail but it only took us 30 minutes. But even though the trail was shorter than I anticipated, the view is jaw-dropping. This is a definitely recommended activity to try in Korea."
Funny train!,"Almost half an hour riding on a paddle train was my first ever experience. Excitement came while moving under the tunnels which were decorated with different themes. Although it was very cold weather, it couldn't interrupt our enjoyment. "
Rail Park,"It was almost 30mins of cycling on the rail bike, but it was fun & cooling! Weather was good and the scenery was beautiful! Though there was a bit of constructing still going on, it did not ruin the whole experience. This was an interesting experience in Korea, especially on a train rail track.The tunnel was filled with different ""theme"" to spice up the entire experience.The cycling was smooth.Another half of the journey was riding on the train itself, so dont need to worry about sore legs. Haha.A minor note: The restroom at the end of the cycling (before we take the train back to the entrance) has no water for washing hands! So do prepare some wet tissue, or water for your own cleansing."
interesting place,"Old railway can be so interesting and fun like that. Good, fun and healthy activity. Really love the view along the way."
Unique attraction,This is a great way to experience the Korean countryside. The total track is 7.2 kilometers long and half of it is in descent. Please be advised to book tickets in advance.
Deep cut in Seoul,"This is the third time I visit South Korea with my dear. We love Korean food and shopping but this time we've planed for a different itinerary. We went to the rural area of Korea on July.The transportation will be quite complicated but luckily for us everything run so smooth that we got there only in 3 hours since we got on the bus at Jeongdongjin Station at 0645. Certainly it's not a short journey But after you arrived the starting point of the jeongseon rail bike, You will find it worth!!!So next time when you want to visit Korea but already tire about only shopping , spend a day in Jeongseon! "
Fun activity for family,It was a fun activity to do as a family though the prices for the rail bikes were quite steep! We had fun peddaling and going pass plantation fields and into caves. Nicely done!
So Much Fun!!!!,"It was so much fun!!!! an activity which is suitable for friends, family and couples.u can enjoy the beautiful scenery along the rail road. definitely will go again with my beloved family."
So much fun!,"I made a reservation for a two-seat and a four-seat bike. I wasn't able to pay but I called them the day before our schedule and they said to just come and buy the tickets on site. We were at the Rail Bike station by 10:10 am and I was able to buy the tickets. My husband accompanied his parents in the four-seater while I and my son took the two-seater. The bike was easy to pedal ~ in fact my 9-year old son did it most of the time. The only time I took over was during the last kilometer ~ it was a little tough.The scenery is just beautiful in the middle of June. The trees are in full bloom ~ everything is just so alive. On the way back, we took the free train and again ~ I was awed by the beauty of the scenery. Definitely worth the trip from Seoul!"
Working trip worked wonders!,"In preparing for this trip, I read whatever I could about getting to the railbike. In a nutshell, there wasn't much written on how to actually get there. Booking website was in Korean, had to have Korean mobile number and such to do bookings, KTO at my local country wasn't too helpful - all in all, a bit of a headache. Kudos to the English-speaking KTO staff at KTO Myeongdong - she called, googled and gave us detail instructions on buses to take, she made bookings for the railbike and train pension (to stay overnight) and Arirang train to return to Seoul. And so, I shall share on what we did and hopefully help you in experiencing the railbike with minimal headache:1. Took a bus from Dong Seoul Bus Terminal - go to Gangbyeon Station (Subway Green Line 2), bus terminal is across the road. Ticket from Seoul to Jeongseon KRW19,800 (therabouts) leaves at 7am. Alternatively, you can take the Arirang train (also know as A-train) from Cheongnyangni Train Station - more expensive KRW26k ticket, longer ride but there's entertainment onboard.2. Reached Jeongseon Bus Terminal around 10:45am. Took local bus from Jeongseon to Gujeol-ri (Yeoryang Bus Terminal) KRW2,700 around 11:35am - make sure you have exact change, ticket machine on bus can't take KRW10k note - someone found out the hard way :p3. Reached Yeoryang Terminal at Gujeol-ri around 12ish noon. Changed to smaller local bus for Auraji Railbike KRW1,000 around 12:30pm. You can use the restroom next to Nonghyup Bank (turn right at main road and walk down). You can also see to the fish cafe (about 80m walk) - this is the terminating spot for the railbike from Auraji.4. Reached Auraji around 12:50pm - bus driver loudly announced arrival. Railbike is just across the road. Staff were waiting for us 'cos the KTO staff booked the 1pm ride for us 5 days earlier :) They kindly stowed our bags for us and hurried us off to the railbike.5. Ride took about half hour even though we were delayed by a wild deer trying to cross the tracks - yes, a live wild deer! And boy, was it cold on 1Apr - brrrr.....6. Reached fish cafe at Gujeol-ri. Since we were staying overnight at the train pension, we took the free train ride back to Auraji. If you're returning to Jeongseon, just change bus at same terminal (I think there are hourly buses departing on the :30 - pls ask to confirm).Even though it took a lot of work to get to the railbike, it was worth the experience!"
Great fun with spectacular scenery,There are rail bikes for two or four people. The track runs through the beautiful locales. Grab a blanket from the ticketing booth during cold months. It can be chilly as the rail bikes zoom through the mountain sides and through the tunnels.
Family & Friend & Couple 's fun activity - Rail Bike in Gangwon!!,"I was planned for this tour a month ago, the rail bike at Jeongseon must be reserved at least a month before during Spring, Summer, Autumn..maybe you can get 2weeks before in Winter period. Anyways, I checked the website many times to secure and get information about this tour.There are 2 type of seats available, one with 2pax and the other one is 4pax. The journey of tour is about 40min. and you can see small valley, country houses, mountains and beautiful scenery. At the end of finishing point of the rail, we met - Fish shape cafe. And the old shape of trains cafe, rest place gave us very good memorable feeling."
Good Experience with beutiful landscape,"CYC ( 2013.07.31 ) This railroad was operated train several years ago. but, train was not operated now. So now this railroad recycled by attration with railbike. This railbike time is about 30 minutes with beautiful landspae and fantastic tunnel. During biking, you can feel cool breeze, see mountain, small river. Especially, with family or lover, more happy."
