Good beach :),"Very good for relax and some swimming (water in September was not too hot). If you had a time - visit a nice small island ahead, very recommended! :)"
Relax time in Hyeopjae ,Wonderful beach in Jeju island. Very clear water. Amazing colors and good vibes all around. You can spend here one day to have relax and chill out. And If you want you can walk around. There are close to the beach a lot of restaurants and cafés 
Lovely sandy beach and very clear waters,"The beach by bus is easy to get to the bus stop is located about 1 or 2 minutes away, the beach is clean and the water is lovely and blue"
Massive... not setup for swimming at low tide,Car parking near the beach is a nightmare... too many cars... cars parked improperly... but at least it was free.I really like this beach as it was very clean... although there were a lot of people the beach can easy absorb them due to its size... lots of cafe and coffee shop nearby I arrived at low tide and it wasn’t suitable for swimmers as the deepest point (next to shark nets) was only up to my thighs. So I was disappointed by that.. maybe it’s a lot better during high tide....Another negative is you have to pay to use the SHOWERS.. 3000w for adult and 2000w child.... shower gel and shampoo is available... for a price
"Calm, clean and beautiful beach","Water was very clear and sand was clean. There are some shops on the beach, and toilet facilities close by. Plenty of eating places around the area too. A nice beach to spent a day or just a little while. There are people firing fireworks at night. So if you happen to be there when that happen, you are in for some light show."
Nice beach for a walk and pictures,My girlfriend and I went for a walk here and sat on a bench to watch the sun go down. It was a picturesque setting which we enjoyed. There are hundreds of little rock piles people have built which I recommend seeing. We were not there to swim but the water felt good on the feet!Shane & Jill
Picturesque Photo Op Spot,We visited this beautiful beach as part of the Western Discovery Tour organized by Yeha Bus tours so we were only given a limited time to experience the beach. We visited during the early days of spring so it was still quite chilly. The views of the beach are undeniably breathtaking. Ten minutes is more than enough to get in those nice shots.
Beautiful Beach,"We go to Hyeopjae beach whenever in Jeju, lovely sand, good safe swimming, great rocks to climb over, the grandkids love it"
Average beach,"Of the beaches we visited in Jeju, this one was disappointing. The ground sand is covered in matting (likely to prevent erosion) and the area seemed a little untidy. "
Beautiful ,The beach is nice with a combination of sand and rock. Korean people use EVERY available inch of land. They pull their trailers and cars right to the edge of the beach and set up camp. Don’t understand why swimming wasn’t allowed. People were wading in the water. 
Lovely view and cafes ,Visited Monsanto cafe and found there are afew other cafes there next to each other. It's a must go if you love beautiful beaches. 
Photogenic colour of sea,"The colour of Hyeopjae beach is real. it is not edited. It was very beautiful, the black coral makes it perfect."
Crystal Clear Water,"One of the best beaches in Jeju, we loved this place for its cobalt colored crystal clear water and fine white sand and the view of Mount Hallasan.Our kids enjoyed playing in water and collecting seashells, while we enjoyed walking along the shore.Food stalls, shops, umbrella rentals are available."
Clear water,Beautiful sand beach.Couldn't swim coz we visited during the autumn. It'll be too cold for us to swim.It's amazing to see lava rocks stacked at one corner of the beach. We had a very nice lunch nearby. Love their seafood noodles soup; but I forgot the name of the restaurant. Sorry guys. 
Beautiful sunset!,We are so glad we managed to catch such a beautiful sunset here! Had a cuppa latte at the cafe. There are plenty of cafe and restaurants around. Plenty of parking lots too! 
Great ,Wonderful beach. I stayed a short while and had a coffee it s a great place to relax go early avoid the crowd 
Beautiful,It's beautiful but really cold. I dipped my foot in the water because I didnt see it The water was so clear.. the sunset is soooo beautiful
Clear waters,"Went to hyeopjae beach just to try swimming while i was in Jeju. Rented a car and drove there, thought that parking was gonna be a challenge but managed to get one in mere minutes. Mum didnt swim, so we rented an umbrella + mat for her to wait at. Cost us 15K won. Not sure if it was cheap or expensive. They guy attending to the rental didn't speak english, thank God for a local young chap who helped us translate.Loved the vibe of the beach, everyone there was enjoying the waves. Where I'm from, our sea is not as rough. so it was really different to see everyone in their floaties waiting for waves to hit them."
Good,"If you wanna experience to swim in the ocean and in the volcanic water, this is the place. You hire the spot for couple of hours and until 6."
"Lovley beach, great views","This beach is adjecent to GeumNeung Beach - you can walk between them. Hallim Park is also next to it - all are walkable from each other. There are plenty of shops and umbrella rentals, etc. Camping is avaiable at the next door beach. Some areas are not for swimming due to strong currents. Lovely view of a nearby island. You can take the 202 bus from the 5 day market near the airport. Takes about an hour."
Black lava beach,"I stayed here for a couple of hours, swam, enjoyed the sun discussed the Jeju routs with young travellers. We laughed a lot & practiced 3 languages. Black lava beach is happy noisy place:-)"
Beach,"This beach is good and definitely worth visiting. Admittedly, it didn’t live up to what I had expected when I heard beach. however, I think this is due to me living near the Gold Coast & Sunshine Coast in Australia. Very good a must see of Jeju. "
"Great place, friendly and local","Stayed by Hyeopjae beach two nights, wish we stayed longer.Lovely place with a real local feeling, many cafés and restaurants around.Large and free car park.Don’t miss the beer battered chicken with beer by the walk down to the beach, opposite to the foot cleaning bath"
Fantastic Beach Better than Hamdeok,"We had a much better time here than at Hamdeok Beach. The water was much more shallow, more friendly for swimmers, less seaweed at low tide areas too. The water was clean and the cafes nearby were cute too. "
Paradise ❤️,"This beach is one of the most beariful beaches in Jeju, with its white sand and really good restaurants and coffeeshops nearby. Really recomendable to go! "
Beach near hallim park,"This stretch of beach is very near Hallim park. We happened to drive by and stopped for photo taking.There are few restaurants, cafes around the area and a convenient store.The sea is clear and there were lots of people lazing by the beach. Was a short stopover for my family, nice scenery, no harm stopping by for quick foto shoots."
The best beach in Jeju,"I visited 4 different beaches in Jeju. They all had their own charms but for popularity goes to Hyeopjae Beach becaue of good size and fantastic photogenic view. If you want calmer, smaller, less crowded and less windy beach, there is Kumnyoung beach right next to Hyeopjae beach. It is good for younger children to play. Hyeopjae beach was quite windy and cold. Of course Summer time would be different story. I was looking forward to riding transparent kayak but it was not operating in Apr. There was number on banner but no one answered. "
Very cold...but awesome!,I and my wife went to this beach as this beach was the first pitstop for west package in Yeha Tour. The place was very cold since we visited during winter season. But the scenery was very beautiful and lovely. Seriously recommended for the honeymoon lovers.
Not a must,"The tourist industry is creative. So they discovered a sandy patch on the Island and made it a highlight for an excursion to the Western part of the Island. After one picture you can leave. The sand is nice, however. I took a sample"
Beautiful colours...!,"Too bad we went in fall, I would have so wanted to go in those beautiful turquoise waters. But we sat in front of the beach and didnt realize how much time had passed by. The colours are impressive. My favorite beach in Jeju."
Excellent,Very beautiful beach although one has to pay a large amount for a spot with an umbrella on the main beach. You can however walk just a bit further and find another beach. Beautiful beach with clear water. It can become crowded in summer over the weekends
Average beach,"If you are coming from a country with lots of islands and beaches like the Philippines, then this place can be omitted from your itinerary. Food and drinks are readily available in this area but it was too touristy for me."
Chill Place to Relax,"Love this beach! Sand was soft and the sea was beautiful. We walked to the extreme left and it was peaceful, quiet and secluded."
Great beach and good place for a drink,This beach was really clean and had many food facilities available. There was free parking. We did come in October but I could definitely see this place full of people in the summer. It is relatively close to Jeju city and has quite a bit to offer. 
Another beach.,"Worth a visit if you are a beach person - lots of people. Plenty of food booths and shops close by, lots of gimmicks to buy to include in your day. Water was okay - typical sand in the pants type of thing!!"
Beautiful beach,"White sand, clear water. View of several islands. Family beach. Easy to get to, great to walk along the water's edge."
Known as the most beautiful beach in Jeju,It's a tourist packed beach in the summer time. It's quite expansive so you can go to your own spot thats semi private. Recommend you to travel outside the vacation period unless you love swarms of families with children. 
Beautiful sand and friendly locals,"We have visited this beach on our first day in Jeju island. As soon as we walked in we felt so happy to see this beautiful beach! It was beginning of September, it was hot but as soon as we went to beach we almost got frozen due to strong wind. Sand is white and when combined with clear sky water appears Caribbean blue :) it was difficult to find a place to sit as it was overcrowded. We asked a lady in a local shop to keep our belongings for us while we are swimming, she was very kind and didn't ask any money from us. We also met sunset on this beach. It was gorgeous.Tip. Take a windproof jacket with a hood of you cannot stand for wind for a long time.Renting a place on beach with umbrella costs 10,000KRW. Renting some inflatable toy (flamingo for example) is also 10,000. Life vest/goggles rent is also 10,000. And you won't see any price tags around, kind of weird.Food around. Chinese restaurant across the street serves nice jajamyun noodles for 6 or 7,000 KRW. I can recommend it. Drinks - cafe bene with gorgeous view. Average coffee. Good bagels with crab meat."
Nice sandy beach,Even during slightly overcast conditions this was a very pleasant stroll. People enjoying the very blue water and peering into tide pools. Progressed from lava stones to smooth sandy beach.
Popular beach,"Fish and chip shop with Aussie beers, wines and S. African Savanna cider :) Many other eateries nearby."
Very Beautiful beach with clear waters and local people,"We originally got the bus here to go to hallim park. we noticed this beautiful beach and decided to check it out. anyway we ended up staying here all day. Was so nice to be on such soft, yellow sand with clear waters. There was quite a few families with young children which was nice to see all the children playing. Unfortunately there was a digger truck digging the sand while we were there for a few hours and a man kept blowing his whistle at everyone walking near the truck. if it wasnt for this it would have been excellent. Theres shops and restaurants close by and toilet blocks that provide flowing water to wash off but this is cut off around 5 or 6 pm. Sunset here was amazing."
Lovely and shallow beach for snorkeling,Very lovely and shallow beach so good for snorkeling. And actually quite famous for snorkeling already. You will see lots of young people in summer. But it has also great scenery in winter too.
Beach has potential,This is not your traditional beach. It is quite rocky and has limited sand however really spectacular geographical features to see here. Lots of restaurants nearby and also you can visit Hallim park for a few hours. Think this beach would have been better in the height of summer (July- August). 
Most beautiful water on the island,This is a great beach with the most beautiful water on Jeju. The waters are crystal clear and the color is picturesque. The lava rocks add to the beauty of this place. 
Turquoise Water & White Sand - A tropical Gem!,Spent a Sunday morning relaxing on this magnificent beach. Its emerald coloured crystal clear water and fine white sand laced with shells that makes it glitter. A magic location!Cannot wait for the moon to appear and make my summer complete. Walk all the way round to Geumneung beach and enjoy the stroll on the white sand.
Dog walk along the beach,We are staying near to here and stopped on a drive through. Great photo opportunity and it's clean with white sands. You can take your dog here also which is great and there is camping available also. A nice little stroll around the point and there is another little cove also. Not very busy really at all when we visited. No swimming signs everywhere but great for paddling and taking In the views. The sea is beautifully blue in the shallows
Most beautiful beach in the West side of the island,"This is one of the most beautiful beaches in Jeju island. The sea was so amazing, water so clear and having light ocean blue color. from here you could see the Biyangdo island, very close. However, it was rather cold and windy for us, so we could not swim just wandering around. we spent around 2hrs here. we got here by intercity bus no. 702 (about 1 hr) from jeju bus terminal."
Most comforting turquoise beach after a hike in Hallasan,"We stayed at Seowipo, near to the seogwipo-si (former) intercity bus terminal and took bus 110 from Jungang Rotary bus stop to Jungmun Tourist Complex. The bus journey about 30 minutes and cost less than 2000won one way. The bus driver could provide change if needed. There was a TV screen at the front of the bus that will flash and announce the current and coming stop in english clearly (Although I did not see Jungmun Tourist Complex on the TV screen, therefore I used GPS to locate instead. You can press the bell to alight. For my other bus trip, the stops were announced correctly and was reliable). We actually stopped that Jungmun Tourist Complex to go the the Teddy bear museum and Cheonjeyeon Falls before proceeding to the beach. Just to note that the bus ride can be a nausea one as the driver usually travel at a high speed as there were many stops they need to embark on. We needed to change bus 702 (opposite the tourist infrmation counter) to Hyeojae beach. It cost 3300 won. The journey on the bus we great as you will pass by paddy field, wind mills and wild flower fields. You will see a beautiful beach 1st ( I think it is Geumneung Beach) but don’t get down, get down at Hyeopjae beach as the view is nicer (about 2 stops away). You can walk down the stretch later (There is a public toilet down the stretch if you need). The weather then (April 26) was 12 to 17 degree Celcius and remember to buy a jacket and windbreaker as it was very windy when we were there. We so blessed that the sky cleared up to reveal one of the most beautiful turquoise beaches I have been. The beach was wide and the colours of the water clear and blue. There are many café where you can buy a hot drink from. Noted that the café only allow you to use the toilet if you buy a drink (the receipt will print the password to get into the toilet). You can always use the public toilet. We decide to walk along the orange and blue ribbon trail (Jeju Olle Route 14) and it was one of the best trail for me. We complete only part of the the trail where we walk through the villages to the fishing port. The route will bring you to a serene path with light house and the wind mills. The the path became rocky nearing the windmills, and we decided to walk out through the rocky back alley of a shellfish place (away from the orange/blue ribbon) and landed at a bus stop. We took bus 702 back to seogwipo. It was a must go beach but only on a clear blue day where the magnificent of the beach will show up."
Most beautiful beach in Jeju,Unfortunately the weather was too windy for us to swim on that particular day in April but I'm sure that it would otherwise be perfect. It's a typical tropical beach with white sand and turquoise water. Hanging around to watch the sunset there is worth it.
Beautiful beach!,"We found ourselves frequenting this beach during our stay in Jeju. The water is turquoise and semi-transparent with beautiful contrasting lava rocks lining the coast. Also, there is a view of an island. Note: there are few bars and/or beach cafes. "
Amazing Colours and a Beautiful Beach,"A wonderful place to visit a regular place to visit whether for a walk along the shore to relax or to camp out for the weekend in summer,it is really just great!"
Beautiful Beach,Its a windy day at the Hyeopjae Beach. But its shiny weather and the view is perfect. Next trip in summer will be here to relax at the beach
Beautiful!,It was cloudy and cold when I visited in the evening (it had rained earlier during the day) but this beach was amazing! I wish I spent more time here! Can't imagine what it would have been like in summer or on a clear day. I would definitely visit this beach again one day.
Stunning views and beautiful clear waters,"One of my favourite places on the whole island. There's lots to do in the local area, and plenty of places to stay, but one of my favourite things to do is camp down by the beach and have a BBQ and take in the phenomenal sunsets."
Best beach on Jeju,Amazing sunsets and great vibe to this beach. Really recommend it to anyone visiting Jeju...also near some other attractions.
Great beach,One of the pit stop along the way to Yongmeori Coast via halim park route. Offer a great view. Ample prking space is available.
"It is nice, warm and quiet at the end of september","The beach was almost empty when we went there. It was sunny, quiet and very nice. The beach is very shallow, so it requires like a hundred meters of walking to reach a place where a grown up guy's feet don't touch the sand anymore. It was the perfect beach for just walking around in the shallow water. I would absolutely go there again. We took a bus from Seogwipo (서귀포시), which took quite a while but they're not expensive. And the drivers are crazy so be prepared for a thrill ride!"
"very industrial place, parking next to water",Not a place where you can experience nature. Next to busy road and parking place. Still pretty good compared to other beaches in Jeju.
Beach for Koreans,"The water is a beautiful emerald color but the beach is too crowded. Too many parasols, shops, and small hotels. Go to the beach down the road if you want a more relaxing day at the beach.Tip: There are some decent beach style restaurants on the main road. There is nice a pizza cafe with covered outside seating. Also there is a Mom's Touch that servers fast food (chicken sandwiches).This beach is ranked as one of the top beaches in Jeju by Koreans. I was disappointed but I realized that the standards are different. Hey if you want simple food, people, and shade then this is the place to go. "
Nice Clear Beach,"Walking on the beach, relaxing, and chilling.It was 20,000 Won Taxi cap from Jeju Lotte Hotel, and you don't have to keep your taxi waiting for you because there are many taxis in this erea. Pass by the delicious Pizza restruant which called ""Donato's"". It is Five Min by walking. Also there is a nice park close to it. "
Just average but too crowded,"The beach is conveniently a walking distance from Halim Park across the street. Pretty good size and a very shallow beach, good for children to play. It's kind of too crowded for me and the rent for the beach umbrella is somewhat expensive KW25,000. We did not spent too much time there."
Beautiful clean beach,"The beach is family friendly with shallow, calm and beautiful color of turquoise water. White soft sand. My kids had so much fun snorkeling and chasing small fish for hours."
Super beautiful,Such an amazing beach.It was really hot when I visited there but it worth it.Nice scenery and there are so many exciting things to do.
Stunning beach with lots of facilities,"This is probably one of my favourite beaches of all time. Do not be put up by busy pictures... The water is shallow, for about 200m or more out to sea so the area for children to play and people to swim or snorkel is huge. We set up towels on the short and put up our own umbrellas and it really didn't feel crowded at all. There are loads of shops and restaurants around, as well as loads of places to rent rubber rings etc. I also saw lots of water sports happening outside of the safe swim zone. Truly a great day or so out!! And sunset is beautiful too."
best jeju beach,"Near to Hallim Park. Small beach with brown-white sand and black rock. Better to go when low tide The main beach is usually filled with many tourist, but they have umbrellas and chairs."
Lots of facilities,"A nice beach with fine sand and lots of facilities such as parasols for hire, cocktails and food stalls. There are showers and toilets close by too. On the downside, it's incredibly busy and parking is a nightmare. Once all the parasols and tables are out there's very little sand left! The amount of space available for swimming is small. We preferred to go to the less popular beach along the road. It's more spacious and more relaxed. "
The best beach on Jeju!,"This beach is beautiful and amazing! The main beach is usually filled with many tourist, but they have umbrellas and chairs you can rent to get out of the sun every once in a while! There is a great camping site just off the beach where many families camp and it is very cheap 7,000-15,000won. The sand is so soft on the beach and in the ocean! There are many sandbars so the water isn't too deep and makes it great for relaxing in the water! There are great restaurants around, and even the best pizza restaurant place I've been to in all of Jeju! They even have Inflatable tube rides on the back of jetskis and boats. They also have smaller inflatable tubes you can rent for a small price of 5,000 won. "
Beach Experience,Near to Hallim Park. Small beach with brown-white sand and black rock. Better to go when low tide so you can walk a few hundred meters into the sea.
NIce view,It was a cold nearby the beach and it's near to Geumneung Beach. There are a lot of seaweed around the beach. The water was clear blue and clean. Fantastic view though it was very cold.
Fun for all ages,It was low tide so the rocks were dry and there were lots of little pools. It was fun to see little kids playing in the pool water for hours. We were just there for a little time. Our teenagers had fun walking on top of the lava rocks along the beach. Careful not to step on crabs. Beautiful serene beach. 
Great beach! ,"Would recommend to all visitors of Jeju. Nice atmosphere, clean beach, blue water, and great scenery. A little rocky in the water but overall it was peaceful! "
I remember beautiful hubjae beach,This beach is very beautiful.You can see red and orange color beach on evening.I want to comeback this beach.There are many pub and hostel and food-court.
beautiful sea,This beach is my best beach ive ever seen. In front of the beach u can see beautiful small island.Transparent sea and emerald sea. Recommend!!!
Calm and a beautiful beach!!!,"Hamdeok beach is just so beautiful. It offers you black rocks, white sand, and breathtaking views. It was our first destination for the day after we landed in Jeju. I found the beach quite peaceful and calm. It is very near to Hallim park. Just took us about 2 mins to reach the park by a car. I wish we could spend some more time at the beach but we had to rush to our next destination. Good place to stop by and click some nice pics. Good luck!!! :)"
Nice beach!,Nice beautiful beach with black stones contrasting white sands and blue sea. Near to Hanlim Park which is a must visit. Summer is great time to be at the beach
Pretty view,"It was 25,000 won taxi cab from Lotte City Hotel. It was a very pretty beach but water was too cold for swimming. It was also a bit breezy which made laying on the sand a bit difficult. "
Like a gem,"Very beautiful beach, especially in a beautiful day. It is opposite Halim park so remember spend 10 minutes to enjoy the sea. We went there in May and the weather was great. There was a lot of dried squids there but we don't know how to buy it :D"
When is a turquoise blue beach not inviting,"In April, the waters are not warm yet, so sitting here is quite beautiful and not crowded. A sense of both oceanic drive close by at the coastal road, a coffee deck behind and an almost cove like open white sand isolation which will probably disappear in peak summer"
Disappointed,"We came here for the sunset view, because that was the recommendation for this place. But we were disappointed.We reached Jeju via plane around 1pm and went to Hallim park (5min walk to Hyeopjae beach) after check in. After a walk around Hallim park we walk to Hyeopjae Beach for sunset watching. The weather is just nice, no rain, not too hot. The sand beach was covered with plastic material (?), I guess so tourist can walk on it. There was few garbage lying around the beach and it was a bit crowded with people, both local and tourists. The sunset view is not that nice.Again, to be fair, we come from the tropic. The Bornean sunset is probably the best sunset. So for people from the tropics, you can skip this place if you want to. But if you have nothing to do in Jeju, I guess you can come here to relax, after a walk at Hallim Park.To go here: Take bus #710 bound for Hyeopjae beach (or Hallim Park if you want to go there first. It's just 5min walk to Hyeopjae beach). "
Can't swim on this beach ,Hyeopjae beach is opposite with hallim park. You guys should to visit if you have plans to visit hallim park. This beach unable to swim because there are a lot of stones but you can chill out with nice view. Reach the beach by bus 702 from Jeju intercity bus station to Hyeojae beach. 
Beautiful beach - worth a visit,"Was here a week ago or so in April 2016, and the beach was very beautiful! We were there in the morning and there were already a few numbers of tourists there, but that didn't take away the beauty of Hyeopjae Beach. "
Selfie Paradise,Beautiful clear water unfortunately a lot of the sand was covered up with matting. Comical watching all the people taking selfies.
Nice but crowd dependent,"Probably better to visit during summer. We went in November where the weather was still kinda chilly and windy (just a short stop), so there wasn't alot of other tourists. The sea view was pretty! But nothing else to do there when it's not the suitable season.. The street beside it looks interesting though.."
Sea and sand at sunset,"Hyeopjae is a beautiful beach with everything you would want in a beach it's very long with thick soft sand. But, the best thing about Hyeopjae beach is the Ollhe trail that starts at the Northeast end of the beach and goes for ever. The trail runs along the shore so close to the sea that at high tide on a windy day it becomes inpassable because of the waves submerging the trail in some places. The volcanic rock along the trail forms different things. If you look at the rock closely you might see a dragon or a horse or maybe a bird. If you stay on the trail long enough you walk by G-Dragon's cafe. If you go even further you will come across a Smoke Tower that is hundreds of years old used to send a signal of a enemies ship approaching.So, while Hyeopjae Beach is 1st rate when you are done swimming take a walk through history down the Olleh trail.I'm an American that has been living in Jeju for the last 12 years and I walk this trail 3 to 4 times a week and it never gets old."
Hyeopjae Beach during sunset winter season,"No much crowd during winter, windy location, lots of eateries nearby (seafood, cafe, finger food stalls, fried chicken, family restaurants, pizzas). Nice sunset. Suggest to drive there, white sands, using the island as background. Need to check sunset time before planning route."
1 of the nicest beach on Jeju!,A Must Visit Beach on Jeju as my friends and I WOW-ED at the spectacular view! the sea is BEAUTIFUL! Blue blue sea that is so clear that we can see the sand below. Please google for the photos. :D
One of the best beaches in Korea,"I've been Hyupjae Beach in the last August. The water colors were so beautiful and hued with many indescribable colors as I had visited many a time before. I've been to many beautiful tropical beaches and I can say Hyunjae has a unique attractiveness compare to them.During vacance season it is very crowded but if you avoid that season and meet good weather by luck, you shall think of Hyunjae Beach as a serendipity."
Clean and relax beach,"Reached at 10am in morning. There are many groups of people visiting the bench early. Cool and refreshing clear sea, many children and family are playing on the beach. Definitely one of the attraction beach. Live seaweed can be spotted on the beach. Nearby cafe and shops to relax and slow down your mood. "
Great view even in the autumn,"This place even have amazing views in the autumn eventhough it was a bit cold. The sky and sea are blue, and clean, and the sands is white."
Aquamarine water,"One of few beach that the water is many hues of blue (usual sea colour of jeju is dark blue). The beach is quite wide, so you can enjoy strolling around while drinking freshly pressed orange juice."
Beautiful!,"One of the nicest beaches I ever been too and I been to Aruba. The sand is white and clean, waters were shallow for great part of it. I wish I had more time to spend there. I just went but it was warm enough that if I wished I could have swam. I could see it being really crowded in summer. Loved it! Must visit in Jejudo. "
 Worth a visit,Best time to visit us when tide is out and you can walk and climb amongst the lava rocks. Was a little surprised at the amount of litter on the beach. Great views and lovely color of water. 
Lovely sunset,We were there just for the sunset. Loved it. It was a weekday and there were not many people at the beach.There are shops in the area too.
Lava & Sand Beach,"This is a very picturesque beach and is composed of lava and sand. It was a bit chilly when we visited, but it was still a nice stop and very serene."
Beautiful during sunset ,Great place to visit after the Hallim Park. The sunset was amazing. Could see the beautiful island from the distance and the sands were soft and white. Looks pretty clean.
Okay. Very pretty,Stopped by this beach after visiting Hallim Park. The sand is soft and the water is turquoise-y. But I have seen better beaches. The unique feature to me is the volcanic rock by the beaches.
"good, I guess...",beautiful beach but kinda crowded. showers are common and pricey. there are restraırants nearby but almost none of them are good. 
"Great, chill beach",This beach is less clustered by tourist and easily accessible. Take the 702 for an hour from the Jeju Intercity Bus Terminal and arrive at the entrance. There are several food options and convenience stores. The lava rocks are also pretty cool. 
Nothing special,"Visiting Jeju ? Do it if you have at least4 days or more ! All the tourist attractions are in different corners of the island and they are far from each other .There are daily bus tours , running in one direction , starting at 9am coming back at 6 pm . Not every spot is so interesting , probably many of travellers have seen some similar somewhere else . The same is reg. this small beach . There are plenty of such beaches or even nicer around the world"
"Quiet, but mostly meant for selfies apparently","So we visited this beach in May, so it wasn't super warm. We arrived, wanting to sit on the beach in our swimwear, take a dip for a bit and enjoy the sun. Turns out most people there only went to this beach to take selfies...?Luckily, off the main beach, to the right side down some steps, there was a quiet area. We decided to sit there and have some time to ourselves, rather than be in other's people pictures. That was a great spot, with a marvelous view of the mountain and the beautiful blue water!"
Great,"I went to this beach with my kids, they liked it very much. It is safe for childern and very clean. It has toilets and groceries. I believe this great place miss cafes. If you have you g kids, this place is very good for them."
Amazing sunsets compliment a broad open beach and hordes of tourists.,"There are two kinds of people in the world: those who like their beaches to be overrun with screaming, writhing masses of tourists, and those who think being happy is important. And sure, this could be just another one of those jaded reviews written by a bitter old troll who has no other outlet for his vitriol than to misinform random strangers on the Internet, but it's not. I'm here to vehemently disabuse anyone who is thinking of having a quiet day at Hyeopjae beach out of a sense of civic duty. Yes, the beach itself is a soft sand frame for spectacular sunsets punctuated by occasionally clear blue-green waters, but it's also a growing epicenter for the worst kind of overbooked tourism. Pros: The beach itself is broad, and the area in front of the main beach lends itself to a safe experience for attended children: there is a large, open region of sand at low tide and shallow water at high tide for kids to play in. The view is nice, and the sunsets are extravagant. There is camping nearby with good tree cover, adequate facilities for showering, stores for trinkets and swimming paraphernalia, and places to buy food and drink. There is also a small but growing night life near the beach that has a distinctly island feel, far from the thumping of your standard Korean club scene. Cons: The swimming area is unbelievably small, so not only does everyone get to experience a sardine style of ""swimming"" in water that rarely goes past the hips of an adult, the water is also full of sand and debris due to the high person-per-square-meter ratio. Visibility underwater is often zero, so don't expect to see fish on a busy day - which is pretty much the entire high season. There is garbage everywhere, both in the water, and in large, reeking piles near the parking lot. The noise is unbelievable (just like the parking) and the local restaurants - with only one or two exceptions - cater to the lowest common denominator for quality. Hyeopjae is being targeted by packaged family tours, and yet there is a laughably inadequate infrastructure in place to ensure a safe, organized experience for children. The beautiful volcanic rocks along the sides of the beach and in some parts of the water are playgrounds of minor and major injury. The often unattended children that race up and down the beach are in no way warned about or protected from these hazards. The forest of beach umbrellas tightly packed on the ""main beach"" is both uncomfortably crowded and poorly organized for parents to keep an eye on their kids, and for kids to find their parents when they get lost. The lifeguards are simultaneously overworked and overzealous. They are simply too busy whistling at people to keep them safe from the dangers of hip-deep water (a strange and annoying tradition amongst Jeju lifeguards) to effectively keep an eye out for people - especially children - who are may be in real trouble.Bottom Line: If you've never had the chance to explore Jeju, you won’t know just how bad Hyeopjae is. Moreover, as I said in the beginning, some people actually enjoy the mass market appeal of tourist traps, and I don't begrudge them their tastes. All I'm saying is Jeju has an embarrassment of better beaches with better food and better facilities. In fact, you only have to travel up or down the road for 15 minutes in either direction to find beautiful, secluded areas where you lavish on an empty beach and swim in truly pristine waters. Q.E.D."
"Perfect setting, safe for kids","The actual Hyeopjae beach, at the north end of town can get very crowded, but is close to the cafes on the main street. Personally we prefer the Geunmung beach end which is to the south, just past the Hallim park entrance.Both beaches are stunning with turquoise water and great views out to the island. The beaches shelve very gently which makes them great for kids. Geunmung particularly is awesome for the kids as it has little bays and rock pools too."
Clear waters and soft sand,"You could actually walk out into the ocean among swirling seaweed and chase after schools of small fish (my favourite part). There are also small rock ponds for you to observe some sea creatures that were washed up by the waves. Plenty of families and couples with puppies and dogs were frolicking in the waters and having a picnic on the sand. Sand was so soft!

basking,"beautiful view, great for swimming, warm clear shallow waters, best beach i've visited in Korea. I didn't expect to find a tropical like beach in Korea. if i have an opportunity i would definitely visit again. "
Rivals Thailand,"Okay judging by the other reviewers, I must have been there on a great day. The water was crystal clear and the experience was amazing. There is a convenient store located right on the beach for all your necessities (i.e. beer etc) and convenient ice cream and restaurants. While it was a little far away from where I was staying, it was an unforgettable experience and was my favorite part of my trip to Jeju."
OK beach,We were told this is the spot for the sunset...the 30 minute drive from where we were staying was not worth it. Getting a taxi at night was not easy and it took us over an hour to get one.
Nice clean beach,We visited at the beginning of May and it was cold. It also rained when we were on the beach. So could not enjoy the water.However beach is very nice and clean. We had coffee in the coffee shop on beach which gives you nice view of the beach.Its just opposite Hallim park so can be combined.Would nice to spend a warm and sunny day on this beach.
Covered beach,"Never been to a beach where the sand had a huge net over it. But then I'd never been to a beach in Korea. We werent too upset because we kept our shoes clean for the museum we visited next. The only sunbathers were foreigners, everyone else waded in the water almost fully clothed or stood on the lava rock taking selfies. It's pretty and there are places to grab lunch or an ice cream."
Daebakk!!!,"Very beautiful beach with clear water & nice scenery. For me, this is one of best place to visit in Jeju."
Beautiful Beach,"Beautiful beach if only few tourist there. Clear water, decent sand. Can visit with Hallim Park. There is a G25 which can provide basic food and snacks. Nice view from Coffee Bene."
Awesome view and lovely place to relax,We went to the beach after hallim park. It was a nice place for my little one to run around as the sand is very soft. Must be a lovely place to relax in summer. The view was beautiful. Lovely cafes along the way and we had nice pizza. 
white sands with great sunset,I like the white sands with great sunset even though it is winter. I should visit it again in summer.
Beautiful,"This is a really beautiful place to visit in Jeju! The sand is really fine, and with very refreshing breeze"
Far beyond my expectation!,"I came to the beach on 4th day of the holiday with my parents. It's surprising to find a beach with white smooth sands here in the vocanal island. It would be a very good place to enjoy the sunshine in summer. Even in early October, it is warm to swim. There is a 7-11 not far from the beach. Love this beach!"
It Was Allright,"Anywhere you go in Korea, there will be people. So, I wasn't too surprised when we showed up to Hyeopjae to find a lot of other tourists. The beach wasn't as big as I thought it would be, but it was still nice. We rented a table and an umbrella for like 10,000won ($10 USD) and enjoyed a couple hours in the sun."
A Silver sand beach of Jeju,A large area of beach for entertainment of every one of any age fro five years to eighty years without any fear. You can let your siblings play at their own with small fishes around them. 
Something different,"This beach is superb. As someone who has seen a lot of beaches in SEA, this is a bit unique in the sense that you can see a white sand clean beach while standing on the volcanic made rocks. Its just something different and special..."
Blue color of beach water. Very good. ,"Blue color of beach water. Very good. We visited there late July. The color of beach was amazing. We enjoyed swimming. Also the sunray was very strong to enjoy sun tenning. We are food a little far from here, because restaurants near beach was expensive. Also there are good places to nearby beach ; Hyeopjae cave, botanical garden, tracking beach, etc. "
Ok beach way too many people,"This might be one of the best beaches of Korea like some say, I wouldn't know, but that tells you more about beaches in Korea rather than about the quality of this one. It is an ok beach super crowded. It cannot be compared to southeast Asian beaches, or Caribbean. It's fine if you are here, but I was def deceived by some ultra glowing reviews of this beach that I felt are completely unjustified. Another thing that puts me off is the fact that many Koreans choose to bathe fully clothed and that they cannot take their eyes off you if you are western."
Felt like I was in Thailand,This beach was stunning. The sea floor was all sand and the water was very clear! The beach wasn't overly crowded for summer time. The water was warm and I felt like I was in Thailand 
Good Beach- Very Crowded,I recently visited this beach with a group of friends and it was definitely worth it. We were staying in Jeju City so it was about an hour bus ride to get to the beach. There isn't any space to lay down a blanket so you have to rent an umbrella. The water is crystal is clear and the tide is very low. I had to walk about 300 meter in order to get water that was waist high. There are all kinds of coffee shops and restaurants located along the strip of the beach so you can eat and hang for as long as you like. The water is beautiful and makes it worth it.
"Very good, except one minus","Great beach. The water is really clear and nice blue color. The tide comes up and down during the day though. So from 11am~ until 5pm~ you can walk few hundred meters until you reach deep enough water. But besides that one minus it is a worth visiting beach!If you want some more information on what you can find on the island, you can check out this video: http://youtu.be/X2RwSnOMgYk?list=UUYEqXBrHobdnJF591_o-vcg"
Fantastic,"The beautiful white color of the sand comes from the large amounts of crushed seashells that have been mixed in with the sand. The long seashore stretches for 9 km and has cobalt colored seawater and evergreen forests scattered around the vicinity, making the scenery very beautiful. Just off the beach is Biyangdo Island. The white sandy beach is about 20 meters long, and the water is 1.2 meters deep with no sudden drops. In the evergreen groves, there are plenty of convenient facilities and campgrounds for visitors to use. "
Favorite beach in Korea,"Among the beaches in Korea, this is the one that most resembles Hawaii/Australia/Thailand. White sands and turquoise waters, with striking black lava rock. The water is warmer than on the mainland, and it's never been as crowded as Haeundae (in Busan) when I've gone. It's easy to go, even alone, and spend a relaxed afternoon swimming and sunbathing without feeling as though you're ruffling anyone's feathers. This beach is always the first place on my checklist when I go to Jeju!"
One of the many,beautiful beaches that's not over crowded with tourists (well except for Summer season) but a great place to go camping. Undisturbed silence and ocean.
Nice beach,"Heopjae beach is on the small side and the time I went there, it was pretty crowded. But nonetheless it's super clean and it's perfect for enjoying a dip in the ocean, taking pictures, some water sports and hanging out with friends. Going there at sunset during the summer months is even better! "
Stunning beach!!,"Beautiful clean beach!! one of the nicest I've seen, it was spring and a bit cold so not ideal for swimming but i guess in the summer it would be really nice to go a dip as the water is very clear."
beautiful waters,"Clearly, going in early spring is not the best idea; water's still too cold for swimming but it was perfect to go walking barefoot in the fantastically clear water. It was pleasant to walk into random warm currents while chasing after fish in the shallow water. Our driver said it was the best beach on Jeju but he said that about Hallim Park too so I would not take his word for it."
Beautiful white sand beach!,"Beautiful blue/green water with white sand beach. We didn't get in the water since it was chilly, but it looks very shallow with some rocks. Can park and walk along the beach shore. "
Beach near Hallim Park,"It's very near Hallim Park so check it out if you are also going to Hallim Park. Nice and clean beach, and there's a small island directly opposite it."
Really nice beach near Hallim Park,We went to Hallim Park and decided to spend a little time on the beach as it's right next door. Nice place for some fresh air and a quiet walk
It's fine if you're in the area.,"We happened to be staying near the Hyeopjae Beach so we went there a couple of times, but I wouldn't recommend going out of your way for it. The water is clear and beautiful, but a bit cold for our tastes. I'm sure it warms up in July and August though. - Kanannie"
Lovely Beach in Jeju,"Located on the west side of Jeju, this gem has a very nice view, were you can see some mountains across the beach. We went there during late spring, the water was very nice while basking in the sun. There's not much people there, however when summer comes, most of them will swarm all over the place. It's better to go on spring, you can enjoy the view and just listening to the water splashing on the rocks. This is one of the best beaches in Korea."
Nothing special,"We just stop in here taking picture. No many people visited there when i was going there maybe because it was raining.I went there by taxi,we rent taxi for two days and the taxi driver recommend us to visit this beach when i said i wanted to go to the beach"
Great fun lively summer beach,Loved it here - so much so our day trip became three days! Lively beach - busy by day but we were there peak season! Had fun playing in inflatable tubes on the very safe and shallow sea which is well guarded by sea police on jet skis so no accidents! They are fun and splash everyone etc My 7 year old loved it here! Lots of beach food and drink options and many guest houses too! At night time it's flood lit and there was live music and fireworks every night we were there - really relaxed fun!  
Best Beach in Korea,"Located on the far western shore of Jeju Island, Hyeopjae receives a fraction of the visitors compared to other well-known Korean beaches. My wife and I enjoyed a spectacular sunset here after a fun half-day spent swimming and exploring the volcanic tide pools. The beach is superb for three reasons. 1) Great location (not a city-beach), scenic view of islands and volcanic rocks strung along northern portion of the beach.2) Relatively few visitors compared to other Korean beaches3) Water and beach are clean, shallow water makes the beach great for families"
