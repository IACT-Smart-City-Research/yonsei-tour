Well organize tour,My mom and I opted for Pocheon Art valley and apple picking. Our tour guide was Lammy and as ever all Ktour story tour guide was very nice and efficient. My mom enjoyed the apple picking with some tips to Lammy to say korean word to the owner. We had our time tasting the sweet apple juice and apple jam its soooo delicious. The apple is sweet amd crisp. Hope i can go back with my kids in the apple farm. Pocheon Valley is beautiful. In herb island i never seen any herb :-(. All in all my mom and i enjoyed this tour. Thanks Lammy.
Worth a trip,We drove here during an overnight stay near Garden of Morning Calm. It took about 40 minutes to arrive. Price was reasonable and we opted to buy the round trip monorail tickets. Plan for babywearing rather than a stroller if you want to go up some of the places with only stairs. Some stairs are steep and spiral but it's okay if you're prepared. We spent about 2 hours there. Parking on site is available but can be tight. We travelled with a 5 and 3 year old and they enjoyed walking around and seeing everything.
"Beautiful, but small","Public transportation is lacking to go there. The direct buses run every two hours. Please check the website for exact scheduling from the Pocheon bus terminal. You can take other buses that run more frequently and walk the road to art valley but the walking can take longer. The main sights of Pocheon art valley is very beautiful!!! However, it is small and if you come by yourself then it will feel like a waste of time. If you come with friends or your loved ones then it will be more worthy. I didn’t take the monorail to the top, I just walked. It is a steep hill but not super long. I think if public transportation is better, then I’ll rate it higher. "
Beautiful Place,"a bit far from Seoul so we joined a group tour. Amazing place, not crowded. We definitely enjoyed our visit."
Must see,"This is the best place in pocheon. There are couple of places in pocheon, you don’t have lots of options. But this must be your first location"
"A very, very nice way to spend a sunny winters day","We started our visit with a look through the retro game display. It was nostalgic and fun. Then we caught the monorail to the top of the park. There is stuff to see everywhere. You can walk to the top, there are statues a long the way and places to sit. The park is well set out with a few different areas. Of course there is the beautiful quarry. Even in winter is was truly beautiful with frozen waterfalls and ice all around. It has wheelchair access but some of the ramps are steep, so be careful. Oh and there is also a rather large reclining statue of a naked man, with his legs apart???"
Day trip,"In this art valley, they have a creation and experience center, an exhibition hall for stone culture, a monorail, an astronomical science museum, an outdoor concert hall, the Cheonjuho lake, a sculpture park, a media facade, a doleum stairs, the Hosur Concert hall and the Jeonmang Cafe. It is a very good day out for both young and old to explore our world."
Great for photography ,"The quarry turned tourist attraction is an amazing place for photography. It is Northeast of Seoul so we decided to book a day tour to cover this and Herb Island. Arriving at almost sunset was a superb idea because we were able to capture good shots of the quarry and when the sun set, special lighting shone on the area and the quarry looked mystical as the lighting changed. "
Lovely place,It was a quarrying site turned into a museum. A lot of beautiful site to take pictures but not a much else to do. There are modern art display all over the place. 
Worth visiting for 3 hours,"Has photographic zone where few dramas/movies was suited. Mono rail helps to take up to top within 10 minutes, while returning you can return by walk to take pictures."
Quite beautiful ,"Went via a tour, journey from Seoul to pocheon about 1 hour. The place was beautiful, neat but small. Went there to see as the Korean Odyssey and The legend of the blue sea were filmed there.Might not be suitable for elderly as the steps can be steep. "
Art Valley visit,"Today I visited Pocheon Art Valley.It's a wonderful site for family or a date. There is a beautiful area to walk, for picture taking and a breath taking view of the Pocheon valley. You have a couple museums to visit, a fusion style restaurant. also if the trail goin up to the top is too steep, the have a monrail you can ride up. Unfortunately time did not permit a complete tour of the site. I saw enough to know I would love to go back."
Former granite mines turned art valley,This was our first stop of our 4day famtour. The place was a granite mine during the late 1800s then turned into a park/ art valley. There’s a monorail that will take you at the top where you can see a lake and an observatory. 
Good Combination - Art and Beauty,"We took a local tour to visit this and some other places (including lunch). The price was reasonable and worry free.The scenery of the lake and surrounding was excellence even in this winter day. The blue water and the rock formation gives a beautiful picturesque setting. The outdoor arts are OK as well with many interesting, unique and funny sculptures. I do not mind to come back again, during warmer season."
Beautiful place,"It was challenging for a non-Korean to get there via public commute, but it is a beautiful place (especially the lake area). One would need at least half day to fully enjoy everything inside the park in a relaxed manner. Paying for RT cable ride to the park area is good as there's nothing much to see if you will walk from payment booth. Filming site for at least 2 sageuk-fusion Korean dramas. There is a coffee shop, a restaurant and a convenience store in the park. There are also small lockers to leave some of your stuff (free of charge, just leave ID card, not necessarily passport).Directions from Seoul (my experience): ride subway to Gangbyeon station, go to Dong Seoul Bus Terminal (across the road from subway station), buy ticket to Pocheon (6400w i think) and find the bus# indicated in the ticket (take note, make sure you catch the bus scheduled in your ticket). Bus ride was more than 1hr (tip: open waze to know where you are because there is no English sign or recording in the bus to let you know if you arrived already in your intended bus stop). Get down at Pocheon bus stop (small bus stop, no English signs) and walk towards City Hall bus stop (walk to opposite direction of the bus you just alighted from). There are 2 bus stops there facing each other from across the street. Choose the one which is not along the nearest convenience store (GS25 i think). Ride bus 87-2 because that will stop in front of Art Valley..in my case, 87-2 took a long time so i rode another bus upon advice of a Korean woman and went down at the intersection going to Art Valley (refer to map in photos). From that intersection (you will pass Coway), ride a taxi (didnt know how to get a taxi, so I walked) or walk for 30mins or more uphill following the signs until you reach Art Valley (tiring esp if it's summer).Going back to Seoul is easier: Check schedule of bus arrival (posted at the art valley entrance area), wait for Bus 87-2 at the Art Valley bus stop, tell driver to drop you at Pocheon Bus Stop and from that bus stop, buy bus ticket for Seoul (no bus # this time, just time of bus arrival, so make sure to ask people in the bus stop the correct bus to Dong Seoul Bus Terminal). If you are a group, just rent a car! "
Beautiful valley for a one-time visit,"As mentioned by other reviews, it is very straightforward to get to Pocheon via bus 3000 from DongSeoul Bus Terminal. We walked the 2km distance from the main road into the Art Valley which was alright as we were there in late Jun when the weather was chilly and great for taking walks. There are some slopes along the 2km walk and the nearest restroom is at the art valley so if you are with children or elderly, it'll be better to take the bus or taxi instead. We took about 2 hours to explore the art valley and take photos at a relaxed pace. Admission is ₩5,000 for adults; ₩4,500 for round-way monorail ticket and ₩3,500 for a one-way ticket. We bought the round-way as there was nothing much to see along the hill except the granite hills and flowers. Two things to do when you arrive at the art valley - (1) Check bus timings for buses that leave the art valley, (2) Obtain a brochure on the area. The brochure helped us to map a rough route to get to as many things as possible and also find our way around so we do not miss anything. Other than the lake that everyone takes photos of, there is a planetarium (interesting exhibits include thermal imaging camera; took 30mins to walk through it; exhibits in Korean), modern contemporary art sculptures all around the valley, flowers such as roses in bloom which made good photo-taking backdrops and facilities such as a cafe and convenient store. The convenient store closed before 6pm. The art valley is a beautiful and picturesque getaway destination for a half-day trip. It is important to check for the bus timings out of the art valley if not you would end up having to walk the 2km out from the art valley to the main road (which was what happened to my friends and I who had missed the bus by 5 minutes). To get back to Seoul, cross the main road and take bus 3000 back to DongSeoul Bus Terminal (approx. 2 hours journey in the evening). Bus 3000 back to Seoul costed ₩6,400 and is to be paid by cash. If you do not have exact change, you can go to the convenience store opposite the road to buy something for change. Before going to the Art Valley, we went to Sanjeonghosu Lake which was about an hour's bus ride away from the Art Valley. This lake was suggested by several blogs that recommended the lake for the activities and picturesque scenery. Maybe we went at a bad timing but the lake was quite a wasted trip as parts of it were already dried up and it seemed to be a day trip get away for locals. We hiked one of the trails suggested where one of the stop was Biseon Waterfall. We took some time to locate the trail and way to the waterfall. From our limited Korean, the locals seemed to be telling us something about no water. We hiked the trail using Google Maps and walked past the waterfall (according to the map) but saw no waterfall anywhere to our disappointment. The trail was also ridden with mosquitos due to the stagnant water from puddles as a result the drying river."
Great Art in the Valley of Pocheon,"From Incheon International Airport, we were taken straight to Pocheon Art Valley in Sinbuk-myeon, Pocheon-si, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea by our friend late in the afternoon to watch the sunset. There weren't so many people anymore because the valley just closed operation for the day. Thankfully, the kind park staff still allowed us to pay tickets (at 3,000 won or a little over $2 each) after being told that we are tourists. To find out that the place used to be a granite quarry made it all the more thrilling and exciting for us to do the little steep climb because the monorail was no longer available. It had just snow, and it was all our first time to hike on a cold late afternoon. Cheonjuho Lake is the main attraction of the art valley. It was made by a river dam, and for me was the best next to the sunrise. Among the arts on the valley was this cheeky sculpture of the half body of a man under a height of rocks, and he's lying there for everyone to appreciate. Checkout my photos ;) There's also the pinky swear statuette, and I love it too! Minus the climb (coz you can monorail your way up), Pocheon Art Valley is a very nice place to visit. Given the chance, I'd go back again to visit early and explore more. "
A great way to escape busy Seoul,"This is a very cool place to go for a day trip. It's a park that has some beautifully carved cascades and a lake in the middle of one area of carved rocks. The lake is by far the best attraction of the park.There is a small science museum at the top for kids and a lot of modern art around the park. The admission is ₩5,000 for adults. The monorail is ₩4,500 for a round trip ticket and ₩3,500 for a one way ticket. I would strongly suggest to at least get a one way ticket. The hill is long and steep. You can walk down the hill and even feel how steep it is but it's not really necessary to take the monorail back.This place is good for a one time visit. It's relaxing and peaceful but not worth going back more than that.To Get There: As one reviewer mentioned, go to Gangbyeon Station (Dongseoul Bus Terminal) and buy a ticket for Pocheon. The cost is ₩6,400. Once you arrive at the terminal, turn left and walk to Pocheon City Hall. Walk for about 5-8 minutes (pass one intersection) and it will be on the same side of the street as the bus terminal. Wait for the 87-1 bus and take that. It comes once per hour."
Pocheon Art Valley...something new,"Pocheon Art Valley is one of the places you can consider if you are thinking of a day trip. It is something new and different. This used to be a granite quarry which was latter transformed into a park with a science museum and out door art exhibit. Directions: There are many suggested ways on how to go there, but this was my first gand experience. From Seoul, take the subway and exit at Gangbyeon Station (green line 2). Exit and alk across the street towards Dong Seoul Bus Station. Purchase a bus ticket to Pocheon Bus Terminal at W6,400. The travel time is about 70 minutes. From Pocheon Bus Station turn left and walk 5-10 minutes towards the Pocheon City Hall , there is a bus stop there. Wait (there is a time schedule for this bus every 1 hour) and ride bus 87-1, this stops at Pocheon Art Valley. It takes 12-15 minutes. There are other buses (3, 10, 138 etc) which stops on the main road(near conway store but i don't know the name of the bus stop), with a 2 km walk from the main road to Pocheon Art Valley so I would suggest get a taxi, wait for bus 87-1. ￼Entrance is W5000 for adults, monorail W3500 one way, W4500 two way. If you want to see the planetarium additional ticket. ￼The weather was fine during my visit (early spring). There are a lot of photo opportunity but not much to do. There is a museum and planetarium at the top of the hill. There is a restaurant (korean) which i did not try, a convince store and a coffee shop (on the hill).To maximize your day trip, i suggest going to Pocheon Herb Garden which I wasn't able to see (couldn't get directions from Art Valley to there). So in this matter, joining a tour might be handy. Enjoy your day trip!"
Art Valley in the Mountain,Many art installation & sculptures here. Also has a Planetarium for kids too. You can take the mono-rail to go up and walk around.
One of the best place in Pocheon,"By turning old quarry into awesome valley, it has been one of the best place you must visit when you plan to go on a trip to Pochoen. Not only you can't find any other unique place like here but well maintained park is totally worth visiting."
What else is there to see in Pocheon,Pretty cool. Guy buy cheap land and carves out some rocks. Puts art around it and a musium at the top. I must say it is well kept and prestine. Looks like a great place for a concert or wedding. 
Natural Beauty,This old quarry turned park is a great place to check out. It is a small park but very beautiful. There is a stage for concerts as well as a little coffee shop on the grounds. A perfect place to just relax for a nice afternoon~~
