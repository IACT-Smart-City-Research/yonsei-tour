Great Statue Of The Admiral Who They Say Was As Good As Nelson,"Admiral Yi Sun-Yin was a famous Korean Admiral, the inventor of the Turtle Ships and famous for his battles and beating the Japanese during the Imjin Wars. He lived from 1545 until 1598 and died of a gun shot wound in battle.His impressive large statue stands in Gwanghuaman Square and worth a look. Yi Sun-Sin improved on the Turtle Ships that had eleven cannons on each side, two each in the bow and stern and spikes on the roof to avoid being boarded.Some historians have put him alongside Horatio Nelson as a a ship-lover leader but that may be pushing it. Better than Horatio!.Nice Statue but not as nice as the column in London."
One of two,One of the two statues in this square. The square and statues can be found right infront of the palace. Good for some quick photos.
Respected admiral,This statue is to honour a famous and respected admiral best known for his military achievements during the Imjin War. There is also a small underground museum in memory of the Admiral. In front of the statue there is a water fountain called 23.12 representing the 23 wars the Admiral won with 12 warships.
Beautiful!!,"I saw this when I was walking around Seoul. Very enjoyed reading about the history of Admiral Yi Sun-Sin. Go here if you want to learn about him, and why he is important."
The War Hero,"Considered as a War hero, the 6.5 meters bronze statue of Admiral Yi Sun-sin is situated in the G Square which is in front of the G-Palace. The statue shows the Admiral in a standing posture, holding a sword in his right hand the face depicting the determination of a soldier.Near the statue there is a miniature turtle ship representing the war vessel which the Admiral supposed to have commanded during the war. There is also a small museum in the memory of the Admiral.Also in front of the statue there is a water fountain called 23.12 representing the 23 wars the Admiral won with 12 warships."
Amazing Admiral,"I had never heard of this famous 16th-century Korean admiral until I visited Gwanghwamum Plaza, where his bronze statue anchors its southern end. But now I know that Admiral Yi Sun-Sin has a fascinating background, including incredible military achievements during the Imjin War (1592-96) when he defended Korea against Japanese invaders. Yi Sun-Sin invented the ironclad ""turtle"" ship. It was so successful that it took only a few to win a battle with hundreds of the enemy's traditional ships.Sculptor Kim Se-jung's 1968 work depicts the war hero standing in armor, with a massive sword in the right hand. A miniature replica of the turtle ship appears just below the statue. The bronze and its high pedestal rise about 56 feet above the plaza. The 12:23 fountain nearby received its name from the 23 battles the admiral fought with 12 ships. It was not operating during my day visit in October, but I saw it in action with colored lights, passing by in a bus one night.As a history buff, I enjoyed the small museum under the plaza devoted to Admiral Yi Sun-Sin and King Sejong."
Impressive statue with fountains,This is an impressive statue located in the centre of the city and the great thing about it is that there is a museum underground here where you can also learn so much about Korean history. The statue is very close to the statue of Sejong the Great and also walking distance to Gyeongbokgung Palace.Another great feature here is the water fountain in the evening time. The fountain is lit up and changes colour all the time and here you will always find kids playing in the fountain. My own young kids insisted to come here several times.
Great pose of a great seafaring Admiral,"I just liked the pose of Admiral Yi Sun- Sin as he appears as this bronze statue on Gwanghwamun Square in Seoul. As a hero from the sixteenth century, he is celebrated for his triumphs against the invading Japanese."
Admiral Yi Sun-Sin means a lot to Koreans,"It is a small statute which you'll automatically pass by when visiting the Gwanghwamun district. There's a year-long protest going on nearby the statute, so make sure you do not offend people there by taking photos like tourists. There's always somekind of protest going on around the statute, which will rarely be a probblem for you, but still, be cautious."
The museum under the statue is worth seeing,It is recommended to start your Seoul trip here along with the statue of King Sejong the Great and then walk to the main palace. There is a nice and free museum under the two statues that tells you about these two great Korean men. The part about Admiral Yi Sun-Sin details great navel battles and shows how he saved Korea from the Japanese invasion overcoming great odds due to strategy and better ship designs. A true David and Goliath story.
Sixteenth century naval commander,"Around the country we have discovered statues of Admiral Yi Sun-Si, here in Seoul and Busan, this sixteenth century naval commander is famous for the major part he played in defending the country from the Japanese. The Admiral's bronze statue stands high on a pillar in the middle of Gwanghwamun Square, at the foot of the pillar is a model Turtle Ship, with his back to the Bukaksan Mountain and Gyeongbokgung Palace. One of the Admiral's greatest achievements was bringing back turtle ships into use and improving the design and function."
Korea's famous admiral,"The 17 m bronze statue stands in Gwanghwamun Square and in front of it there are many small water fountains that go up and down ( a favorite place for children to play in the water). The admiral was a famous hero who made his name by fighting the Japanese in the 16th century. In front of the statue tents have been erected and this seems to be the place to draw attention to various causes, such as the sinking of a Korean ship by the north."
Revered Naval Commander,"The Naval Commander who is credited for several decisive victories and ultimately sacrificing himself in a war with the Japanese in Nov 1598. His come commemorative statue is rightly placed in front of King Sejong’s statue who is in front of the palace, being the first to face any oncoming enemy. A special pedestrian street is built in the middle of the road where these statues are placed. Very powerful statement. When we were there, tents have also been set up along this street bringing awareness and prevention of desertification. "
Hero of war against Japan,"Admiral Yu Sun-Sin is a hero of war against Japan- not in a modern time, but about 400 years ago. There is a museum of his legend nearby (underground), which is quite instructive."
A Statue,This is a site you will not miss on your way to other activities. Located in Gwangwamun next to palaces and markets.
Its free and otw to the palace.,"You can't miss it, and I am not sure how you can complain when it is a free attraction. As far as the ""tent city"" is concerned, there was a ferry disaster in 2014 in which 304 passengers, most of which were high school students, died. This tent city as some call is is in response to that and actually part of the effort to memorialize the incident, seeing as how the statue is of a Mariner it was the appropriate place to set it up in an attempt to call the coast guard out for it's lack of response at the time. Out of the 172 survivors, only 30 or so were saved by the coast guard itself, fishing boats provided the majority of the rescue effort. "
"The Statue of Great Admiral, Yi Sun-sin","C ( 17.12.06 ) Admiral Yi Sun-sin was great person of Korea, and this statue is landmark in this area. Only see statue, it was simple to enjoy, but there was museum about Yi Sun-sin under this statue. Must visit this museum about Yi Sun-sin."
Take picture ,"Quick stop to just take a picture with a local landmark. If youre going to Gyeongbokgung palace, pass by here too."
Impressive statue,The Statue of Admiral Yi Sun-Sin is in Gwanghwamun Square and was put up in 1968. It is one of two statues in the square – the other being that of King Sejong The Great. Admiral Yu Sun Sin was a 16th century Korean hero. The statue is 17 metres tall and looks impressive with the background of the mountain. The statue is made of bronze. It shows the Admiral standing with a sword in his right hand. In front of the statue is a miniature turtle ship similar to the one he captained. At each corner are two drums that were used to increase the morale of soldiers going to the battlefield.Next to the statue is a fountain called the 12.23 fountain to commemorate the 12 warships he used to fight 23 battles in the fight against the Japanese invasion.
Quick picture then go,Just a few steps away from the statue of King Sejong where you just snap a few photos then go. Nothing much to see.
A Hero in the middle of the Main Street ,"This hero status is situated on the center of the Main Street. Aside from Admiral Yi Sun-Sim, the Emperor Statue is also placed in the same area.It was nice to get a glimpse of such height of statue in a busy street near the Palace.It was a coincidence when we visited as it was also the Celebration date of the Year of the Policeman. So there is a lot of man in uniforms. We decided to leave early seeing the crowd is increasing by the minute. If anyone asked me if this place if worth a visit? I would say yes if you are already visiting the palace. It was just 600 meters walk from the Palace museum. "
5 stars? Just a statue ,It's just a statue. Nice to have a quick look or snap a quick picture. Has information about his life underneath the statue. Located in front of the palace 
Imposing statue,"We found this statue in Gwanghwamun square, together with the statue of King Sejong. This is a respected historical figure and the statue is prominent and iconic.Good for a quick visit."
Historic statue,An amazing figure in Korea history and stands tall protecting the palace as well as people of Korea.You should definitely visit the museum to understand the history between Korea and Japan. Fascinating and interesting facts.Must visit place! 
Dont miss the museum,When I first saw this I was not aware of this guys importance or presence on the 1000 won note. Be sure to go to the other statue to enter the museum and learn a little about why he is there.
"It is a nice statue, but the history of Admiral Yi is really interesting","The statue is nice, but I only get the meaning of it when I have learned about Admiral Yi. Really interesting guy !! The museum under the square explains it all. Entrance is under the other statue of King Sejong."
Nice!,"This is just outside the Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Gwanghwamun Gate. So it is not hard to miss. If you're lucky, you might find a flea market that has stalls that sell Hanbok at cheap prices. So rather than rent, why not buy one and keep it as souvenir."
Good place to take a picture including the palace with mountain,"Gwanghwamun start from this point. Behind this statue, there is King Sejong statue, Gyeongbok palace and Inwangsan. Quite scenic place to look at the behind. "
Statue of a legend,"Located in Gwanghwamun Square a few hundred meters from the King Sejong statue, the statue of Admiral Yi is definitely worth seeing as well."
Worth seeing this legend,"Straight outside Gyeongbokgung palace, it was interesting to see this statue dedicated to such a historical figure who can be found on W1000 note. There is an information board and it makes a great photo.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful."
Relax after a long walk in the palace,Saw a lot of families with kids playing around. There's a garden nearby where you can sit and rest. Good after a long walk in the palace. There's fountain too. 
"Yi Sun-shin, an eternal hero of the Korean people",Statue of Admiral Yi Sun-Sin is also located in Gwanghwamun Square. Yi Sun-Sin was a mariner commander who lead soldiers in a sea battle against Japanese army.
Kids playing around,Once you are done with the palace. Go down the main square to see the shops and the statue. There are some floor fountain around the statue were kid would be playing. It is fun to see or if you wanna join them
Another statue,Another statue on the main street. If you are around go to see it. Near all important locations. A statue of an important admiral in the history of Korea.

Nice spot for photo shoot!,"This statue is nice for photo shoot, that is it. It is at the square on the way to the grande palace of Seoul."
Another Big Statue,Before you go to Gyeongbokgung palace take a picture of this statue in Sejong centre and you can take a picture Statue of Sejong the Great too.
Next to palace ,If you are coming to this area to see the palace you are bound to see the statue as it is in the front of the palace gates. Very interesting piece of work and you can gain information and the importance of this admiral underneath him in the information booth. 
Located in Gwanghwamun Square,Statue of Admiral Yi Sun-Sin located in Gwanghwamun Square together with Statue of Sejong the Great. You can hardly missed this if you are around this area or visiting the Gyeongbukgung Palace. The underground museum is must visit as it is well-designed with interesting information.
Historic Landmark at Gwanghwamun Square,"Located inside Gwanghwamun square, you will not miss out on the Statue of Admiral Yi Sun Shin. I was not able to take a close photo of the statue during my visit though due to the barricade and the people protesting within the vicinity."
Guardian looking over Seoul,"Just by standing next to this statue I can get a feeling of all the important historical events that it has witnessed. Against all the hardships it is still unconquerably standing in the heart of the city, reminding its citizens of their roots and past glories. Every capital needs a symbol like this and a hero that manifests all those attributes that are important to them as a culture. Personally it's one of my favourite places in Seoul. It's always fascinating to remember where it's all started."
Historic statue,Yi Sun-Sin was a mariner commander who lead soldiers in a sea battle against Japanese army. He also invented the turtle vessel which was a main reason of Korean victory on ancient times. This statue is located on the Gwanghwamun square on the opposite side of the palace. 
You won't miss it when you are in Gwanghwamun Square,Statue of Admiral Yi Sun-Sin was in Gwanghwamun Square; you will not miss it when you are there. Recommended to visit the surrounding museums and art galleries.
Sightseeing,"If you are in the area, there are a few spots to check out all at once. The Gyeongbokgoong Palace, Statue of Sejong, Gwanghwamun Square and etc. You should visit all of these together since it's near by and walking distance. The area is huge so you can take some cool photos. However, there are often strikes and protests which can interfere with the view or cool photo opportunities. It is one of the popular landmarks of Korean history so visit if you're in the area."
Tent city,Currently there is a tent city set up around this statue so getting a clear photo of it is a real challenge. The tents are scrappy and covered in plastic and not a good look. Some political group I guess and a shrine to the people lost in the ferry tragedy. Go underground to the museum to find out about this generals life.
Statue that shows honor and reverence of the Korean General,"This statue of Admiral that shows honor and reverence of the Korean Great Admiral of Seocheon Dynasty. It's located at Gwangwhamun Square, in the central of Seoul, near Gyeongbokgung (Palace). Very nice scenery."
A definite landmark of the Gwanghwamun area,"This is a cool statue of a man credited for developing the turtle ship that helped defeat the Japanese. You can get some fantastic views of the Gwanghwamun area including Gwanghwamun Gate and Bugak Mountain from long range. It's also conveniently located near Insadong, Cheonggyecheon Stream, and Gyeongbok Palace."
Statue of Admiral Yi Sun-Sin,"Centrally placed and at the moment the gathering area for the protests, very peaceful, against the president. Easy to walk to as you go to a variety of other sites such as The Stream"

Great statue,"There are 2 greatest person statues at gwanghwamun square that one is the status of admiral Yi sun-shin. If you have extra time, take a walk on the Gwanghwamun Square & stop by the Yi sun-shin statue after touring the #1 sightseeing Kyeongbok Palace in seoul. Gwanghwamun Square is in front of main gate of the Kyeongbok Palace."
Walking around ,It was a nice surprise that there's a museum under the statue. There's an underground museum that tells the Story of King Sejong and the Story of Admiral Yi Sunshin. There's also a cafe and a store to buy souvenirs. It's a really nice area to walk around in and explore the palaces that are near. 
Statue,The statue that sees everything lol. On front of one of the big temples gate. Close to US Embassy and a big plaza
Idolised Korean,"A very famous and revered Naval Commander who saved Korea from the Japanese. The statue is very impressive and stands out in Gwanghwamun Square. It is close to another revered figure, Sejong The Great. "
Interesting statue of an important historical figure in Korea,"This statue is very imposing and beautiful. It depicts a very important historical figure in Korea, Admiral Yi Sun-Sin. The history of the admiral's accomplishments is impressive. It is worth a 20-30 minute walk around the square to admire the statue and see kids playing in the fountain nearby."
In the heart of Seoul,It's close to many other tourist attractions. It's a great place to take a pic that you'll treasure. 
There is a surprise fun thing to do just beneath this statue,"The statue itself is cool with huge historical importance. but just beneath it is a nice fountain you can run around, get wet on a sunny day and with beautiful light play at night. we had so much fun getting wet and running around in beautiful light and water play"
"If nothing else, it’s a landmark!","One may say this statue is the most famous statue in South Korea. It really anchors the Gwanghwamun plaza and the entire district. It is a good example of a national monument, but nothing more. However, often at the feet of the statue there can be political protest or other temporary exhibitions. And on hot summer days, when protestors are somehow absent, there is a plaza water fountain that kids love to play in."
Fierce,This is a great statue .Right next to the Kings statue.A brave admiral who led his soldiers against the Japanese . You should see it.It's quite impressive.
Impressive statue,"Just before the Main Statue of the King stands admiral Yi Sun-Sin. You can spot him form far away and he stands rather proudly in the middle of a walking island. Right now the tents to remember the victims of Sewol and before you step before the admiral you are sadly reminded of the horrible accident. Around the admiral are water works where on hot days, like in July, children happily play and somehow lift the whole mood. The statue itself exudes authority and commands attention. In comparison to the kings statue, which is kind, warm and fatherly, Yi Sun-Sin shows a fierce gaze and a stance as if he is off to war."
Nice statue on the square,"Before the Main Statue of the King who invented the Korean alphabet, this is the admiral who bravely led his troops to fight against the Japanese aggressors. A symbol of courage and the Korean Identity, it stands in this iconic square in the heart of Seoul."
Admiral Yi Sun-Sin,"This whole area is great to see there is a museum underground that is awesome that is a must visit which explains the history of Admiral Yi Sun-Sin and King Sejong. The US & Korean embassy are in this area and many more places to see. Kyobo Book store is near here as well. Palaces to visit, art places, This is an area well worth visiting."
Commanding figure,I found this statue to be quite impressive. The figure exudes authority and command and immediately caught my admiration. There is also an underground museum next to it with more about the admiral.
Close to the palace so have a look,"Not worth travelling there for only this statue but since you'll most likelly be visiting the nearby Palace, have a look"
Might as well,"If you're going to visit the largest palace (Gyeongbokgung Palace) You might as well take picture with King Sejong and Admiral Yi. They are located at Gwanghwamun Sq, which is a stretch of road leading to the palace. To go here: Take metro line 5 and stop at Gwanghwamun St, exit 2, directly to the Gwanghwamun Sq. Move towards the palace and stop and take pic along the road."
Impressive statue for an impressive warrior,"This is a towering statue in Gwanghwamun Square, near the statue of Sejung the Great King and Gyeongbokgung Palace. It's easily accessible by subway (line 5 - purple).The Admiral looks fierce, and there is also a model of the type of boat he used to fend off the Japanese. Nearby is an underground display of his story, along with the story of Sejong the Great King.Be impressed!"
Admire the admiral on your way to Gyeongbukgung Palace,"The admiral cuts an imposing figure on the main boulevard as you walk towards Gyeongbukgung Palace. Be sure to snap a picture of him as you walk past; just try not to get distracted by the heavily fortified U.S. Embassy located on the other side of the street. 'Murica, indeed."
Impressive sight,"This statue of the man responsible for creating Korean currency is located near palaces, as well as art and history museums, so try to work it into your visit to the neighborhood. Like some of the palaces, it's lit up at night, so you might want to take a photo around dinner time. When I visited there was a memorial in front dedicated to the students who died in the tragic ferry incident."
History lovers and a touristy spot,Read about Admiral Yi Sun Sin and take some time to walk along Gwanghwamun Square. Nice a a couple of picture.
Statue of the historically important Admiral Yi Sun-Shin at Gwanghwamun Square,"One of the interesting things you will see at Gwanghwamun Square is the bronze statue of Admiral Yi Sun-Shin, erected here in 1968.

Historical Spot to remember Korea's past,"Before coming to this place, read about Admiral Sun-Yi; a very memorable and heroic character of Korean Empire. They even made a movie about him a couple of years ago. Recommended to see on your way to Seoul's forbidden city."

All these places are very nearby,"Been here for a day tour while on a business visit.Very conveniently located in city, 15 min walk from holiday inn.Weather was very pleasant.Glad to see how they preserve such a ancient monument. "
Every time I'm inspired,Setting at Admiral Yi's statue always makes me think about another time and place - which i assume has also been very formative to modern day Korea. And the statue is also quite imposing. Take a moment and enjoy the moment with him
Nice Statue,"Big Statue of Admiral Yi Sun-sin, History & Story of the Admiral is displayed in the museum underground. There are lot of videos & pictures & historic items on display."
Better of the 2,"This is a very impressive statute. When standing beneath it, he looks like he's staring down at you. Might as well stop by if going to the palace or anywhere in Insadong. "
Greatest naval commander ,The art of war must have lived in his blood. His invention of the crane technique in battle with only a few to win over hundreds in battle is definitely worth earning the title as the greatest naval commander. Worth a visit!
