Value for Money,"For a reasonble price, he took us around to a lot of nice locations on South Jeju Island. He was a great photographer, as well. Thank you Mr Yang!"
Great service :),Mr. Yang is a very friendly driver and provided awesome service throughout the whole day - explained in detail what each attraction is about and gave us the opportunity to explore the popular spots across the entire island in a short period of time. Much appreciate his help and passion for tour guidance! Very convenient trip overall!
Great guide and photographer!,Mr. Yang is a wonderful guide. He took us around to some of the most picturesque locations on west Jeju Island. Gave us plenty of time to enjoy the sights. He is a great photographer as well! Thank you Mr Yang! 
Great driver in Jeju,He is very helpful driver. With cheaper price than others. He guides us to wonderful places. Especially he helped us to buy ticket at Eco Land which is cheaper than booth selling
Jeju taxi tour best,"We retained this company for 2 days. Our first day was with Mr Kim Jinu and our second was with Mr. Yang. I was happy with the promptness of the email correspondence as we planned these trips. Both drivers arrived on time and had cars that were comfortable and in excellent condition. Both drivers did their best to ensure that we saw what we wished to see. There were some differences between the drivers. We felt that Mr. Jinu gave us more time to explore and enjoy the sites while Mr. Yang was focused ( at least in the beginning) on moving us along, perhaps to ensure that we were able to see all we had set out to see. Mr. Jinu's command of the English language is far better than Mr. Yang's. Mr. Yang took far more photos of us, and the photos were framed excellently. Both men watched out for us and were great taxi drivers. Mr Jinu was very kind and gave us a lovely gift of some cooking seaweed upon our entering his vehicle and some water along the way. If you speak English, Mr Jinu is easier to communicate with. If you speak Korean, both men are excellent. "

Good and reliable taxi tour in Jeju,"I had booked another taxi tour but was sent this instead. Mr Wang was punctual, suggested the sequence of sights to see based on best route, helped us with tickets and also taking pictures. We are a family of three and always miss out on pictures where all three of us are in one frame. This was a pleasant exception. The only drawback was he hardly spoke any English but we knew what we wanted to do, so it wasn’t an issue. Overall it was a good day and we will gladly recommend him to others."

Best Driver/Guide in Jeju!,Mr. Gwang Bo Yang’s service is superb! He fetched us at the airport at 8:30am even if the official schedule to drive us around Jeju starts from 9am. He recommended a lot of places and took a lot of good photos. He patiently waited for us while we explore and even brought us umbrellas when it started raining hard! :))
EXCELLENT JEJU TAXI TOUR,"Mr Yang’s tour is excellent, and he helps to take super pretty pictures. Totally recommended! The trip was well planned and I appreciate how he brief us about the day’s plan."
Excellent taxi/guide,"Our cruise stopped in Jeju for a day and rather than take a ship excursion we found Mr Park, an English speaking taxi drive. We told him what sights we wanted to visit and worked out an itinerary with him prior to our visit. He gave us a price for the day and it was very reasonable split between the 4 adults. His car was excellent as was his driving. Very friendly chap. Happy to take photos of us any time. Highly recommended. Contact details: +82 10 8664 4377 (WhatsApp) or e mail pth4377@hanmail.net"
Good,Good and very niceTook a lot of pictures and recommended very good food!!! 10/10 will book again!!!
Last minute tour ,"My two friends and I booked a last minute tour of the eastern side of the island with Mr. Yang. He was very accommodating and picked us up at our hotel in Seogwipo with just an hours notice. I speak Korean, so he basically just talked to me and then I translated what he was saying to my friends. He was overly hospitable at times, mainly insisting that we take numerous photos with a thumbs up at every location, but we knew he just wanted us to have good memories. I would have to say his English is non-existent in my book. Overall, he listened to our itinerary wishes and also recommended a few other must-see places. Our tour lasted 5 hours, and covered a lot of distance that we wouldn't have been able to, without renting a car and planning a route. Thank you, Mr. Yang. "
Great!!,Amazing tour with Mr.Yang...he is very friendly and likes to take too much photos... I told about my wishes and he show me more than I was waiting.. 100% satisfied..
Jeju trải nghiệm cùng chú Yang,He is the best driver and tourguide when you dont know where and how to visit recommended places.His attitude and passion is great with foreigners even he speak English a bit.
The best tour!!!!,"When I asked a friend that used to live in jeju what to do when we got there she suggested “jeju taxi tour best”. The best recommendation we got by far!!!! Mr. Yang took photos at all the best locations and showed us the local spots and history, not to mention extremely nice and funny. If you go to jeju.....THIS TOUR IS A MUST!"
Best taxi tour,"Mr. Yang picked us up at our hotel and took us on a tour of the east side in a day. We hit all the popular spots: seongeup folk village, seopjikoji cape, gwangchiji seaside, seongsan ilchulbong, manjanggul cave, mysterious road, and eorimok hiking trail. He’s friendly and enthusiastic to show his city. For lunch, he took us to a local spot where you can get abalone, hair tail fish, and live baby octopus. Would definitely recommend a tour with Mr. Yang!"
More than you can ask for!!! ,"If you are looking for a friendly guide who loves to capture your experience, Mr Yang is the best!!! We lucked out and booked him with the recommendation of the hotel concierge. He is fun, energetic, and gets you where you want to go quickly. If you are planning a visit to Jeju Island, be sure to request his services. He speaks mainly Korean with some English. "
Taxi tour of Jeju island,"Went on tour of Jeju island with Mr. Yang. He picked us up from the market near the ferry terminal and brought us around the island. In a short period of time we were able to see several of the island highlights like the volcanic crater, the lighthouse park and a folk village. He also did a great job of taking photos for usI only wish we had more time on the island as the sights deserved more time than we were able to give to them. It was great that the taxi also had free wifi. "
