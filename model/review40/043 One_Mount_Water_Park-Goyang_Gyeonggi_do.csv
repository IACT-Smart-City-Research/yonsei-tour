Joel,Good for small children. The rides for adults andolder children were really long. Also some of the rides for small children require extra payment. The entrance fee is high enough it should cover all rides.
One Mount Water Park,"Water attractions are nice. However, they accept people much above the center capacity. Therefore, for each attraction it is necessary to wait quite long time in queues. It is not worth to go there under such conditions."
"Snowpark, slide","As people who are coming from tropical country, visiting this snowpark is just like entering a new world. In this snowpark, we can experience the activities that can only be done in winter time. To reach this place, just go to Juyeop Station and take bus 080 from Muncheon Village bus stop (the bus stop is in the middle of the road). "
Refresh your heat during Summer in Korea,"OneMount Water Park is the big water park in Gyeonggi-do, Korea. The best & unique rides is the spiral slider which is located on the roof top of the building. You will be thrilled while sliding and seeing the scenery at the same time."
Very cool!!!,"This is such a neat place! You can skate with just regular shoes and see the huskies too! And if you check the place out, there's also a sledding area just beyond the main skating rink."
Kids enjoy the snow,We visit Snow Park which is in the same building with Water Park.Basically not really a big snow park. However it worth to visit especially if you travel with kids.Our daughters enjoy the snow. We spend almost 4 hours here.We took subway from Myeongdong Station & transfer to Line 3 at Chungmuro station & hoop out at Juyeop Station. Take exit 2 and walk straight through the garden around 15 minutes to Onemount Park where this snow park located.
Onemount snow park,"Actually we went to Onemount snow park rather than the water park. we went there about 2 plus and noted that the tickets will be cheaper if we purchase after 3pm. It can quite tiring to be there whole day. We left about 5plus before it closes at 6pm. My elder kid (age 8) love the skating there but the younger one (age 6) keeps falling down and dont quite enjoy it as much. But to be fair, I dont see the rest of the kids falling down as much. The skating field can be slippery though if you are not careful.You need to be properly gearly when inside so that we can enjoy yourself. we have rented the jackets to keep ourselves warm. also we need to have the gloves before playing the slide (for kids, we bought it in onemount. whereas, my husband has a pair which we used in rotation.Overall, we enjoyed this attraction. "
Mount? Not even a hill...,"1. It is way outside Seoul, so it toom us quite some time to get there. This alone would not have been a reason to give a bad rating, but...2. High entrance fee considering what was offered... they charged us 50.000 won per person (36 month and above!!), but luckily we got a 50%-off discount voucher. Korean sign at ticket booth showed different (way lower) reduced prices, but maybe we were just stupid foreigners that could not read 한글3. More than half of the slides were closed; those open you could only ride if you are taller than 120 cm, less than 55 years old, or, in case of the tube rides, not single (which was the case since your daughter was too short and was rejected and we adults could not go together since somebody had to watch our toddler...)4. They charge you for everything: deck chair, tent, life vest etc. Would not have an issue, since we did not want to take a deck chair or a tent, but...5. The make you wear a life vest (see 4.) even if you can swimm!! And not just the children... No matter if you want to ""ride"" the water channel (no current or waves at all, 1 m water depth, booooring!) or just want to go into the wave pool (30 cm waves, boooooring)6. Most of the important signs are in Korean only, and of course NONE of the people working there speaks at least enough english to explain you the basics, give you directions, or answer your questions7. ... I probably could find some more points to scold about (considwring my daughters disapointed expression after she realized she only could go on the baby slides...), but after rereading up to this point I wonder why I spent more time writing this review than I had fun time in One Mount..."
2 hour visit from Seoil,"We went there with our 10 urn old boy. Left Seoul at 9pm, took the MRT. It's quite far from Seoul. 1 hr on MRT and another 15 minutes walk with nothing on the way. The One Mount Mall was deserted. Very quiet. It's out if town in the living area full of high rise local apartments. It's near another shopping center but we didn't go.We went straight to Snow Park. The price is OK. If you need to buy glove, buy it inside snow park. It's just 1,000won comps e to 2,000won downstairs. Snow park provided a few selections of sleds to play on ice. Quality of ice is so-so. My boy tried ice skating for the first time. Ice was not made for ice skating. The wee bumps here and there and tracks from sled too (share the same area). It was not bad for weekdays but can't imagine how weekend would be with more people. Ice slider was not in good condition. Nothing else to do so we were there for just over an hour and came back all the way to Seoul. A but disappointed though. Better go to the Lotte Park because you don't need to commute 3 hours back and forth like this one."
Wow... and not in a good way.,"Horrible experience. Typically overcrowded, rude people all around, and you have to pay for EVERYTHING. Literally. Entrance fee only gets you in the door, have a fistful of cash to actually do anything once inside."
Ermagerd,"If your idea of fun is spending inordinate amounts of money to stand in a crowd for up to an hour to use a waterslide or swim in a pool with more people than water, this is the dream location."
Water Park with family young children,"The water park have indoor and outdoor part. Friend remind must to wear swimming cap, otherwise you can't play, and don't throw the receipt when you leave the changing room, because you need to use the receipt to exchange the lift jacket, if you don't have receipt, you need to pay 6000 won to rent one. Have a fun and enjoy many activities."
Cool place,"It's new and it is fun! You can go here during summer to cool off~Also, there is a snow park right beside it, so you can go there as well.There are lots of rides for couples and only few for single people. So, it is a highly recommended place to go with your partner!"
One Mount waterpark,"We visited the Water Park in the summer and it's quite crowded with local families with children. There is a free shuttle bus from the Juyeop Station every 30min or so (expect lunch from 12-2). Otherwise it's about 15min walk. Remember to bring your own swimming cap or beach hat or baseball cap, it's a requirement to wear it for adult and children, otherwise you will have to buy it from the water park store. Most of the pools require children to wear their life jacket as well which you must rent at the park. You go inside the park at the rest area where u open up your locker for the shoe, you will get a locker key. This is the number of your changing room locker when you go inside the changing area. Inside the water park, you pay everything with your lock key, no need to bring cash. You can buy inflatable swimming rings / toys etc inside the park. Small children under 6-7 probably can only play around the main pool and the river. The top floors are mainly for teenagers and adults with longer slides etc. For older citizen, there is a lift, but takes ages to get in (about 15min). Overall, if you have plenty of time in Seoul on a hot summer day and can spare about a day then it's a good choice. But otherwise it's not one of a kind water park."
A refreshing break from the summer heat!,"I visited this place with my nieces and nephews. They loved it! Grown up in Europe I would say that it is a little bit different to the waterparks I have been to there. So if you're a foreigner, you should be aware of some cultural differences.What stands out the most is that most people have rashguards and shorts on. You also have to wear a head garment, so I would advise to bring a cap so that they won't force you to buy a swim-cap. You are not forced to wear a longsleeveed rashguard, but most korean people just would not go in a bikini, not even to the beach. I don't think it matters though, in the end you have a lifewest on so it's not a big deal.You have to rent a life-west even if you can swim and even if you're an adult unless you bring your own. I don't necessarily like it, but the wave pool can get really crowded and I was really glad I had it on a couple of times. I guess it depends a bit on the season you go and at what time, we went early in the morning and it was more pleasant than later during the day as it got more crowded. The food is okay and as in most theme-parks and amusement parks, a bit overpriced. However it was worth if, we only had one meal, burgers and coke from Lotteria and the kids loved it so I didn't mind paying a couple bucks more than the usual price. Outside there are several slides, the queue moved quickly and we didn't have to wait very long. There were also some kiddy pools that seemed very clean and well looked after. I think it is a great place to spend a couple hours. I mostly enjoyed the outdoor slides and the relaxing hot tubs. Some younger kids might be restricted from the larger slides though. If you're a tourist/foreigner I think it might be good to take into consideration that it might be a bit different from what you are used to, as culture does play a part. I read some other reviews before starting mine, and realized that not wearing only a bikini and being forced to wear a lifewest might seem strange to some. Even if you go to the beach here, most people are almost fully 'covered'. If you mentally prepare for it to be different, it should not be a problem.  Anyway I had a good time with the kids and hope others will too."
Place with plenty of eateries,"We stayed at MVL so appreciate that there was One Mount to visit nearby. One Mount is a shopping mall with eateries and theme Parks. There's a water park on top of the mall and also a Snow Park, didn't visit either but from the looks of it the Water Park looks fun. There are a few big named stores like Zara, H&M and smaller stores around. There are also many places to get affordable food too. It isn't a big shopping mall and was quiet most of the time. Don't travel specially to visit unless you want to visit the water park. Ilsan Lake Park is just behind One Mount, a good place to explore too."
Horrible experience,Never ever go again. No smile no greeting from staff. From the moment you reach the ticketing counter you are greet by all the unfriendly staff with their black face. Even the staff posted at all the rides are the same. They are trying to shoo you off the rides asap once it's finish.
90% staff very rude,"We visited the Snow park, not water park, on march 16th this year. From the female attendant (attitude problem) at the main entrance ticketing counter to the 2 females at the skating rink (the older was not that bad. At least she helped a kid who fell down and smiled abit while the younger one was really unfriendly. We asked about the carousel, she said 3pm. When we returned at 3, she gave the dreaded look, like we are giving her problems and making her job difficult). And next at snow hill, the male at the top was quite zzz while the female at the bottom was just totally mean. My friend's kid fell as it was slippery - she rolled her eyes because she had to walk over and help the kid up and get off the slides quickly for the next group. Really? Rolling her eyes? Especially when there was no one left in the Q, the male was gona get down for a break maybe.. when he saw my friend's kid coming up for another ride... Both male and female staff gave the zzzzzzzz face. I wanted to ride as well but after seeing their faces, i decided to leave early.The female staff at the everslide as well, was unfriendly - we didn't even bother to go on the ride. So, in short, maybe All the females on duty on 16th march are menopausal or their salary is so low that they wish people will not come to snow park and make them do their jobs to watch and operate rides.Only ONE guy at the locker / dog sled ticket counter was helpful.It was not even crowded that day at all so why is the staff on such bad behavior?? They can give fake smiles if they want but no, not a single smile at all. We will definitely not visit snow park ever again. It's supposed to be a fun theme park but became a hell park.Compared to Everland, which is the friendliest place - even if they are not sure and cannot help, they say sorry and smile."
One Mount Snow Park!,"I did not go to the water park. I went to the snow park which was located just opposite the water park. You can experience winter fun even during summer times! There is an large ice rink located right in the middle whereby u can use the different kinds of sledge provided to play with, visitors of all ages will be able to enjoy the fun.."
Paying much for being told how to have fun,"The only good part was that there was a 50% foreigners discount when we came. Stil it was a LOT of money for a family of five (110USD) for a few hours in a swimming pool. I can't imagine paying dubble that. But the paying had just begun. Our food was taken out of our bags on entrance. I had brought life vests for my youngest kids who can't swim, but found to our horror that all kids and adults have to wear life vests which you have to rent there for the day. My atlethic husband who is a very good swimmer was quite mad at being pushed out of the pool (knee high) as soon as he got in. There can be up to thousands of people, and my estimate is that at least a quarter of them are guards. They are constantly whistling at you for doing something wrong. For example I took of my swimming cap for a moment as it was so tight. Not allowed. Everybody around me was just wearing baseball caps, with long hair down. So there is no rhime or reason to it. The life vest was choking me when in the water and with one of these on it is impossible to actually swim. Although the place seems clean, it was surprising to see most people entering the water dressed. Hardly anybody was wearing a swim suit. I just hoped all their clothes were washed before they entered... It is noisy as *&%, and when you want to sit down you find you have to pay 15 USD to rent a chair, or 35 USD to rent a little tent. Food is of course overpriced. Some of the fun looking things one also had to pay extra for. You can pay everything with a chip in the lockerband. On exit you have to go to the 'adjusted fare' counters to pay whatever you have used or eaten. Only then you get your shoes back. But I figured my shoes weren't worth that much. Granted, my kids loved the slides, and the kiddie pool on the roof was nice once the weather cleared up. But no, paying that much for being bossed about is not my idea of fun."
Fun day out,"I visited in June. I don't know if it was because it was a bit early in the season or people were avoiding public places because of the MERS outbreak being a big deal in the news at the time, but it was really quiet! All the facilities were open, but there was no wait time for any of the slides, fantastic.I really enjoyed the slides, lazy river ride and wave pool. It's not huge but there was enough to keep us occupied. You have to rent a lifejacket (think it was 5,000 won) if you want to use the pools and lazy river. You also need a cap, but a baseball cap will do. If you only want to use the slides you don't need a life jacket or cap. The facilities were modern and clean.The price was discounted by more than 50% when we went so that and the lack of queues meant it was well worth it. I would definitely recommend it for a visit outside of peak season."
Snow Park ,One Mount also have a snow park. There is an ice ring and tube slide inside. You can only use hired ice skates. There is also other ice transportation devices that you can use for free. There is a sled that is pulled by real dogs. You can stay busy for around 2 hours. Overall it was a good activity. 
Horrendous,"If your idea of fun is sliding into body warmed water with half of the population of Korea and pay through the nose for the pleasure, this is your place. Even with the constant promotions and events, it's still pricey for a family, there are several height, age AND weight restrictions. The biggest burn was the inability to bring any food or drink into the park, leaving you hostage to awful price gouging. It's redeeming factor is it is on the rooftop of the shopping centre beneath and affords fine views over Ilsan, which you will get a lot of whilst waiting interminably for the crowded rides."
Enjoyable day out,"The waterpark is only 30 minutes from Seoul. It is new, clean and well organised. We were lucky enough to go when it was pretty quiet. There were no lines for the slides and that was good. The water temperature was very nice. Children need to be 120 cm tall to ride most of the slides. The attendants were quite strict on this.There is a wave pool, giant children's structure and four or five slides inside. There was also a lazy river and some warm Jacuzzi type Pools. As it was February the outside was closed but we had an enjoyable time inside. On their website foreigners get a 50% discount which meant my family's cost went from $150 to $75. Was it worth it for $75? maybe just about. I certainly wouldn't be paying more. Parking was free for up to 3 hours and there is a nice shopping area right there with restaurants and a variety of shops. My advice would be to get there early.One little tip. When you are queueing to get your tickets you must get a number from the machine which is on the left hand side of all the ticket booths. Waited there in line without one of these tickets and wasted 15 minutes. Overall we had a fun time and will probably go back."
Water Park & Snow Park all Year Round,"Not far from Seoul and you can enjoy the snow here. Outdoor snow slope will open in Winter. But you can enjoy the indoor one all year round. For Water Park, they will adjust the temperature of the water up to the weather."
Not just a place for the young but also for the old :),"There are 2 parks. The park I've been its the snow park, unfortunately it was winter so there is no way we could go to the water park. The kids had plenty of fun!! "
Fun n Release,"First time to this water park, it's mainly for korean, but it had a clear english sign. This water park with 2 floor, the best area is on 7 floor a lot of outdoor activities over there it's a lot of fun n excisting. . Good to go there to enjoy ."
Nice attraction,"One Mount has 2 parks, a water and a ""snow"" park. Both can be very enjoyable but there are some unexpected and potentially frustrating elements for Western travelers.-First try to go during school days. Week-ends and school holidays mean the place can be packed to the gills with young children and be very loud.-If you are not a resident of Korea you can get 30 to 40% off at the ticket booth (show passport or foreign driver's license).-The indoor snow park is fun but well it isn't a snow park... there is no snow at all. It is a ice-skating rink with an outer ring, partly covered, making it feel like you are skating in a tunnel. Pretty cool, but don't really expect to skate on the skating rink. It is covered with children in luges, some sorts of buckets on skates and weird ""ice bikes"". The outer ring allows for a little skating if you arrive early, but the ice, which is not smoothened during the day, is quickly trashed by large dog-sleighs, yes with real dogs, and people riding the ice bikes! It does make for a merry time with children or for young couples though.-Mezzanines in 2 upper floors have random games and activities for kids (plastic duck fishing, toy car racing track...) and some Korean snack food and udon.-Up on the roof are 2 slopes, which may have snow in winter, but in summer when I went were converted to water tubing, one of which could be ridden without getting wet, by both people from the water and snow park.-As for the water park, the slides are awesome but forget about swimming, (as other reviewers stated life jackets are mandatory somehow which does ruin the experience), or relaxing (extremely noisy inside). Also go with friends who will ride with you. Most of the slides are ridden in 2-3 people tubes so it can be annoying having to pair-up with random people."
water & snow theme park,"Spend a day at One Mount. Nice place having fun with kids, even the old folks enjoy. Do prepare winter stuff for snow park & swimsuit and cap for water park. Free locker available."
Utterly frustrating,"I took three children with me for a day of fun and relaxation. It cost me approx 150 dollars but I was looking forward to relaxing in the water. The place itself is well equipped with a satisfactory variety of slides, spa pools, lazy river, adventure playgrounds etc. However, the only way you are allowed in the water is if you are wearing a life jacket (which you have to pay to rent for the day). Even the 90 cm deep family pool requires that every person (adults and children included) wears a life jacket because of 'safety'. This completely ruined my enjoyment of the attraction as you can't swim and relax with a life jacket on. There is absolutely nowhere in this attraction where you can enjoy swimming in a pool unencumbered. There are other water parks in Korea who only require a life jacket in the wave machine pool. I will not come back to this place. Not being able to enjoy the water made it a complete waste of money."
