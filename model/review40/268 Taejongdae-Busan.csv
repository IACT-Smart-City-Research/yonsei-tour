Interesting place to be,"We took a bus from central Busan to the last stop at a place where we were approached by a man who asked us whether we wanted to take a boat trip around the park's coast. We agreed, and were driven to the port by a free-shuttle bus. From there, we took a boat ride around the southern tip of Busan. After the boat trip, we walked to the Park and explored it by foot and also took a train which runs around the park. Very interesting place to be, especially the views from the lighthouse.A lot of walking involved, so wear comfortable shoes!"
A park on the sea,"A nice park to spend a few hours in. Green forests, rocky beach, temples and monuments are only part of what this place has to offer."
Amazing view!,It was raining and the Danubi train doesn't operate even when it drizzles. Be prepared to climb 4.5km up to the top. It was an awesome slow walk up. 
Amazing View!,"Despite the endless steps, this place is stunningly beautiful.Great angle and position for photos. It was breathtaking. Though the time spent here was short, it was really worth it!"
Must visit place in Busan,Taking bus no 8 from Jagalchi to Taejongdae. The fare is about 1.2k. Then walking around 5 minutes to the entrance to catch a Danubi Train. (3k per ride ~ with 3 stop). The view is awesome. A lot of stairs but just chill and walk slowly so you can enjoy the view.
Taejongdae Park,"Amazing view of the cliff, the lighthouse everything. You should come here early morning if you want to catch avoid the queue for the Danube train going up. But you can hike all the way up for around 30mins."
Beautiful View,"The view is beautiful, lighthouse in the cliffside. But the you need to take stairs going down and up. A bit tiring for us, who are not so physically active."
"Steep climb to the top of the lighthouse, great exercise for a 70 year old!",Beautifully sunny day day hot work but worth it. Lots of climbing steps to get there but all well organised
A scenic view that worth it,"The scenic view is stunning ! Try also the lighthouse. But you will need to be enduring, found downstairs and upstairs. Should be done during sunny days !"
Good walking,Took a taxi from our hotel to here. Relatively easy walking in a loop which takes a couple of hours allowing for stops. Nice views; a few steps to the lighthouse. We went down to a pebble beach where the ferry trips go from and raw fish was being sold. 
Leisure Walk with Good View,"Getting there by public transport from city centre may take awhile. Hence, we took a cab from Seomyeong Station costing Krw 21k (cab driver did a detour, otherwise cheaper) taking abt 30 mins. You could view the park by either taking the Danubi train (Krw 3k) with 3 stops to view the places of interest or walk along the pavement next to the train path. If you opt to take the train, time will be wasted waiting for the next train at the bus stop after each stop. We decided to walk the 4.5km trail as it offered more scenic view at our leisure pace. It is better to start the trail counter clockwise as suggested by the brochure because the last section after the temple is downhill all the way! Once your reached the Yeongdo Lighthouse area, you have the option to walk down to the Lighthouse as well as further down to the rocky shoreline to see the fishermen at work. Not recommended for those with knee problem to walk down the 500+ steps as walking back up would be challenging. The last stop is the temple where you can find transquility.From here, we decided to take a taxi to Shinsegae Centum City Shopping Mall (Krw 21k toll included). You could also go to the Songdo Skywalk or Oryukdo Skywalk, etc."
Beautiful Lighthouse,"Spectacular views from the lighthouse and observation deck , you will have to walk down and up many flights of stairs but the hike is well worth it."
Great outdoor activity.,"You need a non rainy day for the park, but a slight drizzle also works. The bus inside the park shuts down during rain, so keep that in mind. However its a really good place if you are in mood for a long walk. I visited during the evening and the lighthouse at night still looks pretty."
nice view from hilltop,"a view from uphill is always a nice thing to experience. in taejongdae hill it was at its best. we enjoyed the train ride to and fro,started from the base office. one can opt for the on-foot travelling enjoying the breeze. we skipped the light-house stop & got down @ the temple. it was amazing to visit a temple among forest. so serene it was. a must go when you are in Busn. "
Neat,The South Korean coastline is beautiful however we had to wait an hour to ride the train up to the lighthouse. Not easy to walk around so keep that in mind for elderly or injured. 
A day in Taejongdae,"It's reachable by bus. Across the bus stop, There were people offering boat ride that cost 20000 won per person and will take you to the ferry station. It was a wonderful and relaxing experience. we were able to see a part of the island. After the boat ride, we joined the bus tour that brings you to the lighthouse. It costs around 40000 won. Sad part, It was raining that time so we were not able to go around the area that much. "
A day to taejongdaeüòçüíØ,The entrance to taejongdae park was free and its easy access with direct bus from busan station. It was a long walk with a slopes to go the lighthouse so do dress in proper shoes and bring lots of water.The view from the lighthouse was amazing and its windy too! Its worth the climb if you love the view and the wind !
Use their mini train!,"Give around two to three hours to explore this place. Use the mini train to take you uphill around the attractions then downhill. You hop on hop off as you like. They run every 15 minutes. 3000 won/adult. The train doesn't have a/c but the windows are open and kept it cool. Last train is at 1730. It is quite a trek if not! Wear comfortable shoes. There are many steps. The major attraction is the light house/ scenic view of the ocean. There is also a boat that cruises around, 11000 won/ adult. They end at 1800."
Historical relaxing beautiful view point,Taejongdae is named after the ancient king. It was also a place the fairy gods came to relax. It was also where the depressed would commit suicide in the old days. It has a nice viewing platform over the vast ocean. There is a statue of a mother and her children reminding all of a mother‚Äôs love. About 200 meter down is the lighthouse which has an even nicer view. The park is well constructed and the train which circle the track only cost 3000 Won per person. It is worth exploring the area and enjoy the nature. 
The Sunset Point is one of the best sunset view,"I went to Taejongdae before sunset. Foggy at the top of the hill. But at the sunset view, no fog at all!"
Nice place ,"Once you get to the top of the lighthouse the view you getting je breathtaking with the rocks, waves, city in the background & the blue sky in summer. I do recommend going "
Taejongdae,"Taejongdae is one of the iconic attractions in Busan and also the locals' favourite hangout spot during the weekends! Well known for its rock beach and clear blue waters, Taejongdae is a place not to be missed when you visit Busan!*If you have limited time for this attraction, get off the Danubi train at the Yeongdo Lighthouse station!„ÄäTaejongdae Resort Park ÌÉúÏ¢ÖÎåÄ„Äã24, Jeonmang-ro, Yeongdo-gu, Busan (Î∂ÄÏÇ∞Í¥ëÏó≠Ïãú ÏòÅÎèÑÍµ¨ Ï†ÑÎßùÎ°ú 24 (ÎèôÏÇºÎèô))‚è∞ March - October 04:00-24:00November - February 05:00-24:00Danubi TrainOperating hours: 09.20am to 5.30pmTicket Pricing: 3000‚Ç© per adult, 1500‚Ç© per child*Note: This is a one-way train.

great view!,"It's a hike down the stairs but totally worth it, with a view of the coastline in both directions. The lighthouse was closed when we were there but walking around is still fun, with benches along the way to rest. "
Relaxing train ride,"It was late when I reached the area, so I just got on the train which went along the road in a circle. The easiest and fastest way to look at scenery but will lack some experience and sights reserved for those who walked the off-road paths. Gorgeous view even for train riders; the train will stop at designated areas so you can hop off, wander around and hop on to the next train if you want."
Spectacular sea view and nice walking,"Took public transport to this place from jalgachi market area directly to this place. It was a Sunday and there was huge traffic jam leading to this scenic spot but it is well worth the visit. I choose walking, while you can pick the scenic tour bus for 3000 won for adults. It has multiple stops so you can hop on and off on designated viewing spots. The walk is not strenuous, but altogether took around one hour depending on how long you stay on each spot. All of them offer different views. If you want to sink in to the ocean view, the sea breeze and the sound of birds singing altogether, this is the place. There are two convenience stores on the route. There are also good bathroom facilities on the way. Check out the photos. Heading back I took 1006 bus which travels to BEXCO via the Gwangali Bridge, the journey took an hour or so but this is an economical way to tour a bit more of the city. "
It's okay,"Place with amazing view. Kinda boring, not so many things to see. I spent there half an hour and it was enough. Nice spot for photos."
A walk at Taejongdae Park,"Took the Metro Line 2 - Seomyeon Station changed to Metro Line 1 - Nampo Station, alighted and walked to the bus station located directly opposite of the Lotte Mall Gwangbok (Youngdo Bridge 01-064) and took Bus No. 30 (alt Bus No. 8) all the way to last stop at Taejongdae Park (Taejongdae Spa 04-192). Once there, you‚Äôve got two options; (1) to climb on your own or (2) head to the Ticket Office to purchase Danubi Train for 3,000 won per person. After payment, you‚Äôll be issued with a ticket with the train no. Waited for the train no. to be flashed on the screen before joining the queue. Thereafter we alighted at the Lighthouse and explored the rest on our own. Truly a sight to behold. A good exercise before stuffing our face at Jagalchi Market (will write about it in my next post!)Key takeaways:-(1) always check weather forecast before heading out to Taejongdae Park;(2) best to bring along a poncho/umbrella; (3) remember to hydrate well by bringing water bottle(s);(4) bring snacks/fruits to enjoy during the walk; and(5) always carry a trash bag to keep the park clean at all times. Have fun! "
Very Pretty,"It‚Äôs a bit of a hike back up, but the view over the sea is beautiful . On a very clear day one can see Japan in the distance...."
Must-see in Busan ,Went to Taejongdae with the family. The view was spectacular with the sea view which can even reach japan. There are good resting spot as the area has many flights of stairs. Every part of this park is worth walking for.
Breathtaking view from the hill,Nice scene from the hill and lighthouse to view the cliff and sea. However it is quite a small area so don't expect something like Great Ocean Road in Australia or 7 Sister White Cliff in England. 
Be prepared to climb many steps!,There are easily 500 steps up and down and there is only one way. The lighthouse is enclosed at the top so don‚Äôt expect any windswept hair photos. The views are definitely good. This is not possible for those with mobility issues. We took the Danubi train to this stop. 
Beautiful Lighthouse in Busan,"You can spend many hours here exploring the lighthouse, temple, garden etc. Admission price is $3000 won per adult. $2500 won for teenagers and $1500 for child. You will have access to the shuttle bus moving you from different attractions within this Taejongdae park. We enjoyed ourselves very much and the lighthouse is one attraction you won't want to miss. You can climb up the lighthouse and admire the scenery."
Lighthouse!,"I love lighthouses and visiting Taejongdae is a must! The walk to the lighthouse is quite long but we were rewarded with great views of the sea, cliff and the lighthouse. "
Worth it!,"My friend and I hiked up the park and the total duration was about 2-3 hours depending on your speed. The hike was relatively easy with some inclines but if unable to walk for long distances, there is a little train that can bring you around the attractions. Would recommend walking and exploring this area to see amazing views :) You can take a bus from Busan Station and it is the terminal stop. Would definitely recommend this place. There are many restaurants in this area also with cafes. They generally have english menus so not much of a problem. However, we tried a store that has no english menu and turned out to be great! The picture of the store looks like that but I am not sure what it's called in Korean."
Breathtaking view,"The area around the lighthouse is absolutely breathtaking. Steep, dramatic cliffs make for an amazing view. As a bonus you get to eat quality fresh raw seafood provided by the haenyo. The whole area is beautiful, the lighthouse are even more so."
A resort park,"This is a resort park with a little train that goes around to all the attractions. There is a light house, an observatory and a temple. I would only recommend this to families with young kids or for people that want to take a nice stroll since this park does a nice loop. "
Worth it for the views,We enjoyed our time here as part of the Busan City tour and although busy was well worth the trip. Lots to explore and do go up to the top of the lighthouse.
Beautiful scenery,"The view is great from the top of the cliff, do take note that you will need to climb lots of stairs to get to the light house and climbing back up is a challenge. The last stop ""Taejongdae temple"" can be a miss if it's not spring period, nothing much there to see.If you are taking the tram, do take note that you might need to wait for a few rounds if you try getting up from the last stop."
Beautiful Cliff,"Even took the Danubi train till the lighthouse stops, but you still require some foot steps in order to reach the cliff area. It is a place to take great photos and chill out. There are some fisherman selling sashimi under the cliff but I didn't went down because it required lot of steps to reach there. After visit the place, you can have your lunch at the food street located opposite the Taejongdae Entrance. We tried the pork soup with rice which tasted awesome."
Beautiful scenery,"Beautiful scenery but note steep climb if you decide to hike. For elderly and children, it's best to ride the Danubi train which takes you around the park and you can hop on and hop off. Do note that trains may not run if it rains heavily. Unfortunately we were caught in a heavy downfall and waited for the train. Eventually they sent a bus to pick us up."
Magnificent Cliff,Taejongdae park is the famous place with rock beach n magnificent cliff. U can see the view from observatory deck at the lighthouse.. U can access to attraction place at Taejongdae Park by Danubi Train that cost u only 3000won..
Serene place to chill out,Take the Danubi tram (extra cost) to get to the stops along the way otherwise you are in for a long uphill hike. We stopped at Lighthouse stop.. it was quiet and we stood ard to take pics plus chill out.
Nice walk with nice coastal view,"As it was a sunny day and we took a walk to shoot some good photos. As we started in the morning, it was not too crowdy. We enjoyed the fresh air and nice views. Take water with you as resto was closed."
Beauty from Busan,"If you like walking and get rewarded by a beautiful view then this is it.If you don‚Äôt like walking but the view then this is it because you can take the ‚Äútrain‚ÄùWalk down the lighthouse and get close to the water, then enjoy the view and fresh smell of the sea."
Very enjoyable visit!,"We spent an enjoyable afternoon slowly walking through this place. The place is well maintained. Nice breeze, tall trees, cherry blossoms and great scenery. Definitely a must visit for Busan."
Nice coastal view,We visited Taejondae last week in the afternoon on a weekday so it was less crowded. Glad to see hordes of tourists getting on numerous tour buses leaving the place. Pity that there seemed to be renovation works being done. Restaurant and cafe at the observatory were closed. The biggest disappointment was the path leading to the platform rock was closed off. Still it was worth a visit as the coastal view was great. Did catch a relatively beautiful sunset. The price for the Danubi train is now 3000won.
Taejondae,For those with strong knees. Need to go down the staircase to the lighthouse and climb up again. Nothing much to see just the coastline. Nice view to take picture. 
Not wildly exciting,"This is on the coast, but whilst there are some quite nice views out to see and the lighthouse is interesting, there's not too much worth seeing. However, the best thing is to head to the eateries close to where the road train trip starts and there you can get some great food......baked clams, fresh prawns, abalone, all ripe and ready for the BBQ"
Park,Beautiful views! I visited this park twice from the water and once on foot and I highly recommend it to everyone! beautiful surroundings and lots of nature around! Great to go there with family and children!
Beautiful cliffs and sea views,"A nice place to visit. Taejongdae is a nature park located on the southernmost tip of the island of Yeongdo-gu.The whole looped route is about 4km long. Visitors can either walk the whole way or take the Danubi train that has 3 stops along the way.There is an observatory, a light house and a cruise centre there. The views of the sea are breathtaking.From the entrance, there is a road leading down to the pebble beach. Try out the bbq seafood. It‚Äôs delicious!"
Nature Rocky Park,"Taejongdae is a natural park with lush evergreens, which includes many types of trees and stunning coastal cliffs facing the blue-greenish ocean sea. Its famous seascapes and landscapes was designated as a Busan Monument. There are various sights and activities all throughout the whole park."
A forgettable moment at Taejondae Park,"If you're into nature and outdoor activities, Taejondae Natural Park is a destination that might fit your need. Feel free to skip if you're looking for modern infrastructure or a faster pace destination. Taejondae park contains beautiful green mountains that over looks the ocean. Once you arrive, you'll purchase round trip tickets (5 USD) that takes you on a tram ride that drops you off at various points throughout the park such as a light tower and an observation deck. There's no time limit as buses run in a loop every ~15 minutes.Overall, this place is perfect if you're old or have a family with young kids. If you're into the slow pace nature, this destination is perfect for you. If you're short on time, I recommend using your time visiting other destinations such as Gamcheon Culture village or Haeundae Beach. Keeping it real.#TravelwithContext"
Day trip with Ktourstory ,We came to this place as part of our day tour package booked through Ktourstory. We went up to the top via the shuttle bus and ride down via the danubi train. The view up there is very beautiful and one could climb up to the tower and take beautiful shots of the surrounding from there. However this place is not suitable for people who has weak legs as they will need to climb up and down on the steps. 
beautiful park with stunning view,"Visited Busan while working at Seoul office. The Taejongdae has been on my trip list for a while, and it was not disappointed. Easy bus ride from near Busan Station (only took about 40 minutes without traffic). Got off at the end of the bus stop. From there, walking straight and you will see the entrance of the park. For those who can not walk long, buy the ticket for the Danubi train near the entrance. The train will take you to the major viewpoints, and go back to the entrance. Just be prepared to wait a long line for the train. For those who can walk at least an hour (that's how long it will probably take to go around the park, WITHOUT stopping at the major viewpoints!!), don't bother to buy the ticket, just start to walk. It is totally worthy the walk as the view, and air, and road condition are all perfect!. Slow down and enjoy the park! Expect to spend at least 2-3 hours there. Oh by the way, the walkway to the Sinseon Rock was closed. No one was allowed to go there. I was not sure if it was because it was too windy during the winter time, or some other issues. Anyway, that is one little disappointment I had, but nevertheless, it was not a big deal. I still give 5+ stars for this park. "
Amazing View with Blue Sea,"Was recommended by my Korean friend to visit here. There was a monorail bus that can bring you around the Park or if you want, you could take a causal stroll up which I did. The view was amazing! There was a observatory that had restaurants and convenience store; a place you can have a break before reaching the Light House and enjoy the view of the blue sea. If you are in Busan, this is a place you must put in your itinerary. I stayed for almost 2 - 3 hours enjoying the fresh seafood and beer that 'Haenyo' were selling. Enjoy the waves crashing into the rocks, cool breeze and the remarkable view as you consume the fresh seafood and drinks. Great place to go and can't wait to go back. Great place to take photos too! For those that want to have another view of the place, they can purchase the ferry tour that Park is providing. Not sure how much it is or how did people feel, but preferred walking up and enjoying the scenery. "
"Fresh air, fresh seafood",Memorable experience of walking down the stairs by the cliff to a small shack that sells fresh seafood at very affordable prices. You should try their live octopus if you are up for it. Can never forget eating seafood on the cliffside right by the sea while watching boats go by. The views are beautiful.
Hike to Taejongdae Resort,"We took taxi from Jagalchi to get here and it cost us Won8,200. You can also take the bus but it will take more than an hour to reach the entrance to the mountain but saves you more. We walked along the main road uphill which made us gasp for air all the while but enjoyed the beautiful surroundings and the ocean view at some point. There are several tourist spot for a great selfie or groupie opportunity. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a good idea to hike in the summer coz it could give you heat exhaustion. We are lucky enough that it‚Äôs winter when we climb this amazing place. There‚Äôs a kiosk on the observation deck if you need something to replenish and a fish cake shop to warm our cold belly. The lighthouse is next to an amazing rock formation and but you have to take a steep flight of stairs to get there so be prepared! Overall, we had so much fun walking around the entire loop road back to the main entrance. A must see attraction in Busan!"
HOW TO FIND THE CLIFFS,"You cna go to Nampodong and take a bus over, but the bus can be quite long, so if you have less time and more money, take the taxi.If you are in decent shape, walk over from the enterance. If not, take the train/shuttle."
"Overall, it was a pleasant visit","We visited Taejongdae on a sunny but windy Wednesday morning. As we have elderly folks in our group, we bought tram tickets (W3,000 for adults) to bring us around. The views at the observatory were fantastic. We went to the top of the lighthouse as well as the bottom on the shore, where several ladies were selling live sea urchins, etc. We also visited the Taejongsa Temple.Overall, it was a pleasant visit. "
Must visit!,"It is worth to see, we took a day tour to Taejongdae, took the Danubi Train to the Observation Deck & Lighthouse. It can be quite windy there"
Worth to visit,Taejongdae is must visit place in busan. Worth to see. The beach is really pretty.many thins to see. 
Hike with a sunset view,"It takes about 1.5 hours to reach from Busan station. After alighting from bus no. 101 (which is the last stop), walk straight ahead and you will see Taejongdae curved on a huge rock. Going up and coming down took me an hour. Skip the train service If you are fit to walk. The queue to take the train is crazy, it costs 3000 won per adult. Walk up and all the way till you reach the observatory area where it offers a nice view of the sea. Catch the sunset if you can."
Relaxing morning walk with nice scenic!,"It was a relaxing walk to enjoy the scenic from mountain to sea view. As we are quite early (before 9 a.m.) over there so the tram service aren‚Äôt available yet. Apart from this, there‚Äôs a trail to forest for you to trek in and bench are available for you to sit down and enjoy the endorphins and scenic in the forest too. We found a restaurant which is beside the sea after we trek down by the staircase but too bad they are still preparing to open as it was still early. There‚Äôs a nice restaurant at the entrance of Taejongdae too. Do stop by and enjoy their food. "
Nice view,"This place is easy to access by bus ~ If you have plenty of time & energy, you may choose to walk to the observation deck and lighthouse. The scenery is nice and enjoyable. Otherwise, you can visit each point by shuttle.The ticket costs 3,000 won."
Nice view,Worth the hike with those beautiful view. There is a shuttle train which you may take with a fee. But we chose to walk instead but it's really worth it.
Great,"Good views on a good day secret pebble beach, lighthouse, viewpoints are all worth a visit much recommended"
Relaxing visit to the hill for seaview,"The park consists of a few touristy spots for mountain or seaview and there are trams available to ride with a certain fees collected. If you‚Äôre not ready for walking or hiking up the hill, it is advisable to take this tram up which will drop you off at the tourists spots. There‚Äôs nothing much to do other than enjoying the seaview or eat the fishcake sold there (which is tasty). After the stroll, you may head downhill for a clam bbq meal available. "
Lighthouse,good for a quite walk and friends talk while walking ...memory pictures and landmark of the area .....
The nice park where you travel by Shuttle,The park has nice view of the sea from an observatory and temple. It is connected by the Danubi Train. The view ar Taejondae is very nice. The view of the sea is outstanding.
Be prepared to walk UPHILL and it's all worth it!,"Stunning scebery, beautiful track to walk down, lots to see on the way, monuments etc. The lighthouse itself is a little run down but the area is so pretty. Catch the trolley bus up to the high point then just walk the 30 minutes back down. Its a great walk and plenty to see on the way back."
Lighthouse with views,"A little wak down a slopping deck then some stairs, but rest areas on route. Climbed lighthouse stairs ......no air con at top! Views obviously are good. Paced ourselves on the way back. No need to go to the gym!"
Ocean view and sea breeze ,"Free entrance to the light house. You can choose to walk 2km uphill or train service at 3000won/person/way. Walking may take you around half hour to 45mins. While train only take 15mins to the lighthouse. Still once you reach the station, you still need to walk another 15mins to reach the lighthouse. If you choose to walk, there are toilets facility and drinking water along the way. "
Catching our breath amidst spectacular views!,"Taejongdae is a natural park of Busan with magnificent cliffs facing the open sea on the southernmost tip of island of Yeongdo-gu. Taejongdae was named after the 29th king of the Silla Kingdom - King Taejong Mu-Yeol (AD 604-661).Getting there: Upon exiting Nampo Station (orange Line 1), you could take bus number 8, 30, 88 or 101 to the Taejongdae Cliff bus terminal. We took bus number 88 to the bus terminal and bus number 101 on the return trip; the journey time either way was about half an hour. Upon reaching the bus terminal, you cross the road and reach the entrance of the tourist attraction after walking about 100 metres along the row of shops. As this attraction is free of charge, be prepared to enjoy it with hordes of tourists. It opens from 4am to 12 midnight from March to October and 5am to 12 midnight from November to February. The attraction: The route (comprising road and walking path) is ‚Äúcircular‚Äù that takes you, depending where you start, along the coast into the jungle. But either way, you would end up at the Yeongdo Lighthouse which is at the centre of the route. You could take the Danubi Train or tram (‚Ç©3000 for adult, ‚Ç©2000 for youth and ‚Ç©1500 for children) in which there are 3 stops, hence you would miss the pebble beach Taejongdae Jagalmadang (about 5 minutes‚Äô walk from entrance) and the southern point lookout (about 10 minutes‚Äô walk from pebble beach). Hence, we chose to walk to the Yeongdo Lighthouse and back while. While the walk from entrance direct to Yeongdo Lighthouse would take about 35-45 minutes, we took almost 2 hours because we were catching our breath at the pebble beach, Southern Point Lookout and Taejongdae Observatory Deck.What we enjoyed: The views from the Southern Point Lookout is great ‚Äì you could see Gadeokdo Island, Geojedo Island, Dadaepo Beach and Namhang Bridge The next lookout - Taejongdae Observatory Deck -offered fabulous panoramic views of surrounding rocky cliffs, the sea of Japan and several islands (nearest Saengdo (Tea Kettle) Island to the farther Daemado Island, Brother Island, Geojedo Island, Tree Island and distant Tsushima Island). To me, the most spectacular views are from the Yeongdo Lighthouse and from the ‚ÄúLight Beyond Limitation‚Äù sculpture of overlapping blue and red semi-circles and a sharp bar. Looking to the left (westward facing) of Yeongdo Lighthouse, you could see a group of small islets known as Oryukdo and the three towering under-construction buildings of Haeundae Beach. Looking down to your right from the ‚Äúlight Beyond Limitation‚Äù sculpture, you could see the iconic Mangbu Rock, Sinseon Rock plus majestic rock cliffs.My family and I enjoyed ourselves at Taejondae. It is one ‚Äúmust visit‚Äù attraction that has to be on your Busan itinerary, and make sure you wear comfortable walking shoes and protect your skin from the sun if you decide to walk."
"Lovely surroundings, enjoyable scenery","We took a public bus from Nampo-dong; basically any bus that goes to Taejongdae will bring you there. It's not that far away, the bus ride took us about 40 minutes. Alight at the last stop. Walk about 500m to reach Taejongdae information centre, and thereafter, the ticketing booth.If you do not wish to walk, you can take the Danubi train at KRW3,000 per pax. The train will bring you to the observation deck, the lighthouse and the temple. I find the lighthouse to be interesting. You can climb up to the top to look at the sea or visit the museum building at the bottom."
The sea view is brilliant but you have to afford the walk,"It is kind of nice view there, but before enjoying the view, you have to go for a 20-30 min walk down the stairs. Plus, you have to climb up the stairs once you have finished.It is not advise to people who lack of exercise, the slope of the road/stairs is not easy"
Nice sea view,A relaxing place to visit and stroll around. Nice sea view and surrounding. Good place to sit down sipping a coffee and relax.
worth visit,taejongdae park located a bit far from busan center but it was a worth trip. i went there during autumn and its quite cold and windy on the top of the park. they provide a small train to get around. there are some pit stop and the best one is the light house. 
Good time here,"Basically, i ‚ù§Ô∏è Busan. I enjoyed being here. Just a reminder please use sneakers when you are here. Prepare your leg so that it wouldn‚Äôt shock. Hehehe To reach a lighthouse you have to step up staircase quite fatigue but worth it. Beautiful view and i had a great time here."
A tourist check point,A good place to enjoy the sea view and enjoy some good time with family or friends. Should pay for the coach to save time from walking around.
Park on the cliff edge.,"We were so pleased that our hosts drove us to Taejongdae, a nature park located on the southernmost tip of island of Yeongdo-gu, it was a cold and blustery afternoon as this part of the country is open to the elements. The region gained its named after King Taejong Mu-Yeol (604-661), apparently he liked to traveled to this place to practice his archery. There was a large paid car park near the entrance to Taejongdae which is free, we chose to walk around the park but for a fee there is a small road train which will drop you off/pick up at various locations in the park. The coastline is hilly, rocky, with wonderful views out to sea and along the coastline. We enjoyed the walk along the path by the road into the park to the Observation Deck (1.7kms) and the lighthouse (1.9kms), from here it was all up hill for ten or so minutes before reaching the summit then all down hill back to the entrance. The walk is circular if you so choose, allow 1.5 hours for a comfortable visit/walk."
Great Views of the Ocean and Cliff Edges,"Downloading the NAVER Map app was a very good tip when travelling around in Korea. This add had recommended the correct bus with the right prices to pay and estimated travel times.As this national park is quite big and the main attractions of the light house and observatory are some distance away, it is recommended to take the Daunbi Train, but do note that the trains start only from 9.20am so no point going to early unless you plan to walk. But due to the summer heat, best to go in the morning and try to reach by 9am.However, getting from Bus terminal to where you will stop to the Danubi Train is still quite a bit of a walk up a medium slope. May be an issue for elderly. The train has a 40 min interval in case you miss them.there are 3 stops on the train and 1st stop was the Observatory, which you can stop to have a view of the sea through the binoculars and have a pic taken with the Monument of Mother and Child ( Monument was erected as in the Past, many people had come to this place to end their lives by jumping into the sea, so this was erected to remind them of their mother's love in hope of changing their minds)Once you get off at the 1st stop, it is not necessary to wait for the next train because the 2nd stop was the light house which was just a short 10min stroll down the road ( downhill makes it easy as well)Here at the 2nd stop, it gets abit tiring for the elderly or those with weak knees or poor physical condition. There many steps down towards the lighthouse and further down to rocky outcrop for seafood and some pictures. But what goes down must come up and so the difficult climb up.You are also able to access the Light House and after a flight of spiraling staircase, you will end up at the Glass top with 360 degree view of the ocean and hills. Thankfully there is air conditioning in the Glass Top.1 did not stop at the 3rd stop which was a temple though. If you are then taking a Bus back to town, do note not to walk to the Bus Depot ( which i did ) think to catch the bus back, but instead the bus stop is located just before the round about next to a mini supermarket. That is where the bus will be leaving the depot and will make the stop just at the exit for you to board.Again, do use the Naver App to get to the next destination."
Taejongdae,Beautiful Scenic walk on the island of Youngdo in Busan. Walking to the lighthouse will show you many beautiful things sites along the way.
Very nice park with great view of forest and sea,"It takes 40 minutes by local bus from the centre to the park. It is such a huge park with lovely and peaceful walks. To save time, there is train to take guests to the top where you can see the top view, the light house or visit cliffs. Everything is so beautiful. There is also a small coffee shop near the way down to the cliff where you can see the sea around through window glasses. Some locals sell seafood and guests can enjoy grilled seafood while sitting on the rocks."
Nice place but tiring walk,"We were prepared to spend about 2 hours here and wasn‚Äôt prepared for the mountainous route and ended up staying for half a day. The scenery at the Yongdo lighthouse is great; you can walk all the way up to the observatory which is just below the light bulb area (out of bounds) and have a look at the coastal area around the lighthouse; however I prefer the walk down to the rocks where you can be closer to the sea. As usual, there is a tent-stall selling seafood here, and a cafe as well. For going back, we decided to take the tram as we were all winded by all the climbing.One thing to note when taking the tram is to purchase your tickets at the vending machine near the stations before queueing up for the tram. We didn‚Äôt, and was only told about the vending machine when it was out turn to board the tram and had to leave the queue to buy - and the worse part is that the tram did not wait for us so we had to wait another 20 mins or so for the next tram. "
Gorgeous view!,"Taejongdae takes some time to reach from central Busan. We took the subway to Nampo and then a bus. Finally, once we arrived to the park area, there's a train on wheels that takes you around. I suggest using it since there's a lot of walking and very steep roads.The Taejongdae lighthouse also has a lot of steps to go down and then back up which you should take into consideration if you're not in the best of shape. Even if you don't go all the way down to the lighthouse, there are great views from the observatory which is located one station before the lighthouse station."
Great workout,It was a great workout for all of us walking to the lighthouse via the numerous steps. Nice view overlooking the lighthouse. The tram ride saved us all. Take the tram from the lighthouse as it is difficult to board at the temple stop.
Breathtaking Seaview,"Named after King Taejong, it is trail where you can take in views of a temple, monument for fallen soldiers, and the famous lighthouse. There are viewpoints along the way where you can witness the cliff. The trail can be difficult for older generations as there are up and down slopes. However, there are rest points and water points too. There is a tram service you can pay for to skip walking.The view from the lighthouse is amazing. You can go in and climb all the way up too. Direction from Busan Station:.. Exit 10 (left side of Exit 6).. walk to the road and cross.. Turn right at the opposite junction and walk to a bus-stop somewhere in front... Bus 88 or 101"
Revisiting Busan,We did not have a chance to visit Taejongdae the last visit. It was about a 40 minutes taxi ride from Haeundae where we were staying. A big park and we decided to take the paid tram services to the 3 major drop off point. A walk through the park would have taken at least 1.5 hours. The lookout point was high looking into the Ocean. The lighthouse where the 'arrow' sites is a interesting walk for lots of photo taking. The temper was okay but we did not spend much time as it was crowded being a holiday celebrating Buddha. A place to visit when you have time.
Nature beauty of Budsan,"AWWW i loved this place! But, for sure, the weather is a must for this journey! Mine was awesome) Higly reccommend for all Busan visitors. Easy to get, free entry) i would reccomend a train to get to observatory and than do a walk down the hill, and take a ferry ) beautiful place! "
Taejongdae Resort Park,"the lighthouse/monument is in the Taejongdae Resort Park. it's like entering an amusement park (no entrance fee though), long lines for the little train like carts, so I just walked up to the lighthouse, a lot to see on way, like Taewon Pebble Beach, it's a workout going back up stairs and up to lighthouse, but worth it. beautiful scenery and many sculptures. it gets windy, bring jacket/windbreaker! I took cart train on way back (3,00 won aka $3-ish) bc I was so tired, so missed out on some other attractions (other monuments & Taejongsa Temple)"
Beautiful cliffs and scenery,A must see for anyone who enjoy nature and beautiful scenery. We took Daburi train (3000 won/adult) to the observatory which has great views of the ocean. However we did not stop at the lighthouse. Notice there are nature trails with clearly marked signpost in English. Great place to bring whole family for nice day out. The initial path to train station can be quite steep for older folks with mobility problems. 
Great views; planning needed for weekend visits,"This place was apparently one of the top tourist attractions, and there were long queues at the tram station, particularly before noontime when most of the day tour groups arrive. Better to eat a bit early and come during lunch time. The tram covered four stations, the really important one us the 2nd stop ie the lighthouse where most folks alight. There was a long queue to get back on the tram on the way back so it was much better to take a 2 min walk to the 1st stop (the observatory) where the lines are shorter. Logistics aside, the views are spectacular and well worth the effort. "
Beautiful place,Need walking about 2 km until the top. The scenery is beautiful. The vibe is so peacefull. We can see sea and park
Just as exciting on a second tour,"I visited the place previously hence had an idea of the good places for photo-taking. As before, I went to Nampo metro station and from Exit 6 walked up Yongdo Bridge to the bus-stop where there were several bus routes terminating at Taejongdae. With time to spare I ventured up the light-house and took some photos. It is a beautiful place with panoramic views."
Good cliff and sea view,"A bus ride from Nampo or Seoul subway stations and a short climb brings you to the entrance of Taejongdae Park. It was smaller than I initially expected, but also meant it was less tiring than I thought it would be. There's also a train option but we did not see any in operation when we were there. Also the park isn't that big so if you're not super physically unfit you can just walk. Wear comfortable shoes as some uphill climbs are expected. If you intend to go down to the lighthouse, be prepared to descend many flights of stairs and to climb back up later. It rained halfway while we were there so it was quite slippery. The view of the cliff from the Observatory is spectacular. Water dispensers and toilets are available near each stop so don't worry about bringing extra water for the trip. There's also a cafe and a food court which you can dine at if you go at lunch time or to get a snack"
Scenic but much smaller than you'd expect,"This is a pretty scenic spot that you can visit if you're in Busan. It is a small park with a circular path. There are five scenic spots along the path that take you around the park. You can either walk along the path, stopping by the scenic spots, or purchase a ticket for a train that will take you around the park. I did a mix of both. I took the train to the first and second stops, and walked the rest of the way. The ground is largely paved, but there are some gentle uphill slopes to climb. The highlight is undoubtedly the rocky cliffs and turquoise waters lapping below. If you are adventurous, it is worth climbing up the lighthouse for a better view. However, do not be deceived by photos as the area is really quite small. 2 - 3 hours would be sufficient time here, 1.5 hours if you are taking the train all the way. "
Beautiful scenery in Busan,Can travel by public bus (8 or30) and walk a short distance to entrance. Buy tickets for the tram or walk the path. Bring your camera for amazing pics.
I,Lovely place. Very windy. Good sights and a bit of a hike so wear good walking shoes. The Danubi train also connects the sightseeing places so it‚Äôs worthwhile paying for that. 
Nice national park with paved walkway ,"If you are viewing this, I am sure you know this place is famous for its cliff already so I will be focusing on what you don‚Äôt know ( what most review doesn‚Äôt cover):1) I visited Busan for one day from Seoul ( 6 am departure from Seoul, leave Busan at 9pm), 2) from Busan Station to here is just a bus ride away ( remember to cross the street to tame bus 101)3) once arrive the park, decide whether to buy the train ticket or not, personally I would suggest don‚Äôt buy the ticket so you can have a good walk ( I estimated it to be around 8km to cover all paced walkway )4) check weather for FOG before coming here. I visited here during April, it‚Äôs rather foggy in the morning, visibility improves after 12 mid day. 5) would I recommend here ? There‚Äôs no fancy view, shopping or food here lbut If you like nature scene, yes. 6) ps: you might find this park to be a bit man made, as there‚Äôs pace walkway with road for the train. Bottom line: You do get a sense of Korea in its natural form here "
Nice ocean view ,We took a bus from our hotel front in Jungang and it took about 45 mins. It‚Äôs the final stop and easy to identify the entrance to walk into the site. Go early in morning to avoid long queue for Danube Train. Definitely a must for most visitors who don‚Äôt want to be hiking long way into the various places to sightsee. Luckily we took the train as we soon realized the walk in and up is not easy especially for folks with elderly and kids. The train goes in a loop and is regular so no worries about getting back to starting point. 
Lots of climbing,"Went in the afternoon. Took the bus from the bus stop opposite lotte mall - Gwangbok. Took slightly less than an hour to get that. Recommended to take the danubi train to conserve energy. At the observatory stop, can walk to the lighthouse stop. Lighthouse not visible from main road. Need to climb down to get to the base of the lighthouse, then climb up the steps in the lighthouse. If you've not been to a lighthouse, it would be an interesting experience. However, coming from an island state, views of the sea are not very unusual. I would say the views are pretty unremarkable for the climb required. If u haven't had lunch, you can climb down the steps all the way to the coast where there'll be ajummas selling fresh seafood. Spotted a couple of people enjoying their meals by the sea. "
Calming sea view!,Nice climb up the tower. Wasnt able to go to the cliff area due to closure. Suggest to just alight at the light house tower if short on time.
Nice place to visit,Nice view but it was very windy on the day we visited - we did not explore much the area and the view is breathtaking.
"A trip to get to, but worth it","You can take the Danubi Train to tour the area or if you're really wanting to burn out your fitbit steps, you can walk the up and down path. Gorgeous view of the ocean and little islands in the distance. Takes about 1.5 hours to tour the place.Took the #8 bus from Nampo station and it took about 45 minutes to get there. Last stop."
Family Trip,"Taejongdae is the Highlight of our trip.We arrived early in the morning, so we didnt have any problem with DANUBI TRAIN queueing line. Go for the Observatory deck and lighthouse for a breathtaking view. On to the lighthouse we have to walkdown thru stairs,Busan city bus offer has a stop at the parking area. "
A beautiful spot,The walks through the park are very pretty and tranquil and it is a worthwhile spot to visit. There are many steps to climb.
Blow away the cobwebs!,I had a nice walk around Taejongdae on a pretty windy day - the lighthouse was incredibly breezy! I decided not to bother with the train; the walk is only about 4km and while a little up and down it's a straightforward path so is fairly easy going. Nice views over the harbours and I could just see the Japanese island of Tsushima. There's a good view from the top of the lighthouse too if you go in by the 'library' and just keep following the spiral staircase up. I caught a #8 bus from Nampo station and it took about 30 minutes to get there.
Beautiful....,"Lots of walking, up & down stairs.Go all the way down if you can. It‚Äôs amazing & beautiful.We were there during Seollal, so didn‚Äôt get to meet ajuma for fresh oysters."
Average,"Not very impressive unfortunately. The train ride was not a train to start with, and the view was not spectacular. "
Beautiful view with strong winds,"Taejongdae is a large coastal park that offers several attractions. Most of it can be visited via taking the Danubi train which goes around the park. Even if it‚Äôs just for the lighthouse, visiting Taejongdae is worth it. The views are one of a kind and the strong winds make it all the more fun (albeit being a bit dangerous)."
Nice Park by the Sea,"We took a taxi from the Oryukdo Skywalk to Taejondae for 14,200 won plus 1,400 won in tolls. This took around 30 minutes rather a much longer way via public transportation. In general, you can get a cab pretty easily from these popular sights and they drop you off right at the entrance.We paid another 3,000 won per person to take the Danubi Train which makes a stop at the Observation Tower, Lighthouse and Taejongdae Temple. We got off at the Observation Tower and walked the 2 minutes to the lighthouse (most popular stop for everyone). At the Observation Tower, there was a Food Court and we had lunch. The Temple was actually underwhelming and a lot of people don't get off here.The train saved some bit of walking since there isn't much to see on the way. There are lots of steps but the views are very nice. We spent around 1.5 hours here."
Lighthouse view,It maybe quite tiring for the elderly to climb up all the way to the lighthouse but is worth it because we rarely have such opportunity to go up to a lighthouse. 
Well spent early afternoon at Taejongdae,"We reached here closed to 1230pm with an empty stomach. Hence the first stop is to fill up the hunger. Once done, we headed into Taejongdae entrance. Note that the Danubi train ticket is sold further up the entrace. You need to hike up and you will eventually see the ticketing booth as well as people waiting in line for the train. If you feel like challenging the slopes within the park - go ahead and walk. Train will stop at observatory 1st and proceed with the lighthouse and lastly the temple. If you are in rush of time, head straight to lighthouse. You don‚Äôt need to alight altho they would suggest that you can walk for 2mins from observatory to lighthouse. At the lighthouse, head down to where the ahjummas are selling seafood while enjoying the magnificent sea view. Coming up is quite tiring but you can make small stops, breathe in some fresh airs, take a few more pictures and then continue on. "
A must-go scenic view,"Prepare for quite a bit of walking, comfy shoes are a must. Take the trains to the observatory, the sea view is breathtaking and it‚Äôs winter, try to be there early since the Sun sets by 5pm, perfect place to watch sunset. Once done, walk up the Lighthouse, here is where the killer steps come in, but it‚Äôs definitely worth the hike. Be sure to take pictures by the cliff further down below the lighthouse."
Taejongdae Park ,Taejongdae Park has magnificent cliffs facing the sea. Beware as you may do a lot of hiking! Hop onto the Danubi train if you are tired of walking.
Short but nice ride at Danubi Train,We made some walking and ride Danubi train going around. Good location to watch the sunset. We spent more time in waiting for our turn to ride that the time of the ride itself. 
Fresh air and Nice view,"Before you reach to Taejongdae, you must use train get up to the hill. Once you reach this spot. You have to walk about 20 mins to taejongdae. If for people in wheelchair are not suitable. Alot of stairs to the spot."
Get the train...,This is a scenic place but with a lot of walking to do. We caught the train and walked some parts and rode some parts. There are a few stops which is all worth it. 
Beautiful ,Worth coming. Take the train round the park and you can get Beautiful scenery. You can hop on and hop off train anytime.
Bluey waters and Bluey sea,Love this place in summer. A very loooong walk up to the lighthouse. Sweat lots amidst the strong cooling breeze. Great hiking session coupled with meditation along the way!! 
"Breezy, beautiful ocean sights but hot.....",Its a long upclimb(walk) to this place. Highly recommend to pay for the Danubi tram ride which goes along a designated route covering few attractions including this.The vast & open ocean view from here is beautiful. This is a big open space attraction with total exposure to the hot sun ( advisable to put on good sunblock as exposure to direct sun here can be quite long).Be prepared for a fair bit of walking & climbing. Esp if you also decided to go all the long way down ( & up later) to the coast level.But it's a good experience. Definitely recommend to visit this place when in Busan 
Beautiful view all around but a little tiring,"Taejongdae is a beautiful place to be at with nice scenery everywhere. However, it can get a little tiring with all the walking of stairs and the wind can be quite strong that I could not really take nice photos because my phone almost flew away haha. "
"Too late for the bus, pretty much too late for everything. But that didn't stop us from having a lovely walk","We arrived at the base of what is effectively a long walk up to and back down a significantly long hill. Along the way you find certain attractions, mainly views, along with a nice restaurant with a busker playing to one side. Because we arrived late, we basically had to hurry and in turn miss out on a few things. Be prepared, if one misses the bus, for a long and arduous walk. Well, it was fine, but if you are old age, think twice.Seems many of the locals come here as the road is besieged by cars, however there's not much parking near the attractions.Views are spectacular, as you can see by some of my - sadly - hand held images."
No Danubi train,"If you have trouble hiking up hills and stairs, you might think the train is a winner. It isn't. Just today, it failed to stop where it was supposed to, and failed to stop to pick up people who had walked from the only place it seems to stop, which is the observatory at the top. That wasn't announced in any of the several languages I could have understood, if it was announced at all. If this is an issue for you, as it is for me, get together with a small tour company that has permission to drive the route. Some wait outside the gates. It was a big disappointment. Yes, it is only a 2 mile walk all the way around but kids, disabled and older people might have difficulty because of the hills, stairs and climate. Lovely place, but don't take the train. I would have liked to see all of it."
Serene and blissful,"As you walk through the entrance, you will be surrounded by beautiful trees with Autumn leaves. The feeling was so calming. Pine trees and other vegetation blanket the sides of the road as you go further. I"
Beautiful scenery,The tourist objective is at the end of a beautiful 4 km walk with great scenery. It gets a bit windy so you can take a jacket .
Lot of climbing down and up,The light house entry is restricted. While climbing down to the basement of the light house please do keep in mind that these steps are to be taken for climbing up. Good view of the kettle Island and sea
4 km walk with nice views,"You can choose the 4km round-trip walk or the train/bus around this park (the train rides were sold out the day we went so we had to walk). If you want to experience a Korean forest without having to a big hike, it's quite nice. The views of the sea are good too, but you can get these at more accessible places."
Beautiful cliff,"Taejongdae is a beautiful cliff slightly away from the city. A must visit attraction.How to reach: from busan station, take exit 7, then from 3rd bus stop, take bus no 101, which takes about 40 mins to reach taejongdae. It is the last stop.I recommend to take the Danubi train after reaching here. It is a hop in hop off train with a ticket of 3000 won for adults. It stops at all attraction points. Even after using the train there is lot of walking involved, so it‚Äôs better to enjoy the attraction rather trekking the whole place.First stop is observatory, the second stop is the light house which is the main attraction. Remember going to pebble beach and eating fresh sea food served below the light house adjacent to pebble beach.Lots of walking but worth a visit "
Great Sunset view ,"‰æÜÂ§™ÂÆóÂè∞ÁúãÊó•ËêΩÊ¨£Ë≥ûÂ§ïÈôΩ„ÄÇ1997‰∫ûÊ¥≤ÈáëËûçÊµ∑ÂòØÔºåÈüìÂúãÈô∑ÂÖ•Âõ∞Â¢ÉÔºåÂæàÂ§ö‰∫∫‰æÜÊ≠§Ë∑≥Êµ∑ËºïÁîüÔºåÁÇ∫‰∫ÜÈÅøÂÖçË∑≥Êµ∑ÊàêÁÇ∫ÂÖ®Ê∞ëÈÅãÂãïÔºåÁâπÂà•Á´ãÂÄãÊØçÂ≠êÁü≥ËÆì‰∫∫ËΩâÂøµÂõûÈ†≠„ÄÇThere are several great locations to have gorgeous views for sunset.

Beautiful coastal area,Walk or take the tram for gorgeous views.A restaurant at the top of the walk offers views and good food.
A must visit in Busan .. Great views of the geoliths,Be prepared to spend at least half a day in this reserved park. A number of fantastic views especially the observatory tower with a view of the rock cliffs. 
Slopes & steps aplenty,"From Seomyeon station Exit 1, walked about 100m to the bus stop for Bus 88 (hint: in front of Daiso). Apparently bus 66 goes to Taejongdae too - check with the driver before alighting. Took bus 88 to the last stop (I lost count after 15 stops, about 40 mins ride) at Taejongdae Bus Terminal - driver will shout for all to get off the bus. Walked to park entrance and up the slope to a square where the Danubi train ticket office is. Due to the morning rain, the train wasn't running (yikes) cos the roads were slippery. So, we bought some hot snacks from the convenience store to power up before the uphill walk to the observatory and lighthouse - park highlights. Turned out it wasn't so bad in the cool shade. The observatory was quite nice, had an eMart for those wanting to get even more snacks and souvenirs. Also a food court + bakery at the lower floor. Good view of Tea Kettle Island (which I didn't think resemble a tea kettle). The ferries going back and forth were quite entertaining cos we could hear the loud music and announcements on board - imagined how the passengers felt.A short 5 min walk, we were at the stairway down to Yeongdo Lighthouse. Many many steep steps later, we reached the lighthouse. There was some renovation in progress and Sinseon Rock was closed - a pity. Some of us joked about the ""wife waiting for husband"" rock which was next to Sinseon Rock - half the team were singles :)) We took the spiral staircase up the lighthouse - 360view was ok but the space was quite stifling as there was no ventilation. From the lighthouse, we made further descent to the ahjummas at their seafood tents - kinda pricey sashimi (we ordered a flounder-looking flat fish for KRW40k) - alive and kicking. I reckon the bill included the atmosphere. 45 mins later, we climbed the never-ending steps up to the main road, powered by sashimi calories. By then, the Danubi train was running but we decided to retrace our steps and walk back to the park entrance - mostly downhill for 2+ km and save a few wons for icecream.Took bus 66 back to Seomyeon station - bus stop was next to bus terminal (hint: where all buses were parked) - 30+ stops / 45 mins. Grab a seat. Bus 66 also passed Lotte Dept Store and Lotte Mart next to Jagalchi Market."
"Good view of the surroundings , haeundae beach and sea !",A very worthwhile trip to the coast to see the beautiful scene of the skyscrapers majestically protruding out of the clouds and the white silky beach of Haeundae. Also really nice breeze that just makes the atmosphere so peaceful and calm. 
Amazing and beautiful place!,A trip to Busan is not completed without a visit to this beautiful area. The lighthouse is located at the cliff surrounded with beautiful scenery. The steps down may be a little scary especially when it is windy. A stop to the little cosy cafe located there is a must. A must visit place for avid photographer.
Great Busan Park ,"I will recommend taking a danubi train (3,000 won each) if you bring the elderly or small kids. The entrance basically is free of charge. You just need to pay for the transport ""train"" service. Incredibly beautiful leisure park that the whole family can enjoy. "
A beautiful attraction with a good view of the sea,"We took Metro line 1 to Nampo station and exited from exit No 6. Then we took a local bus No 88 (you can also use bus 30 or 66) and got off at the terminal in front of Taejongdae resort entrance. We walked all the way to the observatory, stopping along the way to look at various attractions. Must have taken us about an hour before we reached the observatory, which is the main attraction here. If you do not wish to walk, you can ride the hop on hop off Danubi Train and stop at the various sights. We spent almost an hour at the observatory area before walking back to the main entrance and taking in more sights along the way. All in all, it was a worthwhile half day spent here."
Wonderful walk during sunset,"Taejongdae is located right along the coast of Busan, I spent around 45 minutes walking uphill and downhill to reach the lighthouse and the coast. The view was amazing, with the cliffs and the sea, I loved it. I think it is better to visit around sunset time,"
overlooking the sea,"The cliffs of Taegongdae puts you face to face with South Korea‚Äôs southern coast. In fact, it‚Äôs on the southern tip of an island off Busan, the Yeongdo Island. The entire area is a national park and designated as one of 28 monuments in Busan. This southern tip of Yeongdo-gu is named after the 29th King of the Silla Dynasty, King TaeJong who apparently loves archery and practices from this cliff point. Since Taegongdae is a park on a hill perched facing magnificent ocean views, walking around the park would definitely make you sweat, unless it‚Äôs winter. If you don‚Äôt want to walk the park, there‚Äôs a train that goes around the part that lets you get on and off. Save the walking, but you‚Äôll lose out on achieving those steps on your fitness tracker. :)Taejong-Dae lighthouse. Below this lighthouse is a rock that legends say is where gods and goddesses came down from the heavens to relax. I guess even gods and goddesses need a break too, and Taejong-Dae, with its magnificent cliff views of the ocean is an excellent choice. Venture down below the lighthouse and you'll find ahjumas (aunties) selling right of the sea seafood. Fresh octopus, as in still living is served raw on makeshifts by the cliffs. The octopus is cut open in front of you, served while the parts are still moving. Eerie, somewhat disgusting yet fascinating. Eating raw seafood that's still moving is definitely part of the charm of Busan. I just couldn't move past the wriggling parts. Sitting on a rock by the sea. Ocean waves crashing underneath with winds running chills through my bones. All I could think about was how much I needed this good moment to remember."
Buddhist temple ,"Beautiful place to visit) we loved the view from the cliff. Though if the weather is hot, it will be very difficult to go up and down the stairs especially for orderly. There is nothing special about the temple, but the scenery is amazing. "
Beautiful View,"One can spend a few hours in this place for hiking or simply enjoying beautiful views. There is a tram in the park to take you from one location to the next stop. When you are done, there is an decent place to enjoy some Korean noodles outside of the park."
Good walk and workout,The weather is fantastic as it is windy and not hot. The park train that take passengers to the different locations are quite frequent and the journey is quite short from one location to another. Overall I would considered it quite a good walk and i had a good workout climbing the stairs!
Wonderful attraction with great views!,We stopped here as a group. We took the tram up to the top and the views were magnificent. We enjoyed fish cakes from the roadside vendor at one of the stops and took in the fresh air with some breathtaking views.I would highly recommend this attraction!
Quite a trek but worth the view!,"Be prepared to walk a lot! Though there's a tram to go around the entire place, you'd have to walk towards the lighthouse and it's a bit of a trek, with lots of stairs. Worth it, though. The structures combined with the view of the sea is simply breathtaking. "
"Triple treat on train, foot and boat","Taejongdae Park is located on one of the many fingers of headland in Busan. It is easily accessed by Busan Metro and bus. We arrived at the place fairly early in the morning to catch the Danubi Train before the busloads of tourists appear. At ‚Ç©3,000 per ticket, the hop-on hop-off train ride saves you the effort and time to walk up the rather steep hill. At the same time you can enjoy the scenic views along the way. We alighted at the Yeongdo Lighthouse station and proceeded along a fairly long flight of stairs to reach the iconic lighthouse. There are viewing platforms at the lighthouse for you to admire the square block cliffs and azure waves of the sea. Returning to the base station by the train, we also opted for a boat cruise to view the Yeongdo Coast from the sea. At ‚Ç©10,000 per ticket, it was well worth the price to sit on the open deck and ride the choppy waves. The exhilarating round trip made one short stop and travelled as far as Oryukdo Island before turning back to the Taejongdae pier."
Beautiful!,"I must admit, it's a long walk to get here. There's usually a bus that takes you directly to this location. I would recommend paying to get there quick. It's beautiful but it shouldn't take the whole day especially if you're only staying in Busan for a short amount of time."
A place worth to visit,"I went to Taejongdae twice - once in May 2016 and once in June 2017. Both were fulfilling but very different experiences. In May 2016, the Danubi ride around the park was closed and we had to hike up to the Lighthouse which took around 1.5h at normal speed(a bunch of 20 year olds). I was able to climb down onto the rock structures and snap photos at the Lighthouse area, and it was honestly one of the highlights of my trip to Busan. Afterwards, we didn't have to climb back up all the stairs again because there were free ferry rides sending visitors back to the entrance of Taejongdae. However, in June 2017, the Danubi rides were open (thank god) but the path to the rock structures were closed(and I don't know for what reason). There were no more ferry rides so we had to retrace all our steps to take the Danubi train down again. It was tiring to say the least. However, my family and I enjoyed a plate of fresh seafood right above the rocks and beside the sea(You''ll know where I'm talking about if you go to the Lighthouse). We ordered a plate of sanakji(live octopus) and some form of orange seafood for 30,000won. Pretty expensive, but worth the one time experience!"
Beautiful sceneries,"We went here in summer ,june 2017.and luckily it held flower festival in taejongdae temple.we only have 2.5 hours in this place,so we chose lighthouse and flower festival.Lighthouse is really beautiful,with lots of steps..you can see 'sea,steps,forest',very beautiful... If you are quite strong in walking..you can go downstairs till the beach..and of course you must go upstairs...yaaaa...quite tiring. And after that,we stop at Taejongdae temple..beautiful flower hydrangea festival..we'd never seen it before.."
Must visit place in Busan,"I went up to the lighthouse walking and came back in the bus provided (3000 KWR). The view looked amazing. You many need to climb up and down wooden stairs to reach the place. The are also some look out points on the way from the gate to light house, the walking along the road creates a positive feel."
One of the must see in Busan,"I've visited Taejongsa temple twice, the day before the festival started and the festival day on June 24. There's so many people even I arrived there early 6am in the morning. I recommend to visit here at evening before the sunset which is much better. And it's located at the top of the mountain so you should wear comfortable shoes. "
Must Visit,"The walk from the entrance to the lighthouse is about 1.9km uphill (gradual). Nothing very interesting on the way up. Once you're at the entrance to the lighthouse, it's downhill all the way. We were there around 6pm (still bright due to longer daylight). The walk to the waterline was fought with bitterly cold and strong wind, so go prepared."
A great place with great views,My 2nd visit and love the place as usual. Its windy and beautiful sceneries. Highly recommended to others who visiting Busan
Have a break ,"Take a little break from the bustling city and enjoy a short trek along the park. Ignore the tram and take a walk instead. It's peaceful and best of all, it's free! Drop by the various attractions like pebble beach, observation deck and tower. Remember to head down to the beach area and take photo with the rocks at the bottom of the cliffs. I would say this would be one of the main attraction and you can spend half a day over here! "
Ïó¥Ï∞®Î•º Í∏∞Îã§Î¶¨Î©∞..,"We bought tickets for the Danubi Train and we went around sightseeing. Overall place is great; however, the Danubi Train made us wait over an hour at a station and the conductors just completely ignored us. I came from America to this place, and as a fellow Korean, I have to say that I was ashamed.

Highlight of Busan,If u have time to cover one main attraction then make it this one. Totally worth it. Its a little out of the way as u need to travel about 40mins in bus. I made a mistake by taking a looped bus so wasted a lot of time. So do ask bus driver to confirm. Once there..u will know cos its the last stop n everyone will alight. Walk up slope to catch the tram (or they called it train). Treking on foot will take u hours so the tram is recommended so that u save some energy to reach downslope where the tram cant go. The full journey is about 4.7km by tram but its more on foot for sure. I will recommend u dropped off at first stop at observation deck and take all the photos there. This is also a good stop to eat as there is a food court and cafe and a restaurant there..so its a goof refuel place. Very scenic and calming walk. Enjoy sea breeze. Take lots of photos!
A place with beautiful seascape,"The landscape was very beautiful. My friend and I took Taxi over there, and it's very convenient. You also can take the bus to go there. We stay in Taejongdae for more than two hours and took a lot of photos. But I still felt a little bit of cold, when the wind blowing."
"A must see, but pick a sunny day!","This was a trip we really wanted to do. Sadly we picked a cloudy day and there was no visibility. The walk up to the top was pleasant and we enjoyed that. You can also take one of the tourist trains, but it was an easy walk and would be ok for most people. We could not see a thing out of the Observatory, but judging by the picture on display, it would be stunning on a clear day. I would recommend."
Sea is really beautiful,"it's definitely worth visiting. Views are amazing, nice hidden pebble beach and small market of fresh sea food. There are several attractions and most of them are on the mountain, also if you turn right there will be pebble beach, places to eat and cruise boats. If you'll get straight then there will be road to hill. You can buy tickets for train car or go by foot. Train stops at every attraction and you can use next one after you done looking at it. Try to come down at second stop it's got sea food market and hidden pebble beach. It's a bit hard to come up but place is really nice just bring some water with you."
Time to enjoy the ocean,I went there in the afternoon with my friend. We didn't buy the ticket for the bus but just strolling along the coast. It takes you about an hour to walk along the whole coast but of course some extra time to stop and take photos of the view.
"Wear your most comfortable shoes, and make this your first and only big outing","I am glad this was our first outing and not our second. The second outing we planned was not as pleasurable as, we were quite spent!We took local transportation. (Nampo station and exit to Youngdo Bridge. Walk up the bridge a bit and there are buses going to Taejongdae (No. 8, 30, 66, 88, 186) and it takes about 30 min. per previous reviewer) We took a shuttle train (Danubi) for convenience and got out at the first stop. You can hop on and off anytime. There's an observation platform, which has a few eateries/convenient shop, and a rest room. We took some time taking the view in.We hopped back on the train, and went to the lighthouse exit. We have a family of 5, 3 of our kids are 15-23 years old, and my husband and I who are just 50, and pretty fit. It really wiped us out. It could be we've been walking around all week, and the fact that I and family wore sandals, not thinking this would be strenuous at all. The stairs are steep (not all but still), and there are a lot of them! What felt like forever to get to the lighthouse, my legs turned into mush, and I couldn't gather the energy to climb the spiral staircase to reach to the top. The rest of my family did, however, and they said the view was spectacular and worth the trek up. I was happy with my view from the platform ""resting"" area so I didn't feel like I missed anything. We rested until we felt ok enough to walk back uphill. I rode the train for the rest of the journey, and by the time we were done, it was around 3pm, so we ate at the first restaurant nearby the bus depot, and took the bus back home. I read somewhere that this needs about 2 hours, and I would say factor in commute time to get there (metro and bus), waiting for lines to get tickets on train, waiting to get back on the Denube train, etc, because that will affect your energy level by the time you actually do the hard core walking around. We went to Gamecheon after, and I loved it, but I think it would've been more pleasurable if we were not in pain. Taejongdae is spectacular and highly recommended. Just plan accordingly, and have expectation that it is physically challenging, and wear the right shoes! If you found this helpful, I'd appreciate helpful thumbs up. Thanks!"
Lovely nature,"Take a boattour, you will love it! We saw dolphins. A lot of green, nice colour water, islands in the far view"
Seaview,We took a bus to this place (bus no. 101) fare was 1.3k per pax per way. Nice to take the bus there where u can see more thing along the way. Once u reached the place u will need to walk up a slope to the information counter to buy tickets for the mini train ride coz it will be easier or you will have to walk the hilly coast. Fare 3k per pax. Train will move and stop then u can enjoy your time and wait tor the next train. Great place to explore the sea coast area n a beautiful Seaview. There is a light house with great photo shot area.
Good place to free your mind,"In Busan, its all about sea view. But any how, this place is good to free your mind. Bear in mind, when you purchase the small train ticket, it comes with train number, so there is no need to queue up, when the big display screen show your train number only you queue(walk to the front). there is nothing much for 4th location-taejongshi(temple), many people didnt visit this place, as a result, we cant get on the train to go back to the entrance, the train is always full. so, you may consider to skip it also. "
a very nice walk around the penninsula. .,"Went yesterday and it was a very decent walk around passing the history museum and lighthouse etc. . yes, all up was a decent visit. ."
Great view!,"I recommend taking the Danubi train and then taking the coastal walk down to the light house. The train goes around the Taejongdae area with a few stops. Train tickets are 3,000 KRW each and you can hop on and off the train unlimited times. Last train is at 6.30pm. Taejongdae is a rock beach and while it is difficult to get all the way down to the beach, the view of the sea and the lighthouse along the coastal walkway is very beautiful."
The cliffs! ,"We didn't get a chance to walk down to the cliffs when we visited but that would have been cool. The lighthouse and the view was great. Very serene. If you don't want to take the trolley, hiking up by foot is permitted. "
Great vast sea view with rocky edges,"Taejongdea is basically a park with a lot to see. You could either choose to trek the area or commute around in their tram services.You have to be ready to spend longer hours if trekking.Taking their tram service would cut down the hours in walking.In order to reach the lighthouse, you will have to walk a number of flights of stairs to get there.Upon reaching, you will be greeted by the vast ocean.However, that is not the end.If you still have the energy and time, head down further to the rocky coast.This meant that you have to conquer more stairs to reach the bottom coast line.Along the way down to the coast line, there is a traditional seafood shop selling fresh seafood with a great view.There is a great spot for photo taking along the coast line.However, please be careful as it is very slippery due to algae growth on certain rocks.And a reminder, the number of steps down is the number of steps up for the tram."
A Wonderful Outing,"The views are excellent, the sea is gorgeous, the Buddhist temples on the way are beautiful, and the walk up many, many small hills and steps is invigorating but is not too strenuous. We are both elderly and had no difficulty in navigating the hills and steps! Overall we thought our outing to Tarjondae was quite wonderful and would be very worthwhile for most tourists!"
A must-see in Busan,"It is quite easy to go. Take the metro to Nampo station and exit to Youngdo Bridge. Walk up the bridge a bit and there are buses going to Taejongdae (No. 8, 30, 66, 88, 186) and it takes about 30 min. The views are excellent and there is a shuttle train (Danubi) for convenience. There is a walk down the hill to see the Yeongdo Lighthouse and the ""Light beyond limitation"", the red-blue circular structure. From the observation platform, where there is a convenience store, one could see the Tea Kettle Island. I went there in late March and there are beautiful magnolia flowers."
 Must see,Beautiful but be prepared to exercise going up and down stairs when you go see the lighthouse. It is a must see during the day or for a sunset
Not bad but not spectacular either,Not accessible for wheelchair users. Went one round on the tram and waited while my family went to the observatory deck. They did enjoy themselves though. 
Interesting lighthouse and scupture,Went there late afternoon and took the tram to the designated stops. The observatory was pretty much a look out point with a cafe on the top level. Did not stay long there. Walked over to the next destination which is the lighthouse and path to the lower rocky and rugged coastline. Saw the nice pointed sculpture along the way and a little island nearby. Sightseeing boats were passing by as the sun set. Managed to catch the bus back to the gate before dark and skip the next destination which is the taejong temple. 
Amazing view,I confess we had some trouble understanding the bus audio insisde Taejongdae which caused a bit of a discomfort but we managed our way there and enjoyed the great view... some people were definetly going to forbidden places and doing dangerous stuff so watch out stay safe cause the wind is really strong and can drag you around.
Rainy day,"I came here on a rainy day, so the train to the lighthouse did not work. Thus, I had to walk up hills for around more than 30 mins to the lighthouse. However, it was paid off once the scenery was gorgeous."
Awsome place for a day in nature.,Good hiking and walking. Lots of open space with wonderful ocean views. A must to enjoy the nature of Busan.
Taejongdae clam tents,"Found Taejongdae clam tents to be better than Jagalchi market. Advantages- Minimal tourist in the area, thus they spoke very little English. Thus you pay what local pays.- Seafood BBQ in front of the beach, very relaxing and peaceful. Feeling more at home.- Difference flavour and the way you cook.- Seafood includes clams, mussels, prawns, very big clams but inside meat are like XL scallops, Disadvantages- No fishes or Alaska king crab on sale- 3 tents/restaurants selling seafood"
Must visit if come busan,The location is awesome .i went there by bus then purchase ticket of tram vehicle .the view was nice . Have coffee shop resturant .i really enjoy
Excellent,Beautiful spot on the coast....well worth the visit.....a good half day. Easy to get to by subway and bus.
Nice and calm,"Went there after 2pm. Although the place (most of it, tge observatory are and the area of the lighthouse) are under reconstruction, quite many ppl were there. I guess on a weekend and when it's open it will be packed, our visit was not that bad. Nice view of the sea, quite athmosphere. 2000 wonn/person for the ""train"" ticket was cheap.Nice area to walk around. If you have time while in Busan, then go there."
Nice Sunset,"Went there around dawn, joined the tour train. However, there is no English translation so we don't know it is almost the last train. Just follow the crowd and get off the train to take photos. Cannot find the spot because there is no English direction or signage. Jump back to the train and just follow the crowd again. When we arrived the final destination, everyone has gone in a second. All shops have closed. We went down to bus station, no one is around. It is like a dead city. Asked the bus driver and try to head back. He said no, then i turned round and fell from the bus. Bus driver did not see me and drove away. I was almost rolled over by the bus. What a bad memories in there. Watch out for the road uneven and the bus driver attitude."
Great place! Lots of walking on lighthouse area,"This was a great stop if you want more nature in your trip. There was a wait for us to ride the train but it is well worth it. The ENTIRE trip up is uphill. Then when you want to check out the attractions you will also need to do stairs. The observatory stop is nice but I recommend going to the second floor area by the cafe. It was less crowded and provided the same view as the main lobby area. The light house can be walked to from the observatory, or you can catch the train. The light house trail is great, lots of views and steps. Be prepared to walk a lot! "
Garden walking,"Nothing much to do there other than visiting a deserted temple hidden inside, walk around the greens, taking mini train and take pictures nearby the lighthouse. Suitable for leisure walk only."
Nice place for photos,"Good place for taking photos. We took the train around the park (highly recommend) and took photos at the viewpoint, lighthouse, cliffs, and temple"
Great seaview,"Take a metro to Nanpo station, then take a bus 30 to Taejongdae then you can either take bus in @10K won with a ferry ride Remember to bring thick cloths and raincoat "
Beautiful scenery and pleasant walk,"This was my first stop in Busan.our family took the bus, they gave us the family discount. We got off at the obsevatory.it wascrowded with many tourists . Odeng was delicious there. We walked to the light house.mysonwanted to go nearthe cliff, and we did go down. It was hard to climb up the stairs, but we took some beautiful pictures down at the cliff. There were some kind of dinosaurs footprints, on the rocks."
Nice scenery,"A great location if you are planning for your outdoor activity in Busan. Nice scenery. You can see a limitless ocean view and some traditional Korean temples in this area. If you take the Danubi train (~2000 won per head), you can hop on and hop off to 5 major attractions in Taejongdae Park. Should definitely stop by the observatory and the lighthouse for some good photos and good hike. "
Awesome lighthouse. ,"A lot of slippery steps so make sure you have grippy sneakers. Really nice and well organised hike (not really a hike, just a walk around a really big park) but well worth a visit. "
"Nice scenery, bad train service","We bought the train tickets which allow us to hop on and off at different stops. Once you get off the train, it is very hard to get back on. All the seats were taken. The staff was rude. We ended up walking all the way back. "
Breathtaking view,"To enjoy full experience of what Taejongdae have to offer, go up the hike to every station and view points. On a bright day, can see Japan! What amazes me the most is the hike down to one of the station, eat sea urchin while waiting for a boat ride back to the entrance by sea!"
A must visit place in Busan,"Make sure to allot at least 2 to 3 hours to visits the place.Check the lighthouse if you have time, you can go down the mountain to reach the lighthouse."
To long walk,The walks there are not really worth it. The views are not spectacular and it is kind of boring to walk around!
Great place to walk around,"I didn't know the park was so big, and I didn't wear comfortable shoes that day. So my feet hurt so much after walking around, but it was worth it. The air was fresh and clean, it was nice to walk without sweating (I would be soaking wet if I walked like that for 5 mins in Singapore). It is a must-go place, but elder people won't be able to walk the whole park."
Some cracking views,"Taejongdae offers a circular walk around a forested area on the coast that is less strenuous than Igidae Park. There is an observatory that looks out to the sea, a lighthouse you can climb, and a couple of Buddhist temples. If you don't want to walk, there is a land train that circles the park for only Ôø¶2,000."
My favorite spot in Busan :),"I walked from the start till the end and i guess it took around 4-5 hours as I stopped at every spot and explored a bit. I recommend you to walk if you have time as the walk itself is not difficult and it would be a very good activity for relaxation, remember to bring some food though. You get to really enjoy the views and get the most out of your visit if you walk instead of taking the bus. The views of the sea and rocks at taejongdae were fantastic, better than the views from the igidae park but there were more tourists in taejongdae.Definitely come on a sunny day so you get to see the best views."
Tiring walk but nice scenery,"We took a public bus to the park and then walked all the way to and back the park. Took us over 3 hours. Quite tiring but nice cool winter weather (about 7 degrees C). Those who find the walk tough can take a tram ride though we find it not worthwhile to pay for the 2,000 KRW ride. Just take a slow leisurely walk.Good places for photos along the way. Nicely maintained park and there was an art exhibition going on at the exhibition hall."
BEAUTIFUL!!,"Luckily my friends and i opt for the tram (KRW 2000), because its a long walk to get to the lighthouse. we went in the morning, weather is nice and windy. Please wear a proper shoes there. Spend almost 3 hours enjoying the the beautiful scenery and having fun taking pictures."
Nearest to Sea,nice seafood at the button of the hill. The sunset is very nice. I suggest you can take 4-5 hrs here. 
rewarding,super great of view of the sea and the rocks! although getting there is a bit rough at the end of it is a great reward of a great view
Beautiful! You must go~,"It took us a while to get to Tawjondae from Haeundae but I must say, we were amazed by the view! We took the ferry to go there. I recommend going there early in the afternoon. Bring some snacks with you and a cup of tea/coffee. And also, make sure to bring one plastic bag because you cannot leave your trash there. My husband and I would love to bring our families here. The water is quite magnificent. Busan is beautiful. "
Spectacular view of the sea and cliff ,"We got there extra early by reaching Nampodong station at 8.30 - used exit 6 and waited at the second nearest bus stop to the exit (take either bus 8, 30 or 88). Our journey took only 25 mins since there wasn't much traffic (taejongdae is the last stop)In winter, the Danubi train starts at 9.20am. Pay 2,000 won and they will bring you to the lighthouse and 3 other stops. We spent a good one hour on the lighthouse with a good look of the sea and cliffs. The other attractions are just so so - we decided to skip. Definitely worth a stop - the bus ride is pretty scenic too."
Unexpectedly good,Was thinking to choose between Bomeosa and Taejongdae for a half day trip on my last day in Busan before depart to Jeju. Turn out to be surprisingly stunning than what I expected. Definitely love this place.
Good sea views but not a lot more,"This is a location to come for a walk. In fact if you did not take the tram (2000 won/pp), then it is a very long and uphill trek to the lighthouse, which we consider the pinnacle of this attraction, which is otherwise free to the public.Do not stop at the viewing platform (1st stop) because it is under renovation as of November 2016. Perhaps it will be ready for visitors in 2017? 2nd stop is at the lighthouse, which still requires a good number of stairs to descend to (and back up). Climb the lighthouse to just below the beacon. Great views from there. We saw many folks walk the small tracks to the cliff tops overlooking the sea. If you have time this can be a wonderful thing to do - to take a ""dangerous"" selfie. At the base of the lighthouse is a jetty with cruise boats that take you around the coast. If not, have some seafood with the vendors there.Best time to visit is probably the afternoon when the sun is shining from the other direction, as the views look eastward."
Nice view,nice view. you can choose to walk or pay betwen KRW 2000 for the tram. Need a good sport shoe to walk as is climbing up to see the view. Tuorist can get free stroller and wheel chair with only put your passport at the info counter. The staff cant speak english well.
Little over-rated,"I don't wish to hike up ,and then get a view of the Korean coastline and just come back.Some gardens,flowers,trails etc would add to the attraction but sadly,all I saw was the Memorial to the Med Corps outside the park and the gorgeous view of the bay."
awesome scene,"walking down the many steps to the lighthouse towards the shore was simply breathtaking that I nearly missed a step. the rock formation was unique and we've so much fun taking pictures, posing against the backdrop of the ocean with the on-going liners in the distance was spectacular! besides the lighthouse, "
"Lovely, easy hike. Great views","Flat, paved walking paths. Free activity, no ticket required. There is a quirky ""train"" that will save you the walk, but in my opinion the walk as the best part. There are luggage lockers near the start of the trail next to the convenience store where you can store your stuff for 500 won for the day. I walked down the rough stairs to the pebble beach to just take in the views. Lots of shallow tide pools if you like looking for sea life. Saw a few determined fisherman who had clambered over rocks to get prime spots to cast their lines. You can also take a ferry here to get to other parts of the attraction, but the ferry is rather loud so I didn't.Further along the trail, there is an abandoned temple with a lovely bell and buddha statues. Finally you'll come to the lighthouse where you have to walk down many steps to the shore. You'll be able to see ocean going liners in the distance, and other islands. Unique rock formations on the cliffs next to the sea. Narrow grottos and rocks you climb over for better views. Lots of picture opportunities. "
Scenic,We took the city tour bus at Busan to reach here. It was one of the stops. Definitely need a good pair of shoes to walk but worth the effort. Make sure you take more pictures here!
Nice place to hike!,"Get out at the last bus stop Taejongdae station. Have to walk a few more distance before reaching the uphill entrance. Best to wear rubber shoes when going to this place. We opted not to take the train (i think it's called danube or something). We had a 3-hour amazing hike in this place, picture taking and stops included. Went to all the stops/scenic view this place has to offer. One of the nice place In Busan. Restaurants are located around entrance/exit area. "
Great views,It's a long walk to get to the lighthouse so it's more convenient to take the Danubi train which make several stops along the park and doesn't cost much. The path leading to the lighthouse gives you great views and I even saw some people walk down to the rocky promontory down the lighthouse.
Long lines for the train,"You need to ride train, not just for the experience, but the place is big and you'll be tired. There are long lines for the danubi trains. Waited less than an hour to ride it. But lots of sitting spaces available. Ate ice creams and pastries while waiting for our turn. We had a long day that day, went there around 4pm. So everyone is tired to walk. Just sit inside the train and enjoy the round. Worth another visit in near future."
Scenic and windy at time of visit,Spent only 3 hours here so I only visited the observatory and lighthouse. It is very scenic with nice rock formations at the lighthouse. Be sure to go down and take lots of pictures and climb up to the top of the lighthouse!Take the Danubi train (2000KRW for an adult ticket) as it is quite a long distance from the entrance to the lighthouse and observatory unless you have lots of time and don't mind hiking uphill.
The amazing sunset in my life ,"We was visiting at16/10 Monday due to raining day at Sunday , we don't have enough time to do the trekking therefore we choose to take the tram around it. There are two stops , we stop at the 1st station taking some photo and enjoy the wind the view , the observation deck is closed due to damage of typhoon. The amazing view is we continue to the 2nd stop which is temple and we are so lucky see the amazing sunset view , very good memory of my Busan tour. "
Good Experience,"Taejongdae Resort Park. When you are there, you can purchase the train tickets (Danubi Train) to proceed up to the drop off place where you can then walk to the light house.Overall good experience but not really good for elderly people as there are quite a lot of stairs if you want to head to the light house. Slow walk down the stairs should take you about 15 mins to reach the light house vice versa back to the surface.Some really nice sea view and strong wind."
Must see in Busan. ,This is by far the most scenery place to visit in Busan in my experience. The place was cooling with breeze of air. Nice place to visit during a sunny day!!!
Extremely Scenic,"It will be a good hike if you choose not to take the tram service (2000 Won/pax for adult tourists). Covered more than 2km on foot and covered many scenic areas, along the beautiful sea, lighthouse and park. This is the place for couples and avid photographers as you can take many great pictures!"
Feels run down and not very well maintained,"We boarded the tram at the start and first got off to see the light house. We went down to the rocks and found a few ladies selling fresh flat fish, sea squirts and sea snails. Apparently they will sashimi (served raw) the fish for you. The climb back is moderate, but some of the steps near the bottom need repairing. The view is decent and if you are up to it, you can climb up to the lighthouse as well.We hopped on to the tram and got off at the Taejongdae temple, which was disappointing. Overall a rather average experience."
Very nice views and the strong winds,Love the place and the trek in general. Wish I could've allotted more time to this area because there were so much more to see. We arrived quite late and was able to get on the danubi train ride but I wanted to walk around some more. The place was very picturesque and also good for exploring around. 
Good Hike,"It is good for hiking. On the day we visited, it was raining and we didn't have a good experience. Otherwise it would be a memorable place to visit."
Beautiful Southern Tip of Korea,Worth a visit. Spectacular sea facing view. Be prepared to come with extra tees because there will be lots of walking and climbing stairs. There is a bus which will take you to the peak to see the lighthouse but you still need good walking shoes. 
Nice cliff scenery at lighthouse,"The path to the top is quite steep. So if you are with children and elderly, advisable to take the Danubi train and get down at the desire stop. 1st stop is the observation tower (it was under construction during our visit in September 2016), you get to take nice scenery pics at the observation tower. The 2nd stop is the lighthouse. You need to walk down stairs to get to the lighthouse. At the lighthouse, you are also able to take nice scenery pics. These are the two stops where most of the people drop off. "
Good to walk!,"I enjoyed to walk along the round route, seeing sea and ships and breathing in fresh air! There were shuttle bus and ships for tourists though I couldn't get them."
Must Visit!!!,"I love nature and this place was AMAZING. Worth a visit and sweat. The breeze from the ocean was so breathtaking. But this is a very tiring place to go. U need to climb a lot of stairs. Wear suitable shoes. We rode on the Danubi Train which cost 2000won. If u do not come for hiking and go here by bus, take the train. U hv no choice. I am aware of the renovation works at the observation deck so we alight at the lighthouse stop. Well, basically everybody goes off here. That is why u hv to queue in a long line when u r going back to the main area. "
Sea View by the Light House,"You can ride a train going up there, it cost KRW 2,000 for the ticket. And you have to wait for the train with the number on your ticket. There will be 3 stops, the first stop is the Observatory, but it was in renovation when I get there, the second stop is where the light house is, but you still need to go down from where you stop to reach to lighthouse. And the 3rd stop is a temple they said, I didn't get to go there. beside train you can also walk, but the way there was quite hiking."
Í∑∏Ïñë,"Taejongde Beach is about 8 kilometers from Busan Station, Busan, south Korea. If you walk along the beach, you will see a natural perfect, fascinating, and amazing view. And you can try train for looking around."
A place must to visit in Busan,"Nice scenery. Walked down the trail to the lighthouse. If you have stroller, you have to be prepared with inconvenience bringing t down and up the staircase at the trail even thought the staircase is not that steep. Be prepared with mosquitos repellent. There's a Danubi train to explore the areas around Taejongdae."
Awesome ,"A must go place. I walk up the trail, enjoyed every observatory point. Took many pictures.. It's so beautiful, lucky me the weather was so good . "
Super windy and superb view,Pay W2000 for the train to get up the hill (it's a return trip ticket) and the view was perfect. The wind is so strong it blows away our train receipt in my bag!. the stairs was killing. Do prepare a proper shoe and outfit. Dress is very dangerous and heels too. 
Picturesque ,"It is a large area around Taejongdae. Get a pair of good walking shoes to walk around the area and enjoy the beautiful scenery. One of the main attraction is the western most light house of Korea. The view is gorgeous. There is a sightseeing train to save the walk, but tickets could be sold out fast. You can also get in from the stops along the route as long as there are still seats."
Good place for hiking,"This is a beautiful place in Busan but I little bit far away by this reason I recommend to take the Jumbo Bus City Tour. Is a good way to know the city without spending a lot of money in transportation and with the freedom to spend the time that you want in any place. You can go to view point in a train that cost 4000 won-two ways, or you can go walking. There is also the possibility to take a cruise. "
Beautiful park ,Be sure to come with proper walking shoes as the roads are rather steep and there's a lot of walking up and down the steps. We came here in the summer and boy was it so hot. However as we got near to the sea it was very windy and at one point the wind was almost pushing me. The part where the cliff is was beautiful with crashing waves hitting it. A must visit and do remember to buy tickets for the tram ride up. 
Long Hike but worth it,Cool bridges to cross and nice scenery. Many places to stop for selfies. Very beautiful hike. You do not need a guide just follow the signs.
Fresh and,"The most attractive station will be the Yeongdo Lighthouse but there are many attraction place can be found here. You'll be able to enjoy a superb and magnificent view at the cliff. There will be quite a number of stairs to go through to reach the cliff, and you need to climb up the stairs again after that to continue your journey. Beautiful nature and scenery if the weather is perfect. whole route is around 5 KM one way if you want to enjoy the whole area."
"Beautiful, nice park","We went to Taejongdae Park using the public bus. From the bus station, just need to walk for about 150m, and you will reach the entrance. We took the danubi train, which cost 2000 won to tour the park. It's a hop on hop off train, so you can hop off at any station along the way. The most attractive station will be the Yeongdo Lighthouse, and you will be able to enjoy a superb and magnificient view at the cliff. There will be quite a number of stairs to go through to reach the cliff, and you need to climb up the stairs again after that to continue your journey.Beautiful nature and scenery if the weather is perfect. Huge crowd during weekends/holidays, so need to wait for quite long for the train."
Nice visit to this park,"When you buy a ticket, ask the person at the gate first, what train to take. It goes in turns and numbers. Please make sure to use every stop of the hop-on hop-off train. Before you know it, all stops are done. You should also be prepared to wait to take the next train. If you take a walk, it will take time. It seems, that the boat trip has mor to show, then the train. But the boat is mor expensive."
NIce Place - Long walk,"Nice Place , the whole route is around 5 KM one way if you want to enjoy the whole area. Or you can take a train for W2000, but the problem with the train is that the train has a long queue normally, it is not first go up first serve kind of thing but depend on your ticket queue. So we were ask to wait for estimate around 1 hour for our round (it was on a weekend, so it is just a estimate waiting time). We give up and start walking...But it was enjoyable walk, but due to that we skipped some far away spot. The scenery was magnificent. They also have one store selling seafood on the beaches, it was actually cheaper than in Jagalchi..."
Hydrangea on a rainy day,"Nothing seems to be open on a rainy day here, but I did got to see the beautiful hydrangeas! The summer humidity, rain and mist gave this place a mysterious look! Be prepare to sweat and have your clothings soak in this season if you do make it here... The Danubi train don't run on rainy days!"
great scenery. lots of walking required,"Visited here during my second visit to Busan. The coastal view is very impressive and will not disappoint you. After checking this one out, the sand beaches in the city will be boring to you. need to climb a lot of stairs up and down though. not for people with weak knees! If you take the park bus (recommended), make sure you pay attention to your bus number instead of going to the waiting line directly. You can only get onto the bus corresponds to the number on your ticket."
A place must visit,"There is a tram that cost KRwon 2000 per person to bring you round the park. The tram will stop at 5 key places. 1st stop is the Observatory Deck. Nothing much to see as the place is closed for renovation. 2nd stop is the Light house. Also takes less than 1 min to walk from the Observatory Deck to Light House Station. Once reach there, you will need to walk less than 5 min downhill to reach the Lighthouse and the Iconic Arrow. It probably takes another 5-10min to reach to the Sinseon Rock (ie flat rock) where you can take nicer pictures of the cliff and ocean. There is also a fishing village that serve fresh sashimi if you walk further down the hill. However, please note going downhill is easy, the challenge is climbing back up again all the away to the Light House Station. Stroller is not recommended. After Light House station, the tram will take you to a Temple."
"Beautiful views, requires some walking","Great for dating, you can sit the tram around, but if you have the stamina, better to walk for quieter more private company. The views at the cliff and light house are lovely to walk and get photos taken. Overall a pleasant experience. Great for nature lovers and those who need a breather from urban life. Not recommended on bad weather days though."
Spectacular views and quite a walk,"Lots of things to see -- temples, the ocean, the ships ending the harbor, and a small festival. We walked. It might be best to buy a ticket on the tram so that you can take a break."
Cool and Beautiful Scenery ,"A nice park that deserved good rating. Nice scenery view. The cliff and light house are must to visit. You can walk down to the cliff and enjoy the sea breeze but it slippery. Be careful. You can either take a stroll walk around the park which I did. It took me about 4 hours to finish the park (including rest stop and photo shooting). Not suitable for elderly or young kids as there are many up slopes. Many toilets around the park.Or you can pay ‚Ç©2000 for their tram ride. Limited seats per ride available. I reached the park at 11.30am but the next few trams are full. Need to wait till 12.20pm. In the end, I opt to walk. The tram stop at few major attractions. You can hop on and off.To reach there: From Nampo Metro (Exit 6), take bus 8, 30, 66, 88 and 186. The bus stop will be 2nd bus stop from the exit (opposite Lotte Department). Bus ride take about 30mins and you alight at the terminal. Walk straight for 50metres and you will reach the park."
A nice natural park with gorgeous views,"Taejongdae is a natural park with a rather dense vegetation. It has a single primary paved road with side-walk that takes you in a circuit like path of the whole park. The main entrance of Taejongdae park is accessible by bus or taxi. The entrance is free. Once you walk past the main entrance, it takes you to a fork. Keep right and this follows a downhill path. From there, you will visit a number of attractions a long the way like temples, lighthouse, cliffs and sea lookouts. You will finally return to the fork. The entire circuit is about 4km and a total of 3-4 hours would be sufficient. The path is up and down. And ascends at some points are quite steep. If you are pushing strollers, be prepared for some workout and it won't be possible to get to some attractions like the lighthouse (which is led by steep steps) and near temples. This park is very peaceful with amazing sea and cliff views.If you think walking the whole circuit may be challenge, don't despair. There is a 'train' service. It is actually a modified truck pulling three coaches. This service is quite frequent and has a number of stops a long the circuit. You can take this train near the fork that I mentioned earlier or at 5 other stops. Since this service only goes in one direction, there is an additional benefit to walking with the traffic flow. :)"
Must visit place!,There was a direct bus from my Guest House and Taejongdae is the last stop. There is tram but I chose to walk all the way. Nice place but I would suggest you to check the weather before going there because it is more beautiful with clear sky.
Superb view,"The view at the observatory is superb. Wind was quite strong. Highly recommended to visit if you are in Busan.Tips:1) To avoid looooooong queue for the train, be sure to reach early as soon as it opens. 2) Alternatively you may walk all the way but be prepared as the road is going upwards and could be a couple of kilometres from the entrance. Good exercise though but be sure to have comfy walking shoes :)"
Nice walk,"Second visit to the park. I still find it enjoyable. Took the train and stopped at the observatory and did a slow walk. Great scenery along the coast. Nice slow trek going downhill. This time round we walked all the way down the cliff. Interesting to see the ladies selling seafood at the bottom of the cliff. Midway trek back, we stopped at a cafe for a drink. Nice and relaxing if you have time. Great place to spend 3 or 4 hours enjoying the ocean."
A must-go if you are in Busan! Amazing views!,"Took a bus near Lotte (Busan station). Upon reaching the stop, the driver will announce & everyone alight from the bus.You can grab a free map from the Information Office at the entrance then walk up a short distance to the waiting queue for the Danubi train. 2000won for adults.Or you also choose to walk all the way along the route.The Observatory is under some renovation so I didn't manage to get in. Went to the Lighthouse & the views were breathtaking! You can walk to the edge of the cliff and spam your camera shutter button all you'd like =P"
Taejongdae Park unspoiled views,"Unless you're prepared for a 2 - 3 km walk from the entrance to the observatory, best to take the cute Danubi tram (KRW2000) running at 10 mins interval. The tram has about 8 stops between its circular departure/arrival point, so you can easily hop at any stop without having to pay again. Just show your ticket when boarding. Key highlights of this scenic yet rustic park located at the southern most tip of Yeongdo-gu are the observation deck and lighthouse. Pleasant park though summer can be really hot walking down the fairly long flight of steps to reach the lighthouse and downhill to the magnificent stratified cliffs fronting the open sea. The close encounter is worth the hike and do go slow with children and elderly relatives. The smell of fresh leaves, music of chirping birds and scenic views will keep nature lovers and photography enthusiasts going. Tea Kettle Island is visible in the background. Directions: Subway line 1 to Nampo station exit 6, walk straight to 2nd bus stop. Take bus No 8, 30, or 88 and alight at the last bus stop for Taejongdae Park. To travel back, take the same buses at station next to the bus terminus for Nampo station. Lots of local eateries just outside the park offering local food such as sliced pork soup, grilled pork and chicken soup."
Very nice to walk around! Great views!,One can easily spend one day around Taejongdae. There are many walking paths and even some temples that one can visit. It's a bit far from the main city attractions but it's worth the bus trip.
This is the place if you love nature,"I took bus opposite from the Lotte to reach this place. No worry where to stop as this is the last stop of the bus. There are two ways to explore this park one is by walking if you think you are energetic second is by tram called Danubi. Tram will be the best way to explore it. You can observe the beautiful sea view and the natural park in Yeongdu which the most people visit here. There are some stalls selling seafood on the coast, you can having some fresh seafood by enjoying the nice sea view."
Inexpensive and nice views,Nice walk around the shore with several interesting points of view. If you don't want to walk you can still take a short train but you will have to wait.
Interesting coastline,"Take the tanubi train (2000won per pax, loop service but it's totally worth it - u can alight and board the next train when u are done sightseeing) or it involves alot of walking. As we were short of time, we did not alight and visit all the stops, but only the second stop (observatory) and third stop (light house). For the third stop it involves alot of walking and (?) climbing of the rock. But one can reach the shoreline real near, and the view is definitely fabulous! To think such a wonderful place was once people committed suicide by jumping off the cliff.."
okay place,"This place was not in our itinerary when we first arrived to Busan. But our landlord recommended it. So, we decided to visit the park. It is a huge park, you can enjoy the park via foot (a bit hilly, but not a hard trail) but we were too tired, so we decided to use the transport tram they provided there. It's a good place to relax, but if you had no time in your hand, you can skip this place. "
Lots of walking if you don't take the tram.,A temple a war monument and a lighthouse. Its a good walk if your reasonably fit i did see old ppl and small kids walking around so i would say its average. There is a tram you can take around if your not up to the walk. Probably the lighthouse would be the most strenuous part as its cliff side and you can actually go down to the sea.
Nice !,Nice and full of tourist. Be prepare to walk and walk and climb and climb! But see many people young and old coming here.we even had seafood sashimi here. What an experience! 
Enjoyable Walk,"Great to walk in morning period. If your traveling with elders or kids or you don't like to walk up slope, or you wanna save some time (it took us nearly 3 hours for the whole walking trip), try taking the tram with little fees. It could be actually quite tiring walking up the whole way to the top of the park for the best views. The view of the sea side cliffs is spectacular, but windy at the time we're there. However, its not reachable by LRT. The best option getting there is by taking bus 88 or 101 near Nampo area, and it's the last stop of the buses routes. After the walk, have a try on the seafood noodle just next to the bus station (just below the TOM TOm's Cafe)."
sightseeing,"we only had a day tour in Busan and Taejongdae first in our itinerary. The park can be covered by foot, but i recommend to take danubi train to save more time and energy :) The ticket train is only 2000won per adult. Best time to visit is in the morning. Best season to visit is Spring you can see a lot of cherry blossoms in the park."
The scenery is very beautiful.wesome View.....,The scenery is very beautiful. With the windy weather and the fresh air. furthermore with the season of cherry blossoms along the park ..
No English direction in the park ,"The scenery of Taejongdae park itself is great. What's lacking is that there is no English direction regarding how to board the train, its stops. Ordinarily this attraction does not cost anything but the train does. Quite exhausting if you choose to walk instead taking train. "
Scenic; may it be from the top looking down or at the coast or rocks,"It's natural beauty. The beauty of the layers of sedimentary rock formation, the fault lines, the sea, the sky, the pebbled coast or even a view from the top is great. It's not enough to be standing at the lighthouse and looking down. If your legs can take the steps, then, it's worth walking to the surface of the rocks. Better still, if you are still game for it, you can walk all the way down to the jetty, where there is an array of raw sea foods for viewing or consumption. To get here, take the Subway to Nampo.Get to exit 6, then walk straight for about half a minute The second bus stop is for buses No. 8, 30, 88, 88-A. to Taejongdae.Disembark when the announcement is made. Walk down and then up the hill towards the Danubi train station. It's some 8 minutes walk uphill, in the North west direction from where you got off the bus. Easier to take the Danubi train because a one way trip there would be about 2-3 km uphill."
take danubi train,"we had to wait for about 40mins for our turn to take the train, but we are tired of walking (the map says need 1 hour to walk, 20mins by train for the whole area). the observatory plaza was closed for renovation, only a small area open for photo / view, then we walked to the nearby lighthouse and down to the cliffs. the train did not stop at the southpoint view, which i tot should be a good point to stop though. the temples & playground we did not go as it looks a bit under maintained."
Lovely place on sunset,"As always everything is perfectly organised, clean and preserved in this park. You can have very impressive views on the Korean costline there. It's Worth taking a taxi or the city tour bus to go there. The best would be to go with the city tour bus and stop there and then at the maritime museum which is really interesting."
The scenery is very beautiful,"Take subway line 1 to Nampo Station, exit 6. Take Bus 88 or 101 and get off at the last stop (Taejongdae Chagoji)."
A must-see in Busan,"Very peaceful park, a bit far from the center of Busan but is definitely worth the ride. The nature is beautiful, right next to the sea"
"Nice views, but only a few",The main trail in the park takes around an hour and 15 minutes. You walk along a road on which a tourist train passes by every few minutes. You can take this train if you do not want to walk and you can get out at the interesting sights. We didn't take a train and just walked as it was not tiring at all. There were some nice views of the ocean but especially the last part of the trail is not really interesting. It was nice to get out the city and look at all the trees in spring.
Love the view,"I love mountains and the sea; this place have it all; beautiful to visit in the afternoon; the view is amazing; but can be a bit cold depend on the time of the year you visit, because of the wind; but the place is worth it; there are many buses coming from Nampodong to the entrance of the Taejongdae resort; from there you can walk or take a small ""bus"" offered by the resort; very beautiful view"
Lots of walking,"We arrived a little later than we should have. The land trains last run is at 6pm, with the final returning one being at 7.30pm. We just caught the last one to the light house. Ideally you would want to spend a few hours here and walk around the park, but we headed up to the top, saw the viewing point, walked down to the lighthouse and back up to the bus. To get to the lighthouse you have to walk down quite a number of stairs.I think the visit was worth it, just would have been nicer on a sunny day with some more time.Last land trains back are very busy so we walked back to the viewing stop which ensured we had a space."
Family Oriented Park,"It is a beautiful park. You can opt to walk if you are fit enough as the road is up hill & down hill. To tour the entire park you can purchase your ticket to board the 'Danubi Train"" and it stops at observation deck, light house and the temple. The young children will enjoy the ride as the front part of the train has a unique shape. The train comes with many colors. It is popular for the locals and tourist too."
Lovely Light house in Busan ,"To see the lovely light house & see the ocean in BusanIf you are visit Busan , you should visit this place.Make sure you wear the comfortable shoes to walk around this area.You'll never ever regret to visit here."
awesome place for some quiet walk,Taejongdae offers an awesome view of the sea and a quick get away if you're tired of the metropolitan life in Busan. There are a few walking trails in the area. Excellent half day trip and just a few minutes walk from Haeundae beach.
Stunning island park with sea views,Bring your walking shoes but be prepared for a very pleasant seaside park and views. I wouldn't bring along small children as the course can get hilly and steep with stairs. A light jacket might be a good idea when the sea breeze hits you. Stunning sea views and takes great photos as well.
Amazing view of the ocean,It was a lot of walking so I'd suggest being prepared to walk. There was an option to take a bus too but you get to really enjoy the place if you make the effort to take the trail. The ocean view along the trail was really nice.
Island Park great for an easy getaway from the city,We took a ferry that ported us on the other end of the island after giving us great views of some of the small Korean islands off the coast of Busan. We then walked around until exiting from the main entrance. Great place to walk and picnic. Loved watching the sunset while gazing out to the open water.
lovely lighthouse,"good to walk along for some time..there also is a small train along the trail..don't miss the lighthouse top..if you visit on weekdays, you can feel the Pacific ocean whole in your mind alone"
A walk with nature and the sea,"I opted to walk rather than taking the tram in order to save a little travel expenses. Not exactly wise if you don't like to walk or you are travelling with elderly/kid or the weather is wet/extreme hot. It was around a 4km walk if I remember correctly, but lucky thing for me, I was blessed with good cool weather. You get to see a pretty lighthouse, rocky edge that's photo worthy, endless trees with different colors (brown green red) and nice lamp posts. It's really a great place to stroll and enjoy nature."
Nice place with great view,"My second time to this place. A must see destination. Follow the instructions to get to this place. Would need to hike up 10-15 mins before you reach the entrance to buy the tram tickets. It is best to buy the tram tickets as it i quite tiring to climb the way up. There are many places to visit. The best place to go is the cliffs. you can walk on the cliffs and take lots of pictures or simply just chill there. Can be quite dangerous if you trip and fall, hence be careful. At the bottom of the cliff, you will see tentage near the bank of the ocean. They sell seafood but the price is very high. Other than that, expect to spend around half a day to explore the place. Definitely worth the time."
Nice Park & Lighthouse,"Taejongdae Park is along the southern tip of Yeongdo-gu coast. Entrance is free but if you opt for the train ride around the park it will cost you about KRW 2,000. It offers a beautiful view of the cliffs and the ocean.In the park you can find temples, food outlets, observatory and a lighthouse. Many statues dedicated to ocean going history can also be found here. There is also a dock where you can take a boat ride along the coastal waters to appreciate the view of the cliffs and lighthouse from the sea. The view from the lighthouse is amazing. This is also a good site for photography enthusiast. Also a good place to visit with the family. "
Another nature park,"This is another park among others in Busan, if you have seen others this could feel a little repetitive. Free to enter but it cost to take the park's train which round the area considerably frequent."
Nice Walk with Ocean Views,"If you enjoy walking and photography this is the spot for you. The walk takes about an hour at a leisurely pace. Benches are provided for your comfort. You are able to take a short ferry ride if you venture off the main road. If you are not inclined to walk, you can take a tour ""bus"". A nice way to spend an afternoon. Once finished there are nice little restaurants within walking distance."
Romantic ,I really liked this place even though I had a long day walking all around to find where to go but finally I arrived ‚ô° a lot of seoul ppl xD not many tourists which I really liked!! I went in winter so the weather was windy and so cold but I was fully prepared :D 
Mesmerized with the lighthouse during the night.,"Taejongdae is a scenic park along the coast. The park is not along the beach but on a cliff so what you see is a vista of the sea and rocky cliffs. You can take the Danubi train (2000 KRW) that goes around the park, which you can get off/on at any station and wait for the next train. But I love to walk so I skipped that. The road around the park is around 3.5km with a constant uphill for the first part, thus it's downhill afterwards. Aside from the constant vistas, there are also other attractions around the park like the pebble yards (beach), observation deck, interesting rock formations, lighthouse, memorial, and temples.I got there quite late at 4pm and thought my trip would be a waste since it got dark soon after (though the sunset was beautiful). But when I went down to see Yeongdo lighthouse, I was completely mesmerized with the effects of the light hitting the trees, cliffs, the sea. At 6pm on a winter night, there was no one else around, it was a bit creepy but the majestic silhouette of the cliffs and beautiful night seascape made me just sit there and enjoy the breeze. Of course the park would be so much nicer to experience during the day but I'm glad that I got to experience it during the night :)I travelled solo and I got there by riding bus no.101 and getting off at the last stop (Taejongdae). Entrance is free but riding the train isn't. I stayed for 3 hours despite it being dark, coz I love my me time ;)"
Beautiful...,"Loved the place, its nature and beauty of the sea. The walk is a killer with slopes but not to the locals who was briskly walking past. Took about 2 hours to each the lighthouse with side detours down a cliff to the sea. You should try walking to the end of the lighthouse and face the majestic awesomeness of the sea and its fantastic view!"
Spectacular view,The view over the ocean is spectacular. You have to walk down to a cliff near the lighthouse as it provides very interesting and nice background in pictures. The path to the cliff is windy but safe enough for a healthy person to walk there.
Tiring & freezing but worth it!,"Visit the park in Apr 15. Took a public bus to Taejondae Park at 6am. There is tram leaves every half an hour in the morning starts at 10am till 12 noon. It was a rainy day we didn't take the tram cos it was very early. The dramatic coastal cliffs, lighthouse & deep blue sea will take your breath away. It takes 2 hours to walk up and down the slopes the whole park is only 5 of us. Good exercise. Remember must have a proper and comfortable shoes. After the visit, went for a seafood steamboat at one of Korean restaurant near the bus stop before heading back into town."
Wear comfortably to walk comfortably,"Interesting place with lots of walking. Like the title suggests, wear comfortably to walk comfortably. You'll be thankful for it."
Awesome place,"I've been here about 5 times already and take all my friends who visit Busan here. You can either go by car or take a bus. I've only taken the bus from Jagalchi/Nampodong. You can take the bus #8 or #30 from there. It takes about 45 minutes. Once you get there, you can buy a ticket to ride the ""train"" (not an actual train, but a bus/truck pulling carts). They didn't have an order of boarding before, but now the tickets have numbers and people get in the line when their ticker number is displayed on the screen. You might have to wait about 3 rounds until your turn comes depending on the amount of people. If you get on the train, you will want to stop at the lighthouse (after the observatory). Take the stairs down to the lighthouse and keep heading down until you reach a building detached from the lighthouse. You want to turn right there and follow a trail to a cliff. This is the best area for pictures or just to chill and relax for a bit. It is needless to say that you should watch your step here. Once you are done taking your pictures and selfies, you have the option of going back to the entrance by ""train"" or by boat for 10,000 won (per person). If you want to take the train, I suggest that you walk back to the observatory and take the bus there as you will be skipping all the people that form the line at the lighthouse. If you take the boat, make sure it goes to the entrance of the park (if you parked there). I believe the last boat takes you to the port near the university (you can also take a bus back to Nampodong from here). Another way of going about this trip, which requires being able to speak a little bit of Korean, is buying the train ticket, coming out of the park and going through the parking lot (the one on the right when facing the park) and head towards the rocky beach. You will have to go through some food tents. Eventually, you will reach where they sell the boat tickets (same price here). The boat will make a stop at the bottom of the lighthouse, but people are told not to leave the boat assuming that you don't have a train ticket. If you tell them that it is ok (since you already bought the train ticket) you can be allowed to get off the boat, look around, and the take train back to the entrance once you are done. I know it is a handful of information, but it is a place that I quite like and hope the tips help you out!"
Beautiful coastal scenery,"Taejongdae is set in a national park with natural pine forest. The dramatic coastal cliffs, lighthouse & deep blue sea will take your breath away. Dress warmly in winter. There are well maintained paths down to the lighthouse & cliffs. Most tourists hop on the Danubi ""train"" & get down at the observatory to start their walk. After your visit, you can have a nice Korean meal near the bus stop before heading back into town."
Tiring but worth it,"Get to enjoy the nice scenery (cliff, beach, island, forests, rocks).. Actually, there's a small train providing shuttle service within the park , but it doesn't provide service on a rainy day. It takes 1-2 hours to walk up and down the slopes.. "
good place and very nice scenery,nice scenery and a lot of photo zones....not that crowded on weekday and you can take the tram to go up the hill
Worth the walk,Be prepared to walk for about 3 hours to enjoy the place on foot. Alternatively you could take the electric train/bus. We walked. A bit tiring but definitely doable. Scenery worth the effort.
Awesome View of Autumn Leaves,"Visited the park during the first week of December (which is already going into the winter months) and was surprise to still able to catch the last bit of the fall! The view of the yellow leaves along the trail was truly mesmerizing. You may choose to visit the park on foot or take the mini train/tram from the entrance (KRW2,000 hop on/off). Walking would be the best way to enjoy the park (slight slope on certain parts, but overall would be an easy walk). Be sure to visit Sinseon Rock after visiting Yeongdo Lighthouse (just follow the stairs below the lighthouse). The rock formation is amazing! You can easily spend 1/2 day in the park."
Wonderful ,We must used walking shoes because its streets uphill but we can used bus to the top. Sea view... good scenery... dont forget to bring a camera.. 
Taejongdae,"You could get to it by public bus, and once there you can either walk or buy a ticket for the bus at a very low price,and can get off and on any of the attractions along the way, they will tell you as they come to them and in English. It was worth going to, great view's and for taking photo's.Free to get into. Sorry forgot the bus No but ask at any info centre they are really helpful on anything you whant to know."
Taejongdae Cliff,we took the Busan City Bus so it was very easy for us to get there. We took the tram ride and hopped off and on several stops but the must stop point is the Taejongdae Cliffs. However be ready to walk down quite a bit of stairs before reaching the best photo taking point.
Feel the chilling wind of Busan Coastal Area.,"Overall a nice visit to Taejongdae. When you take the bus to last bus station or bus terminal, walk your way to the entrance and enter Taejongdae. There is sort of tram to bring you around... pretty cheap won$2000 per person. Keep the receipt as it allows you to drop-off and board back the tram. "
Beautiful!!!,"This is our 2nd visit to Taejongdae. With our Korail Pass, we went down to Busan from Seoul. At the Busan Station, you go out to exit 9 and front of the Kim-Bap Chunkook (small kim-bap franchise restaurant), take a bus 88A, 88B or 101 to last stop station which is Taejongdae (will take approx. 25 min). I really recommend to buy the tram ticket so you can on and off from the attraction point. This time we rode the ferry also to see the scenery from down to up of Taejongdae (It was okay for onetime experience but we like more scenery from up)."
Cool breeze at Taejongdae,"Going here, from busan station you need to take bus 88 or bus 101. After the busan station exit, turn Right. You need to take the underground bridge to take you to the other street. Turn left when you're at the underground. At the exit, you will immediately see a bus stop waiting area. Just wait for the said buses to stop then hop on ;)We arrived here on a Sunday. A lot of families were here, really crowded. But since it's really huge place to stroll to, you wont notice the crowd that much as you move around the place. Aside from the entrance ticket, we also avail the tram ride so we wont walk the whole time. The tram was really convenient for exit from the park.Make sure you wear the most comfortable shoes coz you will walk A lot. Really really a lot. And you will climb a lot of stairs too.I highly recommend this place. No. 1 in Busan"
Magnificent views ,"Honestly is a must checked in spots in Busan. Magnificent cliffs and views of the scenery. You can choose to walk as there are a few stops like temples, observation deck, light house and etc or you can pay and hop on the Danubi Train. "
A lot of walking,"if you enjoy hiking then you'll be fine. The scenery is what you'd expect from a rocky island. It's nice but it's not on the top of my list of things to do ever again. There's a small train that has a route around the island. You can walk down the ridiculously dangerous stone steps to catch a boat ride around the island. The water was very choppy that day but I'm told that, that was normal. If you have absolutely nothing to do in Busan, i.e. no tv reruns to watch online, and you don't mind all the walking, go for it. Don't get me wrong, the scenery was nice but...not THAT nice. If you've seen the ocean, you won't be too impressed."
Tiring,Is tired... alot of.staircase.Not suggest to senior people.View isn't that good. Better go in the morning
Went for a boat ride.,"Was on our to the Haeundae Beach, but with our limited time the taxi driver suggested that we go to this beach instead. We went on a boat ride, the view was fantastic, the kids enjoyed feeding the seagulls shrimp chips."
Splendid Sea View with nature's touch,"You can get here by taking a bus from Busan Station or Nampo Station to Taejongdae. I took a bus(Bus No. 66 or 88) from Nampo station, which takes around 15 minutes. Upon reaching here, you can get around Taejongdae by foot(with some serious walking) or take a tram. Tram is available at entrance with price of 2000 won. Of course the best part of taejongdae is the cliff area. Walk down hundreds of stairs and you can reach the cliff. Pretty magneficient view, so it worth a climb. There are some seaside tents selling seafood, probably worth a try for some raw seafood. Double thumbs up!!"
Beautiful Scenery,"My friends & I took bus no #101 and alight at last bus stop.There is no entrance fee to the park.There is a train (Danubi Train) which will takes you around the park. The fee for the train is KRW2,000 for adult.There is 5 stops. Basically, visitors can hop on & off the train at these 5 stops.But remember the waiting time could be long.You can always explore the park by foot.There were a lot of up & down hills along the way to the attractions.Tips: Wear comfortable shoes as there's quite a bit of walking."
Great Scenery!,Good views with plenty of walking to do if you do not want to wait for the tram ride. Might be better to walk as the wait for the tram can be pretty long. 
Nice Hike,"Actually i went to this park at April 2013.From Busan we took no. 88 from Nampo and it took around 20-30 minutes, Taejongdae was the last station. And then took danubi train with KRW2,000.With Danubi our first stop is Temple, but there is activities out there, so we move to observation deck and the lighthouse by walk. next stop are the shooting error site and down to the rocks for photo shoots. Taejondae it has beautiful sceneries."
Unforgettable Trip,"Last month i have a short trip to busan on Chuseok Holiday (Korea Mid Autumn Holiday)Me and my friend go to busan for 2 day 1 night. I go to Busan from Seoul with express bus, usually it only take 4 hours but because at that time is Chuseok Holiday we stuck in the traffic and spend 8 hours to get there. Tips for you guys : 1. Don't go there on Big holiday or long weekend if you don't want to stuck in the traffic.2. If you still want to go use KTX ( Korea fast train ) but more expensive.Ticket price using Express bus is depend on the bus type. The cheapest is General Bus 23.000 KWR one way. I use Excellent Bus type from Seoul To Busan price is 34.200 KRW one way. The different between these two bus is the facility, Excellent bus seat is bigger and have foot rest also there is usb plugs in every seat so you can charge your phone. The general type bus is only usual tourist bus and the seat is smaller.If you want to be more comfortable better you use Excellent bus, but if you a Backpacker General bus is just fine.2nd day in Busan i go to Taejongdae, if you want to see a beautiful scenery you must go here. You can capture many beautiful Photo here. Taejongdae is a National Park, it's look like a small mountain or hill that located in the side of ocean. We can see high seas from here. Taejongdae is really a big park with an uphill road, if you like hike you can walk but if you not do't be afraid they have shuttle bus ( Adult price is 2.000 - 5.000 KRW) i'm not remember. you can go to the lighthouse with shuttle bus it will took 5 minute. This place will be difficult for old people because there is many stairs. From the light house you can go down to a coral reef and took beautiful foot there. View from here is really beautiful.If you go to busan Taejongdae is one of the place you must visit!"
Nice scenery ,"Breath taking view from high up!Those we love photography would love this place.But you need to wait for the tram ride if you are too lazy to walk. (My advise, dress down, shoes) Be prepare to walk walk walk and walk. Trust me, I rather walk than wait for the tram."
Taejongdae in Pusan.,This is a very large park adjoinging the sea with beatiful cliffs. You can walk for more than two hours to look aroun it. Sunset is also beautifule there.
Breathtaking view but it comes with a price.,"Entrance is free but you might want to consider paying for the train ticket inside the park. A lot of locals actually come to this park to exercise daily, and always come prepared i.e with your umbrellas or raincoats cause the train won't be operating when its raining. Very beautiful view near the observatory tower. Wear a pair of good shoes as you will be walking a lot (if you are not planning to take the train). Cousin and I had to walk in the drizzling rain for 2 KM back to the entrance as the train stopped operating and we did not bring our raincoats along."
Nice View,"Love the view but train service can be improved. Train will not be in service if it's raining, which is very inconvenient for tourists. I walked 2km in the rain because train was not in service during rainy days even though i have paid for the tickets. "
Nice view,It was raining that morning so the trams were not running. We walked up to the top and saw a nice view of the ocean. 
Loved this,Located at the south end of yeongdo. Buses are available (Number 8 and 30 ) from biff to this place for 1300won one way.The park is about 5.2 km round trip Passenger train is available in the park for 2000 won. Nevertheless you could just walk along the path which demands more physical work.Check out the rocky beach. And of course enjoy the breeze there. It is so refreshing you dont feel like leaving.
Relax trip at taejongdae,"Well well, seriously, reminds me of jeju in a second, but this place is by its own with a few places to visit by tAking a paid tram that visits some temple, rocks, and lighthouse.. But the key idea is the relaxed mode we get at this place.. Worth a try.."
Taejongdae,"Taejongdae is one of the hop on hop off stops on the Busan city tour bus. It is rather scenic , but nothing spectacular to impress . It has some rock cliffs and some recreational fascilities for families to enjoy. It has been said that this place was the place where King Taejong fr the Silla dynasty , would often come for his archery practices. Pay 15000 won (US$15 ) for a day ticket to enjoy this and other places."
Good Beach,"Taejondae is one of the landmark of Busan. You can't miss this place if you decide to come to Busan. But you have to walk a little bit, good news for hiking lover like me."
Taejongdae trip,Very interesting trip we took train and bus 88 to reach the destination it is beautiful coastal line the nature wonder .need alot of energy to get there..ineteresting must not miss to be there when come to Busan.
Broad sea view. Perfect skyline.,Broad sea view. Perfect skyline. Need some walking even with little vehicle for travellers from point to point. 
Great coastal views,"The walk had fantastic views of the coast with waves hitting the rocks and small islets in the far horizon.The wind was extremely gusty, threatening to blow my cap away. As I looked down from where I was, I spotted 2 brave souls all the way down at the bottom of the cliff, standing right next to the ocean with its rippling waves. Apparently, there are dinosaur tracks down there.The observatory had a photo exhibition by Choi Ji Woo, a Korean actress from Busan. She‚Äôs the one who was always crying in Stairway to Heaven, a famous k-drama. You can also look out for a small islet shaped like a teapot from the observatory, aptly named Teapot Island."
The highlight of the Taejongdae tour,I love it here. It is so beautiful. This is the thing that satisfied my wanderlust. I would love to go here again. Its big and fun to explore here.
Nice stroll expecially for families,"Taejongdae is a pretty peninsula turned into a park featuring a paved walk and some extra off track options. The paved walk can be quite crowded as families enjoy spending the afternoon there. A wheeled train also runs on the same walk, making things a little confused. A lighthouse and Taejongdae landmark (see picture above) are worth visiting for the views and the breeze. Try to avoid weekends."
Taejongdae woohoo!!,"Coming to Taejongdae was a good choice. Be prepared to walk and walk, especially going down to the clifts but you will be rewarded by a great view and fantastic wind. Advisable to take the bus up instead of walking. From Busan Station, take Bus 88 or 101 and get off at Taejongdae"
"Beach, Rock, Lighthouse","This place is quite nice; I like the view of its scenery, soothing and breathtaking. sadly I went there when there was thick fog ,limiting our visibility. The wind here was very strong, do not open your umbrella, my friend break his while playing with it.there is a bus service for just 2000 W and you can use it as many as you like."
Nice place to waste time on a weekend,"The place was good for a weekend laze. Great rock formations riddled with fossils. Nice ocean view and fresh air. Japan's Tsushima Island can be seen from afar on a lucky day. Truck train is available if you're lazy to walk around. There are temples and several interesting sites on the island. Check them all out ;)This place is also great for jogging and running. The island offers paved road and scenic view.Taejongdae is accessible from Busan Center via bus from Nampodong. If you're in Busan, this place is a must see."
A must do ,The walk there is the best view you can get of the city. It's a must you don't have to do the 4.2 km walk just do the third if you don't feel like walking it's enough. Amazing path whit suspended Briges and compress air station to clean your shoes 
Beautiful scenary that you can't miss.,"It was a long weekend... There were so many people visiting Taejondae. Even though there is a shuttle bus service with ticket purchase, we couldn't wait an hour to reserve the seats. My friend ad I decided to walk up the mountain, and it was a a bit tough, but a good walk! And we took the boat tour on our way back. It was a great choice to walk up and take the boat. We saw a lot more!"
Beautiful!,"I love taejongdae! Beautiful walking, gorgeous cliffs, and plenty of little stops along the way. The overlook is beautiful and offers free wifi which is a great check in point for tourist without cell phones, and the lighthouse is incredible. I loved the boat you can take for ten thousand won - takes you along the cliffs and it's breathtaking. "
Overrated. ,"We actually found it a total waste of time. Walked in, bought tickets, waited like 30mins for those tourist trolley trams to bring us in. When we arrived, it's just a viewing deck to look out into the sea (Busan has fantastic sea view from every angle anyway) ....Spent an even longer time waiting for trams to bring us out of the park (too many tourist, too few things to see). Basically a ""touch n go"". Dun think I even bothered to take much pics there either. "
TAEJONGDAE CLIFF WALK,"I was literally exhausted after doing this walk, but it was so worth it. The view was stunning and my pictures came about amazing. While it was beautiful, its one of those things I would do once, way to strenuous hahahhha. there was a line for a trolley type thing to take you to the top of the hill, but that line was really really long"
"Wonderful,windy","We love here so much,it really a wonderful and nice scenery place.We reach here late evening,therefore we can't finish the park.Kids like the place too,it is cool in November therefore they willing to walk although it has so many step to go.Must pay a visit here if you love nature."
A nice park to visit,"Nice park to visit in a cool weather but took the train instead of walking to the Lighthouse.We went down to the bottom on the cliff and there were women selling fresh seafood caught by divers from the sea.Enjoyed our fresh sea cucumber and sole fish sashimi at W30,000 per dish. It was an experience eating in tents by the sea. Thereafter, we proceeded to the pebble beach to have some fun time by the sea.A place to visit while in Busan."
A foggy day but still a nice pary,"We enjoyed taking walks in this large park and touristic destination. The views, even in the fog, were significant and the sound of the surf was very nice. One can see why the emperors enjoyed the summer seasons here. WARNING, however. The place has got to be crowded on regular summer Saturdays, because there were almost too many people for us on a rainy and foggy day. Get there early and get out quick. "
nice view with fresh scenery,"I go there with my kids, experiencing the fresh smell of natural environment created by GOD, So awesome! You can ride a bus to strolling the whole island just only 20000 won the fare......"
excellent place,I was there and amazed wonderfyl pleace I walk around I visited temples and I saw ligth house one of my high ligth of busan
Nice place to watch Koreans visiting a national park,"Not what you expect when you go to a National Park. You are always on crowded streets.But it is nice, nice views, temples, trees.And it's fun to watch the locals to enjoy an afternoon in the ""nature""."
Quite a nice walk with some interesting area to explore~,"It's quite a nice place! There's an option to take a tram that will stop at different important stops (which we didn't cuz there's a looooong queue) or just.. walk.Hmm.. a full round takes about 1.5 to 2hrs walk if i'm not wrong.We didn't want to queue and since we still have some time, we decided to trek!Quite a nice walk with some interesting area to explore~If you have the time and don't mind walking, do the walk!Full review: http://wanderer.summeree.com/travel/korea/busan/taejongdae/"
Great park,"We took line 1 to Busanjin, exit 1, then walked down the road to the bus stop and took bus number 88 / 101 to Taejongdae, the last stop. The park is full of tall trees and plants giving it a green, cooling environment. Follow the information on the photographed signboard that I have posted. You do not really need to ride Danubi train to get round the park. You need a cap / hat/umbrella and drinking water. You walk for about 3 or 4 hundred metres, then you stop to look at the designated attractions. You just do not feel tired, as you walk, stop, visit, satisfied, happy and continue your walk to the next spot. Our first stop was Pebble Beach. Climb down the staircase and walk among the pebbles to get to the water. You can see the sea. Nice view and good photo shots. Next is Gumyeongsa Temple. We stopped to pay respects to the Buddha. Continue walking and you come to South Port Observation Point where we were supposed to spot the many islands but we could not as it was rather misty. The next spot is where the filming of the popular k drama took place, Jiwoo Love Story In Busan. Many fans were taking photos with the main actress's photo at the exhibition gallery upstairs. Finally you will reach the highlight of the park, the Lighthouse. There are many photo taking spots and do remember to go all the way down to view Sinseon and Mangbuseok rocks. Of course you must go up the lighthouse and witness the great view from high up there. Our final stop is Taejongsa Temple. Altogether the round trip took us 4 hours. We proceeded to the crowded restaurants just outside the park to have our lunch. Please go early as it is cooler and less crowded. If you need to be motivated, there are food kiosks along the way, to get coffee / tea / ice cream or some snacks."
A worthy stop from hop on hop off Busan bus,This was a stop on the hop on hop off your that is worth getting off for. Park is free to enter. We decided to walk the loop around which took about 2 hours and it's quite hilly. You do have an option to get the tram type thing which probably is the best option. The walk is fine and we had a beautiful sunny day but would say views aren't that amazing that they merit a 2 hour walk! We stopped at one temple on the park and it was one of the worst I have seen- it even had a satellite dish of the side. Ha ha
Cool views,This is a very nice place to walk around with some beautiful views. Or you can take the train and get off at a stop then take it again to the next stop to see the lighthouse or the temple for exemple.
Beautiful Park!,"It's a great place to visit. Especially if you are looking to get a good walk and enjoy the nature, this is the place. Yes, it is crowded on weekends but still worth a visit. If you are lucky, you may even get a glimpse of Japan as well!"
Good for walks and great views,"Nice park where you can walk amongst the trees and see the ocean. There is a tram service that will take you around the place to see the highlights. To walk the entire route, you will need more than 2 hours. "
Busan best,I will rate this highly as the view from and around the lighthouse area are spectacular. You need at least 5 to 6 hours just to slowly walk to the lighthouse entrance area. Otherwise use the tram service. There are more nice areas around this park but you need at least 2 days to explore other areas beside the lighthouse
Windy,"this place is so windy especially at certain areas so be prepared! it nearly blew us off our feet and im not kidding! besides that the place is really nice to go around, super big so i suggest to get the tour train bus thing and stop here and there if you have time. Really interesting place, great scenery and love the wind even if it nearly blew us away :)"
good place to walk around,If the weather is nice. You can choice to walk a circle for 4.3km in stead of take tour train. The walk path maintains very well. 
Beautiful,"All uphill, but what a view when you get there! Gorgeous flowering trees all along the paths. When you reach the top, your view of the ocean, cliffs ands islands is worth the trek!"
Large Park Ocean view,"seems like a Large Botanic Garden, Quite a distance away. Some Taxi drivers may charge extra for the Toll for the two massive bridges on the way. Largely concrete amidst thick forest which is manicured & well maintained. Since on the ocean bank, makes for beautiful photo snaps. Significant up & downs allows for good exercise. For the infirm, there are trains for pick up & drop off. Park allows for two pebble beaches but water is cold. There is also a trekking route along the ocean & mountains which is invigorating.Several restaurants inside too. There is also a ferry terminal within the park. Size of park is huge & in early hours you can identify several birds. "
Too windy for a comfortable stroll,"When I went there it was far too windy while we waited for the tram. When on the tram, its comfortable but you dont get to see much from there; so you need to get off at various spots. We went up to the light house, but realized that its not the traditional one, just a modern light house - so nothing exciting. "
beautiful,"Beautiful. It reminded me of La jolla cove and Big sur in California. If you want to use a tram, you have to pay and get a number first. Wait until your number (time) comes up to get on their tram. You want to sit on right side because ocean view will be on your right. If you decided to get off you may have to wait long to get back on tram because it's really packed. We just stayed on tram until the end and that was good enough unless you want to hike. You can take local bus to entrance of taejongdae. Since everything is in korean it's very challenging however you can have your own seat and open the window for nice view instead of fighting to sit upstairs for double decker city tour bus."
Amazing views of the ocean! A must visit place on your itinerary,"If you enjoy scenic views, make this a must-go place on your trip to Busan.Although there are no direct MRT trains to Taejongdae, you can take bus 109 from Busan Station and alight at the last stop (Taejongdae). Another alternative is bus 30 from Nampodong.Situated on the southern most tip of Busan, Taejongdae offers fantastic views of the ocean and the surrounding islands. There is an internal shuttle within the vicinity that visitors can use and get off at different stops within Taejongdae Park.The area is not very crowded and there are lots of food options outside the park. Within the park, there are only 2 choices.Recommended to spend at least half a day here."
Taejongdae Park,"I was here recently in March 2015. The air was so clear and I really recommend those who wanted to chill and relax with nice scenery and sea view to stop by for awhile to enjoy this beautiful location. Enjoy! Make sure to take a lot of pictures!!If you want to travel to other places in one day as what we did, do consider taking cute Danubi Trem. It'll help you cover Taejongdae Park in a blink *literally*."
Beautiful,I went here at sunset in December and the view was spectacular. It will take a few hours to see the whole park. Well organised but very busy as it is a popular destination.
Amazing view,"It was a bit hard to find this place. I took the tram to the observation deck and the lighthouse. At the bottom of the lighthouse, I found out that I could take a ferry back, so I did. It was well worth it! It was fun feeding the seagulls shrimp crakers from the boat."
A must visit!,"Another hot spot to visit when travel to Busan. Just spare few hours to visit Taejongdae, it will be a different experience. Advised to take the shuttle provided in Taejongdae because it will be tiring just depends on walking."
Pleasant seaside walk near downtown,"Visited In winter so not too crowded. The walk is relaxing and there is a lighthouse, some interesting rocks you can walk on, and a couple of small temples to see. Not a must see attraction but if you are in Busan for a few days, it is a good place to walk when the weather is nice."
LOVE IT!,"Went here during winter and take the ferry ride.This is the highlight of my week in South Korea. The place has a romantic feeling, good for honeymooners. The view is spectacular....really enjoy and will definitely come here again."
Nice hike! ,Take the time to visit this location!! The trails are ready to walk and the stairs to the lighthouse and rock below are ready to navigate. Scenery is breathtaking at points. 
Beautiful,"We took bus No.30 right in front of the Tourist Information Center (Nampo-dong Subway Exit 2). The fare is KRW1500 and the bus stops at the last stop at Taejongdae. There's no entrance fee but you can take the slow train (KRW2000/person) to go around Taejongdae. There are 4 stops in total. Or you can opt to walk. We took the slow train and it's a beautiful rock landscape all along the way. On a clear day, apparently you are able to see a Japanese island from the observatory. We were very fortunate to see filming of SBS ""Pinocchio"" on the flat big rock, near the lighthouse. The crews allowed us to venture in the filming set on the rock. Very relaxing place away from busy Busan city. High recommended."
Classic K-drama scene,"Took a bus from Nampo station, followed the crowd into the park. No way you will get lost because of the huge crowd. Be there early if you plan to cover everything, we spent around 4 hours for the entire park by foot. Unforgettable sea view! But you have to pay the price by walking alot! It's all worth it! Bring your own food or snacks before entering the park. The prices of the food sold in the convenience park located in the park are rocket high and it's simply not worth dining in. There is a restaurant outside the taejongdae which sells grilled fish set meal. It's simply divine! Go check it out! It's on the right side from the way to Taejongdae."
"Super view,worth the trip","Offered superb views, and being a popular tourist location, best to go early. A stiff up slope before reaching the ticket booth, so take note! I strongly recommend a visit to this place if you have a good 3-4hrs to spend ."
Nice Walk,"The reason why we decided to visit Busan partly because of Taejongdae. As I heard lots of good views and I don't want to miss it too.To visit this place it will be good to join the Busan City Tour. My advise alight at this place first, good to walk around in the morning. You will need 2 hours to walk around the whole area. If you are those touch and go may be you will spend lesser time. You can also take the tram ride if there is no rain, for us due to the wet weather we were not able to do so.Indeed it was a nice walk, windy and cold. You can enjoy the nature. If the weather is clear and sunny you will have a nicer view. "
"Great view near the sea, but average otherwise","Quite a far place to visit in Busan, as you can't access Taejongdae with metro. We took no. 88 from Nampo and it took around 20-30 minutes, Taejongdae was the last station (should be the case for most buses going near there) so I didn't have to worry about getting off.Unless you are having a long trip in Busan and planning for a whole day at Taejongdae, you should buy a ticket for the mini-train there, just walk up the hill after entrance and you will reach the mini-train station and ticket office. Otherwise entrance of Taejongdae is free.When I visited Taejongdae, most people shared the mini-train with me are Koreans, and they usually only get off at the observatory station and the light-tower station, which are probably the points worth visiting without taking the ship to the island out in the middle of the sea (you can see it from both stations mentioned above). In my opinion, the observatory is bit boring, if you are on a tight schedule, only get off at the light-tower station.At the light-tower, you can walk all the way from the station (which is on mid-level of the island) to the bottom. There are great photo-taking points on the rocks near the sea, but you should expect a steep stair walking up and down, it will be tough even if you do sports regularly. I didn't notice any elevator either."
Scenery and exercise,"A beautiful coastal area that offers a view of forest, cliffs, sea, cultural statues and a small temple. No longer accessible by private car, you can ride the circuit by tram, walk, or take a boat around the periphery. Many people take the tram to the viewpoint so they can linger and walk the rest of the way. A lot of the walk is uphill and can be tiring to the out of shape, but is well worth it. Also, stop to spend a few minutes at the small temple which is surrounded by hydrangeas during the season."
Nice park but there are even nicer ones.,"Directions: bus 8, 88 or 30 from exit 6 of nampo station. Take till the last stop.Easy walking on paved path, with some up and down slopes.Scenery is nice with great views of the ocean. For people who like to hike, try igidae coastal walk. We think igidae is better."
Take the boat !,"When you get off from the bus, some people will try to sell you a boat tour of Taejongdae. Actually, at 10,000 won per person, it is worth it. It takes about 35 minutes and you get great views of the cliffs and of the sea. Much better than walking / riding the bus."
Beautiful and meaningful site. ,"Beautiful and meaningful site. There is legendary story of King Taejong of Unified Shilla dynasty. Rocky beach scenery is really beautiful and light house also beautiful. There is pebble beach, it is also beautiful. "
A Gem in Busan,"My friends and I unfortunately only had about 1.5 hours to spend in Taejongdae, and there was plenty to do to spend a half day there walking around. There is a train that you can take to all the sights, costs 2,000won, but be warned the wait can be over an hour just to board! We decided to walk to pebble beach and a bit further if we still had time. Doing so we discovered a ferry that departs from Pebble Beach, and it was awesome. The ferry costs 10,000won, and takes about 30 minutes. It takes you along the coast of Taejongdae then returns. It was a great option as we got to see the observatory from the ocean, and got the same view of the ocean the observatory would of provided from the shore. I highly recommend."
Park by the sea,"You can either hike around the hilly park or took the Danubi train (fee: KWN 2000) to circuit around the park. If you are travelling with kids & elderly, best to pay the small fee for the train. Beautiful sea view from the lighthouse and manage to stand at the edge of the rocky cliffs to hear the wave. At the Taewon Pebble Beach, you can hear the rocks hitting against each other- soothing to listen to the sea. From the Observation Platform you can view some islands in the distance including the Daema Island in Japan if the weather permitting."
Danubi Train is really the better option,"Don't bother walking if you are not prepared for a good cardio exercise. For KRW2000, you get to enjoy a hop on and hop off Danubi train ride around the park. Best time to visit is around 4-6pm to catch sunset (during autumn). From the park's entrance to the Danubi Train's waiting platform, a good 10 minutes walk uphill. Choi Jiwoo's Love Story in Busan photo gallery is at the observatory's third floor. "
Best Place to See Shinsun Rocks,"Out of all the most touristic spots in Busan, this park and rock beach is one of my favorites. There are special types of rocks called ""Shinsun Rock"", that are created by waves that continuously erode them. Go check them out, on a clear day this place is absolutely wonderful."
Born free at Taejongdae,"This place is WOW! Well....after a long bus ride and a walk lol I took the bus on the opposite side of of Nampodong Lotte Mall and luckily we got a seat because Taejongdae is the last station and it was a ride up and down the hill. Make sure to sit on the left side of the bus to fully enjoy the view. After reaching the station, it's quite a walk uphill to the danubi train station. Not good for elder people who are not used to walking. I was out of breath myself. There are 5 stops for the train and it's hop on/off so you can get off at #1 station, enjoy yourself and wait for the next train to get to the #2. Take note that you can't come back to #1 station by train if you've already passed it cuz it's a one-way road, but yes, you can walk. The most interesting stop is #3 (observation deck) & #4 (light house). You can't miss these two stops :) Standing on the observation deck, take a deep breath and enjoy your freedom of mind. The view is magical."
Good activity if you're looking something relaxing to do...,Not really a WOW experience as I've dine s lot of bush walks around the world but it serves it's purpose as a nice and relaxing trip. The tram is not really Recommended unless your physical abilities are limited (eg travelling with young children)...
Natural beauty of Busan,"We took the Busan City Tour to Taejongdae. It is an hop on/off loop tour for 15,000 KRW per adult. Be prepared to spend half a day in Taejongdae for nature walk and fantastic coastal view of Busan. Taejongdae is actually a peninsular northeast of Busan centre. Walking passed the arch uphill to the ticketing office, we can purchase tickets to take a loop ride. Otherwise, a walk of nearly 2 km should be good physical exercise for the fit and young. Other than the well maintained forest, there are a few sites such as Taejongdae Observatory, , the Light House offer exciting coastal landscapes of vertical cliffs. In good weather, Japanese island could also be sighted. Taejongdae is a popular nature park for Korean family outing."
Lovely Place & Amazing View,"I didn't know how to get to Taejongdae so I took the Busan Hop On/Off Bus. It's amazing that most of the people in the bus were Koreans themselves. It's a very big park so if you arrive much earlier, you get to walk a bit and take the danubi train, if you get tired. (You need to pay for the ride though).I loved that ride around, although I wish I had arrived earlier. I couldn't get on and off the Danubi train easily as there was a pregnant woman sitting near the exit door and I felt bad getting her to move about."
Amazing Scenery,A bit far but its worth to visit! Beautiful scenery & cliff. We spend more than 3 hours to explore this place. Words can't describe how amazing this place it. 
Beautiful scenery,"We paid 2000 won to take the Danubi train for adult fare and 1500 won for youth fare to go round the various sight-seeing site. Those who are very fit, can just do the walking. The first round we were too tired to get down at the Observation Deck but the counter staff was kind enough to let us take a second trip of the Danubi train to go round. This time, we were full of energy to walk around the Observation Deck, the lighthouse, the shooting error site and down to the rocks for photo shoots. We were there on a Monday, we saw the tents but no ""Ajumma"" could be seen. Anyway, it has beautiful sceneries."
Beautiful Taejongdae,"We really enjoyed our visit to the park at Taejongdae. The views are spectacular. The tram is an easy way to see all the points of interest. We also took the harbor tour. The water was extremely rough the day we were there, but it was a great way to see the views from both perspectives, high altitude and sea level. I would recommend if you are in Busan."
Ocean view is good,Perfect place to see the ocean and take pictures and videos. We could see the ocean from a big mountain. The place is clean and safe.
amazing views,"There's a tram you can take around with multiple stops but if you are there to hike, it's not necessary. The views are striking."
A must see in Busan,I would put this tourist spot to be in my number one list. A breath-taking view of the ocean and its wonderful cliffs. The lighthouse and its surroundings are spectacular. Just be ready with your most comfortable footwear as there is much walking required plus hundred of steps to take. But its all worth it! Try going early in the morning from 7:00 - 10:00 when the sun is not so hot -- or take the best view of the sunset from 3:00pm to 6:00pm. 
worth going,I love this place very much. I walked uphill along the coast and went to the observatory and saw many special rocks. I walked through a forest downhill. Relaxing and enjoyable. 
a picnic location,a nice place to spend the day with the family. there is a mioni train which takes you all over with various stops. it has a great view point which should never be missed. MUST DO WHEN IN BUSAN
Nice views,"Nice walk around the headland with a few opportunities to see the good views. The walk took about 2.5 hours allowing for short stops to appreciate the views. Lots of beautiful big trees for shade along the way.There is a tran that you can use if you don't want to walk, it will stop at the viewing areas.You can see the Asian haze unfortunately."
Pleasant walk with a view,"I really enjoyed the vantage points on this walk. It is a very leisurely walk, not difficult to do. I've been here with just one other person, and also with a large group. I'd say the walks along the Busan coast are some of the best attractions."
Not a must.. but still a good choice to visit,"This park needs a subway + bus ride to get there. Do take a pamphlet at the entrance, as it will show you the spots to look for in this tour (you can choose by train or on foot). From entrance, you need to walk a slightly slantly slope path, about 8 minutes, to the ticket office (you cant get the tour guide copy here) to buy train ticket, and you can use it as many times on and off the train during that day. The train departs every 30 minutes and the quequeing sometimes might keep you wait up for an hour or so in order to be on board. In that case, we suggest you to walk instead for the sigh seeing spots are about 5 to 10 to 15 mins walking distance apart.Beware, the staff are not very helpful and English in here is no use. We intended to go to the final spot, get off and trail our way through all the sightseeing places back to the starting point, we got misled and missed the final spot to get off, so we had to ride the train back to the terminal, the staff asked us to line up again in the queque which we would have wasted another hour again, so we decided to walk instead. Anyway, it was not an unpleasant incident as we peradigm shift it to a blessing in disguise... i.e. we enjoyed the walk, the sun, the trees, the scenary, the ocean view, chatting and sweating.... so this is my fond memory of Taejongdae."
Another Nice Busan Park,"Taejongdae is another one of several nice Busan parks. The highlight of the park is the lighthouse and ""museum."" When we were there, several of the interactive displays were down for maintenance so there wasn't much information available. We did enjoy climbing to the top of the lighthouse. It was a little chilly the day we visited so we didn't have to fight with too many other visitors. I would certainly concur with other reviews, it is quite windy at the lighthouse to plan appropriately."
Another Korean creativity to invite tourists,"For us who come from Indonesia, the beach view is nothing special, except the rocks. Taejong dae has the light house and the path available to reach it. For us it is not special."
Beautiful sight,"We got there pretty late in the afternoon at about 5pm. The good thing is there are very much lesser people. As we are fighting to get pictures with the remaining daylight, we decided to take the Danubi Train. It cost about 1500won per pax.The ride was pretty fast. We stopped at the observatory and in front of us, the vast ocean was presented. An awesome sight to behold. We left the observatory and walked about 5mins to the lighthouse and cliff. Loved the sculpture, iconic of the park. Great to view it from different angles. You can take a walk down the cliff. Due to time constraint, we did not walk down. The view of the cliff is beautiful. If you are planning to take the Danubi Train back to the entrance close to the end of operating hours, please give ample time provision. Train interval seems to be a bit longer towards the end of the day and not all passengers may be able to get on the train if there are enough passengers on board from previous stops. It is a very interesting place to visit though. Maybe a few hours will be good, there will be more time to explore the beautiful park."
Is Windy But Cool Scenery!,"Is really windy up there. I will suggest ladies do not wear skirts and high heel to go this place, you might regret. Make sure you walk down to the cliff, is super duper cool!!!! I love it the most!To get to taejongdae, i would suggest you to take the day tour from busan station. Choose the route you want and just hop on and off to visit the places around Busan!"
Worth the trip,Takes a little while to get to on the bus if you are using public transport but relatively straight forward. When you get there you can queue to get a ticket for the tourist fun bus or if you are feeling energetic can walk. We did one lap on the bus realized that to walk it was probably better. Great sights and interesting little areas along the way. If you get the chance to go towards the end if the day the sunset and views around that time are beautiful and very romantic. Also very good coffee a few hundred yards from the exit. 
Lovely Mountain and Sea,"The park is huge and so it's advisable to spare plenty of time if you want to see the most out of this place. If you're coming from Busan Station, cross the main road at front then take Bus88. This bus will terminate at the foot of Taejongdae Park so you don't need to worry even if you can't speak and read Korean. From there, start hiking for around 5-10 minutes to reach the starting point of the park. You may want to take the Danubi Train for 1500Won to save some of your energy and time from going to different attractions around the park. They are providing brochure at the ticket counter and it will guide you where to drop off first and spend most of your time. For me it's the observation tower for the lovely view of an open sea and rocky cliff on the sides. going back, you'll see a bus terminal garage at the foot of the park. Just wait for the same bus (buss88) to take you back to Busan Station or hop off when you see a subway entrance along the way to visit Jagalchi Market."
Worth a visit,"One of the more popular tourist attractions in Busan and I must say that the scenery at the cliff and lighthouse is quite worth the visit.To get around the park, you will need to either walk (which is quite a distance if you have kids or elderly folks) or take its Danubi train. But be prepared for quite a long queue for the train especially during the weekends.But once you reach the lighthouse and cliff, the view can be quite spectacular on a good clear day and it will be worth it. But be prepared to walk (again!) to the cliff. The challenge is not walking down the cliff, but the climb back up!"
a lot of walking but a breather from the big city,"One of the main attractions of this place is the cliff and the lighthouse, which is a must see if you're in the park. But, mind you, if you have seen the Grand Canyon or anything that is close to such a scenery, then this may not strike your interest at all. To me, nature is still beautiful and it's worth walking around the area if you have time around Busan to make a trip there =) Just a reminder, there's a lot of slopes and you WILL need to walk a lot, so maybe high heels isn't the best choice ;) (there are still people who went there with high heels anyway so maybe you'll survive with it too if you choose to match it with your dress)"
The wonders of creation!!,"Gorgeous! Do climb down to the cliffs area even though the climb up will be tiring, it is totally worth it! "
The strength of Nature,"What to say more than words, have a visit then you know what I am trying to say with my tittle.You can choose to take tram for visit this place or like me, hiking for this place until I fully exhausted...especially when I want to go down to Simseon Rock, the wind is so strong!! But it worth to visit!! LOVE in Korea <3"
Fantabulous seafood ,"To save on time and also hassle, I took a taxi from gamcheon village and got there for about ‚Ç©10k. This is definitely worth it after r li read about long stand on the bus. Once I got off at the roundabout, I walked down the slope behind the restrooms. I was led to the shoreline of tents in which ahjumas will whip up a sumptuous seafood meal for you. However, do take note of major communication breakdown. They do not speak English. I walked along the tents until a kind auntie reached out to me and I just went in. I guess the fare is kinda standard. Any 3 kinds of live seafood from the tank for ‚Ç©30k with mussel soup. The auntie will ask you how you want your food to be done and you just point and hope for the best. My food came, all sashimi style and of course I tried the live octopus. Do go and take pictures and video of how it is prepared. I couldn't finish my food but the thought of an octopus died because of me, helped force everything down. This to me was the highlight of my trip there. Take the tram to observation deck then walk down 150m to the light house. If you want to get on the tram down to entrance, walk back to the observation deck else you will have to wait quite a while for empty seat "
A lot larger than expected,"Use the trolley! The walk will take a few hours total. You do not want to go to Busan and miss this area, you will regret it. There are buses from most areas in Busan (like the KTX station) that go here..."
The clam tents are magical,"We went to Taejongdae purely to eat in the clam tents along the coast. It was difficult to get there, especially because it was a holiday weekend and all of the buses were completely packed. At first we tried to get on a bus by Busan station but we literally couldn't get on one because they were so full. We knew about the clam tents in the first place thanks to the website busanawesome.com. They were a great planning resource, and they have directions to the clam tents from a few different locations.http://cityawesome.com/busan1/2011/04/taejongdae-clam-tents-yeongdo-island-2/We ended up going to the Jagalchi market via the subway, getting out at exit 10, and taking bus 8 (which says taejongdae on it, because it is the end of the line). The bus was absolutely packed, standing room only, and the traffic was terrible (construction, lane closure) and I was starting to feel terrible that I roped my group into doing this particular excursion, but trust me, it was completely worth it.The bus ride took about an hour total. We were let off in a gas station parking lot, and we just followed the crowd to the end of the road to what was clearly the entrance to a big park (hiking park). Once we got to the park entrance, we took a right and walked down what looked like a sketchy driveway, until we got to the shore. Down there, tent after tent was lined up, with ajumma's standing outside, barking for us to come in.We chose a tent and the ajumma pointed to a menu in Hangul. We just motioned and nodded and chose the 75,000 won option. We were first brought a hot, steaming bowl of muscles in broth, and a plate of fresh carrots and cucumbers. Then came an enormous platter of scallops with diced onion, carrot and jalapeno on them, along with another platter with some scallops seasoned with gochujang, four large prawns, clams, and two tins with seafood mixed with onions and gochujang in them. Out came the charcoal grill, and, we sat, and grilled, and drank, and ate, some of the freshest, most delicious seafood I've ever had, all while sitting in the shade and looking over the ocean. Also, we were the only discernible tourists there. This is not a touristy experience at all (the park above, however, appeared to be). If you love food, and want to do something that is off the beaten path, this is a do not miss experience."
Taejongdae,There is picturesque sights of cliff by the sea. Usually it's windy. There is train service along the road.
Beautiful Park- but take correct bus,Wear hiking shoes as has a lot of steep terrain and stairs. Very crowded on weekends.Easy to get to by bus from Busan station. Take the 88 or 101. Do not take the 88.1 bus! Trust me!
"If you've got a free day, it's totally worth it! Beautiful hike.","I love taejongdae. If the weather is great and you've got some time to spare, it's a great place to go. Make sure you allow enough time to really explore, don't make dinner plans- it's a must to sip some soju and eat truly awesome seafood on the water in a clam tent! The ajjumas will take great care of you after your day of walking and snapping tons of photos. Make sure you don't miss the temple in the early fall I believe, when the purple and pink hydrangeas are going wild. And don't take the train!!"
Tiring but amazing!,"Bit far from the town. We took a bus no. 88 (you may take bus no. 101 too if I'm not mistaken) from Busan station to Taejongdae and it's really tiring as we have to stand most of the time (please take Busan bus tour for KRW10000 only as it covers other attraction too). Bus fare for adult is KRW1300 from Busan station and fares are different for teenager & kid. It takes about an hour from Busan station to Taejongdae, depends on traffic. There's no entrance fee for Taejongdae, however you need to pay about KRW1500 (adult) for Danubi circular train (it went around Taejongdae area so I totally recommends it as you can save time and energy from walking). Danubi stops at several points so you can hop off and hop in on next Danubi. You can take a boat too, which may costs about KRW10000. The viewing point I think worth stopping by is at Observation Deck & Lighthouse. The view is simply gorgeous!"
Sea side cliff always make good attraction,"It is children's day in Korea today and u guess it right, bus loads, ferry loads of them from the top and from below at the edge, all trying to reach this stone table ' the great ancestor table top'. The crowd is overwhelming, tour buses clogged up the access, some alighted kilometers ahead of the entrance and later find out they have to hike kilometers to the attraction. Forget about the tramp ride even if u get a ticket it may be hours before u get a seat. But anyway thanks to the crowd too, without them i can imagine this is a quiet and lonely place. Take bus no.88 from Nampo area, there are other buses too from Jagalchi side and ride all the way to the last stop, it is an island and Taejongdae is at the back of it. The view at the cliff is breathtaking u can see the earth curvature but can't see the landmass of Japan, if u stand high enough at certain spot u actually witness the full 270 degree curvature of the sea sky connection. I think the disputed island of Korea Japan is nearby but i can't see it. Like many other attractions in Busan u need a good pair of legs, it is walk and walk and more walking not to mention it is always going up a hill. It is the view from the cliff and the view below your feet that makes this place interesting, u have this feeling that u are at the edge of the world and is about to fall into the sea. Coming back to the mainland, crowd at the bus stand is chaotic, just go hop on any bus, everyone is leaving the island, doesn't matter which way it goes, once the bus cross the bridge just hop off. Some are leaving via ferry, it's like an grand exodus, all that just for that lonely rocky outcrop by the sea. For this place i think i only need to visit once, but i will be surprise if i find out the crowd i was with were local Busan people, there really isn't nothing much to be excited about this place."
Beautiful place!,A must go place if you are ever in Busan! Nice scenery of the oceans and rocks in one scene. Prepare to do a lot of walking and climbing to reach the prettiest places tho. Pebble beach is a recommended spot other than the light house! Best to allocate the whole morning to walk the whole resort park! Its is worth it! Fee for the tram ride. (1500won)
Light House and the rocks,"Firstly, how to go there?Take the Metro to Nampo Station. Exit 6, walk towards the bridge just in front of Lottee Dept Store. There is a bus stop. Check the bus numbers at the second stop sign board, you will see that there are many buses end their services at Taejongdae. 8, 13, 30, 66, 88, 101 for example. Just take anyone and get out at the terminal station. Follow the crowd to the entrance of the park, take a photo and walk further up the slope to the queue for Danubi Train. The train costs 1,500 won per person. Take the train and alight at the Observation Deck. After your photo stop, just walk further to the light house which is about 200 meters away from the Observation Deck. If your knee can take it, you can walk all the way down to the rock next the sea. Otherwise, my advice is to stop at the light house, take a photo with the famous symbol of Taejongdae and return to the Danubi Train stop. There are a few points to take note of:1. If you are above 65, show your passport and you'll get to travel in Danubi Train for free.2. Taking the Danubi Train back, you are advised not to queue at the Light House stop. Walk backwards to the Observation Deck stop to avoid the crowd. I have seen people left behind at Light House stop because the train is full. 3. There are many eateries at the entrance to the park. You can eat there or take a drink before you take your bus at the exit of the bus terminal back to Nampo. The restaurant at the Observation Deck is comparatively expensive. 4. Don't go there during weekend. The train is packed to full capacity. It is just not feasible to walk from the entrance to the light house. It is up slope all the time. strenuous. "
Bad experience..,"I have to walked 2 km to go to entrance because of long queue of buses,taxis, cars; I have to queue more than 1 hr to buy train ticket and queue another 2 hrs just to ride a train bus..just to enjoy a sea view with a few oil platforms and vessels..then I have to walk another 2-3 km to find a taxi going back to subway/bus station because bus was full of people..I wonder why people are going to this overrated place..disappointing."
Cool place,"Just hop into a taxi nearby Busan Station and ask for Taejongdae. Taxi fare is less than 10000 Won. Upon reaching we bought ticket for Danubi train. We thought to stop at the last stop and walk back to the previous points but the train brought us straight back to the starting point. Re-entry is possible. If you are adventurous you may walk up the hill and it will be free.This is a nice and breezy park, just remember to wear a good walking shoe as the cliff can be steep. However, for a beginner like me, apart from exhausted, we find it quite easy to walk around. There are even some Korean ladies who wear heels to the cliff!Cliff has breathtaking view and you will be greeted by cool winds along the way.Went on a Friday morning and quite a lot people, not crowded though. Other points besides the cliff is quite lonely, good for couples or a relaxing stroll.You can easily spare some 2 to 3 hours in this park. There are plenty of taxi available at the exit when we went back at 3pm.This is the best attractions i have been in Seoul and Busan. Must go!"
incredible,"I really love this place.. Here, you can find not only a lot of trees, but also a seaside view with the cliff next to it. In addition, you can see the scenery from the lighthouse near the sea so it will be really interesting if you like to take picture.."
Great area with wonderful views.,I would have loved to spend a whole day here. Bring a packed lunch and find a spot on the cliffside to enjoy the views.
Danubi shuttle,"you can buy ticket to take the Danubi shuttle and stop at the place you want to visit. It is hop on hop off type and check out the timetable at the bus stop. Line up earlier as closer to the closing time of the shuttle, it is crowded and it will be very packed sitting in."
A Short Hiking Trail with Beautiful Views,So glad that my friend brought me here and had the walk under the sun. If you are not a walker then you can take their train ride for a small fee. The view from the side of the mountain facing the ocean is beautiful. Prepare for lots of photo taking. A must go place in Busan!
Stroll overlooking the sea,6-7 km stroll overlooking the sea on a paved pedestrial road. Bathroom as well as food available. Do stop at the light house for nice pictures.
Hot spot for tourists,"Taejongdae is a beautiful park located on an island in the midst of the Busan harbor. It is equipped for walking (lengthy) but has a tram from the entrance making a loop around the park and back to the entrance area. At the extreme SE end of the park, you will find a well equipped visitor area with a great observation building, where you can often see Japan. There are several eating/drinking facilities in the building. Below the building and just a bit further west, is a traditional Korea restaurant area, but beware that it's a bit tricky to climb down to it. You will find the freshest of seafood there, caught right there off the rocks! Some areas are NOT wheelchair accessible."
Breathtaking Highlight of My Trip,"I don't even know where to begin. I almost didn't come here because I was thinking ""What's so great about a lighthouse?This is by far my favorite spot in Busan. The view was unbelievable! No video or picture can truly depict the experience of being there. It's hard to believe there's such beauty so close to town. I simply took a short bus ride from Nampo-dong where I stayed.Before getting to the best part of Taejongdae Park, there's a 2.5km uphill walk/hike with observation decks along the way. If you're not one for walking, there's a tram you can take with a reasonable fee.I think I spent almost 2 hours just on the rock alone. Even found a shady corner to take a 1/2 hour power nap. Probably would've stayed longer if it weren't for the presence of chatty tourists and the need to pee. Advice: go on weekdays if possible and pee first! The toilets nearer to the lighthouse are clean.On the other side of the Sinseon Rock are Clam Tents where the women divers sell freshly harvested clams that can be cooked on the spot. I brought my own food and drinks and had a picnic there. There are no barriers at the cliffs so do be careful especially with children."
Standard and Crowded,Dont go on a weekend. The place is huge and ran by trams to get from one place to another. The views are amazing but thats just about it.
"Pretty standard park, nice cliff views.","Taejongdae is located way out on the ocean near the tip of Busan. It takes a little while to get there by bus. The area is located near the edge of Busan, right on the water. It is easy to travel to the area by bus. There is a large hill that has a couple of parking lots, a visitor‚Äôs center and a two lane road once you enter the park. At the top of the hill there is the option to take a trolley/tram of sorts that you can pay to take you around the park. It is relatively inexpensive and stops at three or four different places throughout the park. If you wish to get off at one of these locations you can get back onto the tram system once another one loops around. It does not take very long for another train to come, usually around fifteen to twenty minutes. You may also walk around the park on foot or perhaps bike. When my wife and I went we opted to take the tram because we had to catch a train out of Busan later that evening.The park itself is very nice. It has a variety of cliffs, trees, and an extremely nice view of the ocean from the road. Since we took the tram I am not sure if there were any trails in the park. Most of the people we passed on the tram were walking alongside the road which was also set with a sidewalk of sorts. Most of the cliffs along the road were quite steep and layered, especially those facing the ocean. We were at the park in January however the weather was still mild enough that there were several people taking the hike around the park.My wife and I only got off the tram at one point, where there was an observation deck/building of sorts. At the observation deck there was a food court available with some seating and an outdoor covered area with a very nice view of the ocean. The food court had a variety of Korean food available along with some ice-cream. Since we had to catch our train we did not stay and linger at the other stops available along the tram route. The tram was fairly nice if a little old. Some of the cars were slightly banged up and may have needed some new paint. It was quite long and could fit many people at once.Overall Taejongdae is a good place to go if you like to be outdoors hiking. It has some interesting cliffs and a nice ocean view."
cool,such a cool place ..... go prepare to walk ... bring water and ur camera .... because u will get tired of walking on the stairs to get the lighthouse and u should have cool pictures of that place!
Excellent,"This is easy to get to on the bus. Once there, you have the option of a 1500 W toy train ticket, that let's you hop off and on at the main points of interest, or you can start walking around the headland. There are some great views out to sea, the lighthouse area is worth an hour or two if you take it easy and of course, the temple. There are lots of steps and ups and downs here so be prepared, but it makes a great afternoon out on a sunny day."
Fabulous rocky cliffs and incredibly blue seas,"We took the subway to Nampo station, exited at exit no. 6 and took bus no. 8. The bus was really packed. and the bus fare was KRW1200 each. Took about 20 minutes to arrive. Bus no. 30 also goes there. Taejongdae was the last stop. The park was really huge and well maintained. Toilets and drinking water fountains were available at every kilometer. A Danubi train that runs a loop round the park is available for those who do not wish to walk. Costs KRW1500. There is also a boat ride for KRW10000. Entry to the park is however free. There were crowds of locals walking around the park with their children and pet dogs. The scenery here was absolutely fabulous with rocky cliffs and incredibly blue seas. The best part was the Observation Deck with a lighthouse with steps leading down into the rocky ledges above the sea. A stall selling fresh seafood with a covered seating area was set up on the rocks next to the sea. It was really very tempting but since we had already had our lunch, we gave that a miss. Spent some time on the rocks below taking in the views. Really many, many steps and a long way round. We stopped on the way back at a temple. A big gold Buddha sat in that temple and we spent some quiet time there contemplating. A couple of friendly dogs followed us back to the entrance. A crowd was already queuing for the bus at the stand. Took bus no. 30 back as it was the first one going. We were worried as we did not know where to alight on the way back. Decided to stop at the Lotte Department store, Gwangbok with its central location. A really enjoyable day. Ensure proper walking shoes as the road is hard and trails long."
Recomended,"Took public bus no 8 from Nampodong and bus cost only 1,300 won. Stops at Taejoongdae. Took the tram that cost only 1,500 won. The cafe and the view at the lighthouse is not to be missed. Spectacular scenery."
ÌÉúÏ¢ÖÎåÄ,"ÌÉúÏ¢ÖÎåÄ(Taejongdae) is a natural park of Busan, South Korea with magnificent cliffs facing the open sea on the southernmost tip of island of Yeongdo-gu."
Beautiful Park with Gorgeous Views,"Well worth the visit. The walk around the park is quite long but I did it and enjoyed the hike. The cliff views were breathtaking and scenery beautiful. Steps down to water and back up are also a bit of a climb, but worth it. Make sure to have water and good walking shoes if you plan on walking around the park. There are areas that were a bit isolated, but I discovered a Monk's garden, quite a lovely find."
One of the best views of Busan,"If you want to view the coast and enjoy a nice, short hike, go here. It's a short ride from Nampo subway station, but worth it. The best attraction Yeongdo has to offer."
"Spectacular view, great for outdoorsy type","The resort park is a green and beautiful. Great for the outdoorsy type who like to hike. If you're lazy like me, the Danubi train is heaven sent and the KRW 1,500 ticket will be the best KRW 1,500 you'll ever spent in Korea.The view is spectacular, seeing the ocean from atop a cliff. Definitely not for those who fear heights. Hold on tight though, because this spot is also notorious (a long time ago) as a suicide place for many people."
Lovely place to visit!,"Well, we dont have Lighthouse we can visit where we come from, so my little gal had to see it! Must take the Danubi tram (1,500 KRW) unless you have lots of time & energy to spend walking up, the park is super big. The ticket only valid of 1 round of ride. You can drop off at any stop on the way.Most people will alight at the Observation Deck. It seems that some people may not have noticed that it is also the same stop for the Lighthouse. You need to walk further down, after visiting the observation deck before you see the Light house. That is the most scenic spot of Taejongdae. Beautiful ocean, cliffs and clear blue sky. I can view the small isolated island clearly from there. If you wanted to try freshly caught raw seafood on the rock by the sea, you can walk down to the ""seafood stall"" set up by Ajumas. It rained when i was there, hubby refuse to let me walk on the flat cliff edge :( But it would be a once in a life time thing to do!!!!!!"
Breathtaking View of the Sea from Park,"Going Taejongdae by bus is easier. If you are from Sasang, please take Bus #8. The bus stop is near the Purple Line (Light Rail). Likewise if you are from Jungangdong, please take Bus #88 or #101. I took Bus #30 from Jagalchi. The bus stop is in front of Sindonga Market and alight at the last terminal stop. You can also ride Bus #66 from Jagalchi. The bus journey is around 40 minutes and the bus should come every 10 minutes. Admission is free. If you don't like to get tired because of walk, take a ride on the Danubi tram at the price of KRW 1500 (A), 1000 (teens), 600 (child), unless you have lots of energy and time to spend walking, the park is big and slanting because it is walking up a hill. The ticket is only valid of 1 round of ride. You may drop off at any stop on the way but the waiting time for the next tram is 30 minutes. The Danubi tram first stop is at the black pebbles beach. You need to walk down a flight of steep stairs in order to reach the beach. The first and the second stop distance is about 250 m, so we decided to walk beause the tram was packed. Walking to second stop took us 15 mins and the route is quite steep. We reached the second stop which was a temple at a slope on the left side. Fortunately there was a small stall, which you could take a rest for a drink or snack. Please do not walk from the second to the third stop. The distance is about 700 m. The third stop is at the Observation Deck. You may take the tram for the fourth stop but some people may not noticed that the distance is about 100 m walk which is almost the same stop for the Light house. Walking is about 5 mins further down the steps after visiting the Observation Deck before you see the Light house on the right. That is the most Magnificient and awesome views of the beautiful ocean, cliffs, small islands and clear blue sky. You need to walk down approximately 300 steps down a flight of steep stairs but it is worth the walk though coming up the stairs is quite tiring. The fifth stop is the last stop to a temple which I gave it a miss because of too tired. I just sat in the Danubi and ride all the way down the hill. Do stop at the seafood stall set up by the adjumas on the left and right side before the entrance of Taejongdae. The food are delicious and tasty though a little pricey. It is worth the trip to Taejondae to see the nature! Do not go there on weekends as it is really packed with tourist and local people."
Tram Service Needs Improvement,"If you're into nature this is definitely the place for you! Taejongdae was one attraction on my must visit list as I've read many good reviews about it. To me it's ideal for family travel; tram ride for my 5yrs old, scenery for my mother and light house for the hubby. We took the City Tour Bus there, which was really convenient as it stops right in front of the park entrance.Note : City Tour Bus does not operate on Mondays, do take note when planning itinerary.On arrival we found out that there is no tram service as the day was gloomy and there's a possibility of rain. We were disappointed but because I really wanted to see the light house, against our better judgement we decided to hike our way there. The walk up is about 2.8km to arrive at the light house and on really steep road. Along the way there are other stops and things to see; Pebble Beach being the first. It is a really nice beach filled with pebbles of different shapes and sizes and at a corner is a hut where female divers sell their catch for the day. The view is breath taking. If you'd like to get some snacks for the day there is also a stall selling chips, water and sandwiches right just before the steps down to the beach.Along the way there are water coolers where you can refill your bottles, toilets and a small stall just at the entrance of the temple for more snacks - hot cup noodles, sausages etc. We finally arrived at the light house after what seems like forever and a lot of hard work and whining from my little boy. Few hundred meters before it is the observation deck where there's a local restaurant and cafeteria where one can dine looking out into the sea. Nice.The pathway to the light house is a steep flight of steps down and a lot of walking required. Worse when coming back up. But if one's up for it, it is definitely worth the effort. The view is magnificent and it is spectacular to be up in the light house (again more climbing) looking out into the ocean.Note : It is really windy here and it can get really cold so more layers might be helpful during winter. If travelling with children, watchful eye is necessary.Above all despite the amount of walking and muscle sore after, I think it's worth it. Only downside is the tram service, which I think should have been in service as usual unless it rains. During winter it can be gloomy all the time and to stop the service based on this reason to me does not seem justifiable. It took us about 3 hours to n fro, light house being the final stop as we were too tired to walk on.TIP :(1) Bring umbrellas and rain coat if there is a possibility of rain as there are hardly any shelter throughout the entire park. We had to walk back 3km soaked in rain.(2) Wear comfortable walking shoes."
The best part of my trip,We decided to go on our own to Taejongdae. First the subway then we took the bus to the last stop. Upon arrival we had to take a long hike to get to train ticket booth. We waited for about 10minutes for our turn to ride the Danubi train. We got off at the lighthouse stop and enjoyed the scene. It is one of a kind
Enjoy the beauty of nature,"Taejongdae...I went there by the city tour bus. No entrance fee to be charged to visitor except if you don't like to get tired because of walk, you can get a ride of tram with the price of KRW1500! There are few places in Taejongdae...temples, seaside, lighthouse etc. I have spent almost a day here by enjoying the beauty of autumn foliage...It is worth visit to those who love nature!"
Picturesque Park,"It is easy to get there by bus. I took bus #8 (#30 also get there) from Jagalchi and alight at the terminal stop. You can get a map (they have different languages type) from the Information center. The staff circle on the map and told me that the Lighthouse is the key attraction of Taejongdae. It is advisable to take the Danubi tram (1,500 KRW) unless you have lots of time to spend walking there, the park is big. The ticket only valid of 1 round of ride. You can drop off at any stop on the way.Most people will alight at the Observation Deck. It seems that some people may not have noticed that it is also the same stop for the Lighthouse. You need to walk further down the steps after visiting the observation deck before you see the Light house. That is the most scenic spot of Taejongdae. Beautiful ocean, cliffs and clear blue sky. I can view the small isolated island clearly from there. If you wanted to try freshly caught raw seafood on the rock by the sea, you can walk down to the ""seafood stall"" set up by Ajumas.There is also a stop for temple but I gave it a miss because I have already visited a few temples for this trip."
Beautiful place!,"We took the City Bus Tour to reach to Taejongdae for only KRW10,000 per pax and it was worth it! Entrance is free of charge and you may choose to hike around the park or take the tram up to the tourist spot for only KRW1,500. However, they should increase the frequency of the tram as we had wasted a lot of time waiting for the tram due to long queue. The park is very beautiful with a lot of scenic spot. You can practically spend the whole day to explore the park and beaches. Public toilets and drinking water fountain are located everywhere. One of the downside is that the receptionist at the Information Counter does not speak English so he was unable to provide us information of the park. Remember to get the guide map from the counter."
You can ride tram to explore the park,"After walking a couple of hundred meters up the hill towards the tram station, buy a ticket to use the tram(1,500 won). One leaves from the bottom station every 20-30 minutes and it will take you at every stop at the park and it got 6 stop overall. Please refer to your tram ticket as you will know which stop actually. When we use the tram they announce stop only with korean and we miss taejongdae lighthouse too bad.. There is a Observatory Deck where you can see the beautiful sea. Going inside from the Observation Deck, you can also get some lunch there is korean restaurant at 2nd floor and you can get waffle or walnut cake at western restaurant 1st floor. There is also got Choi Ji Woo gallery at 2nd floor."
Good place to visit in Busan but Tram rides needs more frequency,"It's a great place to visit in Busan, love the sea and cliffs. Somewhere below the Tower down the cliff, there are people selling sashimi, didn't try though as the wind was too strong to walk down. Cons: Tram service needs improvement, there's lots of people queuing up but not enough frequency to cater to the crowd. Consider that we visit during weekdays, waiting time is more then 30 mins. We waited as the walk to the walk is too long for us."
