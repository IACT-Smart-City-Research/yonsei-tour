History,"A place to learn the history of korea...unfortunately, no english translations. They do have a primer printed that provides a summary of what is inside. From the posters for upcoming activities, it appears there are attempts to make the place and the activities friendly also to non-korean language speakers/readers.Tip: ask the staff for assistance if needed - they will call an english speaking colleague if need be :)"
