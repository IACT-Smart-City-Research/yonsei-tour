Clean and modern airport,Small airport linked by light rail to Busan. I enjoyed the utilization of space for casual sitting while charging your devices close to the food court. Th3 airport also has duty free shopping. It’s not a big airport though
Busy airport,Big pickup area of duty free products bought at Lotte Duty Free and Shinsagae Shop at Boarding. Checkin counters written on big signboard not specific. Portable wifi and sim card pickup area open early in the morning. Inside boarding area not much choice for food.
Pretty good,"Got there at 6am on a sunday to take a flight out. Surprisingly the airport was bustling. Eat before u enter. On the 2nd floor, there is one tonkatsu restaurant. I think. 1 korean restaurant and 1 food court. (There are other cafes and such. But food food.) Ate at the korean restaurant and food court. Food court served much better food. The restaurant tasted... preprepared? There's a small duty free inside."
Good Facilities / Standard Airport - Clean,First time here and it's quite alright.Nothing memorable.The Q for customs took about 40 mins - which is alright.
Friendly and helpful staff,It's a long queue for check in but the staff is really helpful. Tax refund counter is on the left after the immigration check nearby Gate 4.
Used multiple times,"Used this airport multiple times while living in Busan between 2012-2015 it’s fantastic. They have 7-11 beers behind security for about a dollar and you can walk around with them and drink in terminal! As a westerner I found this fascinating haha. If in they did this in the west, the airport would be drunk haha. "
Messy immigration & horrid baggage handling,"Gimhae Airport has excellent facilities but the software leaves much to be desired. Our flight arrived on time on Thursday 17 Oct 2019 morning but clearing immigration was a nightmare. The holding area did not have clear partitions for residents and vistors, there was a shortage of officials to manage the huge crowd of arriving passengers (mostly Koreans and visitors from China and Southeast Asia), resulting in jostling, random queuing and opportunist queue jumpers. The holding area for passengers awaiting immigration clearance was cramped and stuffy with only three counters catering to foreigners. We were among the first passengers from our flight to disembark the aircraft but we were in the queue for 35 minutes before having our passports stamped.Baggage reclaim hall was congested, noisy and stuffy, with baggage for up to three arriving flights circling the reclaim belt at the same time. We saw someone pulling a dented suitcase off the belt and snapping photo of it, while another carton on the belt was in a sorry state with part of the masking tape ripped off. Due to immigration delay, a ground staff offloaded the baggage from our flight to create space for others. Despite having our baggage clearly tagged 'Fragile' and 'Priority', the zipper had been forcibly ripped apart by Gimhae baggage handlers. Thankfully we didn't lose anything but Gimhae should improve supervision and surveillance of its baggage handlers."
good,I think this is one of my favorite airport because most of hotel in Busan allow guest check in after 14.00 so here arrange changing room for traveler. There is one near restroom. 
Limited shops after security. More facilities outside. ,"The airport is small so it’s very easy to navigate. If you arrive in Busan, after security most bus stops are just outside. The train station is only a 5 minutes walk. Everything is easy to locate and access. Issue is at departure. My flight got delayed so I was able to explore the airport. If you are expecting. Something like Seoul you are dead wrong. There are a few restaurants on the third floor and a coffee shop (Holly’s). There are only 3 restaurants after Security (Angels, Dunkin Donuts and a Korean restaurant). Strongly recommend to settle all food before security. There are also limited space/chairs. "
Small and comfy Airport!,"This airport reminds us of our home airport where the staff, people, and ambiance is laid back. I was able to purchase souvenir Post Cards to send home from the Post Office located in this airport, and mailed them without running around all over town! Sets the tone for the start of a good flight or to fly in! We had the pleasure of arriving early the morning of our flight back to the states, and we were able to appreciate where the good restaurants are, and there is plenty to choose, and where to get coffee or fast food! Behind the Security check point, at the gates, we found my favorite: Dunkin' Donuts! This mutt love DD!! We promptly sat down, and ate our awesome breakfast sandwiches, with a cold drink. We leisurely walked about, and then patiently waited for our flight! Customers can ruin the experience, but we took it in stride! So if you don't see anything you like to eat before going through Security, then more good eats await you! We were able to also find a 7-Eleven not too far from our gate, and I ran into it to grab some goodies! We can't wait to come back with wagging tails to this awesome airport! Mega Kudos!"
An Ok Airport,"Coming from a city that has one of best airports , our expectations are high.This is an average airport. The check in was terrible cos there was a tour group. It could be airlines lack of organisation.We waited for awhile cos of the group.They should separate group and individual check in.We went through the snake like q to immigration., it says auto passport q. So we went but unable to use. Staff help to move to manual q. There was simply no crowd control. Limited food outlets inside. Some noodle shop, cafe,etc, staff were helpful though."
Not big but efficient ,Not a very big airport but efficient to handle all our arrival. We arrived very early and had breakfast in Hollys. Clean and tidy. 
Very efficient airport,"It can get busy here at security and immigration at times, but it goes quickly. There are a few restaurants outside of security and two restaurants inside. There are three lounges that are decent. Korean Air has sandwiches, cookies and nuts to snack on. Sky Hub lounge has hot food - usually a soup, rice and various Korean dishes. Haven't been to the Air Busan lounge yet which replaced the Asiana lounge."
"Smooth, Clean & Easy","I don't normally write airport reviews, but this airport was very efficient. Immigration on arrival was fast, customs was instant and it was easy to change some money and find the bus stop.The return trip was equally good. My airline had no check-in queue, tax refund points landside (customs stamp) and airside (collect refund) both had no queues and were very efficient. Immigration was also instant and security check was efficient, again with no queues. Airside facilities are very good considering the relatively small size of the airport."
easy to navigate airport,"We flew from Jeju Island, S Korea to Busan and had no problems. English translations were everywhere. The airport is very clean and spacious. "
Efficient!,"We came by Gimhae Int'l 4 times during our visit. Efficient staff; wifi available for use. Airport limousine is just outside the gate. Clean, spacious. Eateries are available. "
Efficient and quick,We flew from Gimhae to Seoul.Small but efficient and clean airport. Impressed with how well it ran! Loads of space to sit down.
decent airport.,decent airport. landed here and took the metro to the hotel which was across the street. helpful staff
Airport staff was rude and does not speak anything except Korean,"My family and I were flying out of Gimhae International Airport to Hong Kong on March 26, 2019. After lunch (around 13:30), we decided to head to the departure gate. I was holding my two year old daughter and my wife was with my six year old son right behind us. We walked up to the airport staff (employee badge #3467) and I handed him all four passports with boarding passes for inspection. This airport staff spoke Korean to me. Me being Chinese, I told him I do not speak Korean. He then proceeded to speak Korean to me again louder and in a condescending tone. I have no idea what he was saying to me. My wife (thank goodness she is Korean) came up to see what the problem was. This person repeated what he said in an even ruder tone toward my wife. At this point, I am extremely frustrated and I said to this person and I asked him if he spoke English. He ignored me and continued to address my wife in a disdainful manner. After a few exchanges, She found out that this airport staff does not speak any English and each passenger had to hold his/her own passport and boarding pass. This airport staff then inspected our passports and boarding passes in the most foul mood, without once apologizing to my wife nor me, and sent us through. Having the name Gimhae ""International"" Airport, I would assume that the first airport staff personnel any passenger meet would have the basic understanding of English. Isn't it his/her job to make passengers welcomed, greet them with courtesy and respect? I did not see or experience any of that at Gimhae ""International"" Airport. Gimhae should consider revising/updating its basic requirements when hiring staff. I believe each staff should at least know the English phrase to be able to perform his/her job properly, or maybe I'm expecting too much from Gimhae ""International"" Airport.Another thing is that there was no signage advising each passenger must pass on their own passport and boarding pass (even toddlers) for inspection. My family and I have been to many airports around and have never encountered this. After this incident, I have concluded that Gimhae ""International"" Airport is not a family friendly place. I will be sharing this experience with all my friends, family and other social platforms."
FUNCTIONAL WITH EFFICIENT SERVICE,"I think that my title says everything.Not the best airport in the world, but works efficiently, and is easy to move through.Passoport control is a breeze, and the shops and bars are of good standard. Summing up quickly: VERY functional, and EFFICIENT… cannot complain."
Good small airport,Reached here from Gimpo Airport.This is a decent small airport. There's a light train connection right outside. It feels like a vacation area as soon as stepping out of the building.
Surprisingly Small,"While decent-sized landside, airside is on the small side. It's just one big hangar. Lounges are a bit hard to find. If you are Star Alliance Gold, do note that Asiana does not have a lounge here, you can use Air Busan's small lounge with a similar limited offering of refreshments for non-Asian tastes. Korean Air elite flyers do get their own lounge though. Both lounges are upstairs, kind of in the middle of the terminal."
Clean,Landed on 16-Jan and was surprised that I encountered no problems with the immigration. Very Fast and Efficient and was cleared in no time.The airport although small but was very CLEAN and ORDERLY.
Pretty average terminal,There really isn't much to make the Kimhae terminal stand out among large airports. There are the usual overpriced airport shops and restaurants. They stay crowded as one would expect of a metropolitan airport. Processing is relatively easy. 
"Same old, same old","After travelling to Busan almost a year ago, I thought that improvements would have taken place. Same old, same old. "
Limo Bus towards Busan Station - Take it at your own risk,"I am penning this down on the limo bus towards Busan Station. There are luggage space offered below the passenger deck and yet the ""clever"" driver insisted to carry our 29inch luggage up along with us. Mind you, there are still ample of space below to fit another 5 big luggages. In the end, not only my friend and I were embarrassed in front of other tourists and locals, our luggages also caused inconvinence to other passengers. We chose limo bus as opposed to the rail because we wanna travel in comfort but ended up in suffering. KRW 7000 went down the drain."
Convenient,"Most people in Korea generally travel to Seoul/Incheon to take an international flight but Busan provides some great options. The terminal is old and can get crowded but there are regular flights to Vietnam, Taiwan, Thailand, Philippines, Japan, and Mainland China. The Korean Air Lounge is NOT good but the SkyHub lounge is great and free, if you are a Priority Pass holder. The rail runs right to the airport and, for those coming from Daegu, you can catch a direct luxury bus from the ShinSegae Department store right to the Terminal. There is also bus service to Pohang and several other cities.If you like smaller airports with less traffic but a great range of international flights for around $200-$300 (written in 2018) then Busan is an excellent option!"
Easy to get around,Easy to find your way around and even if you are not flying....go here for the food lol. Spoilt for choice
Airport limousine bus to and from Gimhae airport,"Just got back from Busan a few days ago. We took the Airport Limousine Bus from Haeundae Beach area to the Gimhae airport as opposed to using the subway. The Airport Limousine Bus was convenient as there was a bus stop close to our hotel. The bus ride took approximately 70-75 min because there are multiple stops along the way as it goes to the airport and there was a fair amount of traffic. Cost is 7000won. We checked with our hotel front desk and were told that the bus would accept the T-money card...it didn't. So unless you have the subway card used in Busan, be prepared to pay cash($7000 won per person). Aside from the traffic, we found it to be more convenient than having to navigate our luggage up and down the stairs on the subway or look for the elevators as we did when traveling from Busan station to Haeundae station. You would also need to transfer one time on the subway from Haeundae to Gimhae airport. The seats on the bus were comfortable and luggage is stored underneath the bus. The bus arrives every half hour. Actual time depends on which stop you are at. Our bus was 8 minutes later than the published time - probably due to traffic. Also depending on the location of your stop, the bus can be fill up and then you will have to wait for the next one. We saw this happen on the stops closer to the airport."
Transportation information,"For those that need to have more infos there you go 3 options to reach downtown : - Light transit train + line 2 metro : Quick and efficient, cost around 3,000 WON. Count around 45-50 min to reach Seomyeong Station- Limousine bus : waiting outside the terminal entrance, reaching different places around the city, 85 min to reach Haeundae, cost 7,500 WON- taxi everywhere but fare would be around 35,000W at least but just depends where you go and the traffic.That's all you need to know.Cheers"
It was not what I expected,"I have traveled a lot and many International airports are impressive and big. So, I was rather surprised that a city with a stature like Busan that host Film Festivals would have such a small airport. That being said, it fulfills the functions of an International airport with professionalism."
No problems.,"You need to fill out and entry card and customs card. Processing for each was reasonably quick. There were a couple ATMs on the departure level. Airport limo bus runs about every 40 minutes. There were a huge number of taxis waiting in line to pick up rides. People were also waiting in brief line to get a taxi. Be care not to get in the much more expensive limousine taxi on the near side (with no line.). We took a taxi for a shade under KRW15,000 to our hotel near Seomyeon."
Great ,"Small and efficient. Great train service gets to your hotel or anywhere in the City quickly, easily and cheaply. Runs with Japanese efficiency!"
helpful tourist booth in the airport,"they speak good english and very informative staff, please drop by since they can give you a great layout of the city"
Inbound and Outbound Tips,"Inbound experience good. Baggage arrival & customs clearance efficient. Took limo bus from Gimhae to Haeundae. Cost KRW7,000 per person x 2. Hit traffic & took 1-1/2 hours. For the outbound we took regular taxi which cost KRW31,000 & less than an hour. Since we arrived more than two hours before flight departure we had to wait to check in. Outbound experience also good. Gimhae is not as busy as Incheon. "
"Sufficient airport in Busan. Easy to get to by metro subway, bus, or taxi.","We took the KTX into Busan but flew out of Busan via Gimhae International Airport to Jeju Island. The airport is easy to get to and it is get to the city from the airport. Most prefer the metro subway which is efficient and fairly affordable, but no way as affordable as the bus. A TMoney card you purchase ride credits on can be used for both and you will end up having to mix the use in Busan between metro and bus, or taxi.Gimhae is a small but efficient airport, it has a efficient check-in departure and arrivals areas with plenty of taxis outside waiting outside the arrival hall. There is a Dunkin' Donuts in one corner and a Tom N Toms coffee in the other with a book store in the middle. Jeju Air is in the lower level, far right corner of the airport hall.Upstairs there are restrooms and a restaurant hall serving Korean food. We got the gimbap, dol sot bibimbap, and tonkatsu dishes. They are good! You return your own trays to the carts on the far wall at this cafeteria style restaurant.There are also art exhibits in the middle of the second level of the terminal, along with another set of restrooms and couple of small shops. This is a good airport to travel domestically to Jeju and other points in Korea or west coast of Japan."
Great Airport,"Please note that there are two terminals. One for international flights and the other for domestic flights. I have been through the international terminal many times and always appreciate how quick the processing is. This airport is very efficient. There are some restaurants available if you need to eat before flying. Wifi is ok. If I can fly out of Busan instead of Seoul, I am happy to do it."
It’s not Gimbae,"While I’ll comment on the airport, I noticed that your site sometimes has errors and no way to have us crowdsource the correction for your site. Navigating here in Busan, it says “Gimbae,” for the airport, but it’s with an “h.”The airport was a little old the last time I flew in and somewhat limited in terms of amenities. The new modeled incheon airport will make gimbal look even more weak, but I’m hoping it got a nice update like Incheon did, but frankly, pyeongcheong is far away and I don’t know if the govt would subsidize such improvements."
Airports are Airports.,"If you fly, you have to use them. We only had to ask a couple time to find the correct direction --- in or out of the airport. Most employees spoke enough English to help. Airport was clean, felt safe, and was easy to move around. I expected it to be larger being the second largest city in Korea. "
Must take a time for waiting the luggage,"After getting off from the plane, you will met the immigration immediately, no stop by for toilet! You can use the toilet after pass the immigration only. The luggage system is really slow, I must wait for 30 mins for luggage. "
Convenient arrival,"Lots of restaurant within the airport. you can conveniently exchange your money with their Forex stalls, rent a mobile hotspot and buy your t-money from convenience store "
Not too crowded,"I usually get Gimhae International airport as my port of entry from Manila, Philippines. It is not too crowded unlike Incheon. A lot easier for mo to reach my hotel destination."
Busan Airport,"Gimhae domestic and international located to next door. Very good idea. Having 2 airports at the same area. Will not confuse, such as seoul airport, incheon airport & gimpo airport. Airport bus stop just outside at the domestic airport, very convenience. 2 routes, Busan station & Haeundae . "
No convenience stores,"Clean efficient airport, with everything you could possibly need once you go through immigration to the outside section. If you are coming the other way, buy your snacks before you go through passport control because there are no convenience stores inside, only expensive high-end fashion. "
First stop on arrival in Busan Airport,We made this our first stop on arrival at the Gimhae International airport to get some maps and enquire about the metro trains to get to the city centre. The staff were very helpful and could speak adequate English.
One of the best Airports,"It could be one of the finest airports in Asia. Very well-kept, clean and efficient service. It didn't take us long to get out of Immigration, queues though long are fast because of the helpful devices installed in the counters. Unlike other airports where it takes a lot of time to go through the immigration, in Gimhae took us less than a minute. The baggage carousel is as efficient. Our luggages were there even before we finished in the immigration. That's fow fast they are! Groud staff are also gracious enough to lead us to the exit doors. Signages are all over so they keep you on track.Taxi bays are also properly located not too far yet not to near to cause traffic along the arrival area. Taxi drivers are also polite and jolly.Overall, Gimhae is very satisfactory when it comes to design and service."
Helpful,"They are very nice and helpful regarding which transportation should i take. I am a little bit blur when arrived Busan, so, I'm just going straight to this information center to ask where should i wait for my bus."
good info,Got enough info I needed for stuff to do during an 8 hour layover in Busan. No need to go all the way into the city center; some malls & stores are just a few quick train stops away.
