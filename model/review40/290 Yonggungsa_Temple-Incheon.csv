Something a little different.,"Temples aren’t usually located on the ocean we were told but this temple is right on the ocean nestled in a bit of steep terrain. It’s really picturesque. You get to it by walking through a lane of outdoor stalls featuring different things- especially unusual food. Then it’s through a lane of horoscope statues. You can pick out what sign you belong to. Be aware that getting to the temple involves many steep steps that were made for people with small feet and that there are many people to navigate through at the same time. That said, it is totally worth your time as the place is lovely and has several places to explore."
Gorgeous temple by the sea,It is relatively easy to get here from Haendae Beach. We took a 25min bus ride (Bus 100) from outside our hotel Novotel Ambassador Haeundae to the Fisheries building outside the temple. It was then a 10-15min walk from the main road to the temple. We did take a taxi back afterwards which costs us USD11. Outside the temple entrance there is a small food n souvenir market. Got my chance to try Hotteok pancake there n ‘ironed’ on grill dried squid! There are lots of steps going down to the shore area where the temple is located by the sea. I don’t recall seeing wheelchair access paths. The view of the temple from the shore is gorgeous and a great spot for photos. There were also people tossing coins into the wishing fountain area. Overall an interesting and picturesque place to spend 2-3hrs here. The Lotte Premium Outlets is just one bus stop before the Fisheries building stop so you can tie your visit with a visit there too. There are taxis from the temple to there if u prefer. 
Beautiful and a relaxing walk...,This is a beautiful area to spend the morning or afternoon just walking around and taking pictures. Very relaxing.
Small but nice,A nice temple on a small hill. It was autumn and my toddler loved walking on the fallen leaves.As for the 1 hour transit tour:It's 20 minutes to and from the airport. You'll have 15-20 minutes to spend here. Recommended for short layovers.
7am to 8am Free tour from Icheon Airport,"It's a small temple surrounded by trees on the top of a small hill.We went there at about 7:30am so it's very fresh, quiet and relax. We visited it in about 15 minutes.There is not much to see but still much better than stay at the airport waiting for next fly."
Free city tour ,Can't complain it's free and it is a small little temple near the airport. Worthwhile if you have a few hours to spare and Beats seating in a terminal waiting 
Amazing Tour for Free!,"I had a 12 hr lay over in Incheon Airport and decided to take their free transit tour and it went Amazing! It's free and totally a wonderful experience. The temple was peaceful, very neat. Tour guides speak English well and are very friendly. I learned a lot in just few minutes. You can take Instagramable pictures but you have to be control your noise as the place is solemn. What amazed me the most is the tree that is over a thousand years old. It's a MUST- visit place."
Nice tour and temple for those on a layover at Incheon Airport,"My family and I had a 5 hour layover at Incheon. We discovered the Korean Transit Tours (which are free and very in variety and length). Since we were limited on time we took the 1 hour tour to Yonggungsa Temple in Incheon. TIP: you should sign up in advance to get on these tours, can do so via web). The tour was easy to get find - they have kiosks throughout the airport. The tour company takes care of the bus and guide for you. They run right on time. The guide spoke terrific English. Since it was a bit of a drive there we only got to spend 15 minutes at the temple. But the guide did a great job and even my kids enjoyed it. It was a great escape from the airport. Highly recommended to look into this and other tours offered."
Nice Small Temple!,"This is a small temple near Incheon International Airport. We joined the Korean Free Transit Tour while waiting for our connecting fly. The temple consists of various buildings such as Gwaneumjeon (re-constructed by Heungseon Daewongun), Yosachae (home of the monks), Chilseonggak, and Yonghwanggak. In Yosachae, the writings of Heungseon Daewongun are hung on the wall and recently, an 11 meter-high statue of Maitreya was put in place. In front of the temple are two 1,300 year-old zelkova trees. It was the first tour to the temple in the early morning so it was very peaceful. It seemed to be a perfect time to visit this ancient temple, listen to its history, and enjoy a quiet morning."
Interesting - Went on a Transit Tour from the Airport,Cute little place in the hills with a solemn atmosphere. The monks were there and also a few people chanting. Very surreal. Wish there was more time but the tour allowed for only 10 minutes stay.
Quiet and Solemn,"Came here for an hour tour from a long layover in the airport. Place is very quiet and solemn. Perfect place to meditate as it is located in the mountains and away from the metropolitan. It also has the 1,300 year old Zelcova Tree! I bought a bracelet for $10, pretty pricey but worth it. Will definitely come back."
A Little Out of the Way Buddhist Temple,"The Yonggungsa Temple is located near the Incheon Airport and is one of the free 1 hour tours offered by the Incheon Airport Transit Tour company. The airport offers 5 one hour tours to this temple. 7, 8, 11, 12 & 2 pm. If you only have a short layover, take advantage of this free sightseeing opportunity. It is small and quiet and remote and not the most impressive Buddhist temple, but is better than sitting bored at the airport for hours on end. The temple was founded in 670, the tenth year of King Munmu during the Shila dynasty. The temple is most famous for it's 1,300 year old zelkova tree. There are two ancient trees there. It was quite cold and we were grateful that the tour company also provided free down parkas. Sit on the sunny side of the bus in the winter for the best photos. The non sunny side will fog up when it is freezing outside."
"Small, quiet temple","C1 ( 2013.06.03 ) There was a small and quiet temple. There was an old ginkgo tree and the Big Buddha. With the exception of these, There was nothing very unusual. The quiet is a good place to take a walk. Passing on the road is also good to visit, I do not want to recommend it go."
