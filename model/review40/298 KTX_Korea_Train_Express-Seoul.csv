Excellent train service,"We travelled on the KTX service from Seoul to Busan and back. The journey was great, trains were punctual and, with a Korean rail pass, the fares were very reasonable."
Clean and fast,"Great counter staff who assisted me even when I asked them which public wifi spot I could tap on, and they got us the front facing seats we wanted. The ride was super comfortable and toilets are decently clean. Definitely will take it again as it is a more convenient alternative to taking airplanes within korea."
Seoul To Gyeongju,"Wow! Talk about efficient! We purchased tickets online to guarantee a seat and exchanged it at Seoul Station for printed tickets. Takes 2 hours to get to Gyeongju (seriously beautiful, btw) and the ride was smooth and comfortable. Our tour in Gyeongju ended a little earlier than anticipated and we were not able to get an earlier ride back to Seoul, they were sold out. We just chilled at Sin Gyeongju station. There's some shops and a couple of restaurants. KTX is awesome!"
"Great system, especially for the price (but weird slowdown around Sejong City)","Great system for the price and quite fast as most have already noted.Also connected to major metro stations for easy access to subways.The average speed is about 300km/h or more between Seoul and Busan.However, there is always a strange slowdown around Sejong City.Probably would cut travel time by ~15m if this slowdown doesn't happen."
Fast efficient way to travel in Korea,"Fast, clean and efficient way to travel in Korea. Seoul to Daegu is about 2 hours. On a busy weekend, you might want to get a ticket in advance, or else you might end up with standing room only, which means standing in the area between the cars near the bathroom - not a fun way to spend a few hours. "
Train To Busan,Easy to find the train and the train is clean and the seat is comfortable.Ready your tickets early as i can see the train is fully booked.The ticket is not cheap but for me is an experience because of the movie - Train to Busan. 
Super fast train,KTX is the best way to travel long distances in Korea. Its better than by air as it leaves from the middle of Seoul and lands in the middle of your destination in the city you are visiting. Very comfortable and free wi fi. Ideal if travelling to Busan
Fast and Convenient,"We bought the KR Pass, 4-day flexible pass. You can book one month in advance in their website.Went to Busan, Daegu, Daejeon and back to Seoul.It convenient, hassle-free and fast."
Fast/Clean and Comfortable train,"Traveling with KTX train is always one of my favorite public transport to Busan/Gyeongju and etc, Pros:- The train seating for second class is comfortable, and clean. Staff over the counter is helpful, as i need to change earlier train schedule from Pohang to Busan to avoid long waiting inside the station. They manage to help me change without any problem on the day itself."
Comfortable Trip into Seoul,Seoul airport is easy to get around. The automatic ticket machines are easy to use but there is a ticket desk near the entrance if you need help. It’s a quick trip into the city and you pay more for reserved seats. I used this service for my first trip and used the standard service for my other 3 trips.
GOOD.,"My guess very cheep, in Japan 3-4 times more.also,much easy to use than metro in Korea.In Seoul is for me is nuts."
Impressive but not quite as fast as the Japaneses version.,"Korean trains are fast, easy to use, clean and safe. Tickets are bought at the various stations and come complete with train, carriage and seat number all in Korean & English. They run of time so make sure you get to the platform early rather than late."
Love it!,Best way to get from Incheon Airport to Seoul. The CT pass was great for metro and bus lines. Best one stop mode for traveling to and from airport.
Easy commute,"if going between Gimpo and Incheon this is the way to do it. Cheap, fast; not stuck in traffic. Be sure to collect rebate on turning in your ticket card."
"Clean, efficient and on time",Took the KTX train to Busan (no pun intended). The whole experience was like clock work. Tickets were easy to pre-purchase. Only suggestion would be to purchase the food on the platform rather than commercial options in the plaza. 
Train to Busan,"The most convenient way to travel to Busan. Ride first class, free water and some mix nuts and cookies."
"When they are fast, they are fast...","Nice and comfortable trains, but not all of them are as fast as the Seoul-Busan line. Actually even not all trains on the Seoul-Busan line are equally fast - at different hours they are different - some stop at more stations, some - at just a few. The Seoul-Jinju line is disappointingly slow - it takes over 3.5 hours to get to the final station, and the distance is actually smaller than Seoul-Busan, where the fastest train needs just over 2 hours to travel the whole distance with speeds of up to 300 km/h"
Worth using,We used the KTX from Seoul to Busan and it was enjoyable. Get your ticket in advance as you really need to book a seat; it was a popular journey. It took about two and a half hours. Take a drink and snacks with you as I don’t think there is a refreshment area on board.
Easy and efficient,"Easy to locate, system efficient. Some confusion on accepting card or cash at ticket counters but easily negated with easy access to atms. Trains on time and clean. Just do not use the toilets - terrible!"
Fantastic train service,"I took this train from Seoul Station to Dongdaegu and also to Busan. The entire system is easy to navigate with English signs and announcements. Trains are inexpensive, punctual, and there are places for you to put your luggage when you board. There are plenty of places to buy food in the terminals. "
Fast and comfortable,"Took KTX from Seoul to Gumi Gimcheon, due to work. Bought VIP seat which is very comfortable and spacious. Snacks and water bottle are provided and the journey took about 1 hr 10mins. In the train you wont feel how fast it was traveling - 300km. Some more there is free WIFI."
Nice Experience,I very much enjoyed my travel from Seoul to Daejeon by KTX. I was seated in the first class which was very comfortable. It felt nice to experience this super fast train. 
Incredible!,"The trains are just minutes away. The speed is stunning. (300 kmh) The cars are clean comfortable, full Wifi. I recommend everyone to give it a try. Great experience."
Can Be Very Fast,"We took the KTX from Daegu to Seoul, but this time the one that made several local stops. It took 1 hour and 45’, but better to take the non-stop that takes only 1 hour and 15’. It is definitely faster than regular train and bus. "
Excellent,"We travelled from Seoul to Busan, thankfully I watched a YouTube video and it gave me the heads up on checking boards and car number, the. Seat number. We travelled first class, which I recommend. You do not notice how fast the train is going."
"Quick, easy and cheap way to travel inside Korea","We used KTX from Busan to Seoul, it was very convenient, fast and cheap. Get your ticket 1-2 hours in advance at the train station ticket office, no need for online booking hassle. The cabin overhead luggage fits up to middle sized checked baggage. Bigger luggage needs to put in between cabins.2 tickets from Busan to Seoul cost us ~110k KRW.Highly recommended."
Take it,"Fast está way to go Airport and city, quik, efifcient, fast, best way to move, not to many people nows english "
It's fast. It's cheap. It's Clean. It's Convenient.,"It's fast. It's cheap. It's Clean. It's Convenient. If you need to go is in the path of their tracks, by all means take it."
Two trips on KTX,"I took two trips on the KTX, one to Gwangju and the other to Daejeon. It was a very comfortable ride and they were always on time!"
Comfortably Fast,"Took this train from Seoul to Busan and vice versa. Ticketing was easy, although you might find the queue a little long if you decide to buy at the station. Not the most modern train, but fast, clean and comfortable. Definitely a more comfortable choice for traveling between the two cities (compared to airplane)."
Fast and Comfortable,the train was from Seoul to Busan took about 2 hours but the train was fast and the riding was smooth
Easy and smooth but some issues with first class,"The good thing about the KTX is that its really easy to use. If you travel outside of peak days then you should have no trouble just show up at the station, buy your tickets and travel with the train. Worked like a charm for me landing at Incheon early, taking the Arex to Seoul station and just buy tickets. Grabbed a quick lunch and went to Busan. The train will depart at its scheduled time and it will be at the terminal stations 30 min before departure. Its the best way to get between major cities in Korea.I used the KTX for a round trip to Busan from Seoul.I thought I should go with first class to busan and back since Im on vacation and not on a budget. The train was easy to find and you just board the car and all is good for a relaxing ride to Busan... or that was what I thought.Its when you enter the train you realize that the standard on this train is sub par even on first class. The first class car was very shabby. the seats where torn and I found stains on them. Well some wear and tear should be expected but this was a bit too much when traveling on first class. When the train departed it was more or less full and thats when I saw the second drawback with first class on KTX. It started to feel like a commuter trains. People where walking back and forth all the time and others where switching seat after each station. There were also people standing in the area between cars blocking passage to toilette etc. Back from Busan to Seoul it was even worse and I had people standing right next to me in the first class car between some stations.I assume those were standing ticket passenger but why are they allowed into first class cars? Basically I bought first class tickets and it felt like I was riding a glorified subway train. The Arex Express trains turned out to be better than the KTX first class and the KTX is nothing even close to the Shinkansen.If you travel with the KTX dont bother with First class since you pay extra only to get a wider seat and a free bottle of water (which you cant get to because of people blocking the passage). Dont expect a calm and relaxing trip and prepare to have people walking by you constantly. Basically hope for window seat, put on some really good ANC headsets, try to ignore all the fuzz going on around you and pray you dont have to use the toilette."
Very good ,We used the KTX a couple of times and in overall very satisfied with it. Be aware that if you try to get a last minute tickets you might not find it on rush hour. 
Best way to and fro airport and city,"If you're travelling with family with kids and luggages, this is the best option for you. It's fast, cheaper than taxi and easy. If you took Korean Air airline then you will get additional discount. Kids below 3 ride for free but they won't get a seat. KTX brings you from airport to Seoul Station which is 5 mins taxi away from Myeongdong. "
Easy and smooth,"Trains were on time and comfortable. We had friends who ordered our tickets so I can't say anything on that process, but finding the train and the everything was very simple."
Smooth ride to Busan,"We took the KTX from Seoul to Busan , inside is clean and comfortable and we are given some refreshment on board have really enjoy our 2.5 hour trip "
Best experience,"KTX is one of the best train services in the world. They are punctual (not as good as Japenese), very comfortable, and very fast! I travelled in this train thrice from and to Seoul. Even when the train goest at 300 km/h, one will never notice the speed or jerk. It's very smooth. They do announce the stations in English so the tourists won't miss it. Travelling on this train is a must while in South Korea."
Touring South Korea ,"We took the KTX bullet Train from Seoul to Gyeongiu ( 2 hour trip),where stayed for a day. We also took the train from Busan back to Seoul ( 2 and one half hour trip). Tickets and and picks were arranged by our travel agent Kate DeLosso. Tickets seemed to cost about 49-59,000 WON each. We were a little concerned about communication once we were dropped off at the outbound station, but this was unfounded because the information desk was quite helpful and signs for the trains and tracks were clearly marked in English. There were elevators/steps/escalators to get to the tracks. We had to use the elevator because of our suitcases. The trains were on time on both occasions. I loved that seats were assigned. Trains were clean. There were a group school kids in our train car, going on field trips, on our first train. They were the friendliest group of kids I have met, trying to engage us in small talks. Great way to move from city to city in South Korea. My only hang up was lugging the suitcase and bag. It was a good experience (unlike our bullet train ride from London to Paris and back, broke down twice, and no apologies). I would recommend the KTX train if you plan to visit these cities. "
Excellent way to get around the ROK,"On my last visit I was able to take a day to visit friends in Gwangju, in South Jeolla Province. Because I had limited time, I took the Express train rather than the local. The cost was somewhat more; but it was still affordable; and the time element was much more advantageous than it would have been with the slower train. The train itself was comfortable and on time. It is equipped with wifi, though it took me a bit to figure out how to get connected. (It helps if you ask the conductor for help rather than trying to figure it out for yourself - unless you're more experienced than I.) In any case, the train both ways was on time, and I enjoyed seeing the Korean countryside on the trip."
Train to Busan,"Everything was clean, fast and reliable. wonderful service, but I noticed some coldness toward foreigners. We took the KTX from Seoul to Busan and back. There were no zombies, though. My youngest was still scared because the train looked just like the one in the movie. Hardly saw any attendant, but the ride was so short, it didn't matter. However, if you needed something right away it might be a problem. There were no food options on board. but lots of shops at both Seoul and Busan stations. We felt very comfy staying at the stations shopping and eating while waiting for the train. We got 2 day flex group saver korail pass and saved some money, though only a few dollars, the lady at the service counter explained."
fast and reliable,It is a very convenient ride going to tourist attractions around Seoul. It saves us time and energy.
Great way to travel,"We chose to travel by high speed rail from Busan to Seoul and it turned out to be a great idea. Our hotel in Busan was just next door to the station so it was very convenient. The train station is tidy and offer breakfast choices. The train is also comfortable, clean, fast and on time. "
One of the most efficient in the world,"This is one of the most efficient high speed train systems in the world. It is fast, clean and comfortable. It is better than air travel since it takes you from downtown to downtown, so you can avoid traffic congestion especially during rush hours. From KTX stations, you can easily make connections to subway or taxi. The Seoul Metro is probably the most efficient subways in the world. For long-haul take Metro, and for short-haul take taxi. Credit cards are commonly accepted in taxi, and the fare is cheap."
"It is very handy,and we enjoy travelling by KTX","we travelled from Seoul to Busan in South Korea a distance of 326 km It took 2:30h.It is beter than trvelling by air,and cheaper , very comfortable so we strongly recomend using the KTX in S.K"
The best way to travel in Korea,"Fast, efficient, clean, cheap, courteous staff, clear signage, good connections to the metro in Seoul. Compared to the dreadful traffic queues of travel by road this is definitely the way to travel around Korea."
Efficent and clean,"We took KTX from incheon airport to Seoul station to Busan. It was on a Monday. I read that we can go directly from incheon airport to Busan but that wasn't true. We had to buy a ticket to Seoul Station first. They have discounts if you traveled with one of the Korean air carriers at the kiosks. Kiosks are easy to navigate in English. Or They also have a special at the desk, three people for 24000 won. At Seoul station, you have to go up to the second floor and buy tickets at the kiosks. The desk lines are slow. The train tracks area are easily marked with numbers. The tickets have a cabin number and seat number on it. They can be strict about it if you aren't in the correct cabin. There is a bathroom on the train and luggage storage. They do random ticket check on boardIncheon airport to Seoul station takes about 35 minutes. Then We bought the fastest to Busan, 2.5 hours. ~59800 won each. No discount I believe. "
best form of transit ever,"great little shops at the station supply lunch or snacks - very good onesThe train is very comfortable and gets you clear across the country in a couple of hours (the express). The train celebrates its inherited notoriety, Train to Busan, the zombie movie. Many public service announcements come with a reference."
Fast and comfortable,We took the Busan-Seoul route. It was a very quick and comfortable ride. The seats are comfortable and the train is very clean. 
"Fast, clean, comfortable","I used the KXT to go from Daegu to Seoul and, although it is more expensive than the train or bus, it is so much more comfortable that it is worth the extra price. It is also much faster, making it more convenient especially if you are going to the airport. The train terminal connects with the airport through both an express train or one that makes more stops. Take the express train! There is also a place in the terminal to store your bags for a reasonable fee if you are going to spend some time in Seoul before leaving. "
Trip to Gyeongju,So easy to book and use. The stations are easy to navigate and the actual train ride was a pleasure...book 1st class it is worth the (little) extra. 
Love this train for visits to Busan,"Fast, clean and very comfortable. The KTX is the best way to get from Seoul to Busan. We've also taken it to the Shin Gyeongju station as well."
Excellent service from Seoul Station to Busan and back,"I have traveled on trains in many countries on various vacations but I feel KTX provided the best service so far. I traveled from Seoul station to Busan and back and thoroughly enjoyed the trip without any hassles or issues. We had bought our tickets a month in advance and when we arrived at Seoul station, we lined up at the ticket counter to get the seat numbers. The line moved very fast so we had plenty of time to do some window shopping prior to boarding the train. Boarding was very easy as the ticket tells you the cabin number and the seats. The inside was very clean and seats very comfortable. What I loved was the quiet atmosphere in the cabin. Our train left the station on time and arrived at our location not a minute later than what the timetable predicted. Our return from Busan to Seoul was equally great. Hats off to KTX!"
Fast and comfortable,The price isn't cheap but it takes you where you need in a fast and comfortable way. Large seats. Respect timetable.
"Super Fast, Clean, Efficient - but very little English anywhere",On schedule and bullet fast. Super clean yet it is very difficult to find a garbage can. Make sure to download your subway maps from KakaoMap as this is very helpful and you will be able to see your location offline even without wifi. There is fast free wifi at the station. 
Fast & Efficient,A very fast and efficient way of travelling between cities. The KTX travels at upto 270km/hr. Tickets can be pre-booked online or can be purchased on the day. All tickets come with a seat reservation. All services run to time and are very comfortable.
Convenient,"Took the KTX from Seoul to Busan. It took about 2 hours to get to Busan from Seoul. Overall the journey was very pleasant and the car was pretty clean. Buying the ticket is also really easy, you can either purchase the ticket through the box office or a machine."
Easy to ride and convenient,"If you're are traveling the neighborhoods of Seoul you have to ride the KTX. It's the easiest way to get around the city, as well as inexpensive compared to taxis. The train ticketing system is easy to follow, and each stop and car was very clean. Signs in the train help you navigate to your destination."
"Smooth, fast, clean","Theres no other way to travel to other cities far than by using KTX. Bus is so 1990s. Train is so smooth you dont even realize your on a train. Just like the Japanese bullet train, any destination that requires travel by car or bus, time can be reduced by half or more. "
KTX,"The KTX is a fantastic train, very comfortable and punctual. I have traveled in 1st class and economy class and would definitely recommend this train"
KTX (Korea's bullet train),"Very efficient way to travel through Korea ,fast and very punctual.Very fast loading of passengers."
Very convenient and speedy,It's really convenient to travel from Seoul to Busan by KTX. It's a rapid train. There are storage for luggages. The toilet was clean.
The best way to travel domestically,"My previous opinion hasn't altered.KTX remains terrific and the best way to see South Korea internally.Buy a KORAIL pass and soak up teh savings, plus upgrade to 1st class 2 plus 1 seating and free snacks for about KRW15000 extra one way Busan to Seoul.My train on that route was 18 cars and full capacity about 1870 passengers. Heaps join enroute on the stopping trains.it's essential to reserve seats in advance.Stations have lots of food and shopping options, and are clean."
Great way to see South Korea,"Foreigners are able to buy a variety of travel pass options.Check your travel plans to see if it's cost effective or just buy tickets as required.Trains were amazing. Clean, punctual to the minute. "
On time!,Not like European trains. KTX is on-time. Never saw a single delay on the board. Travelled 1st to Busan from Seoul. Got a biscuit and a bag labelled ”Welcome nuts”. 
Great way to explore Korea,"Very convenience, very punctuated, I took first class which expecting something more fancy. Will take it again"
Nice,"Great way to travel. Not on the same level as the Japanese Shinkansen, it still is wonderful, easy, and comfortable. Highly recommend using it!"
Amazing,"I love KTX trains. Used them 3 times during my Korea trip and I really like it. Nice and kind people working there and they also know english well, air conditioner inside, fast traveling, lot of space, easy traveling."
Fascinating!,The train is as good as Singapore.. The on;y unique thing about KTX are the platform.. you will see vendo machine and even vendors selling stuff and food which I find it cool :) unlike other strict country trains... Plus the train as this eucalyptus smell on all the trains.. or maybe because it s winter and the heater has this scent.
Fast and on time,We took this train from Seoul to Gyeongju and it was excellent. It cost $80 round trip and made the trek in 2 hours each way vs 5 hours by car. It is Korea’s bullet train and can reach very high speeds. It is THE smoothest train I have ever been on. We recommend it highly. 
Great way to travel Korea,Took train from Seoul to Busan. The 2.5 hour trip was very comfortable. Trains are very clean and fast. Seats recline and plenty of legroom. Electrical outlet is provided so charging your phone or laptop is a breeze. Complimentary wifi is provided and it worked well throughout the trip. Toilets are clean too. Highly recommended.
Room for improvement,"Ensure tickets are purchased for front facing or it would be uncomfortable. Lift to platform is tiny and allow time if you do not want to use the stairs especially when you have luggage. The steps up the train with luggage can be challenging too. Doesn't help when most staff speak only Korean. Luggage compartment for bigger luggage is very small and you may end up having luggage in another cabin if you come late. Train speed is not uniform and for shorter distance between stations, speed is slowed down. We spent 2.5 hours Seoul to Busan but 3 over hours from Busan to Seoul so please note when you purchase tickets, some timings would have more stops. Toilets available in train but hygiene is not there. Only some seats have sockets to charge your gadgets. "
Wish it existed in Australia,"Sensational --really great service and comfort-If you have the chance to travel rather than fly do so, you will not be disappointed."
Train to Busan,We got the train in the evening down to Busan. Getting to the tracks was fine in Seoul station and getting tickets was easy. Actually it would have been cheaper and less time to get a plane but the timings didn’t work! We were glad though we got to experience Korean train journey! The seats were comfortable in first class and we were given a small snack (a cake and some nuts). Comfortable journey.
Preferred City to City Travel,"We purchased the Korail Pass and found the website easy to use. After purchase, it was simple to book our tickets for each leg of our trip. Car and seat number were clearly printed on our tickets. The website said to print both the pass and tickets but no one ever asked us to see them. The trains were well maintained, comfortable, on time and fast. Luggage racks were located at the end of the cars and were able to accommodate our large suitcases. Luckily we we’re able find space on each leg so we did not need to lug them to our seats. Our seats had foot rests, overhead storage and reclined. The trains were comparable to the Shinkansen in Japan.The ride was smooth with limited stops which allowed us to sleep most of the way. Announcements, as well as LED displays, gave heads up on stations in multiple languages so we had good awareness on our location.The Busan, Seoul and Shinyeongju stations were big and busy but not too difficult to navigate. Each had waiting areas but you could walk to the designated track, even if the trains were not boarding, as there were no ticket takers or gates. With the exception of Shinyeongju, the stations were conveniently located in the heart of the cities we visited.In summary, the KTX was a great way to travel around Korea without the need to hop on a plane."
excellent!!,"Was very impressed by the efficiency and how on time the train is. Train is clean and seats are comfortable. They provide free wifi services as long as you are on the train. The toilets are clean too!We bought the train passes via Klook and it was easily redeemable. However, this pass cannot be refunded since it is purchased via third party agent."
"Comfortable, Fast and Efficient","Although more expensive than taking the bus or the regular train, we're happy that we opted to take the KTX to and from Gwangyeong - it was faster and more comfortable. "
Fantastic railway system,"If you think HK and SG were great, try Korea! By far the most complex railway system I have seen thus far, if you need to go around Korea, going by train is the best way to do it! Very efficient, fast and they can bring you all over the place! You have to purchase a T-Money card in order to ride. The good thing about the T-Money card, it can be also used on buses, taxis and even some establishments. You can pickup your T-Money card at any convenience store around Korea."
Interesting,We had the earliest train! I really liked that it wasn't crowded. KTX is on time and clean. What i didn't like was that the tv was quite loud and it didn't have airco
Perfect way to travel,"Clean, spacious, easy to book and very comfortable seats . All that you need to travel from City to City. Can highly recommend."
KTX-South Korea,"I traveled to Seoul Korea with my daughter and friend on 15 April 2019. Our first itenerary is to go to Gyeoungju South Korea. The best way to reach that historic and beautiful place from Seoul is via train. My daughter choose the KTX. I was so surprised because the train leaves and arrived on time. The train and its stations are very clean, spacious and orderly. KTX is comparable to the European and Japanese trains that I have travelled. I will still take the KTX when I travel back to South Korea. "
Super Fast Everything!,The train is well maintained and neat inside. Convenient way to get from Seoul to Busan in quick time with high speed internet on board. A unique trait of the staff on board - they bow to the passengers before disembarking at every station.
Very punctual and clean. But limited space to put big luggage.,"KTX train is very punctual.Interior is clean.Free wifi & can charge your phoneBut if you have many big luggage, can't put above your seat, have to find own space behind near the toilet and put there."
Depart on time,"You can book online which ia slightly cheaper, however i would suggest you to pay slightly more (than online fare) - arrive at the station and decide the next departure. You can easily book your train. There are many trains for you to choose according to the time you prefer. There are lots of food and convenient store around the station.The train leaves and arrive on time"
Excellent high speed trains.,"We took KTX twice, once from Pyeongchang to Seoul and then from Seoul to Busan. The train was absolutely on time, clean as a whistle and had comfortable seating. The main difference between these trains and the ones in Taiwan is that in Taiwan they serve tea or juice on the longer runs and in Korea they did not, but this is not really a problem. Just bring your own. The stations were large and open, capable of handling high volumes of traffic efficiently. The signage was generally very good, with English signs for Europeans and signs in Chinese and Japanese as well. The language diversity of the train system was laudable. I would gladly travel this way again. It offers a much better chance to see the country than flying. "
Nice way to travel,"Our guide took care of the tickets and all that, so I can't say if it is easy to get tickets. But the trains are comfortable, there is information in English. There are power outlets so you can charge your phone."
Travelling by train is a pleasure.,"This is so nice. Just book your train and seats in their portal, you can easily change your tickets and get a refund in case you made a mistake or just want another train, trains are very clean and always in time. Staff shows big respect for their clients. Example for the rest of the world. And there you go, with 300km an hour, as fast as a F1 car."
Needs improvement but accomplishes the mission,"I have taken the KTX numerous times for work and vacation. I have not had a bad experience yet caused by Korail. Their app works well, but you cannot buy tickets within 20minutes of the train departing. Even if there is an error it is best to check/refund ticket before trying to buy another ticket in case the first one went through. All the staff I have dealt with in Daegu and Seoul have spoken clear English. Their trains are delayed more often than Japanese ones. If you get a first class ticket you get free bottled water and some snacks. You can get standing room only tickets which means you can seat in an open seat but must give it up if someone that has a ticket for that seat comes through. The standing room only tickets are cheaper than any other ticket. The seats are comfy and normally have an outlet and USB outlets. With regular seats, it is odd as they don't rotate so the center seats face each other and all the seats after face towards that center row. It is an odd feeling to be traveling facing the opposite direction."
Great Way to Travel Korea,I used the KTX to travel from Seoul to Busan and return. I travelled first class seating and reserved my tickets online from Canada and printed them off for the trip. I used the Korail website but their are other agents that will book for you. Cost each way was just under $100 CDN and it took about 2:20 each way.The KTX is the high speed rail option (300kph) for travelling major routes in Korea. It is operated by Korail. There are other options that are slower and cheaper but may be an option for budget conscious travellers.The stations at Seoul and Busan are large and modern with all manner of amenities. The signs are in English as well as Korea and it is relatively easy to find your way around. About an hour before departure the track for your train will be displayed on the board and about 20 minutes before departure you can board the train on that platform. With a reserved seat just find the car and the seat on board.Many people bring food on board. First class had lots of table space and room to set up and eat. The numerous vendors around the station offered all manner of treats and supplies. I enjoyed Gimbap which are essentially long California Sushi Rolls. You also get a cookie and some nuts from the conductor.My ticket was never checked. The conductor came through (bowing when entering) and it appeared as if she compared a listing with which seats were occupied. All in all very straightforward and stress free.Seating was single on one side of the aisle and double on the other side. Lots of room and very comfortable. Carry on was stowed above my head in a rack and there was and area for large item storage by the entrance to the car. There were USB ports for device charging.There is public transit access outside the stations which are located in main business districts downtown.
Great,"What a fast and efficient service, we could learn a lot from the way that they run their transport system. It got up to 300 per hour, which was a delight"
Great train but CHINESE BULLET TRAIN FTW~!,"My first time going to Korea was May 2018(last year). Once I arrived at Seoul Railway Station, I rode on one of those trains to get from Incheon Airport to the city centre. Very long journey because the distance from Incheon to Gangnam is about 60+km!!! It felt comfortable inside with air-conditioning and route guide. However, the speed isn't as fast as the Chinese Bullet train that can go up to 400 km/hr. This one only goes 270km tops. Well, it's ok either way. "
"On time, efficient, comfortable","Great train system: on time, comfortable, and with big windows for viewing. The actual online system for getting tickets is, however, a real pain, especially if you first buy a pass and then need to get the specific tickets you want. Take seriously the requirement to remember (write down) the pass number."
"Quick, comfortable and better than flying","Travelled between Busan and Soeul without any worries. Speed about 300km/hr. Very comfortable, lots of room, far more than any plane. A better way to travel!"
Great way to travel,"I took the KTX train from Seoul to Busan and then back again a couple days later. The entire process was ridiculously easy. First, buy your tickets in advance online (I had no trouble with this, just use common sense and you’ll be fine). I bought the economy seat and it was nice. Then the day of, get to the station 20ish mins before departure. All you need is a printout of the ticket you bought online. Check the boards for the track number, follow the signs to the track, check you’ve got the right train (boards again or on the sign on the train itself), check the car number, board and find your assigned seat. They never even scan or look at your ticket. There is a luggage rack for big suitcases on each car, though if it is carryon size you can fit above your seat. There is a bathroom and small vending machine in each car as well. They display your destination and any stops along the way in English as well as Korean. The entire journey from start to finish was so easy and pleasant. "
Forward Facing,"Find your car# and then your seat within the car. From Seoul to Busan seats 9-16 are forward facing and 1-8 are backwards facing. From Busan to Seoul seats 1-8 are forward facing and 9-16 are backwards facing. Easy and comfortable way to get between these 2 cities. Get to the platform 30 mins early if you have big luggage and stow in between each car. Book tickets online at LetsKorail.com. If you get a seat facing backwards, just refresh the browser/restart the process again so a new seat# is assigned. To get a non-stop train, check the times to make sure that the train travel time is 2.5 hours. The stops don’t really add much time though and it’s still quick and efficient."
Korean Express Train,"This train service is the fastest train in Korea, they can reach speed above 270 KM/H but unfortunately this service is not running in dedicated line but sharing with other train service. If you have sensitive ear than maybe a problem with with your ear. Seat is decent in terms of pitch and width. "
Civilized way of travelling in Korea!,Took KTX from Seoul station to Dongdaegu for my personal travel. Although the train was showing some wear and tears it still looked well maintained. Boarding and departure was on time as usual and ride is very comfortable despite its high speed. Love the luggage rack space at the rear of the train cars as they are ideal for storing oversized luggage for travelers. It made a few quick stops at major cities along the way and I arrived in Daegu a few minutes ahead of schedule. The entire trip took about two hours. I find high speed train travel in Korea much more convenient than domestic flight as it saves you from heading to airport and clearing security etc. You can literally show up about 20 to 30 minutes at the station and get on the train. Convenience factor alone surely beats domestic air travel in Korea.
Pretty cool,"it was like any other train, much faster that the other local trains. expectation was of a super fast train but this was not even close."
Smooth and comfortable,"The ITX train we rode on going to Gapyeong was amazing. It had +20 carts and had upper and lower levels. The seats had ample legroom and could be turned to face the opposite direction, which is good for groups of four if you want to spend most of the ride chatting. There were clean bathrooms and the doors were automatic. I'm glad I was able to experience the ITX rather than taking the bus on my way to Nami Island, Petite France, and Garden of Morning Calm. "
Comfortable and easy to manage,"We traveled from Busan to Seoul. Our first class seats were comfortable. Though we had the help of local friends, the process of checking in and finding the right location seemed easy. We were hoping to see a lot of the countryside, but we quickly discovered that South Korea is a nation of tunnels, and much of the ride is inside tunnels. "
Brisk KTX,Loved their schedule and onetime service. Great train and network to be in and around Korea. This service is at par with anything in Europe.
KTX train from Seoul to Busan,"Taking the train from Seoul to Busan now.After having taken 6 trips on China's High Speed train, this Korean train is certainly not a high speed train. It is just a normal train with limited stops. Trains are a bit dated although the cabin is clean. But toilet outdated. Average speed is about 100 kmp. A bullet train speed in China is between 200 to 310. So don't be mistaken the KTX for a bullet train."
Great Transportation,"I love traveling by train and our experience on KTX was exceptional. We traveled from Seoul to Busan in southern South Korea and it was a dream. The train was inexpensive, fast and clean...I would rate this above any airline any day of the week. You get to see the countryside and relax in comfort with your assigned seat...a terrific way to travel."
A great experience,"A great trip, I upgraded to first class. Very quiet and comfortable. Power and USB outlets for each row"
KTX booking problem (when booking abroad),"I've struggled to book a ticket online from the US (east coast) as the website kept throwing reservation errors. It turns the transactions only go through during Korean business hours. If anyone else had this problem, simply wait until it's late (like midnight). But you will not be able to choose your seat."
Two Trips Both Good,"This is an excellent train company, at least on the two long distance trips that I took. The trains were impressively clean and on time. The costs are also very reasonable. The bullet train was impressively quick and handy for the centre of Busan and Seoul."
Quick,Quick clean fast and comfortable and only 41 minutes from the city centre and at around £6.00 per journey it’s a real winner 
"Fast and Quiet train, but a little bit oldies","I usually take a KTX train. It still fast and quiet. However, the train was not clean so smell waa not good. We can also take a SRT train.The KTX trains are neended to change a new one.Sometimes the arrival time could be delayed due to an accidental event."
Chose this over flying. ,"It was a toss up about traveling from Busan to Seoul. Glad at chose Korail KTX.I was but certain about booking online so went to Busan station to book the tickets 2 days ahead of the journey. Short queue, questions answered, train selected.I chose the 935 am train, economy class. Cost me about usd 63 for the trip. 2 tickets issued by a printer and charged to credit card. Couldn't be simpler. Coach number and seat number assigned. Arrived half hour before the departure time. Checked out the track number. Mine was track 6.15 min before the, an announcement was made to go in. Do check the lighted signboards.Walked to coach 15, boarded and relaxes for the 2 1/2 hr trip. No one e checked my tickets.Smooth ride all the way.Highly recommended. "
Poor KTX booking service,"I took KTX from Busan to Seoul on 30/3/2019 departure time 14:00. I came with a group of +/-100 persons (incl. elderly people and children) from Thailand. It's the first time that I visit Korea. After the train has passed around 2 stations. There are passengers (Korean) who got the tickets with the same seat number. They asked us to get out from the seat but we refused. After that, our tour leader and the guide were tricked by train officer. He told us to move to the next car which has more seats. So, in order to avoid trouble and argue with Korean passengers, we moved to next car. but there are no seats at all. This mean all of us have to stand for 2 hours to Seoul. The officers (old man and lady) in KTX has low service mind and can't communicate in English. I could say the rail system in Japan and China train are even better than KTX/Korail. Moreover, even you want to send the complain letter, they have no e-mail or FB to hear the feedback from customer as well. So, don't expect for improvement in near future."
Loved how easy it was to travel via KTX,"Although the prices seem a little high, think about the distance you are travelling. 40,000KW takes you about 400 kms. Very comfortable and great views along the way. "
Very comfortable with free WiFi ,"Seoul Station to Deaugu, KTX is the best means of transport. KTX makes my visit very easy and comfortable. To and fro same day is only possible via KTX. Further being a foreigner, we do not have local sim or any 4G facility, thanks to KTX for free high speed WIFI. "
Great way to get across Korea,"We really enjoyed our trip on the KTX from Seoul to Busan and back. It was fast, efficient, clean, comfortable, and a good way to see some of the Korean landscape outside of the main cities. Onboard wifi and USB charging ports are a bonus.However, the ticketing and seat booking process is somewhat confusing - despite pre-purchasing our passes, we had to sort out our tickets once we were in Seoul as we were travelling with kids and both the website and phone customer service was unclear. Also, seats at popular times at popular times book out quickly, so do this earlier if you can."
It has WiFi and charging points,We took this train twice from Seoul to Busan and Busan to Seoul. It’s nice to have WiFi in the train and charging points since it’s around a 2 hour trip. The train is not new but it’s in acceptable condition.
KTX train,"What an amazing experience to drove at 300km/h through the midlands of Korea. Changwon to Seoul. Stations are clean and tidy, so are the trains"
"Convenient, fast and clean",We use this train to go to & fro Seoul - Busan. Its really fast which only using 2h30m for a distance of 329km to travel to the destination. The train is clean and comfortable. Highly recommended if u wanna travel to busan or Seoul for sight-seeing view. 
KTX train to Busan from Seoul,"We had a pretty bad experience taking the KTX train from Seoul to Busan. We did some research prior to our trip to Seoul and all reviews said there were multiple and regular trains to Busan. When we reached Seoul Station at around 1 pm, we were told by the counter staff that the next available direct train was at 5 pm plus. As we did not wish to waste our time (4 over hours) waiting for that train, we took the next offer to go on another train departing at 2.45 pm but there were NO seats left and we have to stand all the way to Busan and there were 6 stops before it reached our final destination. The worse nightmare in the train was that there were actually NO standing space. We have to stand outside the toilet and or near the space for putting the lugguages. Besides us, there were also others standing around too. One guy literally sat on top of the toilet seat throughout the journey when nobody used the toilet! Lesson learnt: make sure to buy the ticket online prior to your trip if you wish to take the train to other cities in South Korea. The reason why we did not buy the tickets prior to our flying there was, we read a number of reviews and all these reviewers said there will be NO hassle getting the train tickets upon arrival in Seoul! That is definitely incorrect information! PLEASE REMEMBER to buy the tickets online from Korail’a website prior to your trip!"
Experience High Speed Rail,"Travel from Seoul all the way to Busan in under 2.5 hours. It was a smooth ride with free WiFi, comfortable seating Travel on KTX several times."
Travelled from Busan To Seoul,Very fast and efficient.We used the first class carriage which was roomy and comfortable.each seat had USB & socket charging points.
"Efficient, Fast and Comfortable","We have used the KTX six times now, always between Seoul and Daejeon, which is an hour out of Seoul on the Seoul to Busan line.Tickets can be booked online, where you can select an English language version of the website and it it VITAL to pre-book, well in advance, because trains fill up. Bizarrely, once booked, you are unlikely to be asked for your ticket as KTX employees patrol the carriages making a note of occupied seats, hence, as long as you have a ticket and are sitting in the correct seat, you are fine.Seats are comfortable, in pairs, although there is an option when booking to request a group of four with a table between - few in number, very popular and sell out quickly. You have a foot rest and a lap table which folds away into the back of the seat in front. There are toilets in each carriage, together with mother and baby facilities, and we have been given bottles of water by staff asking through the carriage, although not on every occasion.Etiquette on the train, of which you will view various videos on the subject on the overhead screens in the carriage, is that passengers are quiet whilst the train is in motion.Announcements regarding the next station are given about five minutes in advance. The train does not stand in any station for very long, so you do need to be prepared. Announcements are given in Korean and English.There are luggage racks overhead, but these are only really suitable for hand luggage. If, like us, you are catching the KTX after a long haul flight and have large suitcases, you will need to store them in the luggage area by the doors of the carriage and this is my biggest gripe with the KTX trains - they are sadly lacking in luggage storage for large pieces, which is unusual for a service which is running outwards from the capital city. The step up and down into the carriage is also high and steep and requires some effort with a large suitcase, although the Korean people are exceedingly polite and helpful and I have had many incidences of help with getting on and off trains.When arriving at Seoul station and potentially progressing onto the metro system, you will also find that it is not always user friendly for those with heavy luggage, with stairs being the only option at some stations and some quite lengthy walks between stations.Because of this, we are planning to use the bus in future. But, if you aren’t loaded down with luggage and are young and fit and strong, then this is an excellent way to fan out from Seoul to the regions of Korea."
Comfortable!,"The first time to take KTX from Seoul to Busan, efficiency with a high speed. Comfortable seats that are good for sleep in the morning or the midnight."
An option,I Have considered this option only because my route gave me no alternatives...It is not a cheap way to move from Busan to Seoul and viceversa (as well as Korean Air flights every hour at a very reasonable price) but I have enjoyed the free wifi and the comfortable sears
EXCELLENT OPTION!,"KTX is an excellent option if you are traveling in Korea served by this rail line. Super clean, efficient reservation system, free wi/fi, overhead t.v., quiet and fast. Busan to Seoul in 2.5 hours! Of course you will pay for this privilege but it is well worth it. Great value for the money. "
Great transportation,I have taken the train a couple of times between Seoul and Gumi. They are very comfortable and always on time. Great way to travel in South Korea.
Efficient,"At speeds reaching 295 km/hr, I found this an amazing way to travel Korea. Train was on time. Easy and relatively inexpensive ticketing. Clean. Great layout at stations. Seats with phone charging ability. Snack vending machines and toilets on board."
17 Minutes to Gangnam!,I've taken this a few times and it's completely worth the drive to the station to catch the KTX. Only 17 minutes to Gangnam!!!
COSY,"The train is very clean, cosy and worth for the price. Its on time. You can see the beauty scenery along the track"
Fast and Less Stops than Other Train,"Get to Nami Island from Seoul and return is fast using this one, just have to know where to find it because it only found at particular station"
Clean & on-time.,"runs like clock works, and cheap and fast enough for a day trip to Busan from Seoul. Sure beats the waiting on the airport for a short ride."
So fast and nice and clean.,"I like to take KTX train when I don't want to take the bus, or I want a faster way to get home. KTX is very convenient. A can be pricey, which is the negative. It gets you faster to your destination, compared to the bus, but it can be pricey. However, the ride is smooth, and you can rest and pull your chair back to rest. So much more comfortable just a little bit than being in the airplane. "
Fast and comfortable fast train service,Took the train service from Daejeon and Seoul and it was an extremely smooth ride. Seats were comfortable and there was wifi on board. Trains generally ran on time and You could get tickets online or at the train station itself. Just a point to note that it’s best to buy your return ticket ahead of time because certain routes are very popular and it might be inconvenient if you do not manage to get a ticket which entitles you to a seat because it means standing in the small space between train carriages
Easy and direct access from Inchon Airport,"Inchon Airport has signs, and the ticket counter has English Speaking clerks. Trains can be local (stops before Seoul) or Express (non-stop). Very clean, modern, inexpensive. "
A great way to get to Busan from Seoul,"A comfortable ride, although not as fast as you would expect or as hyped (not as fast as Shinkansen). Coach seats are comfortable and the view from the windows is good. Limited food and drink on board (just a few vending machines), so bring your own (lots of choices in the station). Arrive early to avoid the last minute rush of boarding the train, especially if you have large luggage over 21 inches. As seats are reserved, pretty much exclusively, buy on-line ahead of time. Note that KTX website in English can be frustrating and make sure to read the entire page before submitting. View out the windows is good, but your neighbors may put the shades down and block your view. Train was clean and well maintained."
smooth ride,"went to Busan with KTX train. Since i purcuas business class ticket, the seat is very comfortable with a lot of leg room. Although it is not the same ""business class"" as the airline can provide, with only a little bit more than two hours ride, this is the best and cheapest business class ticket you can get. Totally worthy, in my opinion. In addition, you can arrive at the platform 10 minutes before the departure time (2 hours for your air travel!!!) , no checkin, no security checkpoint, no passport.....no hassel!! You can get up and walk around as you wishes. Also, free wifi is available too. Overall, its a good experience. I'lll definitely choose KTX again to other cities in Korea next time when I travel. "
Train to Busan,"Very convenient way of travelling from Seoul to Busan. The KTX had USB charging ports and drink vending machines. Best to purchase some food and drinks before boarding the KTX. Took approximately 2 - 3 hours to reach from Seoul to Busan and vice versa. There were multiple timings for the train and you can either purchase your ticket at the train station or online. First time taking the KTX after going to Korea for so many times. Nonetheless, efficient way of travelling from the northern region of South Korea to the southern region. A bit pricy but worth the journey. I was also recommended by my friend to purchase tickets via Klook which was slightly cheaper. "
Efficient Train Ride,"Took KTX to Busan and train ride was good, uneventful 2h10m experience. Bought tickets on line before I arrive and was able to print them. Took metro to Seoul Station, looked up track (avail about 1 hr before departure) and boarded. Bought second class tickets (4 seats across width of train with center aisle). Seats were comfortable. Took some snacks and napped a bit and was in Busan before you knew it. Very efficient service."
"Watch ""Train to Busan"" :)","Caught the KTX from Busan to Seoul and back again. Annoucements at the KTX stations are in Englih so it's easy to find the right platform when the time comes.The trains departed on the dot (so don't be late), the seats were comfy and clean.Travel time is apporx. 2.5 hours in each direction.There's a movie called ""Train to Busan"" which was a hit - catch it if you can, you don't have to know Korean to enjoy it."
Korea in December,"Best way to go from Seoul to Busan. Train is clean and efficient. Timing is really on the dot, don’t be late :)"
fantastic experience,"fast, convenient, extremely clean, great impression of the Korean countryside, unforgettable experience"
just a regular interior but fast!,"wanted to try this fast train just to compare with shinkansen and tgv. the interior is just like a regular train, but it helped us to arrive in Busan only <3 hours."
convenient and cheaper option for single/couple,"Leaves every 30-40 mins, English spoken at ticket counters, refund on plastic card/ticket at end of use. Comfy and clean train. Make sure you get on the one that has only one stop."
Easy to navigate,The KTX was a great way for us to get from the airport to our destination and back at the end of our trip! Easy to navigate and enjoyable and clean.
Not up to par with other high speed rail,"The very first thing I noticed about this train is that it almost looks like an Amtrak train, inside and out. The train design is outdated, and certainly doesn’t look like it belongs being a bullet train. I will get back to the design issue shortly. On the inside, half of the cars seats face forward, half backwards, with no ability to change them. There is also no way that I know of to determine which direction your reserved seat will face. That aside, the inside of the train is stuffy, the grey carpet roofing tacky, and just a generally dated design.Here is where the exterior and interior design issues come together: the train hits speeds of up to 265km (164miles) per hour. It’s cabin does not pressurize/depressurize properly, leaving you with bloated ears and general discomfort most of the way. Combined with the stuffy interior, and a backward facing seat, you may, like me, wish you had taken a bus.One other thing I learned about this train is that other than different colored seats and a tad more space and free bottled water, there is no additional benefit to reserving first class seats, something which even Amtrak in America has figured out.For some perspective, I’ve been on high speed trains in Europe and Japan, and other than its speed which the cars are ill-suited for, this train is not in the same league. It’s just a regular train with a powerful engine, totally not meant for the sub-par cars it’s attaches to."
Use public transportation in Korea,Trains and subways are very easy to use and much cheaper than taxis. You can get a subway/train card and load money on it as needed. 
KTX Train,"We traveled round trip from Seoul to Gyeongju by KTX train. The KTX Train was timely and and priced reasonably. The cost was about 50-60 USD per person for economy and took about 2 to 2 1/2 hours each way to travel the 275 to 280 km. The ride was comfortable, the seats were similar to economy class by air with more room. There is also space for luggage. The KTX trains are designed to provide timely transportation and they do. The KTX car was was one of 18 on our train, the passenger compartments were a comfortable temperature and there is no smoking, both of these features were appreciated. Having never ridden a “bullet” train we were pleased that neither acceleration nor deceleration was too noticeable. The train did not have a dining car so if you wish food or drinks you need to bring your own. Lastly the KTX train’s have many convenient terminal locations . Met our desires as transportation and was uneventful in a good way. "
"Clean, on time and fast train ","Took a train from Busan to Seoul. Ticket priced at 59,800 won per pax for economy class.Train depart on time and it’s very clean and cosy ride. Instead of taking domestic flight, this is another option to consider.Merry Xmas!"
KTX,"I have travelled on KTX in economy and First class, it is an excellent way to travel, the trains are very punctual"
"KTX = Definition of comfort, speed, and already there?","Going off from the title, I was relax and have my own time, but because it was so comfortable, my 2 hour ride felt like 10 minutes and helped me realize the simplicity and benefits of riding this. 10/10 definitely would recommend to others."
Fast,Perfect way to get from Soeul to Busan. Very comfortable three hour trip. Runs regularly.. Great way to see the countryside.
KTX train perfect way to travel,We booked 1st class roomy and comfortable. Service excellent the cars interiors are very nice quality. High technology went into this system
travel fast and relaxed?,then use the KTX. Nice and smoth from A to B on low fares. Don't use the crowded roads. Tickets are easily to get online. Even for foreigners. So check it out.
Korean Holiday,"High-speed KTX trains are a fast and comfortable way to travel to Busan. With a top speed of 305 km/h (190 mph), the KTX-Sancheon is the second commercial high-speed train operated in South Korea and the first domestic high-speed train that is designed and developed in South Korea. Travel time is approximately 2-1/2 hours. A limited number of KTX trains run directly from Incheon Airport to Busan. Service from Seoul Station in Central Seoul to Busan is more frequent and more convenient. You can make your reservations for a seat or standing room directly or over the internet at a discount. We made seat reservations over the internet."
KTX and ITX,"Its definitely a must if you travel out of Seoul, because subway will took forever and confusing if the same colour subway line had a split in route, the subway captain will only report in Korean! Although it's expensive but consider the distance and speed, I feel it is justified. Comfortable and hassle free. If you can't get a seated ticket, there is few cabinet where you can seat provided if is not occupied.One great thing I notice is KTX or ITX station. Lift is link all the way to ground level! OK for baby stroller or handicap, you will greatly appreciate this! Carrying baby stroller climbing those staircase are a nightmare!!!Enjoy my ride! But hope that the train ticket conductor can communicate in English will be a plus! "
Very convenient for a travel access the country ,"So far I have traveled for at least 5 times with KTX during my business trips to Korea and every single time I’m super impressed. Trains are always on time, Internet works well, seats are very comfortable and there are sufficient space. Super clean and tidy etc. The price of a train tickets is a bit high, but the travel is worth the money. It’s Very convenient!"
Very convenient traveling in South Korea,Easy to buy tickets and the seats are assigned.There are food and drinks available on board.Just only one thing I don't understand is their seating plan.They have half of the seat facing towards the way and another half sitting backwards.
easy to use and comfortable,"I caught the KTX train to Busan. It was easy to manage at the station as the signs were very clear, we had numbered seats which were very comfortable. This is definitely the way to move around quickly."
Bad experience,"This could be an isolated case but when I took the KTX from Busan to Seoul, there was a power outage which caused the train to be delayed by more than 4 hours. KTX staff could not speak English and I had to figure things out on my own (where to take the train, when will the train arrive etc). The journey from Busan to Seoul in the end took 6 hours, with long stops at various stations. I am highly disappointed in the service, considering how high the price is compared to other mode of transportation. Would expect staff to be able to converse in basic English or announcements to be made in English."
A great way to travel,"The KTX is a very effective way of travelling in Korea. The advantages are that you know timings which can help at the arrival end, the seats have plenty of legroom but there is no meal service on the train although on the trip when travelling First Class from Seoul to Busan we did a small box with some nuts and pretzels, hardly a snack so you should take some food and drinks."
unbelievable,"if you dnt want to be lost in KTE stations, a navigational map is a must because train line inter change a lot. There is an english translator in every stop. Slow pace on the right side."
Clean and Fast,"Korean train system is one of the best in the world. They are fast, on time, and clean. If you need to travel around Korea this is the way to go. "
Quick and Convenient,"I travelled from Seoul to Busan round trip in October on the KTX, The trip was easy to book online and left and returned to Seoul Station. If you catch a taxi and have luggage, be sure to ask the driver to drop you close to the elevator at Seoul Station. Train travel is a lot more relaxing than flying, having to be at the airport early, and having to deal with standing in lines for security and collecting your luggage. All train stops are announced in five languages."
High speed trip to Busan and back same day.,"Easy to get ticket and reserved seat at main Seoul station. Impressive train - looks like French TGV and over twenty coaches long. Good views of the countryside. Interior of train is clean and neat and refreshments easy to get. Nice trip to Busan, couple of hours in that city and then back to Seoul."
Book Online if You Want a Reserved Seat,"Its very efficient and comfortable, but we suggest you book online in advance if you are expecting a long trip so you don't go through standing. "
"Train to Busan, Great way to Explore!","I purchased a KTX ticket to Busan from Seoul Station a few days prior. The tickets are fairly expensive, but in the end the ride was quick and convenient. I arrived at the platform about 15 minutes before departure and the train left on time. It was about a two hour, give or take, ride to Busan. The train was quiet, smooth, spacious, and comfortable. Overall, great experience!"
The best way to see Korea,"We used KTX trains to travel from Seoul to Jeonju, Gyeongju and Busan. The KTX network is fantastic! The tickets are relatively cheap, much cheaper than Japan's high speed trains. The trains are so fast and smooth with comfy seats, travelling is a pleasure instead of a chore."
Fast and smooth way to travel,"KTX is the Korean version of Japan's bullet train that whizzes you around Korea at speeds over 300 kph. Our journey from Seoul to Pusan took just over 2.5 hours which was far quicker than flying, considering we didn't need to get out to the airport or check in early. The carriages were clean and the seats comfortable."
Fast and Efficient,The KTX is a fast and efficient way to go to Seoul from the airport and vice versa. The seats are very comfortable and there are plenty of space to put your luggage.
Train ride to Busan,"the ride was enjoyable. I was able to enjoy some nice scenery on the way to Busan. Even though, we choose the economy seat, it was very clean and quite spacious. "
Seoul to Busan Hi-speed train,I highly recommend taking this train from Seoul to Busan. I did 1st class which is about $71.00. The seats were nice and wide with ample leg room. You get free water and some snacks as well. Not sure it was worth the $20 difference from economy class though. There is free WiFi on the train. Its a nice a way to see Korea as well. Enjoy your adventure.
Confort and simpaty,"I ask ti change my ticket for a early train, bit the train was soldout, but the lady that was selling the tickets, ask me to wait and she was checkinh all the time someone cancel the ticket, and sh had sucess"
Korea Trains system is great.,Staffs are helpful. The English signs are clear. Ticket vending machine is user friendly for people do not know Korean. Great System.
Fast and Efficient,Great service. Enjoyed the ride from Busan to Seoul.The online booking process was efficient. Collecting the tickets from Busan station was quick.
"Smooth, fast and comfortable","We took the KTX from Seoul to Pusan (Busan). Our hosts paid for our tickets and we went 1st Class. It was very spacious and comfortable. There are great views of the Korean countryside, which is very pleasant, especially the rice paddy fields. The train is quiet and you don't realise how fast you are going until you pass a train coming in the opposite direction. With both trains travelling at close to 300 km/hr, a 200-metre long train flashes by in less than 1 second."
Great railway,I enjoyed using the KTX to go from Seoul to Daegu. It was a quick 2-hour ride in a clean and peaceful train car. Will do every chance.
Train to Busan!,"If you are going to Busan, do take this train which takes 2 hours & 40 minutes. I find that the flexi 2 day pass is useful & cheaper compared to purchase single trip. However, this is not a bullet train so it actually quite slow as compared to shinkansen."
Well connected and very fast,"I had taken the KORAIL Pass for tourists for 3 days as I on the first day itself I was travelling from Seoul to Gyeongju, next day from Gyenongju to Busan and then to Seoul. If you don't have KORAIL Pass, you can purchase the tickets. It is faster and the seats are comfortable."
Quick trip from Seoul to Busan,The KTX is the best way to travel from Seoul to Busan. The fast speed train only takes 2.5 hours for the 330 km. The seats are not luxurious but comfortable enough. The train makes the most sense for this distance.
First class from Busan to Seoul,Comfortable. Clean. On time. Limited staff. Easy to use. Efficient.I would use the train system again. Overall a good experience. We traveled from Busan to Seoul with no issues.
Train to Daegeon,"Train on time slightly expensive, Seating arrangement is not realy spacious. Overall the distance is not far so its ok."
Trains are on time and relatively cheap,"I booked the KTX first class from Busan to Seoul. You go to the platform 15-20 mins before departure. Basically no security checks whatsoever. When you book online, the tickets are immediately issued and you would have to print out a physical copy and save it as a softcopy for backup as they do not email a copy to you. There is no need to exchange the printout again at the station for another ticket. The pros are the trains leave on time and the first class has enough leg room, some cookies and water is provided. There are areas to store limited large baggages on either side of the car and smaller ones can go on top of the cabin seats. This is run like a lean machine, very few employees on board. There is free wifi but signals can be intermittent. Ride is smooth. The pleasant experience is somewhat marred by the behavior of some of the passengers. There are a few who will target foreigners and pressure them into thinking they have the wrong seats and to give it up. Finding your correct seat is idiot proof so there is no way one can sit in the wrong place unless it is deliberate. Everything from the Train, Car and seat Number is stated clearly on the ticket so stand your ground if this happens even when they start to talk loudly or argue to embarrass you. I suspect many do not adhere to their asdigned seats or pay extra for a higher class seat and move around the train hoping they can get away with it. Other than this, it is a fast and pleasant way to get around major cities in Korea. I would give this 4.5 stars as a train service and 3 stars because of some minority passengers. "
Efficient and dependable.,"I use the KTX for business trips. The trains are punctual. Once in the train, the car seats are comfortable. Would be great if they had charging stations. Otherwise, the KTX is a great comfortable ride when traveling in Korea city to city."
