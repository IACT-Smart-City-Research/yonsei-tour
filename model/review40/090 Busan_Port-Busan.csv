Wandering Busan ,"Spent 11 days in Busan, mostly doing the walking tourists thing, not too big a place so much to see in a few hours of walking.The port itself is much of muchness, same as any other port possibly a bit cleaner than some and a bit better viewing deck."
Good wifi and connectivity with city,This is one of the best cruise terminal I ever visited with the best speed of wifi as well good connectivity with city and plenty of festivals outside the port and good staff in the terminal to help you
Not for Ballroom dancers,"There is no provision to get to a cruise ship on tripadvisor.except like this. If your main interest going on a cruise ship is Ballroom dancing, don't go onWesterdam. The main dance floor only play 4 beats Blue music and DJnot knowing what is a quick step nor foxtrot ! He played Cha Cha 5 times ina row until you are too bored to leave. Resturant, bar, room quality staffs were friendly. Dinning room staffs wereexceptional, food was good. But have to line up for staff to give you food atLido resturant. A waste of money to go to the Pinnacle Grill because qualitywas bad but quantity was big. Overall the free dinning room was better.Free Shuttle buses going from port to city centre on nearly every port fit yourtime schedule. Embarkation at Shanghai was a mess. People had to wait o/sentrance for hour without knowing what is going on after getting the ship card.Holland America staff just not letting you get on the ship by keeping your passportin her hand while local immigration staffs were waiting for us to pass throughinside. Debarkation at HK was smooth , fast and efficient. No problem getting ontaxi in less than 15 min."
"NATALIE ""PORT""MAN","This port is quite extension, allowing one to import and export goods. One can receive goods off of boats here and off of ships."
Easy to navigate,"The city of Busan offered a free shuttle from the port to a Central Park with a light house. The shuttle was clean and had wifi. The drop off location was great, right in the middle of the action."
Shore excursion in Busan with ToursbyLocals,"Our Japan cruise included Busan - we had no idea what to expect but hired Frank based on very good reviews. We were not disappointed - the tour was outstanding and he was one of the best tour guides we’ve engaged anywhere in the world, with excellent command of English. We arrived thinking we’d fill the day with some sightseeing around the second largest city in South Korea, and left with a real appreciation of the beauty and history of the city. I highly recommend the tour and Frank as your guide. "
"Unexpected, remarkable and enjoyable ","This place was never on my must see list but now that I have spent a couple of days here I want to come back for more. The markets and streets are a hive of activity, people are friendly but don’t expect much English. This thriving city has lots to offer from temples hanging off cliff sides to broad beaches. A modern skyscraper city with shambling little neighbourhoods. Don’t miss the fish market which is the best I have ever been to. You can tell how good a city is by its fish market!!Great eateries although I wasn’t sure what I was eating. Western food and restaurants are of a high standard but I think stay local and enjoy. It’s easy to spend hours walking the streets but try the metro and buses. Worth taking a tourist guide book with you to point to where you want to go to. I will be back."
Well designed for cruise ships,"Despite what you may have heard, this is an incredible stop. Make it a point to get off the ship! Busan is really special. The city is huge--5.5 million population--and has some of the most beautiful new structures you will see ANYWHERE! The cruise terminal is a wonderful creative structure that looks great as you approach. The cruise line (Celebrity) had arranged for the tour busses to meet us at the ship. There was no problems in getting on the busses, but the traffic in the city is miserable. We were an hour late in returning because of traffic jams."
A few hours in Busan,"Enjoyed the few hours we had there, as in Japan the language barrier was a problem but we managed to get around the city without too much problem, the Gukje markets are huge, a lot of the same style of goods, we went to the Lotte department store, we only saw the underground level and bought some great bargains in shoes and clothing, we actually ran out of time, the Busan tower is worth a visit, there is a massive escalator that takes you up, the downside is you have to take the steps down not too bad, my wife has a bad hip and she managed fine, you need a good day to see the city or a small part of it anyway, huge place, dont always except the first price given e.g we asked the price for a t shirt he wanted $35.00 we walked away and he dropped it to $25.00 most dont bargain, most of the ones we asked stuck to there price"
"Busan Port, South Korea",As we entered Busan with a cruise ship we had nice views of the port and its modern buildings.The new cruiseport is hypermodern and airy and offers free wifi.Immigration and customs are well-and modern-equipped and formalities are simple and smooth.
Efficient and friendly welcome to cruise passengers,Efficient welcome at the cruise terminal . Well organised transfer to waiting coaches although i was late due to huge long slow queue at the money exchange. Modern overhead spiral motorway soon gets you out of town.
Nice cruise port,I'm not sure what the old port was like but this one is pretty nice. We stopped here on our Princess cruise in March. Very modern facilities and tons of space for all the buses that picked us up.
Very modern port,This port is very modern and busy... and clean!We caught the hydrafoil from here to Fukuoka and it was a breeze going through immigration.You will have to pay an exit fee as well as a facility fee too.
What an Amazing place,"We didn't know what to expect of Busan, as we went on a day tour whilst on a cruise around Japan which visited South Korea as well.The level of activity in new buildings, freeways and other infrastructure is probably the most surprising of any place I've been to in Europe, Asia, Africa or Australia"
Nice services for arriving cruise ship passengers,"The new port in Busan where the larger cruise ships dock is a vast improvement over the previous port. Next to the docked ship is a small Customs and Immigration building that has a shopping area plus free Wi-Fi. Each time we've been there, a ""portable bank"" has been set up in the parking lot for money exchange. This is a great place to exchange all of your leftover currencies from other SE Asia countries into the Korean Won. Be careful, however, of people roaming the lot offering to exchange money from their wallet. I don't have proof that it's a scam, but why would they be there when an official bank is already there?"
Clean and efficient ,"Visited here on a flying cruise. The immigration process is very easy here no crowds like huge airports. Clean and tidy. Well laid out. With friendly staff. The fast ferry from Japan passed us as we were about to dock earlier in the day. It was a hydrofoil, neat sight. Probably not worth a visit for any reason other than using the facility. "
特別路線! 乘坐慢船由釜山到福岡的好方法! Taking a ferry from Busan to Fukuoka,"由釜山到福岡有幾種方法，較多人選擇的方法應該是飛機和快船。但我和伴侶選擇了乘坐慢船，因為可以享受一下船上的設施之餘，亦可以節省3小時的交通時間(快船需要3小時)和一晚的酒店房租。 我和伴侶是由香港出發到釜山，再由福岡番回香港(multi-city flight ticket)。慢船大約7點開始check in (於Camellia Line Co 的櫃檯check in)，早到了的遊客可於碼頭逛一逛，碼頭內有餐廳和便利店，可在便利店購買零食和手信。乘搭慢船的乘客其實不多，大部分都是韓國的叔叔和嬸嬸，還有一小部份的是年輕的backpackers。由釜山到福岡的慢船由韓國船公司和日本的船公司聯合營運 (韓國船公司: Korea ferry co. ltd, 日本的船公司: Camellia Line Co., Ltd)。韓國船公司的網站不太支援英文，令到購買船票有點難度，可以的話可請韓國的朋友代為購買。慢船有幾等船艙，有最高級的Delux 房間，亦有2人、4人和二等11人大房。我們選擇了最便宜的二等船艙，幸運的是當晚只有5人入住我們的二等船艙，可以享用更多的空間。慢船上有一間餐廳，亦有不少娛樂設施，包括Karaoke room 和遊戲機房，還有一個大澡堂 (非常舒服) 和晚上在房間的電視內播電影! 當晚便放映了007 Quantum of solace!~ 我們還在甲板上待了一會兒，在甲板上可以欣賞到廣安大橋的美景! 本來我們想等待開船，看一看經過廣安大橋的美境，但等到11點多，船仍未開。但不到翌日的7點，船已經到達了福岡，基本上我們沒有感受到船移動便已由釜山到達福岡 LOL 乘坐慢船由釜山到福岡是一個方便而非常特別的方法!~~~推薦喜歡安排特別行程的朋友們~注意: 1. 出發到福岡的慢船由Busan International Passenger Terminal 釜山的國際碼頭出發，我們一開始去錯了釜山港國內碼頭，需轉乘的士到國際碼頭。2. 慢船上用餐和自動販賣機都是用日圓，最好上船前先兌換一些日圓。"
Busy Port,Our cruise ship the Celebrity Millennium docked at this port. We were greeted with Korean dancers and music. What fun! The port is very industrial being the largest port city in South Korea and the 5th largest in the world. It is not an attractive area to walk. Hence shuttles were provided out of the port to a shopping area in Busan.
International Ferry station inside Busan port,We took the 8:45am hydrofoil jet ferry from Busan to Fukuoka here. We arrived with the shuttle bus that stopped in front of the our hotel and dropped us at the entrance of the maritime station. Check in was quick and boarding was easy and well indicated by panels and port employees. Inside there are duty free shop and restaurants/coffee shops.
A place to stroll,Ot is an easy stroll along the waterfront and you get to see the port which is a busy place and full of action.
Not a lot to do here but good access to the city.,We cruised into Busan and the port and terminal had plenty of transportation available to get into the city. People were very friendly.
International terminal is a breeze!,"Easily accessible terminal for ferry access...just remember to bring cash for the port tax! Bright, clean, and easy to navigate even if the Korean language leaves you boggled. "
Place to take overnight boat to Jeju,"The building is a bit run-down, can get very crowded just before ferry departures, most of facilities are old, like toilet and chairs. Nevertheless it's very convenient that you can buy tickets for ferry at the same building (companies are just upstairs, not at the ground floor)"
Not really that nice,"We thought there would be some kind of fisherman’s wharf or something by people saying there are restaurants and activities. It sure was not like that at all. It’s a port. There are a few restaurants but there’s no fanfare, no attractions, no specials, not touristy at all. Don’t bother!"
good for walking,"The port area is nice, good for a walk on a nice day. Also plenty of street food options around and markets. Especially if you're looking for seafood there are many vendors."
Stay on the cruise ship,We had a short time in port from 8-2The walk from the pier to the street was 25 minutesThe shopping wasn't worthwhile Stay on the ship
Free bus to town!,Port is excellent with a free bus to town! Easy in and out but the line was long to get back. So we took a very cheap taxi. Honest and cheap. 
Interesting and informative,"Busy place, got to see interesting places. Beaches near the port and shopping malls nearby. Very walkable. Great to visit!"
it's a port,not much special about it. easy enough to get in and out of. There wasn't much to do or eat nearby when we went through. 
One of the businest ports in the world!,Busan is a very busy port and there is now the óld'port and 'new'port. It is worth a look if you are not from a city that has a large shipping component. 
Meh,"It's a fishing port. There are fish mongers and fish restaurants... but you can get the same food (cheaper) anywhere else in Busan. It's rather dirty and smelly. You can check out jagalchi market but if you've ever gone to a large fish market in Asia...you've seen everything already. I recommend, if you're there and have a free day, hop on a ferry to Japan."
Visit to Busan,"Its a very fantastic place. Busan is a silent city. People are very kind & generous. Busan, a large port city in South Korea, is known for its beaches, mountains and temples. Busy Haeundae Beach has a Folk Square with traditional games such as tug-of-war, while Gwangalli Beach is a nightlife hub with views of modern Diamond Bridge. Beomeosa, a Buddhist temple built in 678 C.E., is at the base of Geumjeong Mountain, which offers challenging hikes.Busan hosts the Busan International Film Festival (BIFF)—one of the most popular international film festivals in Asia—at the Busan Cinema Center every fall. It is also the home of the Busan Biennale, an international contemporary art biennale which takes place every two years.It also hosted the 2nd Asia Song Festival, organised by Korea Foundation for International Culture Exchange, in 2005.[27]In 2012 German artist Hendrik Beikirch, along with Public Delivery, painted Asia and the world's tallest mural.[28]"
Deliscious Sashimi,"When it comes to Busan, I imagine this place.I ate Sashimi of several kinds of fish.Compared with restaurants in Japan, the price is quite reasonable."
"Save your time. Flash, trash, I just don't get it",Like an Asian low-end Vegas (and I don't like Vegas). I flew from Seoul for the beaches and had no idea what the fuss was about. Yuk. Flew back to Seoul in 2 days.
Ferry t Japan,Awesome trip to japan. Reasonable price and very clean. The ladies and gentlemen were extremely polite. 
"Best Vareity of Sea Food, some never seen before.","South Korea's second-largest city is known for its colossal fish markets. These are traditional fish markets where you can find big lobsters, king crab from local fishermen. They can cook for you right there but prices are not cheap. Top shore excursions include visits to the Busan Tower, Taeshin Park and the crowded beaches at Haeundae. Tourists will also want to experience the fantastic views from the mountaintop Kumjongsansong Fortress or listen to chants of the monks at Temples. Busan has a history of Chinese and Japanese influences as far back as 6 century BC. Fortunately one Korean Emperor invented a completely and distinctly new Language being used till now, make Korean proud."
people nice staffs not so nice,"the building was clean but pretty small and smelled stinky. if you need to shop something in this building, you should not expect you could get something nice one because the shops were pretty expensive than the ones in the city and they were a little dirty. but staffs who works in there were very nice and kind."
JAGALCHI FISH MARKET,I'm happy to finally be able to say that I've been here! I walked through the outdoor fish market and the indoor one. there were so many different kinds of fish too see. I've never seen shrimp as big as the shrimp I've seen here.
"Beautiful, crazy and fishy Busan.","Busan is the jewel in Korea's southern parts. The port and fish markets are spectacular, the streets and eats crazy and the jump point to magic islands."
Cruise stop,"Cool area around the port, don't miss the fish market, if you're from ""The West"", this is something you've never seen before and is quite unique. The street markets were interesting, but typical of what you see elsewhere. However be sure to try some food from the street vendors! The Korean pancakes were delicious and there's all sorts of great little treats you can pick up for just some pocket change."
Busy and hectic waterway.,Busan is the second largest city in Korea and the 5th busiest port in the world. We arrived by ship and the port was just a bustling hive of activity 24 hours a day. It is shrouded in a thick blanket of smog so may not be a good choice for anyone with respiratory tract problems.Sailing into such a hectic port was an eye opening experience.
A long way to go.,"This port is so far away from anything and almost impossible for people to find. The toilets were clean, which made a nice change! "
Good visit,We visited Busan twice while in South Korea. Once by ourselves and the next time with friends. Took the fast train which really is the only way to go. There are some really good restaurants here and lots of places to visit. The fish market is huge as would be expected and definitely once place to see.
Pusan,"Modern clean port. People friendly and helpful to Americans. Enjoyed our day there. The city is very westernized, you feel like you could be in San Franscisco or Seattle."
good place in and out busan,we visited Tsusima island in Japan by Ferry. in this port we took Beetle high speed Ferry. it was fantastic. only one and half hours later we could visit that island. Busan port services is so and so but has good ferry port scheduled. from here we can visit many cities. 
Easy access to the city,This was quite a pretty port at night. The Sapphire Princess provided free shuttles into the main city and we had no trouble finding our way around most of what we found worth visiting.
Incredible wealth of seafood and fish,"Nothing could prepare us for this amazing market. I have seen fish markets all over the world, but none can be compared to the wealth of creatures being on sale here. The typical smell is strong - but if you like seafood it won't deter you. Very impressive is the skill of the ladies cleaning the fish, filetting them, and salting some of them. No one who finds himself in Busan should miss this experience."
raw octopus!,"we went here at night and we had our sashimi inside the fish market. The sashimi is fresh. Raw octopus is a new try to me, which is nice if you don't think it's moving... Urchins are a bit salty while oysters are tasty!"
great,"Easy to get around, 20 minute from good shopping & the railway station. Taxis are easy to get from here also"
Jagalchi Fish Market,"Busan Port is just that, a port. Lots of wharves, sea walls, and docks. What is of interest at the Busan Port is the Jagalchi Fish Market and the surrounding shops. Jagalchi is the largest fish market in Busan and has eight floors where you can find everything from live fish to fish products, to restaurants serving every kind of fish you could want. We discovered however, that the prices are much cheaper at the smaller restaurants around the Busan Port than at the Jagalchi Fish Market itself - just something to keep in mind. Regardless, if you are looking for some fish, or anything made of fish, you will certainly find it in the Busan Port area."
Busan's fish market at Jagalchi,"The fish market is a must in Busan. It is easy to find: by public transportation (bus or subway - line 1) busan city tour bus (hop on/off). We went there around lunch timel. The stalls was offering all sorts of living, dried or salted creatures from the sea : fishes, crabs, shrimps, snails, shellfishs, mussels, squids, octopuses, seaweeds ... We joined the crowd of buyers and curious. We did like them: we chose our fish among the fish swimming in a tank. It was prepared by the fishmonger and served in his shop back . A trur delight"
fishes and octopus and crabs and...,"I came here a Sunday afternoon looking for a fish restaurant (that I did not find - but read on :) ), and it was... overwhelming. Fishes and creatures of the sea of all kind, dried and salted and dead and living, the booths competing with each other to show that theirs where better and more alive than each others. The market is crowded, but it is so worth a visit! Many of the booths sell fish in the front and serve food in the back.Once I was done with the open air area I went to the market hall, and the spectacle continued. More fresh seafood - and the best... the fish is sold on the ground floor and served on the first floor, so I got some food in the end anyway :). They had pictures in the menu, of course, and I got the best fish soup EVER, with all the good korean side dishes :)"
Visit the observation deck,"I reached Busan on a Sunday and there is cultural performance at the ground floor of Jaglachi Market Building, just on front of the sea. I heard Jaglachi host it's own festival in October every year. There was a 15 min firework at the seaport earlier in October but too bad I've missed it. To have a good view of the port. You can visit the top floor of Jagalchi market. take the lift to 7th floor and walk up the stars to the top. It is opened to visitor from 9am to 6pm and is free of charge. There is 2 binoculars for viewing (no need to insert coin). it is very interesting to have a close up view of the fishing ships. I saw seagulls resting on the anchor rope, looks like they are queuing in a straight line. Too bad my camera can't zoom in that far to capture that moment."
Jagalchi fish market,"We went with a aim to see this famous fish market that is near the port. Busan is well known for its shipping industry and ports. We see containers lined along the holding areas as well as fish trawlers along another side of the Busan. The Jalgalchi fish market is overwhelming. The moment I got off the train, I can smell the fishy smell in the train station. We spent time walking along the different streets leading the the fish market. Observing the live sea produce, the live squids, sea urchin, yellow fish, abalone, puffer fish, octopus etc. It is a refreshing experience for us especially we love "" wet market"" selling live sea produce. More importantly, for a fees, they cook it fresh for your consumption at their restaurants. We have our feasts of abalones and squids , all Korean cooking style with local beer. Yummy. Took pictures of the market and trawlers. I told my hubby, the seagulls here look cleaner than those in SF. At least you can see it is 2 tones wings and no broken wings and feathers, they must be well fed by the fishermen. Korea. Is blessed with such rich produce and self sustaining for its locals."
beautiful place,had a little picnic with the friends at the bridge near the port. beautiful place.great sunset views. 
Definitely hit up Jagalchi Fish Market!,"There's a nice view at the port, but the real winner is the fish market! Not only is there a huge selection of different sea creatures to gawk at (or buy), but there are little restaurants set up upstairs. We just pointed to pictures to order-- and everything tasted great! I had this dish with white rice and fresh, raw fresh. We also ordered the live octopus- it's a must-do! It's a little weird at first, but it tastes good. They don't kill the octopus right in front of you, they just bring the tentacles to you- which are still moving! Crazy. And they serve it with a really tasty dipping sauce. Of course, they serve everything with all the banchan (side dishes).If you're in the port area, you definitely have to stop by the fish market and check out all the fish and eat here for lunch!"
Huge Port coverage,"Visit the fishing port close to Gudji Market, a scenary in it self, to see Asien fishing vessels landing fish which often is being sold close by!"
smells like fish!,"not surprising that it smells like fish, because its close to jagalchi market which is great for food. that being said, I'm not sure why the port is an attraction. It is best viewed from Busan Tower or the top of Lotte."
Jagalchi Fish Market FTW!,"The best thing about the Busan port area is the sprawling fish market - there is an indoor one, right at the port and an outdoor market.If you love fresh fish and love visiting wet markets - this is place is a must. Lots of interesting seafood - some in aquariums, some dried. You can eat live octopus - the kind that still wiggles after 2 hours of being chopped up, kind of like a Fear Factor challenge - it's chewy and delicious!Many seafood restaurants and stalls selling seafood snacks around the area too. Be sure to bring your camera, as you'll capture pictures of unique sea creatures."
Sprawling Port & Jagalchi Fish Market,"Busan Port can be quite beautiful at dusk. There are some small concrete piers that allow visitors to get a nice view of the port and some of the boats. However, unlike many areas in the United States or Europe, there is no common practice of piers as tourist attractions in Korea.Nevertheless, the main attraction for most visitors (especially Korean) is the Jagalchi Fish Market. This market contains a full palate of sea creatures ready for the cooking pan. Squid, octopus, sea urchin, sea cucumbers, eels, and every other fish you can imagine found off the coast of Korea. Feel free to stroll the tanks full of live, soon to be seafood. If you have friends in Busan or a kitchen hotel this is the best place for fresh seafood."
International Ferry Port,"Two levels, downstairs looked very old and stark but upstairs more like an international terminal with shops. Had breakfast at the eatery at bottom of escalators before you go upstairs. Didnt look much, a long bench and stools, but food was fine (Korean sushi and udon noodles) Very easy checking in process for the hydrofoil. Usual xray machine checking of bags but you take them with you onto the hydrofoil. "
Busan port and Fish Market,"The Busan port is a large commercial port, a bit far from town, but the only place a cruise ship will dock, so you either get a taxi to downtown or pay double and use the ship to shore excursions.One place you MUST see it the Fresh fish market, its unbelievable . The larges selection of see food i have ever seen."
Good if You Don't Mind Fish Smell,"It's a port. Of course it smells like fish and the sea. For some reason, that's an obligatory part of any review of Busan Port. As ports go, it's not the worst smelling I've been to. Worth a stop to see the boats and bustle. After all, it's currently the world's 5th largest port and South Korea's second largest city."
HUGE Port,Quite an impressive port...container yard is MASSIVE...worth a drive by...you will most certainly see this at some point in your trip
Most amazing seafood market,"If you are in Busan their seafood market is a must see. It is easily accessible by bus or walking from the port. It is the largest seafood market we have ever seen and if it lives in the sea it is at this market. A lot of the produce is also still alive and swimming or climbing around, quite fascinating but sad as you know it will soon be consumed.There is an outdoor section plus a six storey building. In addition the inside section has restaurants where you can eat the fresh seafood. This is definitely worth a visit and smell is not too bad as every thing is fresh."
busan by public transport,"Busan is a lovely city to visit....3rd busiest port in the world......and the public transport is very good, bus and train. We discovered that there is a hop on hop off bus which cost approx $8.50 Australian. One of the hop on hop off buses can be used to go to Haedong Yonggung Temple so you don't need to book a tour which will cost 10 times as much. This temple is the best positioned temple I have ever visited being position right on the sea.The hop on hop off buses go from Busan rail station , right hand side facing the building, first bus 9.20 a.m. . If you are going to the temple get of at Haeundae station, go into the station and look for exit 7, when you come out by this exit there is a bus stop , get bus #181 which will drop you about 10 minutes from the temple. You can also do the trip by train but it is a subway so no view.Another of the hop on hop off buses does a 4 hour tour for the same price visiting a museum, park including a cable car ( which you get at half price ) and temple . The bus gives you ample time (about 30 mins ) at each stop to look around."
Seafood Market,You must visit the Jagalchi Seafood Market. It's a large seafood market with lots of vendors with plenty of containers of live fish and seafood. There is also a large section of dried seafood. On the second floor are vendors where you can enjoy fresh seafood lunch. It's an experience you do not want to miss.
Nice views,"We stopped in Busan when we took a cruise in April 2012 . The area of the port where cruise ships dock is nice and interesting . The City Tour Bus makes a stop at the International Cruise Terminal every half-hour so it is a good way to travel around and see the major sights of Busan . The area called Taejongdae is not far from the Cruise terminal and is worth a visit .  After spending 6 hours visiting this lovely city , we stayed on the deck when the ship left the port to admire the views for more than 30 minutes ."
