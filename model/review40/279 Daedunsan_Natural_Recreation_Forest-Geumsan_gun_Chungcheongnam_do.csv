Very steep but super pretty ,"We went there on a sunny day with average humidity and it was marvelous. I recommend the cable car if you want to go to the stop be because the paths can be very steep. This is why the paths can be challenging to unfit or inexperienced hikers. Iâ€™m a sportive twenty-eight year old with experience in mountain hiking and I found the hiking challenging due to the steepness. However, the view on top pays off for all pains. And the restaurants are also reasonable. I recommend going to the one where the front women are NOT yell-advertising at you. These are usually the best. "
Exciting suspension bridge and Samseon Stairway,"Quite an inaccessible place if you are traveling by public transport.The exhilarating part started after you alight from the cable car. There were many steel steps up. Beware if you are visiting during the wet season as it can be slippery. Not suitable for those who are afraid of heights, especially crossing the suspension bridge and climbing the Samseon Stairway. You can feel the slight sway and hear the squeaking sounds as you move across. There are 2 cafes up there after you cross the suspension bridge.Besides these, the view up there is great. "
"Breathtaking View at the Peak, Quite Crowded With Locals","A must visit/try: Cable Car, Cloud Bridge, Samseon Staircase and Peak!! Done all that, it's all worth it! Thou, they raised the price for the Cable Car, now 10,500 won two-ways and 7500 won one-way for adult. Did not enjoy much the ride because it was too crowded. We don't have vehicles so we took the bus to go to Daedunsan. We went to Jeonju. However, direct bus from Jeonju to Daedunsan is not available anymore (we don't know since when or until when, maybe seasonal). The best way to go by bus is through Daejeon Seonambu Terminal. Bus #34 have trips back and forth every 45-50minutes. The driver was so friendly to us. But, we have to walk about 20mins along the highway (with is quite dangerous, i guess) from the Bus Stop to the Main Entrance of Daedunsan. Only the Bus Trip we had was the downside, but the experince was helpful. The rest of our adventure at Daedunsan was fun, tiresome but worth it!!"
Daedunsan Provincial Park,"Park is located south southwest of the City of Daejeon. Fourth biggest city in Korea. I found the park to be less well developed than the national parks in Korea. But - for that same reason - refreshing and lovely. I have been there three times. And never found it crowded. Always peaceful, serene. I'm sure I'll visit again and stroll among the paths and trees, enjoying nature at its finest. Clean air (as clean as it gets in Korea) and in the spring, lovely flowers and smells."
Beautiful mountain view but overcrowded with the local,Once reach the top peak after the cable car ride. you can take alot of beautiful Instagram friendly photos but the crowd is super overcrowded and not a good time to visit. very tiring high stairway. won't not recommend to visit at this peak time.
Short and rewarding hike close to Jeonju,"To get to the park from Jeonju there is a bus four times per day from the Jeonju Bus Terminal (departure times 06.40 - 09.40 - 14.20 - 15.50). The bus drops you at the bus terminal of the Park. The return buses leave at 9.00 - 11.40 - 13.00 - 17.10 and 18.25. The journey takes about 1hr15 min. and costs 6,400 one-way.I took the 06.40 bus, and discovered that although the Park opens at 8.00, all business are closed until 9.00. So I had to wait for my morning coffee until that time...!You have the choice taking the cable car, or hike up. If you can I recommend hiking up, which takes a good hour until the top cable car station. The trail is steep, on a bed of stones with hand rails on the side. It passes through beautiful nature, and when I was there it was very quiet. From there it is another 30 minutes climbing up to the top. Part of the climb is a steep steel ladder. The view from the top is great. On the way back I took the cable car (8,500 one-way). Took the 13.00 bus back.Very nice hike on a beautiful day!"
Take Your Time and Climb the Stairs!,"From Gao dong it took 3 of us an hour and a half, on the bus, to reach the restuarant and cafe at the base of the mountain. Because I am out of shape it took us about 3 hours to go up the mountain and 1 to come down. The mountain is massive, but a person in better shape might be able to cut the total time down by an hour. There were many elderly people walking up the mountain much faster than me. They also did not have a backpack. I chose to carry water, snacks, and a change of clothes - all of which I needed, but I am sure this slowed me down a bit. Along the way several people stopped to take breaks and drink Makgeolli (rice wine). The view from the bridge and stairs are amazing. Do not talk yourself out of the 70 degree angles stairs, like I almost did. It is well worth it and the way down is hidden and much easier. However, use caution if you have a health condition. Spend a day there. Start with breakfast at the cafe, climb and then have dinner at one of the 3 restuarants once you come down. I highly recommend going on a weekday; we went on a Wednesday mid-morning. There weren't even 30 people there; it was perfect."
The Wonderous Mount Daedunsan ,"Mount Daedunsan is a natural reserve that had kept quite a low profile for all these years. But once you set your foot to the place, you cant help but admire and wonder on the creation of the world where you can view the mountains at a magnificient 180 degrees view. The journey to reach the peak can be tiresome for the weak and so not recommended for the elderly. But , if you are young and fit, do get your gears and climb up the 1 km steep staircase to reach to the top. The temperature can drop to about -4 degrees so do put on your heat tech gears."
