Camera Streets of Busan !!!,"Where a 30-day visit to Tapei, with its famous Camera Street, did not lead to a trade-in of a Canon camera and the purchase of a newer model, this was achieved effortlessly in the neighboring city areas of Nampo-dong and Gwangbok, in the South Korean city of Busan. Opposite the well-known Lotte Department Store in the Gwangbok district is Nampo Station, where there are five photo shops in the underground shopping mall, while at the start of the Gwangbok-ro, which is also five photo shops next to the station.At least 1 store, located at the Gwangbok-ro, has a large collection of used equipment and exchanged at a fair price when purchasing a newer model. There are, however, more stores in used equipment that were not checked for possibilities.The transaction yielded a substantial advantage compared to European prices !!Finally, the camera was delivered by Canon South Korea in its original closed factory packaging and delivered to the store by courier. The international Canon Warranty is 2 years."
Too early,"Korean doesnt start their days early, pass by this district its barely open. But the shop is selling everything you need "
Not worth the time,I’m early 30s and was looking for some fashion deals. This underground mall is catered more towards ajummas (50s-60s) and their shoes and clothes were way outdated and cheap looking for not that cheap of prices. There are a few one off good deals/items but don’t waste your time if looking for younger stylish clothes and shoes.
Best used material,I bought my camera here for a very good deal and many others deals you can find here many small cheap store ...for those who love anime characters go there 
Just like any underground Korean shopping place,"One of South Korea's many famed underground shopping places, you can find Nampo Underground Shopping Street connecting Jagalchi and Nampo metro stations. There are many small outlets selling low to mid priced items from clothes to bags, but don't expect a posh shopping experience.You can try haggling but don't expect a warm response if you do. Also, once you seen an underground shopping street in Korea you've seen them all. You can visit if this is going to be your only underground shopping experience but otherwise you wont be missing much if you skip."
Just another of so many underground shopping centers.......,"If you are travelling F&E in Korea ( particularly in Seoul & Busan), using the Metro extensively is most likely. And you will notice that almost every underground stations has a shopping center.Basically they are very similar, plus minus the size & number of shops.You can't avoid passing through these underground shops on the way to catch the trains.Some of them are so quiet, not surprisingly. No one really shop in most of these places except perhaps the big ones in popular tourists areas like Seomyong or Myeongdong."
"Shops nothing special, just the complex","You probably haven't come to Nampo for the underground shopping, but if you came by metro then this is the first place you see. And it goes on and on under the road and then you can pop up in the area you want to be."
underground shopping that is great as wet weather plan,"A long underground shopping street that is linked to Gwangbok underground shopping street filled with good bargains and sales going on. The cosmetics here (Face shop, skinfood, Etude house etc) are cheaper than in Seoul with lots of free samples given. Shop around for shoes and bags too as they are much cheaper that major shopping centres."
Nice place to walk,"If you asked me if there's anything to buy, for me, it's a no because it's winter season and I don't need anything. But it's nice to be in the shelter walking around (I'm here during winter). It is an underground shopping that connects Nampo & Jagalchi station. Hence, there are attractions nearby where you can just exit through their doors along the underground shopping mall. Example: BIFF Square, Gukje Market Food St. "
Variety of value for money goods,The shopping centre is underground connecting subway station's various exit. There are a lot of goods that are worth buying. 
Average,I think would be better if we skip this place because they sell old things and just few interesting shop. Just go to Gwangbok or Nampo outside the station
Endless choices...,"I'm not a big fan of shopping, but no one can deny that there is plenty of it to be had in Busan! The underground market has a wide array of items available...everything from cheap tourist trinkets to handbags and electronics. Easily accessible in between subway platforms and often full of people, it does get a little quieter on Sundays when some shops are closed. Bathrooms are readily available and those with strollers or wheelchairs will find it relatively easy to access."
Shop Shop Shop!!!! - Convenient and Cheap.,"Very Convenient and it is near Metro Station. Variety are aplenty especially clothes, shoes and others. It is cheap and worth a half day walk or more if you have time. Please remember to visit restaurants outside the station..."
Certain goods are cheaper here than upstairs,"Many tshirts & clothing shops with a few shops selling local designers' above KRW100,000. Nice designs but it was our last day and fund was limited :)"
It's probably worth walking around and exploring if you have reason to be at Nampo or Jagalchi subway stops.,"A lot of the subway stations in Busan have shopping areas of various sizes and variety. Nampo was one of the larger ones. And, whether you got off at Nampo or Jagalchi stations, the area is convenient to both. I don't really have a strong opinion about the prices here. My wife did buy a pretty reasonable hat, but we found a parka that we needed outside on the street above that was a better deal than in here. Nevertheless, I'm sure there are some bargains to be had. If not, get something to eat. I thought the restroom was pretty clean, for a subway station."
Good Shopping at price that is value for money,"An underground shopping tunnel connected near Lotte Department Store towards PIFF Square. Good for rainy season. You will find good items such as clothing, shoes, glasses as electronic items etc etc. if you know the market price. Some shops are relative more expensive than others. Price bargaining is required to protect from wallet."
Not all store sell cheap stuff...,"I bought some clothes at the shop in the corner, you can easily see this shop when you exit from the metro.All stuffs are cheap, but not all of them though. Some clothes are cheap, some aren't. Don't buy bags here because in Insadong there is a shop that sell all his bags 10000krw, all type of bags! And socks are cheaper here than Seoul. I think I saw a shop that sell socks only 500krw. Common store sell it 1000krw. Great place if yiu found cheap stuff :p"
