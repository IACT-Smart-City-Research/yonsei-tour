One of the best fish market for our view and taste. ,"What a pleasure for the senses to stroll along the walkways of this big fish market. Go inside the covered building and look at live swimming fishes, crabs, giant crabs, abalons, eels...You can order them cooked to your taste. Prices reasonable. "
Speaking Korean is the key for a good deal,"Came here from Yonggungas Temple by taxi for 8000won.Ordered 1 snow crab (2kilo) for 80000won, with two snow crab for free.Table next to us ordered 5 snow crabs (~2.5kilo) for 210k won. Avg 42k won each. Speaking Korean and doing your research is important. It was tasty nevertheless."
Good shopping experience,I shopped here in December for some souvenirs and gifts for friends and relatives.You need to bargain very hard for the best prices.
Snow Crab,"We was there in the evening, take the subway to Haeundae station then the bus no 39and get off at Gijang elementary schoolit is one stop before Gijang market stopbecause itâ€™s more nearer to the market, then walking back and turn right inwe went to Ching Ching restaurant the sellers are really nicegave us the discount, you pay for the crab and also pay for the side dish , they charge each 3000 won ( it is really worth the money)after we finished, the uncle seller is very kindhe asked us where we heading backthen walk with us to the bus stop :)we will visit you again for sure"
Seafood lovers Haven!,This spot is one of the best seafood market in Korea! The prices are all reasonable. We bought a 3 kilos lobster for only 100$ and 4 kilos King crab for only 130$! Of course you will have to bargain a little bit to get them even more cheaper so having a korean friend with you will also be a good idea . Over all the experience was amazing it was very delicious dinner. We will definitely comeback! 
Nice place for various choices of food. ,"Nice place for various choices of food. They have the expensive one to cheaper one, like seafood and tokboki. "
It used to be better.,"Years ago the market sold a wide range of delicacies. However, it mainly sells crab these days. The drive to sell typically makes the sellers shout and try to herd you into their stall. Overall, it was not the greatest experience. If you are specifically looking to buy crab then maybe it might be worth your while but honestly Jagalchi is a lot better. "
Ultimate crab brunch - reason for the extra mile,"At Haeundae metro green line 2, we took Exit 7 and bus 181 to Gijang market. Be prepared for a fairly long ride (about an hour, depending on traffic). The bus stopped at the market entrance - if you're not sure, ask the driver for Gijang Sikdang.Many shops with dried seafood of all sorts - ahjummas offered us free tasting. Upon weighing, they added the customary ""service"" of an extra handful. Happy customer 101. However, do note as some vendors may be more light on the scales than others.Our mission was the ultimate crab brunch and we accomplished it. We browsed a few shops and finally settled on the one with a giant crab above their building - we figured, how can we go wrong? The seller spoke perfect English and we finally agreed on 3 big snow crabs, 1 large king crab + 1 ""service"" snow crab for W272k for 8 of us. Came with 8 portions of crab roe fried rice (yummy) served in crab shells and plenty of kimchi. Post brunch, we bought some banchan (mini crabs, squid, seaweed) and hopped on bus 181 back to Haeundae station - bus stop is across the road from the one we alighted earlier."
Huge crabs,"Saw stalls with huge king crabs in water tanks, baskets of many different types of seaweeds. We had lunch at one of the many restaurants with live crabs. The crabs were very sweet! Good place for lunch."
Miss the old one ,"Transportation: New GiJang station Pos: lobby is relatively large and brightCos: the hotness of carriage made me feeling dizzy n hard to breath... Besides, remember to bring an umbrella, you will need it whenever it's sunny or rainy day in the platform. "
"10,000 won/kg cheaper than Jagalchi market","Armed with prices of the snow crab and King Crab that I found on TripAdvisor, my family took the hour long journey from Busan town to Gijang. Asked at almost all of the shops and none of the prices came close to what was written on Tripadvisor. For the King Crab, it was only 10,000 won cheaper/kg than Jagalchi. We bought 1 King Crab and was given a free small snow crab together with a few Korean Crab legs. There were more things to see in Jagalchi. Left by public bus. The bus stop is just at one of the side entrances, opposite Innisfree (the cosmetics shop)."
Many things sold here,"So many kinds of things sold here with quite affordable price. This place located near Nampo and other market that why if you only have short time to visit Busan, you can go here after or before going to Nampo area"
SNOW AND KING CRABS STREET,It took us 1 hr by bus to reach Gijang Market. Interesting place as there were different types of seafood sold at the market. Some which we have never seen before.
"Freshly cooked crab, good value for money","We recommend the one 775-18 Daera-ri, Gijang-eup, Gijang, Busan, South Korea, they are very enthusiastic to introduce you crabs and you can bargain for discount ! We had two snow crabs + side dish + fried rice , two persons only 760000 won. Their crabs looks fresher than the other stores plus inside is nicely presented. They were invited by tv for showing how they prep the crabs ! Very enjoyable meal during rainy july in busan"
Snow crab is in season this time,"There is Korea Traditional Market in Gi Jang.and there are many snow crab restaurant.If you going to there, You can see the Korea Traditional Market and can have some fresh snow crab.Its price is about \40,000~\50,000 per person.I've been there with my familyThere is so exciting and funny"
Must Go for Seafood Enthusiast!,"The market is a little out of the place, but for the price difference of the king crabs, I think it's a place worth travelling to. Generally I surveyed King Crabs would cost about 70,000KRW per kilo in Jagalchi Market. Here, in Gijang Market, it's 35,000KRW - 50,000KRW per kilo. The first few stalls might start with 45,000KRW per kilo, don't worry to keep going down the street and ask for prices, you will definitely come to a stall which will be offering you the cheaper price. We had 3.3kilo King Crab for 110,000KRW here, I think it's a pretty good offer. Imagine you were to order a 3.3kilo King Crab in Jagalchi, the price you will be paying would be more than double the price here. *Since you are travelling to Gijang Market, I would recommend to make a stop at the Haedong Yonggungsa Temple, its a pretty scenic location. From the temple, you can either take a taxi or the bus to Gijang Middle School, from there it's about 300m walk to Gijang Market. We took a taxi to Gijang Market, and it cost us 7,000KRW."
Crabs and lobsters,"If you like Crabs and lobsters, you must visit the Gijang market.Our party of 5 shared a 5.4kg King Crab for 250,000won.....Travellers needs to do some bargaining with seafood stalls...they originally wanted 282,000won...but we offer them 250,000 which they said no...so we moved on...but immediately, they said ok....(I wonder whether I should have offered lower).When you go inside the restaurant, the price of the crab includes cooking price, the many small dishes of Korean appetizers are refillable..Do ask them to add rice to the crab shell and spicy bean curd soup....all very tasty."
Seems cheaper than other markets in Busan,"Came here bec other reviews say the price is much cheaper than in Nampo or Semyeong. Quite many restaurants and shops selling snow crab.Took bus 181 near Haundae metro station to Lotte department store (40 min), and then 181 in the same direction to Gijang market (30 min). Need to ask someone in the bus to tell us when to get off. Easy to miss the market.Market has many shops mostly selling snow crab. Some have lobsters, and other shell sea food. Should make bargain, and compare prices. The system there is you buy the seafood and the shop will steam it for you for free. The place where you will eat will charge you 3000 won per person. They provide the side dishes for free. You can buy other seafood from anyone else in the market and the main shop where you buy the snow crab from will also steam them for you for free.We ended up buying a 1.8kg snow crab for 40000 won ( good discount given), we also bought abalone and other shell seafoods somewhere else and have them steamed for free. Suggestion: do not buy too much bec the shop will steam them all together. So some will be over cooked, they are served all at once, so some will get cold. Most people just come for the snow crabs. 1 crab per person. These crabs are full of meat. Snow crabs are cheaper than the king crabs. The shop boy say foreigners like king crabs, but local prefer snow crabs. Took bus 1003 back to Haundae beach which is faster and passes the road parallel next to the main beach."
A must go market for king and crab crabs,"Took a bus to this market for dinner after shopping at Lotte Outlet Mall. Wide choices of seafood, especially king crab and snow crabs. They quoted the price and added additional seafood like scallops for free. Had lobster as well. Very nice and reasonably priced. The fried rice with crab roe after finishing out crabs was delicious. Strongly recommend this place if you are keen to have crabs at very reasonable prices. Accessible is by bus and just about 3 minutes walk away from the restaurant which brings you to Haeundae and Nampo area."
A market that is superb and highly recommended,"We are extremely happy to have made it to Gijang Market where I would strongly encourage everyone to come by this market if you really want to have the best huge size King crab and Snow Crab. We didn't intend to eat but with the abundant of these crabs, we were tempted to try them. It is of no regret that we pamper ourselves with these crabs even though we were quite full. We ordered 1 King Crab and 3 Snow Crabs for 7 of us. It's super yummy, at one corner restaurant. The young man really have good marketing skill and extremely friendly and able to speak English. We tried the butter fried rice on the crab shells too. It is yummy too. The price are extremely reasonable, value for money. Abundant fresh seaweed is also found here. Brown Korean pear, big peaches and variety of fruits are found here. We bought 8 brown pear in a box which weigh around 13kg and cost 18000 won, meaning each pear weigh more than 1kg. It's with no regret that we bought them as it is extremely juicy. Again it is value for money. It is approximately 15km from APEC Naru Park by driving."
