A little of everything,"Nice market area with tiny shops on narrow streets. Good deals on some items, including clothing and textiles."
Huge market ,This is a must do and see market in Busan. But fresh fish and they will send you upstairs and cook it for you 
Business Trip to Busan,Lots and lots of shops and stalls. Everything for every body. The food market is amazing lots of variety of Korean cuisine. Pickled garlic was my favourite to go with superior quality kimchi.
Local culinary market,Gukje market can easy to find in nampodong area 5 minute walk from jagalchi marketMust try local snack a food like famous fish cake a cold spicy noodle 
Shopping ecstasy ,"There is almost every type of shopping available at this market. High end fashion, second hand clothes, vintage and kitsch, food, art and some things completely foreign.We went on a Sunday so some stalls were closed but that did not detract at all from the experience. It’s a market, so expect jostling crowds but hawkers are not overly insistent so browsing is easy without ending up with unwanted purchases."
Busan,"Glad to visit this place, there are so many things you can do here! A lot of local food you can try, local coffee shop, etc...."
Must go place in Busan,There are many shops that sells household items to furniture. There are also lots of food stalls for you to choose from. Most of them taste really good and cheap.
HBH another busy shopping area,"We were taken here on a tour. Dropped off at dusk having been told that Koreans like to drink all night. Not a good start! However, there was a reassuring tourist Police Cabin in full view. Narrow streets, large and small shops, malls and street vendors selling local food. Very busy. Also cars are allowed down what we at first thought was a a pedestrian area. If you want to shop shop shop, then this is the place for you."
"Half day visit: Yondusan Park, Gukje Market, Jagalchi Market","This is a great place to visit as part of a walk from Yongdusan Park, easily accessible by subway. Here is the course we took: Yongdusan Park -> Busan Tower -> Busan Modern History Museum -> Gukje Market -> BIFF square -> Jagalchi MarketGukje Market is a perpetual buzz of activity, with small storefronts crammed into rows and rows of pedestrian-only side streets. Throngs of tourists mingle with locals so it can get pretty crowded. Places where they sold food were the most interesting for me, and there were plenty of places for a quick bite."
Interesting market,"Mainly fish - live, dead and dried. But also a mix of dry groceries and houseware stalls. Easy to walk through and look. No problem in taking pictures. Worth a visit. "
Places for souvenirs ,Great stop to buy souvenirs/ memorable items to bring home. I think it is cash only as most vendors don't take credit cards. They aren't keen on bartering. Maybe they can discount 1000 won. They don't try to negotiate so playing hard to get won't work here. They sell snacks and grocery items too.
Big Market,A very big local market that sells so many arrays of things. Worth strolling around even not buying. 
Always interesting ,"It doesn’t matter how many times you go to the International market, there is always some new to see. There are always the ‘aunties’ cooking local food in the laneways, and food trolleys with local fare. Try the dumplings as they are to die for, as are the Korean pancakes. But you are spoilt for choice - watermelon slushee, turkey ice cream, chicken kebabs, endless choice. There are always bargains to be found at the countless stalls. Some nights you can have your fortune told. Sometimes the film festival is on. It is always busy, always interesting. "
Interesting ,A market that you can not only buy mostly household daily stuff but also a place to wander and see the locals doing their business. It is business as usual and they are quite oblivion of others. Some simple food stalls also available. Visit and get a taste of local market. 
Quite an interesting place to wander,"We spent an hour or so wandering around this huge market. This certainly wasn't just for tourists - you can buy anything here, like a local, from electrical and kitchen goods, to food, and clothes (which are often piled high). There are pictures at the beginning of each row to indicate what can be found within that row. We didn't buy anything and a lot of the stalls were not doing much business (although we were there during the week). The most interesting thing was the way stall holders cooked and set out their lunches (with several dishes of food) to eat at lunch time, oblivious of passers by and shoppers."
Decent markets,"Interesting market to wander around in Busan. Variety of stores, local goods and heaps of food stores. Nice to wander around."
Want a quick snack,We visited this vibrant market and grabbed a meal on the run. Not expensive and yummy waffles!Plenty of stalls with a wide range of goods to rummage through.
Not For Food Lover,"If you are looking for cooked food at this market, think again. There are a few stores selling the standard street food and fish cake, don’t expect to find restaurant food here. You will find raw food and plenty of house hold items like pot, bowl, cup, etc, clothing (vintage clothing as well)"
Aimless shopping? ,"If you are not looking for something specific to buy and just want to surprise yourself with bargains or the odd this and that, this market might serve the purpose. It is perfectly ok just to roam around aimlessly and you may find something. It is not a clothes market but there are clothes, there are some socks shop, there are also other shops selling pots and pans. All kinds. I mean, why not? Things here are in general not pricey. And you get the usual coffee shops and restaurants around when you get tired walking. "
street food galore,"varieties of street food to choose & you will be spoilt by choices. do not be tempted to start buying at the very first stall you see. walk along and see which is more appealing to you. guess where there is a Q it must be good. go there a little earlier so that you can venture and beat the crowd, walk, shop and try many other foods. "
Traditional Market,"A stone's throw away from BIFF square offering everything from tshirts to bags, stationery and cookware. Interesting to explore the small streets. Can see Busan tower from here."
"Gukje Market,","Had an opportunity to visit and explore this market with friends and though there are many shops selling similar items. It is the small places and it is the people that make this such an interesting place. The street food was good and sitting with the ladies and eating soup in the middle of the market was a treat. Honestly, nothing really special unless you have the time to say hi and engage, but if you do you will have a great time."
Local Flea Market,"There are lots of shop where sell lots of local souvenirs, fake luxury fashion wear and food. Just an ordinary flea market, nothing special. However, the stalls that selling tteokbokki and pancake tasted savory though."
Not very special,There is lots to see here and there are many different shops. But the shops are the same as the ones you see in every market in the country.
"Fun, Food and Savings!","What a great experience to enjoy the street food. Wonderful smells and great cooks provide you many options for dinner or lunch on the street. While shopping is wonderful. You can shop knockoff's, fun fashions and even thrift shopping used items. Fun area to explore."
Great ,Another fascinating dry market. Lots too see but have local currencies for many shops. Some take credit cards.
Colourful and vibrant,"This market comprised shops and stalls over a wide area, teeming with people on a Saturday and vibrant with colour. There was an interesting, seemingly continuous ‘fast food’ area along one street with low stools around each cook who sat on a stool or the floor to cook. There was an overall impression of many colourful umbrellas and a very large variety of goods for sale."
Food and more Food,"Come here for a touch of street nibbles. Standard prices for most food eg 10kWon gets you fishcakes, sundae, mandu for 3 people. Many stores selling similar food items just go to the one you like most they all taste similar honestly."
Shoppers heaven,"It sells cigarettes, shoes, lights, fishes, noodles, herbal tea, hanbok, chainsaws, odens, camera, grass mats, pyjamas, nail clippers, screws, taps, vegetables, socks, ladder, etcBasically anything"
Busan Biggest Fish Market,"Local market with lot of varieties sea produce, quite similar to Tokyo Tsukiji market but with smaller scale."
Find everything here,"If you are looking for a feel of the local market, then this is the place to be. Very near BIFF Square, this huge market sells everything under the sun. One of the largest market in Korea with very narrow lanes, with shops occupying every available space is said to have been first set up by the refugees who migrated to Busan during the Korean War.One can spend as much time available. But at least set aside 4 hours for this place. One can plan BIFF Square, Gukje Market and Haeundae Beach in a day."
Anything Korean is available ,"If you like to bring home more than just souvenirs, here’s the place to visit. Household utensils, hardware, etc can be found here. It was worth exploring and discovering that the most memorable souvenirs were found here. "
Good street shops,Nice place to shop for things especially wholesale. Easy access to Busan tower after walking.Near BIFF and eateries.
Food and shopping,"A big market for the locals and tourists. It sells many things here - hardware, shoes, bags, clothes, daily accessories, food, snacks and many more. Huge variety at an inexpensive price. Worth the visit for sure."
"Full of foods, bags, clothes, etc","Gukje market is a big area with many small streets. Each street sells different types of things. There are household items, clothes, bags, shoes, lights, etc. The food sellers are selling in the middle of the street. Some of them provide small chairs to sit around the seller, but some not. You can just stand around the cart to enjoy the local foods. They sell Tteok-bokki (spicy rice cake), Eomuk (fish cake), Gimbap (rice roll a bit like sushi), Mandu (dumpling), etc. There are too many foods to have, just go there and explore yourself."
Market that sells a variety of things and snacks,"Gukje, Kkangton and BIFF are next to each other. You can visit these 3 places together. It’s best to get a map from at your hotel. The stalls in Gukje are divided into kitchenware, clothes, household items, hardware and foods. Got to try the popular street food at these markets. It’s best to visit in the afternoon and stay for dinner. "
Big like a maze! Endless exploration,"Gukje market is just beside BIFF square. You wouldn't even know that you have wandered into here as it feels part of the BIFF. There are alleys with street food cart all the way, fashion clothing & even 2nd hand clothes. Take your time to explore around."
Find it all here,"A good typical Asian market with a very local feel. It was a bit difficult to locate at first but once found, you could spend hours just wandering from one section to the other and lose yourself to all the sights, sound and smells. A good side trip if you're at Jagalchi Market."
They sell so many things here ,"There are so many stalls here where you can find korea traditional things, electronics, kitchen appliances, clothing, food, agricultural products, fish, dairy goods, ....... The alleyway connect with Bupyeong market or Kkangtong night market. There are also many chain coffee shop like cafe bene, angle in us, ... and so many restaurants "
Lotsa stuff to do,Enjoyed strolls around this market. From Busan Metro line 1 jagalchi station exit 7 walk straight around 5 mins. Its not difficult to get lost here! its also within walking distance to BIFF and Kkangtong market. Lot of sections that sells diff goods. They sells lot of inexpensive items uninflated like the one at myeongdong. Street foods here are way cheaper.
Affordable shopping destination in Busan,"When in Busan, visit Gukje Market for an affordable shopping. Location: Sinchang-dong 4 ga, Junggu BusanAccessibility: You can take the taxi going there or just the subway: Jagalchi Station (Busan Subway Line 1), Exit 7. If you are into food, you'll definitely love this place because there are lots of restaurants and food stalls selling Korean sweets, snacks, etc. for an affordable price. You can also buy souvenirs, bags, belts, etc. I bought a cute pair of pokemon socks which were originally KRW1500 but got it for KRW 1000. Don't forget to try to haggle :) If you still have the energy to go for another round of shopping, then Kkaktong Market is just near Gukje Market. You can check it out and look for more items."
Good for soveiners ,This place is a 5min walk from jagalchi metro. Theres many antiques there for tourist and very near to BIFF
"Huge open market for prepared food, fruits and vegys as well as lots of mechandise","A huge market with tons of vendors selling merchandise, clothing, bags, house goods, tools, EVERYTHING. So large, it is easy to get lost so finding a stall again is not a simple task. Very busy with skooters, cars, bikes driving on narrow roads filled with customers. It is a wonder more people are not injured. Very hectic vibe but so interesting to experience. Works well if you have things in mind to look for. Otherwise the experience is overwhelming. Great open market!! Thoroughly enjoyed going thru it multiple times over a week."
Meet local designers,"So the Gukge market is famous for its street food especially the Hotteok(must try) BUT at the back, the local designers come out to showcase their work. So experience part of the famous Korean fashion."
Somehow magic place,"Is good to see this Market. You can buy everything fresh. Is different than in Europe or India. Koreans, Chinese they have own style. "
Something for everyone.,"This is a huge market that sells a wide range of inexpensive items. It covers many streets so it is not difficult to get lost! The easiest way to get there is by the Subway from the Busan Station. The fare is only US$1.50 each way. Get off at Jagalchi Station (use Exit 7) - it is then a five minute walk to the market. The subway is quite easy to use. Self-service ticket machine. Press the English option, and remember the machine will only take coins or 1000 won notes. Money machines are also available to break down larger currency notes. Not much English spoken. If stuck, ask a school student - the children learn English at school."
Maze of a market!Anything you'd probably want to buy,"I quite enjoyed strolling around this market - it felt more authentic - prices weren't inflated. I had actually wished i had spent more time here. It is quite large, and though there are sections you may not buy anything from, it was still interesting to see. Most areas are covered. Closer towards the direction of BIFF square you can find the row of ladies who sell street food on low stools - i think it was the cheapest lunch during our stay in Busan!"
Lots and lots of stuff!,Stroll up this street where various vendors are selling anything from clothes to ice cream. We had a delicious mango pineapple Turkish ice cream. 
Traditional Asian market,"Worth visiting in your in thr area, coupled along with a pick at the Jalgachi Market, for example, but definitely not worth a large detour. Using the subway to get there is quite handy.Foodwise, there are much more interesting markets in Busan."
Fun and Interesting,"It it probably just a street with hundreds of vendors to most, but the types of “street” food available is worth the visit. Be prepared for a multitude of tourists and visitors. Souvenirs galore at reasonable prices. If you’re in Busan, you should visit the market."
Just A Market,"Like some other reviewers said, if you are not from Asia, probably this is an eye opener but being from Asia, this is just another typical market. Plenty of nice photo shots opportunity though."
Fantastic food ,"There are so many types of food to choose from it is very difficult but our most favorite would be the fish cakes and the donuts that they put all sorts of seeds or cheese inside , as we were walking by some of the fresh seafood stalls an octopus slipped up and over it’s containment tank onto the street and the shopkeeper had quite a difficult time trying to capture the escapee "
Souvenir shops~~~!!!,"My friends always come here to buy special gifts from Busan and South Korea, e.g. dolls, chocolates, seaweed in various seasonings, spoon with Korean words, and other small cute things. Some sellers can speak in Indonesian and Japanese also! ^^ Unfortunately, most places are closed at 7 pm."
Ok la,"This place is not that existing - i mean if you are coming somewhere not from Asia, maybe can go gaga over it. This is simple asia normal "
Some nice shops and eateries ,First when there as we were trying to look for the food street and we had a lunch of stew in one of the diners. Quite alot of the shops in the covered market seem dedicated to household goods so not very interesting but the streets that fan out have more diverse stuff like fashion. There is a cute little food street where women sell their dishes to diners on low stools. It looks interesting but we have always eaten when we passed by. An area not too far from BIFF square so most visitors will no doubt stumble upon it at some point.
Huge market,"This is a really big market and we were soon lost in the crisscrossing alleys. You can get food, souvenirs, clothes, etc here. Can easily spend half a day or more here if you try to browse everything. "
Best vintage market,"It's a really big market filled with vintage clothes shops and regular jewelry/socks stands. A lot of the vintage stores have piles of clothes for 1000-3000, so if you want to dig a little bit you can find nice things for really cheap."
Lots to see and buy but mostly for locals,"Like a huge indoor fresh food and misc goods market. Almost anything you can think of especially if it’s food related. There are some places you can grab a bite to eat on the go.Other places are for shopping like seafood, meat and veggies. They have some interesting stalls selling powdered beans (powdered in front of you), fish cakes and Kim chi varieties. We already ate by the time we came here but enjoyed the stroll."
Traditional market in Busan,"So many foods we can try here. For muslim traveler, must alert about Halal or not in this market. Must visit in Busan"
Interesting market,"Lots of shops and stalls selling just about everything, loved the food! Nice atmosphere and fun to visit"
Gukje Market - so huge,"This is a must see and recommend things to do in Busan. This market is so huge. Everything from socks to grilled beetles. After roaming through this blocks long market place one realizes that there is some sense of organization to this. Like fried dumplings in one area, noodles in another. Also check out the subways. More shops down there and not so crazy."
Good bargain,"The market is closed early at night, hence the best time to pay a visit would be during day time. After we visited Yongdusan Park, we came here to see what can be brought back. Our first impression was 'wow', different zones with many stalls selling various items. The zones are categorized according to the types of item sold. If one wants to visit the whole market, it is best to spend few hours here to get good bargain. Due to insufficient time, we did not finish all the zones. Anyhow, we were happy to get our favorite hats and caps with discounted price."
"Fishy business - eomok, that is ..",There's a row of eomok stalls for people to taste test before purchase. Which is ideal to select soft yet chewy fish cakes. Some were just rubbery hard. Perhaps the winter temperatures had somewhat to do with the texture. Anyways we opted for Yeoja Eomuk which I think means ladies fish cakes.. and we were served by 2 friendly ladies. ₩20k and we get a complimentary shopping bag (see pic) to cart around the 1.4kg goodies. Can use this pic to find the shop.
"Nice street food, small","You can walk around and check food stalls, they offer some varieties of food. Locals and tourists will buy and eat next to the stall."
Plenty of stalls,Some great stalls here offering a chance to buy some trinkets. Plenty of food options to explore for a quick snack.
Huge Outdoor Market With Thousands of Stalls,"The free shuttle bus from the port took the cruise ship passengers to the Gukje Market where we had several hours on our own. This market stretches for blocks and blocks in all directions, and you can find anything you'd need here. There were many locals shopping here for shoes, umbrellas, clothing items, hardware items, wrapping paper, and, of course, food.I stopped at one stall and bought ""something on a stick"" that tasted nice. The lady tried to tell me what it was, but my lack of knowledge of the Korean language didn't help. I smiled and mumbled out ""Thank You"" in Korean (I still have a problem with that one!), and then walked on.The location of this market makes it a nice starting and stopping point for shopping in Busan. From here you can easily walk to the 13-story Lotte Department Store as well as to other markets."
Prepare to spend time,"Unfortunately our tour group only had 30 minutes to spend here, which was not nearly enough time. We spent most of the time trying to find an ATM (there is one in the 7-11 - but the minimum amount you must withdraw was high), so be sure to bring your own won. The street vendors only take cash. There is a little bit of everything and some of the most interesting food I have ever seen. I would definitely go back and spend a couple of hours (and I usually hate shopping!)"
Don't miss it.,"We didn't have too much time so it was a toss up. Guess what, the women won. This market takes over quite a few city blocks. We wandered around for a couple of hours and the amount of things for sale is just mind boggling. They have it set out that one part of a street will sell only one type of thing and move on to another thing a bit further up. From the time we had there the items for sale didn't seem that cheap but it is worth going just for the buzz"
Great to explore,Large market district with plenty of nattow streets with plenty of bargains.Some streets have good quality products at fair prices.Not really bargain basement buying as there is good quality here
Really interesting local market,"This market is the real thing, no (or very little) tacky tourist junk. There are streets and streets of alleyways, corners and street stalls where you can see just how the Koreans shop and eat. Plan to spend a while here and probably buy nothing (other than eats) but get a great exposure of the Korean experience."
A big market near BIFF square and Jagalchi station.,"We came here after visiting Jagalchi market and BIFF square. The Gukje market is quite popular and actually include the Nampo-dong and Bupyeong night markets as well as the Changseon-dong Eatery Alley. Worth wandering around and doing some shopping. Prices are more reasonable than in the shopping complex. many of the stalls are in the open and some are in covered areas. If using the metro, get off at Jagalchi station Exit 10."
Australian Travellers,"A typical market offering a large variety of clothing,souvenirs, stationary, handbags etc and food. Interesting to wander through but not too different from other Asian type markets. "
Come here for your local street food experience,"Not a place to be missed if you want to enjoy your street food in Busan! Loads of shopping if you walk around, and lots of restaurants, cafes and street food. Really enjoyed spending time here for a whole evening.Make sure to have the Ssiat Hotteok!"
Follow the Food,I ended up at GukJe Market whilst following the trail of street food vendors from BIFF Square. I have never wanted to try every type of food in my life. My friends and I went hopping from vendor to vendor to get our hands on all the local good eats. We shared so much that we have never felt so stuffed. Everything was delicious.We saw a lot of flea market type stalls and shops that had numerous amounts of sales and bargain shopping available but we weren't really feeling it because of all the sidetracked commotion from the street foods. I can't say how good the shops are around here but the food won't disappoint at all. Enjoy!
Facinating,"The Gukje market and BIFF square are connected. If u walk further towards the sea you will come across Jagalchi market - u probably can smell the seafood before reaching there.Vendors at Gukje market sells a variety of stuff - socks, kitchen accessories, snacks, tshirts, souvenirs etc. Don't miss the hotteok stall which is located in front of Little India restaurant. Hotteok is fried bread stuffed with nuts and seeds - sweet & tasty."
Disappointing,Came here on a tour and perhaps it was over-hyped by the guide. Very little here that tourists might want to see or buy. Caters mostly to locals and most shops seemed low-end. Can't really recommend unless you are at a loose end.
Street Market in Busan,"If you have visited other street market in Korea, it is just similar. You can find clothes, accessories and many restaurants in the market. It is quite crowded during the weekend but for me, it is just similar with other markets in Korea."
Good Traditional Korean Food!,"We ate dinner at a restaurant in this area. Our tour guide recommended it. He learned about this place through KNN, a broadcasting news agency that featured this restaurant. It was an authentic Korean meal with multiple bowls/plates of various food items, such as kimchi & cabbage. It was a good & extremely filling meal. My favorite included the noodles & pork. We were 7 people & we ordered two full sets of the traditional Korean meal. It wa about $78 USD, which was a great price (especially when I felt like my stomach was gonna explode as I wanted to try a bit of everything & not waste the food). I've always wants to eat a traditional Korean meal & now I have! "
Must Visit!,I love this market! You can see local people life. Great street food to second hand clothes. Must visit!
Goes on and on,"This is a huge market where you can certainly get lost, so I recommend either taking a GPS with you or at least a photograph of where you want to get back to. The market is arranged into categories, ie one area is all fish, another meat, clothes, electrics etc. There is nothing you can't buy. On the downside, I found the Koreans to be most unfriendly who didn't seem interested in serving you and when they did, if they didn't have what you wanted and you didn't buy, they appeared very grumpy. Not the cleanest of places. Still a must visit with a different culture."
Lots of stalls ,"This is quite a huge market. It looks more like stall rather than market. It's lane after lane. They sell quite a number of things.. shoes, clothings, umbrellas, hardware, cooking stuff and lots of it.. the market was not fully opened when we started at 9:30am. So we could only browse through those that were already opened. Lots of shopping but needed more time and know what to buy. "
market selling local street food,"A local traditional market selling local street food like tteokbokki, eomuk and kimbap that is along the BIFF Square and Jagalchi market. Go there to have some street food while shopping around BIFF Square."
It's another market.,It's just another market but it is interesting to just look at people's life here. There are pretty much elderly in this area. A place where you can pop by and just take a look. A little different from the markets that we have in Singapore. 
Worth to walk but nothing much to see,"Nothing much to do in busan so we decided to walk, was contemplating between gukje or bujeon market bur bujeon sells more fresh food and this one has more dry items like souvenirs etc so we came here. Lots of street food. Took us less than half an hour to finish this tourist spot but it's ok. Can visit if nothing much to do "
local street products,"It is just an area cater for locals to purchase local products, nothing spectacular about this place."
Shopping and Street food,"Located near BIFF Square and Jagalchi Market, this area is a haven to shop for local souvenirs and street food. This market also gives you a good taste of the local culture in Busan."
Mix of shopping and street food,"Gukje market is well organized. You will find on each alley street a different type or product being sold - well mostly anyway. So there would be a street full of vendors for men's clothing and leather products, then one for ladies' shoes etc. There is even a street that is lined with jewelry & watch stallholders (it's next to the Y'Z plaza). Plenty of choices for shopping.There is street food here and it is for us an authentic experience to watch the locals eat here. In the evenings there are some alley walkways where older lady folks will man little temporary push cart stalls with low seating. Prices are very affordable and its like having a home cooked meal in the market!From the Jagalchi metro stop (line 1), get out on exit 7, past BIFF in the direction to Gwangbok-ro."
Shopping ,"Located at Nampodong area, near BIFF square and Jagalchi Market. You can visit all these 3 places at the same time sched. Lots of items to chose from, originals likewise fakes. When buying originals at genuine stores, look for shops that offers ""tax free"" to non-korean customers as not all shops have this offer. "
Street food,"I was truly amazed by the street food here. So many kinds of street food sold here with very affordable price. This place located near Nampo and other market that why if you only have short time to visit Busan, you can go here after or before going to Nampo area "
Adventure around every corner.,"This is the place to go if you want to see the local culture, you can find just about everything you could want from local food to fashion. Street food is everywhere and is very fresh. You can even buy alcohol and cigarettes from within the market. Plan to spend a couple of hours here to see everything it has to offer."
Souvenirs paradise,"We went during Chusoek long holidays and on a rainy day, most of stalls/shops are not open. It's quite hard to shop during rainy days as it's not covered. "
Easy to loose your way,"I didn't really like the place. There was nice street food, but all the clothes and cosmetic that was sold there is not worth going there. and the variety of street food is better in the area around the biff square."
Lots of food!,Do not eat lunch and go here.. there is so much food for you to try and it will disappoint you if you are not hungry. It is quite a local market though in terms of actual shopping. But all the food looked amazing. It is also under shelter which means you are sheltered from rain or sun which is a bonus.
Best Place for Shopping,There are so many stalls which make up Gukje Market. There are so many sections ranging from food to Hanboks- all of which you can get at a good bargain. This is the best place to go if you want to buy souvenirs without being ripped off by the sellers. They are friendly and more tolerant towards travellers- especially fussy and budget travellers. Take your time to stroll through the market and stop by for local food if you are tired and hungry.
"Street food, street food!","Its hard not to enjoy the busy atmosphere here, with plenty street food stalls. Its not a place if you dont like crowd, rain, cold, hot or shine. The must try...hoteok!!"
Location and variety,"If you are in the area, just visit this place too. Why not? It is close to public transportation, Biff Square and tge fushmarket.So if you like to stroll around and looking at stuff or want to go shopping for some lowprice items, this is the place!"
Went on crazy shopping here,"Though the clothing collection I can say is juuuuussst a little bit (I mean so little until you can tell heheheh) behind of Seoul, the price is absolutely much cheaper here then Seoul. You have to shop here. Shop til you drop like me. Return broke to Bali "
Street Market & Food,Varieties of food stalls. Some were plastic covered. Wonder if those people would smell like what they eat when the come out.
If they make it you can find it here,"This market is huge and sells nearly everything from fruits, vegetables, clothes, household wares. Nearly every thing. Street after street of brightly coloured offerings.You can even get a suit made by the local tailor.If you are hungry there are lots of places to grab something to eat and drink. Sit down and watch the world go by.People were extremely friendly and I'm sure if you got lost could easily point you in the right direction."
Good find and a lot of things to purchase,"We did have a stroll there from the metro, the whole area is interesting.We did find food easily enough and a lot of other things, that we didn't purchase, well worth a visit"
Gukje Market,"you can find there nice chap souvenirs and market clothes bags hats,with a lot of fakes,a lot of great street food."
International Market in Busan,"Gukje Market is a place where you can find things imported from America, China, Japan and etc. I bought a lot of junk food here, like Japanese Ramen, American Chocolate etc; Things that I didn't see in Korean markets. Not only do they sell imported goods, you can find clothes, bags, make up; things that don't go together- here. It's a fun place, and while your there, I recommend trying out the fish cakes. Busan Fish Cakes are popular and really tasty"
Nampo Dong is awesome ,"What do I like about Nampo Dong? That I can a full day there and still not get enough of Korea. The market is a great experience with a lot of restaurants around, BIFF square, the park and the main shopping street. As i read in a tourist guide the area combines traditional shops with good food and adults entertainment. I would add a lot of Korean culture. So lively and especially in the evenings with the smell of BBQ. Definitely recommended"
A Market For International Products,"The market is located near most of the scenic spots as well as our hotels. We were attracted by their thick trousers that were not that popular and expensive in Canada. Other than that, we also found other global products from overseas. an interesting place to visit to try your luck for any unexpected items."
International Market in Pusan,"This is the most famous traditional market, where you can buy imported products from Japan, China, the USA, etc.. You can enjoy lots of cheap foods from street vendors or shops. This place become more famous because a movie of the same name was shot. You can see lots of foreigners negotiating the prices there."
Where to Locate the Souvenirs,"I spent a lot of time in Gukje and also Bupyeoung markets trying to find things that were suitable to take home as gifts. Mostly what I ran across were tons of shops that sold nothing but sunglasses, purses, shoes, and common kitchen and tableware that the locals would use, but don't convey anything to commemorate your trip to Korea. I finally located the areas in Gukje with shops that sell touristy type souvenirs that foreign visitors would buy. The first picture I uploaded shows this area highlighted in yellow, with the specific shops marked in red. Hopefully that makes it easier to find these places. Other tourist attractions such as the Busan Tower or the APEC building on Dongbaek Island also have gift shops that sell souvenirs like these, but these gift shops are nowhere near the size or have the variety of items that the shops in Gukje offer, and the prices at Gukje can be less if you bargain. Gukje was the only place I could find Korea tourist t-shirts, for example.I would recommend using a phone GPS phone app to keep track of which direction you are walking through these alleys. If you don't want to use a data plan, download Korea Tour that has an offline map for walking with GPS. If you handle walking OK, the Busan Tower at Yongdusan Park is within reasonable walking distance of Gukje, as well as BIFF square and Jagalchi Market. All of these are within easy walking distance of the subway."
Outdoor Market,"Not far from Jagalchi Market and BIFF (Busan International Film Festival) Square. This market place has thousand of shops selling food, kitchen stuff, electronics, diy tools, clothes. But the most that i love is a lot of food truck."
"if you need to pick up anything...really, anything!","You'll be able to find someone selling whatever it is that you need from housewares to clothing to kitchenwares to souvenirs. Even things you didn't know you needed, but that's half the fun of browsing streets like this when you don't actually need anything!Fun to look and see what's available and wonder why in the US we get stuck shopping for all this stuff at Wal-Mart. Markets like this are so much more fun!"
"Alley Ways of Housewares, Kitchenwares and Clothing","Alley ways upon alley ways of little stores selling kitchenware, housewares, clothing and other random products. The prices are pretty cheap and it is possible to negotiate slightly, but only if you purchase a lot. We bought a few makgeolli cups that we found, but be prepared to dig through the inventory of these stores to find what you are looking for as they are often not the most organized. It is easy to get lost in these alley ways as the market is pretty large, but would recommend walking down a few of them if you are in the area, you might find something unique at a good price."
Everything including the kitchen sink,"This outdoor market has many different sections and each one sells particular categories of goods. You can get korean souvenirs, household goods, small electrical goods, new and secondhand clothes, accessories etc, if you dont get to the right section you will be disappointed. It is also easy to get lost in the maze of streets but just ask someone to point you towards the subway if you do. You can get there from 3 subway stations-jagalchi, nampo dong & jungang dong. I like to go to nampo dong and also visit lotteworld ( if the weathers bad) and Gwangbok shopping street which is on the way (there are chain stores and boutique shops around here). A good area to wander around in Busan."
"Similar to Namdaemun Market, Seoul",Wear comfy shoes as you would need to walk a lot..If you've been here then you can skip Namdaemun Market when you are in Seoul. 
"Full of colour, activity and people.","This was a like any other Asian markets but on steroids. We were there at lunch time so it was a heaving mess of people looking to buy street food, so perhaps another time of day may have been easier.It was really easy to get separated from companions in the chaos so it is a good idea to start out with a plan in the event of becoming separated. It was a good fun place and we made a few purchases."
It's a bit rubbish really...,Ok for 20 minute walk round if you are in the area but wouldn't want to spend much longer. Market sellers not friendly and bartering doesn't really apply to majority of stalls. Arrogant take it or leave it attitude. Much betters sights to see in Busan. If time is limited avoid it- you are not missing out.
Not worth a visit,"A typical outdoor street market, spreading over several streets, selling all sorts of household goods and clothing. Nothing special and is perhaps more a place for shopping by locals. It is rather difficult to understand why it is regarded as a tourist attraction."
ugly!,This place is a typical market where you can buy al rubbish made in China. There's basically nothing you can not buy there - but there's nothing you need. Skip this market and go to BIFF Plaza for some street food.
Worth a visit if you want to experience a korean outdoor market,I was given the impression that the market is like Namdaemun in Seoul. But I was a bit disappointed as Namdaemun is more organized and sells better stuff. Did not buy anything.I would recommend this place if you have not been to a traditional korean market and you can try lots of street food.
"Prices high, area nice upgraded ","Part of the area nicely redecorated compared to a couple of years ago. It's noticed that Busan acknowledges the importance of tourism. However, most traders at this market are changing extremely high prices and most things are everywhere else available for 40% or less."
"Fish, Fish, Fish & seafood everywhere","At least half an hour walk, along the market where you can see fish, shell fish, seaweed on one side of the street & small restaurant selling fresh seafood opposite it. The local ladies would take their meals surrounded by products. The delivery boy/lady put the tray of food on their head & deliver. There is also an indoor wet fish market. We have seen enough in the open air so we did not visit the indoor one. Had lunch of few different type of grilled fish. Very fresh. Must try for the experience & noisy surrounding."
Lots of knock off goods,"This market has a lot of bags and knick knacks for sale. Most of them are knock off versions of big brands. While the quality is varied, the shops are not and they all stock the same basic stuff. There are some food stalls as well."
One of the Best places for Street Food in Korea,"The market is about the same as very market in Korea, but really the reason you should come here is for the food. I would plan on doing a lunch just wandering the streets and sampling all of the different street foods, including some that Busan is famous for.Along with all the regular stuff, some of the Busan specialties are a special nut and seed filled hotteok (kind of fried sweet dough with cinnamon sugar filling), and a spicy Odeng (fishcake) which is without a doubt the best I had in Korea. There is also a whole street filled with pat jjuk (red bean porridge) vendors. For only a couple of bucks per item for most things, you can really sample a variety. I think this is a must do in Busan."
One of my favorite markets in Korea,"Definitely worth the visit! They have the BEST pajeon (green onion pancake) I have ever eaten - and I'm a huge fan of the food. Very busy market, but there's a lot of bargaining to be done."
These are the parts of Korea that I absolutely adore!,"If you travel to Busan, Nampo-dong and Seomyeon are two of the areas that are a must visit to get your asian market fix. Gukje Market is in Nampo-dong right near the Jagalchi Fish Market and is a wonderful place to stroll around and people/culture watch. There is so much on offer here and for very reasonable prices including every day items like hats, bags, scarves and socks through to souvenirs that are usually very expensive in other parts of Busan like Shinsegae."
"They have everything in this area, but offer a different price to what they are asking",This is an awesome area to wander around. Walking distance from the fish market and lots of different shops and food areas. You can easily get lost but someone will speak English and can direct you back to the main drag where the metro and buses are.
This is how a market should be.,"Narrow streets, heavily laden shops, make this market an exciting experience. Not only exciting but also heart breaking - for tourists who leave by planes and are limited in the weight of baggage. You can find there everything. The most amazing thing was the incredible choice on offer, in many shops, of office supplies and duct tapes. I wonder what the Busan citizens do in their free time. :)"
Gukje Market,"Gukje market is where they sell food,clothes,handbags, accessories etc.It is said to be similar to namdaemun in seoul. But because i went there quite late, maybe activities had already reduced as its near closing.How to go thereJagalchi Station metro line 1 take Exit 7.Go straight 30m, turn left, and walk straight 5min to arrive at the market.If you're from yongdusan park, go down the long escalator, turn right and walk straight ahead. When you reach a busy place (people selling lots of stuff) you've reached gukje. I estimate around 5-8 minutes walk."
Shop till you drop - then come back for more!!!,"Great shopping experience. Located in the Jagalchi/ Nampo area Gukje Market has heaps of clothes stores down the back streets where you can find & bargain for some hip clothes & discount T-Shirts. There's also loads of second hand (vintage) stores selling electrical, manchester linen, home decor you name it & interesting food stalls. Great area for pottering around though it can get pretty crowded on a Saturday afternoon & one must have a sense of direction as it is easy to get lost. It is well sign-posted though, so one should be able to tell where one is. Remember to bargain with a smile, don't insult or become upset if you don't get the item for the price you wish. Simply move on to the next store where its very likely you'll find that same item cheaper anyway."
Shopping!,"Gukje market is very near to Jagalchi Market and BIFF Square. It's a maze of shops and don't worry if you get lost. Just ask anyone where is the subway (Jagalchi) and soon you will find your way back. What they sell in Gukje market? Beddings, electrical goods, lightings, hats, clothing."
Market to get lost,"This market place has thousand of shops selling food, kitchen stuff, electronics, diy tools, clothes. It is big and it is easy to get lost and to wander for several hours. Stop en route to nibble on a variety of food."
Awesome market,"I spent two days of my 4 day vacation here! It was fantastic. Bought Mink Blankets, lots of great souvenirs, all at excellent prices. The vendors did not really wish to haggle much, but the prices were such that i did not feel the need to really twist any arms. Great deals. great food. Fun day! Once you are done walk the few blocks over to the wharfside and hit the fish market for dinner!"
Wonderful market experience!,"We spent a few hours here shopping for items at knocked off prices and nice quality. But be warned, you have to really know what you are looking for before you get here, otherwise you'll end up buying stuffs you don't really need. The sales people are very persistent with selling you clothes they need to get sold that they would almost shove them at you even as you keep saying no. But since it was our first time in Korea, our target wasn't the goods but to try their local delicacies so we made sure to taste those that they sell on the streets. The foods were delicious and clean, you wouldn't really feel awkward sitting in the middle of the road eating noodles as people pass by. In fact, it was a one-of-a-kind experience for us."
Fabulous Shopping,"We spent our day here wandering around the TON of shops and food stalls. They really have everything and you must barter with everyone. They have many knock off items in varoius qualities so be prepared to look and haggle. Everyone is very nice but be prepared that most sizing isn't ""American"" sized. One shop keeper even pointed that bluntly out to a member of our group! If you take a taxi to the area also barter with the driver before you get in."
"Kukjemarket, Busan_Near BIFF, Jagalchi","Location - Near Busan Station : easy to access by Subway, bus(Under USD 2)Attraction - Many things can see and feel. many people also. May kinds of goods~Food - Real Local snacks you can try. cheap but the hygienic, you know that's why I call SNACKPeople - Kind but not softTourist center - between Jagalchi station and Nampo Station, Speak English, Chinese, JapaneseTips - BIFF, Jagalichi Market, It's walking distance."
Love it,I come here whenever I'm bored and want to spend a bit of money. And I do mean a bit because you can barter and if youre not looking for anything you need you can walk away easy and lower the price by doing that!
