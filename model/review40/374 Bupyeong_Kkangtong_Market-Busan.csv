So many restaurants to choose from!!!,"There are so many things to eat at this market. I recommend Fish cake since Busan is known for it. It's perfect for a cold winter day, sipping warm soup and eating soft fluffy fish cake. There are also many restaurant around there area, if you want crave something they will have it. "
Hot Night Market,"This was a faintly busy night market on a warm June evening. All the cooking that was going on all around us further added to the heat load. It was nice that the street was enclosed to protect the food stalls and vendors from the rain but I wonder if the enclosed roof keeps some of the heat inside. We tried a number of different items from various food stalls but the following stood out:A vegetarian noodle dish with a drizzle of some brown sauce came from a friendly Filipina whose noodle stand was right in the middle of the street. It was a little oily but flavorful. Fish cakes from Gamasot came as plain or four cheese filled ones on their own bamboo sticks. They were placed in a cup and a ladle full of broth (used to cook the fish cakes) was poured inside. The fish cakes were chewy but the broth was richer than we expected. A side of dukboki (made of rice) was slightly spicy and chewy. This seemed to be the only food stall with seats inside, a definite plus, to get out of the street and rest for a short while. We bussed our own trash after we finished eating.Overall a very good, but tight and hot night market. "
Night market of street foods,"Very crowded in the evening and there are lots of foods stalls.It's a good place to try various street foods.But, they aren't affordable. Buying 2~3 kinds of street foods will be more expensive than eating at a restaurant."
GOOD SHOPPING AND GOOD BARGAINS,This is a better shopping place than any other markets that I have visited.Better shopping experience than Myeongdong or Dongdaemun
Market with locals and touristy 7,Plenty of street food available here!! There is a cheap cafe before you reach the entrance... their Americano is 800won only.
Full of street food ,"It's awesome with street food lover. There are so many stalls where ou can find street food not only korean food but also of so many countries here such as vietnamese foods, turkey sandwiches, chinese foods or japanese foods. And out side of Bupyeong market, you will see so many restaurents and also many stalls that serve both soju and seafood in korean way. I just got lost here last weekend. It was so much fun with friends and I was so full LOL. Don't forget visit that night market. Oups! Bupyeong Kkangtong night market open at night till 24 o'clock.One more thing, Don't forget bring cash ;)"
Place to have earthy local meals,"Bupyeong Kkangtong have dry and wet market sections during daytime and transformed to food street and hoft. Its within walking distance to biff, gukje market and jagalchi station on Busan Metro line 1 is the nearest station.The food here is not that expensive as i saw the sliced pork belly for 3000krw for one portion and grilled eels for 9000 per portion "
The Cinderella extension of Gukje market☆☆,"The market opens at 7:30pm till midnight. So for over 4 hours, the market is filled with people eating street foods from all over the world. So many choices, all delicious, from savory to sweet. During my trip to Busan, we tried at least 2 different snacks every night. "
Happy tummy and eyes~,"Location: 48, Bupyeong 1-gil, Jung-gu, BusanAccessibility: You may take a taxi (the most convenient) or a local busBus No: 8, 11 , 96 , 103 , 113 , 126 Kkangtong Market is just a stone's throw away from Gukje Market.A visit to both Gukje market and Kkangtong Market is a good itinerary combo when in Busan. During the Korean War, imported goods (especially US canned goods) are supplied in the Kkangtong Market thus getting a funny name (tin can market). There are lots to see such as food, clothes, foreign products, accessories, fashion items, electronic goods, jackets, etc.!Your eyes and stomach will definitely thank you when you visit this market."
Large market,"This is like an extension of the gukje market across the road except that this has a roof covering making this place an all weather market. You can find food, clothes, souvenirs, etc here. "
Food overload!,"Bupyeong Kkangtong Maket is popular for its night food market. Plenty of stalls to choose from, both local Korean and international cuisine. Just remember that the place can be quite crowded so there isn't much comfort in walking along the stalls. However, the food selection is superb!"
Very crowded but lots to see,"This place is very crowded and has lots of vendors. There is an indoor area. I am shocked that the road is open to traffic though, it felt very tight when cars passed by. I like the market though. Stroller friendly. "
A place to have your meals in a local setting,"There can be confusion over the markets in the area because they are so close to each other. It is roughly in the area bounded by Daecheong-ro in the north and Gwangbok-ro in the south. Junggu-ro seems to demarcate this market from Gukje.Bupyeong is a traditional market with a dry and wet section. In the day, locals throng the market to make purchases of necessities. In the evenings, it turns into a place where local food and snacks ""take over"". There is a city tour bus stop along Daecheong-ro. Alternately, Jagalchi station on metro line 1is an alternative to get here.The market is a maze of alleys that run horizontally and vertically, so it should not be easy to get lost! Adjacent to the market are numerous small street restaurants that lend colour and smells to the market. These are very affordable places to lunch or dine and popular with the local people in the evenings.Keep walking eastwards and you will end up in Gukje market!"
