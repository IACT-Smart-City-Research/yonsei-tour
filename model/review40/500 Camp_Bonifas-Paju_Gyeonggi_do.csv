Base in the DMZ,"Camp Boniface is a base with the DMZ. It is guarded by South Korean and US troops. Can only be visited as part of a DMZ tour, but must include the JSA. The tour guides are left behind and army take over as the guides. We had a couple of young American privates, who had to wear sunglasses. A very important political site on the Korean border."
Got to go ,This is within the JSA. You just visit here as it was so interesting and like nothing else I’d experienced before. You can go into one of the small blue rooms and actually go into North Korea. The USA military soldiers were absolutely excellent.
The reason to do a DMZ tour,"This is the main place on interest for most people wanting to take a DMZ tour - the opportunity to experience first hand the tension between the two Korean forces. It is bizarre and exhillarating at the same time.On arrival you met your serving military guide on the bus (we had an America soldier) and are directed to a large room to be given a safety briefing where you sign a disclaimer recognising that this is a war zone. After having the life scared out of you, you return to the bus to head into the JSA and the famous blue buildings. On the bus you pass through a couple of kilometres of the DMZ, seeing farms and people who live there going about their business.Entering into the South Korean administration building you emerge facing the blue UN buildings which traverse the border. You are reminded only to look forward and to only take photos in the forward direction between two distinct points. It is all very tense. You can photograph the blue buildings and the North Korean buildings. After a photo stop and a few stories of North Korean soldier's antics (which happens while the tour group ahead of you is inside) you are then taken into the blue building itself. Half of the room is soldiered by South Koreans, the other by North Koreans. The N Korean soldiers don't look real, rather they look like wax work models. However, look closer (don't get too close as you will regret it) and you can see them breathing. You can walk over to the North Korean side and officially be in North Korean terroritory right in the middle of the DMZ. A fascinating and slighty unnerving experience, and the closest most people will come to the North. Back on the bus you can breathe a sigh of relief that you survived and back at the main camp buy a few souveniers to mark the occasion."
Fantastic tour to the North Korea border,"An absolute must do if you’re in Seoul. Make sure you book the JSA and DMZ tour otherwise, if you book the latter, you’ll be going back to Seoul at lunchtime and missing out on the most amazing experience. A guide on a bike tour told us that trips to the JSA can be cancelled at a moments notice, sometimes as the coach is pulling up to the gates of Camp Boniface, so the atmosphere is already a bit tense. Camp Boniface is the “entrance” to the JSA. As it’s a live border, the US Army are very strict about what you can and can’t do - clothing (see my picture for what my tour company allowed), a briefing, the security waiver, telling us when we could and couldn’t take photos. Sadly there were no North Koreans soldiers out that day, our US Army soldier guide said they rarely are when tours arrive on the South Korean side as they hate them, but we could see shapes moving around in doorways and behind tinted window.You are on the border for no more than 10 minutes but it is so worth it. Didn’t see the Bridge of No Return due to security issues which weren’t elaborated on. Such a fascinating tour which is equal parts exciting and nerve wracking at the same time!"
"Fascinating, but not the ultimate attraction","At Camp Bonifas, you’re getting incredibly close to North Korea. But this is only the appetizer to the main course. It is certainly of interest to see where the soldiers are stationed, but pushing deeper to Panmunjom gets much more intense!"
Right by the blue building,Named for one of the two soldiers killed in the axe murder relating to the poplar tree trimming. This is covered in the short film in the JSA building
Surreal experience,"It was a surreal experience stepping into this place as this is the middle ground of the ongoing war between North and South Korea. Although this is called demilitarized zone, this is one of the most militarized area in the world. Camp Bonifas includes these freedom houses (blue-colored houses) where peace negotiations are held between the two parties alongside the UN. Must visit for those who can."
"A chance to see ""Bob""!","This is the sole reason why I booked the DMZ/JSA tour. It is all about coming to this location, and stepping inside the ""blue building"", so you can step into North Korea. This is no joke, you have to sigh a waiver form, you MUST bring you passport, there is a dress code, and various rules as to how you must act. With that said, you will be in the blue building for around 5 minutes in total. You will then step back outside and face the ""North"". It is here that you can also take pictures. But of the ""North"" only. No picture taking of the ""South"". When I was there, there was one North Korean soldier outside. He is referred to as ""Bob"". There is also a 10 minute briefing before you aren't to this site."
Such a weird historic place!,This is the place where the South Korean/UN forces and the North Koreans are only a couple of meters apart from each other.This site has a great historic and current value. It really is impressive.Join a JSA tour to see it. 
Worth to visit,We joined the trip that was organized by USO-Seoul which we can recommend. The trip takes you around Camp Bonifas to view the North from a distance. Further the trip takes you to the tunnel and the railway station. For the tunnel you must be fit to make the climb back up since the tunnel is not a full height. Yes visiting is worth and must be part of your itinerary when you visit South Korea
HQ of DMZ zone for US and South Korea,A very Good briefing given by US Infantry Troops here and we were escorted by both US and South Korean military. All part of the official JSA Tour
Highlight of the tour ,In order to come to this area you need to be on a tour. I was pleased to come here as this was the highlight of the tour to see the UN nations coming together to protect South Korea and to provide tours to visitors.
Camp,"Part of the DMZ tour. Amazing view. You can see NorthKoreans guards from ""the other side"" you can feel the tension with the guards"
A highlight of the DMZ/JSA tour,"According to my tour guide, you must be on a tour to visit this place. This excludes private tours.Here the soldiers will give you a briefing along with some background history of the DMZ and JSA which is very interesting. Do note that they are very strict on photography so listen to and follow instructions from the soldiers. From here, they will take you to the Freedom House, which is the highlight of the JSA.There is a small museum and souvenir shop located here as well. Do take a look and grab some souvenirs to bring home!"
Part of the DMZ experience ,You have to be on a tour to visit but it is well worth it. This is the closest you will get to the DMZ and history was made here. The guides are military and bring the experience to a new level. This takes a few hours to take it all in and don't forget to see the museum. The whole tour includes a bus ride through the base. No pictures are allowed along the way but the guide will tell you when you can use your camera.
Gateway to JSA,I can't say much about this place. You're not allowed to take photos and are basically waiting for the military police to come on the bus and escort you to a loading area where another military bus will take you to the JSA. On the way out of the JSA you stop back at the camp for the souvenier shop. So there is not really anything to be said about the camp itself.
Interesting Briefing,"We enjoyed the briefing from the Soldiers at Camp Boniface. We visited there as part of the Discover Seoul package.If you benefited from this review, please click helpful."
The West's Tip of the Spear!,"Wife had to go to Seoul for business and I went along because - A, I love Korean food and B I had ALWAYS wanted to see the DMZ. Little did I know that tours that include the JSA (Joint Security Area), which is what you really want to see, book up way in advance. I managed to get on a tour and found myself on a bus heading North. It's a little eerie when you notice that the highway has barbed wire and watch towers along it (!) Also once out of the SEOUL area, the traffic thins markedly. After several attractions including the Third Tunnel (grueling, not worth it) a train station (deserted) and a quick lunch, we arrived at Camp Bonifas. They take security VERY seriously here - our perky Korean tour guide was replaced by an armed soldier and we switched to a different bus. First we saw a brief film on the conflict and had to sign waivers (because technically you are in a danger zone), then we went to the conference room located right on the border for the rare occasions the two sides talk. You get five minutes to snap photos and pose next to one of the two large, unsmiling South Korean soldiers. Technically you are now IN N. Korea. Then you stand on steps of the Freedom House building and look down at three huts (including the conf room) and a large building that is in North Korea, with cameras and microphones aimed at you. (Don't forget to smile... although gestures of ANY kind are prohibited.) It was pretty quiet - and hot - the day I was there - only one N Korean soldier staring into the West. then it was time to go. You are marched in and out, escorted by soldiers. The bus shows other points of interest - no getting off - the Bridge of No Return, the site of the infamous August 1976 axe murder of two US soldiers who had been sent to trim a tree that was impeding their view, then a stop in a rest area and gift shop (where you can browse very cool souvenirs available nowhere else.) Then it's back on the tour bus for the 90 minute ride back to SEOUL. Hard to believe these two sides have stood stand toe-to-toe in ""GO"" mode for over 60 years but the tour makes you appreciate the brave men and women who guard this border. Thank you."
First stop into the DMZ ,"Joined the koridoor tour to DMZ and it took us 45 minutes into the camp bonifas where you will be sat inside an auditorium and the U.S. soldier will explain to you about what happened and the dos and don't's during the visit. There's a souvenir store to the left of the hall where you can get North Korean bank notes, something I didn't even get to TOUCH in North Korea!"
Entrance to DMZ,"DMZ tour starts around 7:30 AM sharp, and takes about 45 mins to reach Camp Bonifas, which the entrance to the DMZ area operated jointly by the UN, US and Korean forces. Along the way an English-speaking guide briefs you on the history of Korean War, why the peninsula got divided and what the DMZ is all about. At Camp Bonifas, a US Army officer checks your passport, and a ‘tour member’ badge is issued to you and you are expected to wear it at all times."
The highlight of my USO/DMZ/JSA tour by Koridoor,"This is the best part of my DMZ tour. Here you feel like you are back home visiting one of the army camps friends. Soldiers here are American; they carry out their military responsibilities just like they do on the US/other foreign soil. The difference is they are here working around the clock at the world most heavily guarded frontier that involved two regimes political conflicts and UNC. This site visit requires much higher and extensive security and regulations to follow. You must also follow the dress codes set by UNC; details are provided by your tour operator once your booking is secured. Upon arriving at the Camp an assigned U. S. military personnel will meet your USO/DMZ tour guide and take over from there. Your passport will be checked. Visitors will be transferred to the Camp's bus when military guide conducts his JSA land tour. Upon arriving at the Visitor's Center, you group will wait for the scheduled time to enter the auditorium for briefing, sign a visitor's declaration (a waiver of responsibility) and watch a short video presentation on the related subjects. You then again wait for the turn to go through the Freedom House to the other side where the UNC/MACHA and Conference Row/Conference Room located. From here, you are allowed to take pictures of the JSA from the north side of the Freedom House and the views of Panmungak on the North Korea side. Taking pictures with rock soldiers in the Conference Room is permitted but you must follow the strict rules given by your military guide. Pay full attention of the ""Do and Don't "" your military guide tells you; so you do need to behave accordingly. Your visit to the Conference Room and the area in front of the Freedom House on the north side will be monitored and time is precisely controlled by your military guide. Only one group at a time is allowed to enter the Conference Room and visiting time is short. On the day of my visit only a few lucky visitors got their chances to have pictures taken with rock soldiers in this tiny room packed with large conference tables and chairs. Nice thing to brag about the visit to the Conference Room is that you are actually walking on part of the N. Korea's soil. You must sign up on the DMZ tour to be permitted in Camp Bonifas. My visit also includes view of the Bridge of No Return and the memorial site where Ax-murder took place. It's an excellent tour though feeling tensed through out the visit. I highly recommend spending money on this one of your lifetime visit and if weather cooperated you will get the best of it."
Interesting camp,Named after the soldier whom was killed after cutting a poplar tree its sad how he and his team were brutally murdered by the North Koreans. In the camp you can hear frequent gunshots of south korean training units. You can also see the barracks where soldiers train and sleep.
One of a kind experience.,"You need your passport and official clearance ahead of time to enter this ""Camp"" or rather a military base protecting DMZ. Your bus will be assigned to a military guide and you have to follow all the rules and instructions. There is an auditorium where you will receive your briefing. After the visit there will be time for shopping. The gift store is very attractive and offers the whole selections of gifts and souvenirs. This is truly an amazing trip."
This is where your JSA tour begins,"When you book a joint DMZ/JSA tour this is the place where you'll begin your JSA tour. Your bus has a set time to arrive-no earlier, no later or your tour will be canceled, so make sure your tour bus is on schedule!Our bus was boarded by a US Army PFC who verified our passports and made sure we were all dressed appropriately (no shorts, ripped jeans, short skirts, graphic t-shirts allowed and this is so the North Koreans can't turn images of you into propaganda or use for other purposes). Your best attire is a simple pair of pants (not skinny jeans) or long (non-body hugging) skirt, with a collared plain shirt on top.Once our passports were verified we proceeded on to the visitor center, which I believe used to the the Officers' Club (aka the Monastery) in past years.Here you'll have the ability to use the bathroom before your 15-20 minute briefing and signing of a liability waiver (I've posted a photo so you'll know what you're signing before you get there). The briefing/history/slide show was very interesting and gives you a lot of history about the JSA you might not know and prepares you well for the next part of your visit.From here you'll board a different (Army) bus (leave all your personal belongings on your bus-except your phone/camera; don't worry, your bus will be locked) and go into the DMZ and to the JSA.You're not allowed to take photographs while you're on the bus (your guide will explain where you can and can't take pictures) but you'll be wanting to pay attention to what you see along the way to your first stop.At the JSA you'll follow directions and proceed through the building, up the stairs, and out to the front of the building where you'll come face to face (well, not that close but it sure feels like it!) with North Korea. You'll be told not to point or raise your arms in any manner not associated with taking pictures. Think of attending an auction and not wanting to place a bid by accident, except there are worse consequences here!Now, you can take all the pictures you want of the conference room buildings, the North Korean soldier (""Bob"") and anything your guide tells you is OK to photograph. The US military monitoring devices are off-limits and so is turning around and taking a picture of the building you just walked through. But, if you want a picture of the US/South Korean building there are photos taken from the North Korean side on the web.Now you'll go into the conference room. Inside you'll see a large conference table and chairs in the middle with a US flag at the head of the table. This table spans the border and the UN flag is in the middle of the table. You are free to take pictures of anything and everyone in the room, including the soldiers, the table, and anything out the windows-like the concrete slabs that demarcate the border. Pretty intense stuff. Yes, it's OK to cross the ""imaginary"" line through the room and go into North Korea. You are technically on the North Korean side of the JSA, but you won't get a stamp in your passport.After you've spent your allotted time (10 minutes or so) inside, you'll line up and walk back to the buses in an organized manner. No photography from the buses of the buildings.After this stop you'll be on the bus for about 5 minutes until your next stop where you'll have a great view into North Korea and will also be able to see the Bridge of No Return and the site of the infamous Axe-Murder Incident (same location). You'll board the bus and head to that location and once you arrive you'll be able to take pictures from the bus but will not be allowed to exit the bus.Now you'll head back to the visitor center, have a chance to use the bathrooms again and shop in the gift shop for DMZ souvenirs (active military gets a discount) before you board your bus back to Seoul.It was a surreal (ok, overused word when talking about this, I know) experience and one I would recommend to anyone interested in the relationship between the two Koreas and the cold War. I learned more from this tour than I believe I did in school."
Eye opening to see how these brave soldiers serve us.,"Just before the JSA and well into the DMZ this is an opportunity to see how soldiers live and serve to safeguard freedom from a tyrannical, maniacal Communist dictatorship."
An interesting part of the DMZ tour,This peaceful looking area with soccer fields and golfing holes for the JSA military guards really isn't all that bucolic when you realize the entire thing is completly enclosed in multiple layers of razor wire and surrounded by minefields. Super interesting place for sure!
Part of DMZ Tour that we booked,Excellent explanation of what happened during the Korean War. Some sad stories of the Axe Murder just because of a tree. Definitely should take the DMZ tour.
Unforgettable,"Went through here with USO Tours, and there is quite a lot to see, limited on what can be taken photos of for security reasons. They have a good souvenir shop where you can buy North Korea things as well as other DMZ things."
Great place,You can get your group photo by the tour operatorAlso there is a great souvenir shop to get gifts of your visit here.
Unforgettable Trip,Very interesting place that you don't miss ! You can see North Korea closely. But a bit tension and very strict zone.
