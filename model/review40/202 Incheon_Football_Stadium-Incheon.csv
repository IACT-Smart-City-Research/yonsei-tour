Good Fun,"Incheon United football stadium seats 20,891 and was built in 2012.It is easily reached from Seoul main station on subway line 1 to Dowon station.The ground is right opposite the station .Incheon United -the Blue-Blacks or Cranes-play in the K-League.We bought tickets outside at the ticket office for about Â£10 for the game against Gyeongnam.There are no bars near the ground but you can buy beer and food to have at your seat inside.There is a good merchandise shop.There is a good family atmosphere."
The Best Football Stadium In Korea,"The Incheon Football Stadium is home to K League side Incheon United, and is maybe the best looking stadium in South Korea.Games take place between March and November, normally in weekends.Tickets are cheap at around W10,000 per person.Easy to access via Seoul Subway Line 1.The only negative is that there isn't much around the stadium at the moment."
