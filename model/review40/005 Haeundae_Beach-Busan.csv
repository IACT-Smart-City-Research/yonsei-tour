Good beach,Good clean beach conveniently located at the upscale end of Busan. I enjoyed a couple of hours of nice sunshine at the beach on a Saturday and it wasn’t crowded at the time.
Nice for a stroll in the sun,Great to walk along and enjoy during the day and in the evening with the light display. Don’t expect to get in the water before June or after August. For some reason this is policed! Plenty of good restaurants and coffee stops to choose from.
Nice Beach with Lots of people,"I went there with hubby in May 2019. We tried to go as many locals (not too Tourist area) as possible, but this beach linked Tourist areas and some locals. Be prepared crowded areas. It was windy and My husband told me the water was cold (he went to do the testing) and it was good to be there. Locals were nice. Tourists were there and happy relaxing. "
Great scenic beach,Great beach for people watching and for taking scenic photos but not for bathing. Close to restaurants and easy access using metro or the tourist bus loops.
Cool white sandy beach,"Get down at Huaendae Station and walk about 500m and you will find this lovely white sandy beach. In the autumn it is cooling and perfect to go here. Good to relax and plenty of food to eat too. Many places of interest are nearby too: Dongbaek Island & Busan Aquarium ( walking distance ), Centum City ( by taxi / train) etc."
Nicest beach in Korea,"A sandy beach, hreat for passing the afternoon with friends, family or solo. There are many restaurants on the promenade next to the beach and some green parks nearby as well."
Beautiful,"A beautiful beach and so clean ! We were here in November , I can only imagine what it's like in summer."
Great for sunsets,"Come here for sunset and people watch, I think that’s the best time to come and enjoy the beach especially in the colder months "
Great beach,"In the summer it would be packed, but in early November it was perfect for walking along the beach path. Along the path there is a tourist info office, plenty of toilets, street food and the Aquarium. On the other side of the road there are restaurants, fast food outlets, cafes etc."
Nice beach,"Nice beach. It's about 40 minutes from Busan. From Haeundae Beach, can walk to The Westin Chosun hotel where you can get to APEC Nurimaru House."
"Very nice beach, probably one of the finest in Korea. The beach is not very long but ",It is beautifully flanked on the north side by a cluster or modern looking metallic skyscrapers which also house fine dining restaurants. There are some small islands scattered in the far side ocean and some bizarre superman or spiderman statues not too far from the shore. A little bit wacky but ok.
Walked on the beach,Went for a afternoon work. It's a nice place to just chill. Not overly crowded. Was close to my hotel.
The best beach in Korea,"Without stating the obvious, this beach is so lovely. Clean, warm and easy swimming. The water is warm up until late October so you can swim for a large chunk of the year. Well worth a visit when in Korea! "
Beautiful a clean beach in Busan,Huaendae beach is best location for walking a see the sunrise in Busan areaBeach is clean and can reach with public transport( bus or subway) from Central Busan
40 mins from Busan!,"Miles away from Busan, especially if you’ve already travelled from Seoul by train (2.15 hrs). There are nice walks along the dock of Busan so you don’t need to go here unless you really want to sunbathe!"
Wide clean beach with great views,The beach was wide clean and surrounded by great views. No one swimming in October but a nice place to walk and relax. At night there are professional singers based there (at least while we were there). Like most of Korea seems a very safe place day or night.
Beach area.,Went on Saturday afternoon for stroll and plenty going on with singers and people entertaining. Plenty of eating venues and some large apartments towers been built at one end. In October no one in water but looks like it would be fine in warmer times.
Nice beach,"But only food nearby is an underground food court, unlike Gwangalli Beach which is lined with beachside bars and pubs. LPGA tour was in town so probably expensive digs. I just stopped by because I had a day pass for the hop-on hop-off bus."
Tranquil Beach,"I stayed at MS Hotel (mid Oct) overlooking the Haeundae Beach and only see a handful of people walking along the beach most of the time, Such a quiet beach with no activity. May be it is only popular in summer?. The sand is fine and the water is cool but no cold. Did not see anyone swimming. But I like its tranquility atmosphere."
less stay,"Because I couldn't stay long only visit at night shortly so I can not say this is good place. Anyway, I think it will good for drink soju with friend. :)"
Sunset glory...absolutely stunning,"In the winter, this beach is perfect for sunset views and strolls along the sand. The vibe is relaxed and there are lots of families, dogs, people playing volleyball and it's just generally a really nice place to sit and people watch and feel happy. We missed being by the beach and the sea as have been travelling for a while so this was a perfect first glimpse at the natural beauty of Busan."
Great beach to just relax and unwind,"Went there end of Sept, so it was still possible to swim in the sea. We didn't though. Opted to just watch the sunset and enjoy the sound of the waves. There were also buskers around that made our time hanging around the beach more enjoyable. There's also a very cozy tourist information centre (right next to the aquarium) where you can ask questions, get directions, get pamphlets, refill your water bottle and there were lockers to store luggages as well should you need them. Walked 10 minutes towards the other side of the beach to find many seafood restaurants."
A grand beach,"Shortly before a sunset, it' s a right time to enjoy a lively atmosphere of the beach. Metro 2 - Haeundae station. A touristx promenade and a large sandy beach. A trendy skyline, nice view to the islands.An aquarium is present, we did not visit it.What else?"
"Clean, crisp, everything you expect from a beach",Amazing scenic views and only a walk away from a beautiful walkway that overlooks the sea. No filters needed
Busy busy!,Very pretty beach and strip. Living area with restaurants and bars galore.Perfect clean sand with toilet facilities aplenty.clean & safeBusy even at 4am!! no loungers or chairs in Oct as technically “out of season” but still warm enough to sunbath if you son wished although noone else was.
Beautiful beach ,"It is difficult to find a beach in Korea.This is the center of the new Busan city, surrounded by many typical buildings and the symbol of the city.The beach has an arc shape, clean yellow sand. I came here in the cold season so I did not experience swimming here. The Beach manager is very interested in providing the service for visitors after walking under the sandstorm to step on the curb. There is a hose for washing feet, a vaporizer for blowing sand.Locals and tourists come here to play and take pictures a lot.It is best to come here in the afternoon to see the sunset and the night of the beach."
A waste of time,"As much as I’d heard boasted about this beach, it is an extreme let down if you’re looking for a beach day, as American standards for a beach go. There are no chairs, the beach is riddled with broken styrofoam and other trash and everyone is wearing long sleeves and pants. No one is in the water and it doesn’t feel comfortable to take off outerwear to wear a swimsuit as a foreigner. Don’t consider this a beach vacation as it’s definitely not. I wish I had researched more ahead of time before spending the time to take the metro all the way out here. "
Beautiful Beach,"I live along the coast of Australia and get to see lots of beach , but I must say Haeundae beach is absolutely beautiful with nice walk way and lots of entertainment in the evening , busker singing Korea song ,I find it very entertaining with the sea breeze gently blowing on your face on a beautiful evening ,"
Nice relax in between working days ,"Beautiful landscape and very well organized walking itinerary, you can start along the beach from nearby the Paradise hotel and move towards the Westin; take the stairs to climb the coast path and have nice views. Stop to say hello to the sad Mermaid. A lot of choice for restaurants as well."
A nice beach.. thats it,"Its a nice beach, but nothing special though. I mean you can walk up and down and enjoy the sunset. Its relative clean sand but I did not walk bare feet. Somewhere near the Sealand is a public toilet with shower(paid) and a foot washing station (free). Maybe it was a bit late in the season so nothing much going on there. From the beach you can reach quickly the main street for food, which is convenient. Would I go back there? only if I get invited."
Birthday trip ,"Quite a gem for us. The beach is directly across from our hotel and we made sure the make the most it. We checked into our hotel, put on our beach wear to get as much of evening light as we possibly could. It’s probably about 1/2 mile in length, waves for the surfing folks and clean and beautiful sand to walk on. We went back to next morning for the sunset and surprisingly found that it’s a popular place fitness conscious of all ages. They could tell that we were foreigners and smiled when we walked by and some even tried to make small talk with their limited English. If you need to shower it cost you a few thousand Won. There are also a few vendors off the beach in case you want to get some light fare a just bottled water. This was nice break from our continuous walking tour over the past 8 days. "
Beach,Do go to the beaches in Busan. It is filled with lots of people enjoying the sun and seasides. I could just stay there the whole day!
Choppy Waves During Typhoon Season,"We went there during the typhoon season, hence the beach is not safe for swimming. Though there is staff managing the beach warning tourists not to go near the waves, we still see tourists taking a dip into the waters. However, the view is amazing. It reminds me of Gold Coast Australia. "
Very nice and beautiful,I was a really short time in Busan but the most beautiful thing a saw there was these very beach. I went there every day. There weather was also very nice and I had a pleasant time there. I enjoyed the beach very much.
Peaceful beach in the city,"My partner and I enjoyed Haeundae Beach. We found it very peaceful, although in fairness we were there on a national holiday (Chuseok.) However, it was very clean and the water was a clear blue. The scenery of the surrounding city was just lovely!"
Nice and Crowded Beach,"It's a nice beach,but very crowded.I liked mostly the surrounding area, with many restaurants and things to see.Anyway, I prefer Gwangalli Beach."
Nice city beach,"Haeundae beach is really nice and clean. During peak season, however, good luck finding a good spot. The water can get a little dirty from all the swimmers, but off-peak this is a real treasure "
Clean beach,"nice clean beach to stroll around, get wet, thr r some free changing booths, not much crowd, we stayed nearby so commute was not a problem, people r thr till night 1, we can take something to eat on the beach since no food stalls r thr"
Calming beach,We went during noon on a cloudy day and it was gorgeous. Very peaceful. Wasn't crowded. At night there are street foods at the stalls. You need coins to rinse out at the shower station. There is a machine that convert bill to coins. They accept small bills. You can ask taxi to drop you off at the Westin Chosun hotel for convenience access
Good Beach ,"It’s a good beach to enjoy. It is one of the most popular beach for busan and thus must be visited You can rent a tent , mat or swimming tubes etc their to enjoy. There is local market nearby with lots of food and entertainment options. "
Interesting to see,"The beach is unlike any beach I’ve seen. It is enjoyed by thousands, but I passed. It is not doubt a cool relief on a hot summer day, but it you need to be happy to share!"
Gorgeous and very popular but Reaching area by car or bus is a nightmare ,Everything they say is true about this beach. But be prepared if coming from train station to sit in 1-2 hour traffic. 
Clean,"The beach is very clean, and on the back you can see a lot of skyscrapers, which is a quite unusual view."
Haeundae Beach is the symbol of Busan in the Summer,"Nice, clean beach with a lot of service facilities. It is the symbol of Busan in the summer vacation. But there was Typhoon warning when we visited, so the swimming was prohibited because of high tides. It is very safe areas, and there are Sea Life Aquarium and Dongbaek Island to take a walk in Haeundae Beach."
Fun beach with nice sand,It can get a little bit crowded in early August but otherwise a nice beach to get out of the hot sun.
Super nice beach ,"This beach is super nice, clean, freshly organized, the view is amazing. I do recommend taking a stroll around there "
"Nice beach, no swimming!?","Nice enough beach but unfortunately happened to be here when apparently it wasn’t swimming season. No one allowed in the water at all, life guards yelling at anyone who went near. Really odd and a bit of a shame. "
Sunny day ,Beach full of beach goers in summer. The sea water is clean and there are cafes nearby if u wanna chill!! 
Best beach in Busan!,"Beautiful beach. Coincide with Busan Sea Festival. Concert is filled with happening party goers. Hotels along the coast has live bands too. Plenty of people strolling, sitting around the beach area even at 12am."
Beautiful beach at the city front,"Skyscrapers right behind the sunbeds and umbrellas feel impressive.August is super hot day and spending the whole day under the umbrellas we got a proper sunburn, so be very careful."
Good beach,"Good, very crowded beach with lots of facilities nearby. Sea was quite rough when we visited. Lifeguards on duty."
"Would be great, but it's a cesspit","This review is of the beach itself, not the markets or shops surrounding it. The beach is fun, it's got full shark nets and lifeguards on jetskis, at 1800 MOST of the beach closes (but a slither still remains open) to swimmers.On the beach itself, in the evening, performers are around every 100m, they are fun to watch.All this is great until you look at the sand, the amount of rubbish is simply staggering, and if you hang around at 1800 you can see the mass exodous of beach goers going, leaving all their rubbish behind. Busan council need to do a better job of enforcing cleanliness on this beach, I felt scared letting my child run around as there were a lot of cigarette buds and the always-present-fear of glass shards from bottles, etc.This could be so much better, but the people who go there ruin it :("
Impossible for women to swim alone / and be aware of high swimming restrictions,"After a few weeks traveling all over Korea, we decided to rest our last days in Haeundae : we gave up swimming the 3rd night. My daughters couldn't swim without being followed by 5 men who circled around them and narrowed their circle until my daughters couldn't move. The night before, we could handle the stares, but that time it was too much and really scary. I stayed with my daughters and spent time yelling at those animals until they finally gave up. But they were taking pictures on the beach of many women. They even tried to hit on one them... And she was with her boyfriend !It was hard to ""swim away"" from those animals, since the swimming area is restricted to hardly 20 meters away ; if you're used to swim long distance, just forget it, SThis is not the place to go (but if that was the only problem, I wouldn't mind).Did I mention that it was crowdy every time we went swimming, but we were the only ones without a male friend around ? I should also say that every day that happened, none of those animals were korean. If you Google Haeundae, you'll see that there are prostitution issues over there ; does it explain it all? I wonder"
Overall Good Beach,"Over 3 days most of the times it was very busy, even at night. Very popular. 3rd day midmorning (9-11) wasn't too bad. Not many people, water was perfect. There was some garbage in the water, but not too bad. The beach drops off significantly just a few feet out, so not ideal for weak or younger swimmers. It gets deep fast. This also leads to large waves. So great for strong swimmers/bigger folks. Worth a swim if warm enough."
"Haeundae Beach, Busan","Haeundae is famous for its beach, its nightlife, and its lively atmosphere. Walk along Haeundae Market to acquaint yourself with Korean street food. Haeundae Beach is clean and enjoyable to dip into its cooling waters in summer, and enjoy frolicking in the sea and enjoy the sea activitiesin store. After you’re done being active, relax in the shade of a beach umbrella and cool down with a cold beer or a cold drink."
A very pretty beach!,"The beach is very clean, the weather is really nice even though it’s summer, hot but still not overwhelming. It’s not too overcrowded and it has many other places around it like cafes and i believe i saw an aquarium too. In conclusion, a great spot!~"
Popular Beach of Busan,"I stayed at Haeundae Grand Hotel, the beach is just cross the road.At night there are food stall nearby the beach hiding between the footpath and along the beach served very fresh local seafood. One night I walked along, they have live music by the beach. I was so lovely and relaxing. The beach itself is clean, on a sunny day is good for photo whether the sand color is not so white but it give golden contrast to the sea water and blue sky.I like this beach.The photo taken from the elevator of the hotel I resided, showing the beach from afar."
The place to chillax?,"Ya heard about the Haeundae Beach? Well if you looking for relaxed ocean vibes maybe it ain’t the place. In the summer there be like tens of thousands of people’s at that spot. So if you like the personal space maybe this ain’t it.It ain’t cost nothing to kick it on the beach, but they be selling mad stuff. 8000 wons for an umbrella or 8000 wons for a beach chair, or 8000 wons for a tube. It’s all good if you want to crush some beers on the beach because you can. I think the further away from the Westin Chosun end the less crowded it is. Overall the water alright for Korea and you can get your chill on so check it out in the summer. "
Great Beach,"Great experience. A very clean beach with all amenities. Great weather, this time of year. A must visit experience."
Too crowded in the Summer months,"Nice area, super fancy and expensive but good food and bars all at reasonable prices can be found easily too. Ideal for couples, friends and families. Don’t miss the awesome seafood restaurants in the northern side, right where the sand ends"
Really clean and lots of Lifeguards,"Coming from Southern California I did not have real big expectations for finding a really good beach in Korea. WOW, was I blown away!!!The beach is very well maintained and the was tons of Lifeguards watching over the clearly marked swimming area. There are umbrellas available and the water was great! The beach facilities also were impressive with a great area to rinse off and “desand”. "
Nice beach,"Haeundae beach is easily accessible by Metro. The street leading to the beach is very bubbly - full of street stalls, bars and restaurants as one can imagine. It is well served in terms of peripheral cafe or restaurants outlet all around. The beach itself is very opened. There are shower facilities. A reasonably clean beach with lots of activities. Even if you are not swimming, a stroll around it is just as nice. This is one of the top tourists spots in Busan so a must check out. I personally didn’t spend a lot of time there. "
Great beach,Very nice and clean beach with a beautiful view on the ocean. On the beach is a great variety of services.
Modern but lacking of be a h activities,The beach is pretty much for people watching and street shopping. The location has skyscrapers for its seascape. The beach is clean and crowded in summer but it is lacking of water sport and recreation.
Nice place to walk,On a clear day you can walk without a mask and really enjoy the well maintained walkways and beach areas. Lots of shopping g and food choices. I recommend!
Nice city beach,"Depending on weather condition, can be pretty cloudy/hazy at the beach on some days, or waves are too strong for swimming. Today’s great weather makes it super nice to hang out. There are lifeguards to keep watch, also cleaners to pick up rubbish. You can rent the umbrella with mat for 8000won and the swim tube for 8000won. "
Beach,"Nice beach..we rented 2 lounge chairs, 1 umbrella, and one tube for 30.00. While I was in the warer they came and tried to take my chair...probably because we were foreigners. This happened 2 times and then they tried to take our umbrella! Other than rude vendors we had a great time"
Nice Beach,"This beach is great for singletons and families. You can rent chairs and umbrella sets for 24,000. The west side of the beach twds the Westin seems to be the quieter side. Only slight annoyance is dudes constantly coming up trying to sell you chicken. They have trash bins on the pedestrian path for disposing of your litter (wish more people would utilize them) The beach also has bathroom and shower facilities. As a westerner I was caught off guard that when you go into the restroom you need to grab your necessary amount of toilet tissue from the “community” roll by the entrance, as there arent individual toilet rolls in each stall. Overall a wonderful family beach"
Foggy night on summer,"It was foggy night at the beach on a summer season, but during the day it was so clear, they say you can be prohibited from swimming because there are no life guards sometimes. "
Active starting in July,"Beautiful water, clean beach. Great place to people watch with lots of options for hotels. Two metro stops with in range. Also food street right off the beach."
Koreas Ibiza,"Ok, very nice, very clean. Party area for SE-Asia. Expensive bars and restaurants. Our daughters (20+) loved it but me and my wife were very happy to catch the train back to Seoul."
Haeundae Beach,Very nice place with the view of city and the sea. You can see amazing nature from the beach. You cam swim in fresh water
Beautiful,"I love this beach. Beautful view, a lot of coffee spots, adorable spot for photos, easy to get there."
A pretty long beach with beautiful views and many activities,"We stayed in Fairfield by Marriott which was pretty near to the beach so we went a few times. It’s a long stretch and very clean.there were buskers and activities ongoing in the evening, and we loved the atmosphere. U can walk from the beach to the park next to Hilton. Pity the foot spa wasn’t open ."
Nice place to have fun,Can’t compare to other beaches in Busan but this was good for me. Good place to relax and have fun. Many shops and restaurants around. Clean.
Magnificent Beach with perk,"This naturally beautiful beach near city centre is easy to access with metro. At the end of walking street there lies the beach, just walk 800 m straight and you are there.The beach was surprisingly clean for big city beach, because there are loads of children so they keep it clean.Heard that they are very creative with sand sculptures in this beach. There are many artists near the beach whose performance draws people to visit and Improves the atmosphere.They are really strict with photography taking regarding sexual pictures."
Fun to play in the sand,Playing in the sand is always fun. The water isn't too cold and the beach is fairly clean. It wasn't busy so had plenty of space to spread out. In the July and August it can get really busy.
Most beautiful beach in Busan!!!,Easy to walk to the beach from Haueundae Station on Line 2. Long and clean beach with no end to the ocean. Lots of restaurant around this area and they close very late. You can even see people playing at the beach in the middle of the night. Highly recommended place for beach fun and relaxation. 
Enjoyable Beach Visit,"Haeundae Beach was a long stretch of fine white sand. It was a hot mid morning and the beaches were sparsely populated with some under their beach umbrellas while others were cavorting in the clear, cool ocean waters. The beach was also very clean. With all of this, I can see how this would be a popular and crowded beach later in the summer season.The biggest attraction, besides the sand and sea, was the large number of sand sculptures. A lot of skill and patience were devoted to building these massive works of sand that ranged in subject matter from Elvis, the Wizard of Oz and many more. Each one came with a sign detailing who made it and what it represented but it would have been even better if we had been around duirng the construction.."
Busy but fun place!,"It's such a beautiful and relaxing place despite the fact that it's quite busy. Tons of places to eat and drink, from markets to restaurants. When you get tired from all the walking around the city, this is the place to chill even for a bit. A must see place for sure!"
"Nice views, many restaurants!",Umbrellas decked the clean beach. Nice views all round with blue waters. Many restaurants. Recommended dish: stir-fried octopus and belly pork!
Highlight of Busan,There was a sandcastle competition set to music on one section of the beach-enjoyable to view; I can't imagine anyone visiting Busan and not getting to Haeundae Beach-nice respite from this busy port city.
Beach walk with 13yo and 8yo.,Walked the Haeundae Beach with my family. The beach was a short walk from the nearest rail station(Haeundae). There are many eateries and entertainment spots in the area. The beach was clean and presents a good view of the seafront. There is also a trail from Westin Chosun. The trail also leads to APEC reception exhibition.
its beach !!! relax,"visiting with family, never forget Haeundae Beach, such nice scenery mix between buildings and beach ."
must go,walk along the coast in the early morning. enjoy the street artists late in the night. there are also cheap and good massage parlors. check them out during the day.
Interesting Beach,This beach is really special with the backdrop of high building and a very wide beach is really nice even just for a walk. Start from the Westin Chosun all the way to the other side of the bay in the middle you find the aquarium also nice place to visit .
Deserves the hype,"We really enjoyed our day here and spent our time relaxing on the beach, walking round the market and shops and eating/ drinking of course. You can easily spend the best part of a day here."
Sandcastle Festival,"My daughter and I went to Haeundae Beach. It was really really hot for early June. The umbrellas and the snack stand was already set-up for the summer season. My daughter and I admired the sand art then dipped in the water. It was not crowded as it was s Tuesday. When we got hungry, we crossed the crosswalk to eat at the Starbucks in the corner. It has sandwiches, salads and ice cold drinks. Afterwards, we were back on the beach side. This is the best of the year for the beach when the season is not in full swing."
Haeundae Sands Festival ,We are lucky to see all the works from the sands Festival. Good weather in June and nice time to visit. Beautiful weather 
Gorgeous Beach,"We could not decide to stay in the city or beach front. Best choice we made. Just 200 meters from the beach. Absolutely beautiful beach, clean, well maintained, very long stretch & was busy over weekend & really happening. Must visit & stay in the area if possible. Lovely walk all along to the park next to Westin Chosun. They rent beach chairs & very relaxing calm place to be. "
Nice beach ,"Lovely beach. When we went, it wasn’t really swimming time but it was a beautiful with blue waters. This place in the summer must be amazing. "
Beautiful City Beach,"Haeundae Beach is a must see when you are in the area. Very wide, very long beach with fine sand and many, many restaurants, cafes and bars alongside the promenade. There are several festivals and performances over the year, and even if you don't want to go swimming it is still a nice place to rest."
Clean beach but sea was cold in May,As we went their end of May it was still the low season. There were no beach beds or umbrellas to hire and the water was cold so no one was swimming in the sea. So it was a bit disappointing.
Nice,When there at night because it was raining whole day. Its a very nice beach. Must go. And there are a lot of good food around. And casino
Clean beach,"Haeundae beach is one of the most popular beaches in Busan. The place has an amazing selection of restaurants, local eateries, international cuisines etc. This beach is the destination for everyone who loves sun, sand & summer.The beach is one long & clean stretch of white sand. There is a small platform for the artists to perform. "
Amazing beach,A long expanse of sandy beach; we came across the sand-festival with interesting sand sculptures to see. 
Holiday ,Nice beach in Busan. Easy to go by Local taxi from downtown. You can restaurant along the beach. I stay at Hotel around there that can go anyway. 
Sterile,"Maybe it was just when we visited (there is a sand castle fest next weekend, and there was major prep going on-- which was sort of cool, to be honest), but this beach is SO touristy. No shells, no kids running around, just perfectly groomed sand and dressed-up people taking selfies. NOT my idea of ""the beach."""
Haeundae Beach,"Haeundae beach is one of the famous beach at Busan. It also known as long white sand n beautiful sea view. Don't come here, during night because nothing to do. "
Great sandcastle art,Huge beach and lots going on. Worth a visit. Didn’t swim as it was only 20 degrees so can’t comment on that. Lots of cafes around and an aquarium. 
Nice to get out of thd city,"Nice beach although can only swim when they tell you otherwise you are escorted out of thed water. Enjoy the hot water foot spas for free along the beach front and a few streets back. A must thing to do it walk the ols train track around the coast from the beach to a little village with two lighthouses, one red and one white. Here there are coffee shops with ocean views, lots of restaurants with fresh seafood. In yhis village is also the skywalk over the ocean with a glass floor, alot of fun. Enjoy the markets for fresh food and hot traditional food. Also visit tghe Apec centre, lighthouse and mermaid rock at the southern end of beach."
Like any other beach,I visited mid May and there were no activities going on the beach thus it looked and felt like any other beach. There are outdoor foot spas dotted along the beachfront promenade but we were there in the morning thus it has not opened yet.
Gorgeous beach,"Extremely clean, well maintained beach. Lots of amenities, restaurants and bars close by. Loved the statues at either end of the break water."
So nice to be here!!,"This beach was nice. Beautiful and relaxing. I went in late April, where there wasn't a lot of people, so that was nice. The Busan aquarium is just next to the beach, so it is convenient to go there and look at the ocean life there."
Fun spot,"Surfers, soccer players, sand diggers, dog walkers, and those just out for a stroll all enjoy being here sharing the space and sunshine."
An ordinary beach,Haeundae Beach was a disappointing place to visit. The beach is wide but that’s it. The food outlets fronting the beach are also quite average and nothing to shout about. Nothing exciting about this famous beach
Very long stretch of just pure awesomeness!,"Was here dead of winter (January) when every wind that blows is bitter and debilitating (how I want it). Hardly anyone was at the beach even at noon (obviously, as it was -7C) so I had it all to myself. It was beautiful, I have no words, especially that I experienced it without its surging crowds during Summer."
Stroll around on perfect piece of beach,The most famous beach in Korea. very hip feelign to it. Walk around to Camilla island to explore around. Its just a must visit not just for the beach but also the restaurants on Heundae Beach road nearby.
Clean beach in heart of City,Lovely clean beach in the heart of the shops. Nice boardwalk and restaurants . Marine land is readily available.
"Nice place to visit, but just a beach","This was a nice place to visit and walk along their version of a boardwalk. It also made for some great pictures of the beach against the dramatic skyline. The surrounding area has a nice, relaxed, beach vibe to it that is somehow distinctly Korean. At the end of the day, it is just a beach and if you’ve been to one before, it isn’t super impressive, but it was worth a visit. "
Tourist Beach,"Nice beautiful beach and area has lots of restaurants and hotels. A good hour+ ride on the subway from Busan Station though. We came in May so it wasn’t too crowded, but it does get crowded in the summer."
Nice beach,Nice place to visit after the museum and shopping mall. You can have a njce walk and enjoy the sight.
Quick four day trip,Stayed at the Sunset hotel on haeundae beach for three nights. Very happy with hotel. Lovely room on the 14th floor. Nice beach views from my room. Took the breakfast option which was buffet on the third floor. 2 mins walk from the beach and five minutes walk to the subway. Did the long beach walk. Plenty of restaurants cafes and shops on the doorstep both western and Asian. Great accommodation and would certainly choose this hotel again.
Big beach,Very nice in May but becomes very crowded in July and August. A very convenient beach to old town Busan.
Beautiful place,We arrived around 4pm and waited until sunset. It was fun and beautiful. Then we took a little walk to have some dinner and headed to gwangalli beach. It was dark already yet we still enjoyed it. There were vendors around and one lady approached us and offered some sparklers. It was fun!
Quite attractive but no Waikiki,Walked here from the APAC building and it is attractive with its sweeping curve. And the high rise buildings offer good contrast but this does not compare with Waikiki Beach
nice beach,nice beach with some eateries across the road and a local street food setup on the beach. some street shows across the each as well
Ok beach,Just a beach nothing special. Maybe better in summer when can swim and do beach activities. Now is a bit too cold in Spring
Nothing much here,Its a nice broad sandy beach. But there was nothing much to do here on a weekday afternoon. We had coffee at Westin Chosun cafe that has a great view of the beach and had a walk around the park. There was a walking trail that seems interesting though. 
Relax ,Spend for hour or more .... sit and listen a song. it has some street food near the beach..and also aquarium
Fantastic and charming coastline,"Haeundae Beach has Fantastic and charming coastline. There are many places to eat around such as giblets, tteokbokki, bulgogi and so on. If you go to Haeundae during the summer season, you should be careful of expensive accommodation fees and prices."
Beautiful beach,"It was cold when I was there,but still a beautiful beach.Really wide stretch of sand,was not crowded at all because of the weather,but I had a great walk,very peaceful,and so clean."
Beautiful evening walk along the beach,The beach is beautiful in the morning and evening. It was nice to stroll along the beach to Dongbaeksom island during spring.
"Vibrant feel, lovely views","The beach itself is very nice with a wide stretch of clean sand, but the sea view is just the sea with a few ships. Gwangalli beach has much better sea views with some offshore islands and a spectacular bridge, and the street has a.much more vibrant feel ( note also the blowers to get the sand off your clothes and footwear)."
Beautiful beach,"April was not busy on this beach, but our family had a great time relaxing and playing catch. The water is beautiful and the city adds to the beauty of the environment because of the planning of the buildings and their architecture. It's clear that designers planned for the buildings to reflect the beauty instead of detracting from it. The water is far too cold for swimming this time of year."
Haeundae Beach ,Nice place to go around. Since it’s spring no one is swimming since the water is too cold great place for a walk. It may get too windy so I suggest to bring a coat 
Bring Sunglasses!,The contrast of the beach and the sun is very strong! I found it difficult to keep my eyes open. Sand is very clear and clean and if you go early there's not a lot of people and you can walk to the market after
Clean beach,Iw was a great visit to this beach. Unfortunately it was not a good weather to swim as it was to the end of winter and it was a bit windy. The afternoons were awesome for taking walks and playing with kids on the sand while the mornings were great for morning jog or walk and watch the sunrise. I would love to visit this beach is summer to enjoy its full hype.
Haeundae Beach,Beautiful beach with fantastic coastal walking path. Stunning scenery but quite chilly in early April when we were there.
Beach life,"Not sure to say here but I'll try!The beach walk is nice, the beach is clean.If you do enjoy tanning and beach life this is your place!At night clubs and drinking game is HUGE! The show must go on.(Don't have any pictures at night because I was already too drunk)"
Beautiful beach- lots of street and beach activities to do! Good for families and couples.,"About a 40 minute train ride from Busan is the beautiful “Haeundae Beach“. This destination might be of interest if you’re into beaches, hipster restaurants/bars/clubs, or traditional Korean markets (all within walking distances). A traveler could easily spend at least half the day at Haeundae Beach. Along the beach are multiple heart signs or big letters of “Haeundae” where you could take pictures. If you have a family, there’s the “Sealife Aquarium“ that’s appropriate for children which cost ~$25 USD per person. For food/shopping, walk across the street from the beach and there’s a tons of restaurants and street market food."
you can go to there anytime..,you can go to there anytime...its really nice sometimes amazaing area... after the drink even you can enjoy so much :)
Extend your stay here,"Beautiful, safe, spotlessly clean beach and clear water (life guards on patrol), adjacent to pedestrian thoroughfare with markets and cafes- fun to stroll in the evening when families are out and local musicians and kpop groups are performing. "
Beautiful beach just steps away from the hustle and bustle of Busan,"We stayed on Haeuundae Beach at Shilla Stay hotel for 4 nights and wish we had one more day. Since we were here in March, there was no one going in the water but the boardwalk was nice to walk along and the white sand beach is wide however I imagine it is jam packed in the summer. Staying at Haeundae beach was perfect for us to slowly imerse ourselves into being in Korea but its pretty far from the Gimhae airport and some of the main tourist sights around Busan, but all are totally accessible by the extensive subway system. "
Magic,Beautiful beaches! Sometimes a person does not know whether to observe the wonderful water and enjoy the sand or maybe the surrounding skyscrapers! the area is beautiful! and the possibility of drinking beer (officially I do not know if you can) watching the light and water gives you really interesting memories! But it is Busan- a great city with a view of the mountains and beautiful beaches! Magic!
Lovely place to wslk,"A great beach, with a lovely path around the point to see the lighthouse. I was there for lunar new year - superb bonfire! "
Sunny Beach in Cold Weather,"To be honest, the beach in my country ""Indonesia"" is more more more beautiful than Heaundae Beach. But, if you already coming to Busan, you take your time to walk on the beach. The beach is already in the city centre and after walk in the beach, you can just directly to go to Haeundae market to taste the local food. Food street in Haeundae market is the best."
Sunny beach and attractive sunset scene,A very sunny beach in the day time and the sunset scene is very attractive. a happening place to go.
Nice beach!,"Unfortunately at the time we were there, the beach was not warm enough for us to go in the waters, but we definitely enjoyed walking along the beach, taking pictures and hanging out. I would definitely want to check it out again when the weather is nicer. The nice thing about this beach is that it's located in front of the main strip that has restaurants and stores for you to enjoy."
GARBAGE BEACH,"To be honest, who like to swim in a sea of cigarette butts? When the crowds leave and the umbrellas are taken down, all you can see if garbage all over the beach. I wish the locals didn't do that, but that's part of their culture."
Haeundae beach,It is beautiful even in winter. It is definitely a must see for Busan. You can enjoy the restaurants and pubs close to this location.
A must visit in Busan! ,"Haeundae Beach is a beautiful part of the city with lots of great shops, cafes and street food as well as a beautiful beach. "
Beautiful Beach in Busan,"We actually stayed in an Airbnb on Haeundae Beach, which was an excellent decision. My husband had business meetings and the location was perfect for myself and our two teenage girls to be able to explore while he worked. We were within walking distance to Sealife Aquarium and I think Dongbaekseom Island, which had foot paths to walk and restaurants to choose from. "
A nice beach for a stroll,We visited Haeundae Beach during some nice weather in December. Nice beach for strolling with a great view out over the bay. The second story of Starbucks provides a nice panorama of the area. They also had a nice light display on the street. Nice chill place to hang out or look at all the strange seafood in the fish market.
"Hot, hotter, hottest","Come here on summer back in 2012. It was a business trip bu I escape to this beach on afternoon and found so many tourist, mostly Korean and Japanese were sunbathing, and so on. The white sand, sun, food, are so good."
Nice Beach but overcrowded in summer,"A nice beach in Haeundae with quite a few bars and restaurants. Can be a bit overcrowded during the summer months, so I prefer Gwangalli beach. The sand sculptures during the summer are amazing."
Jewel of Busan,"One of the most popular beaches in Korea, you visit to Busan is not complete if it is not a part of your itinerary. This is the most happening place in Busan as various cultural festivals are held here around the year. This 1.5 km long beach is at walkable distance from BIFF Square and is surrounded by skyscrapers housing various restaurants various luxury hotels. The neighborhood is the most sought after place for the expats and why not as this beach offers everything one would like to do, from swimming to enjoy a cultural program to having an option to eat at their favorite eating joints."
Visit to beach during winter,"This is one of the famous beach to visit in Busan and despite it was winter, there were many people visiting the beach, taking picture of the beach. Can’t imagine if it is during summer, it will be very crowded"
Beautiful beach ,"One of the best beaches in korea. Spend lots of tome on the beac with very soft sand, very clean and less crowded. Sometime you would find the street performers there to sing you a song.. if you can wake up early morning and you will be able to see beautiful sunrise.. we stayed on the beach front hotel and very convenient to get to beach ! "
A walk by the sand,"Right after visiting Yunggongsa Temple we decided to drop by this talked about wide sand beach and stoned boardwalk. Heard that during summer this beach is packed with swimmers and tunning bathers all day but it’s winter when got here so it’s much quieter and romantic at night. The view from afar is a nice background for photo maniac with its hilltop houses. If you’re not an avid swimmer and just looking for a romantic walk, better come here just before dark to have a memorable photo shoot. To get there from Jagalchi, you can take the subway and change train in Seomyeon via green line to Haeundae station exit 5. Walk along that street until you reach the end and you won’t miss the place. There are plenty of restaurants and shops along the way too. "
Rocky? ,"We went to the dongbaek island park side of the beach, so, didn’t see the sandy part of the beach, just the fenced off rocky side. "
Stunning beach!,This beach is beautiful! Both the blue/green water and the surroundings look amazing. But beware of homeless people that keep following you.
Nice place ,One of the best place in Busan for meet with the friends. Many cafes restaurants and bars nearby. Nice view. You can just grab a cup of coffee and enjoy the seaview. 
Beautiful ,haeundae beach is spectacular. Worth a good walk around it. I came during winter but Busan is typically warmer than most parts of Korea. Lovely beach with many good seafood around! 
We walked along the beach and enjoyed the activities there,"We arrived at the later part of the afternoon, and it was getting dark as this was winter that we are visiting Korea. Nonetheless, we walked along the beach and enjoyed the activities there."
Day or night,"Good to visit either daytime or at night. At daytime, you can drop by the Busan aquarium right by the beach entrance. At night, with chilly weather and all, the ambulant restos by the parking lot is a great place to chill- with soju, of course."
Chilling Places for everyone,"As a person who doesn’t really like beach, this place surely is quite amazing and good place for chilling out in the late afternoon. The weather is a little bit cold in november, but you can still enjoy the scenery and atmosphere!"
Nice views,This is a long and very beautiful beach. The corniche is very pleasant and appropriate for long walks at any time of the day.it is quite relaxing. This area offers the beauty if the beach with the access to nice restaurants and great hotels. For those interested in shopping the area has some impressive Malls. 
Nice Beach,"I visited Haeundae Beach in november, so it was no sunbathe weather. But is was nice walk. Nice views."
Busan must visit,"One of Busan must go place. Worth to go , many to see, to eat, to explore. Sunrise, sunset. Pretty beach "
Sunset views,"We visited Haeundae beach at sunset to enjoy the views. It's really beautiful watching the sun go down, and then the lights come on in the highrise buildings."
High Rise Buildings,I walked along the promenade mid-morning on a beautiful day. The weather was perfect and it was a pleasure to take in the sun and the clean air. make sure you walk down to the shoreline and look back at the stunning high-rise buildings you will get some great photos. If you walk to the end of the beach walk past the Westin Hotel and proceed up the steps and follow the walkway. You will get even better photos and it will lead you to the APEC building which is well worth a look. You can then loop back to the beach. I walked from Haeundae Station down the main pedestrian thoroughfare which has several laneways running off it which sell a variety of local foods. The walk takes around 10 minutes. 
the small rockery patch with beautiful statue,"this beach is normal to me but the buildings around are quite spectacular and I love the detail of a man on a telescope of a ship coming ashore, my best take is the beautiful black rockery beach next to the chosum building, it's a great place to take believable mermaid pictures."
Beautiful,"A great spot for walking! The view is great, and there's a lovely walk along the beach and around the point. Good restaurants in the area too - a tad pricy, but it is THE touristy spot in Busan"
Clean Ocean Views,"I stayed near Haeundae Beach, so had several opportunities to visit the beach. I was here in October, to me it was to cold to swim, but people were in the water. I spent my time walking from one end to the other or just sitting on the nice benches there at night. The beach was clean, I always saw crew there picking up, which is lovely to see! The beach is just gorgeous with the sandy beaches looking at the ocean. There is a nice paved trail along the beach area, and a ton of great shops and restaurants across the street. You can come here to Haeundae Beach for almost any activity. Personally, I liked just coming here to relax and reflect on my vacation."
Gorgeous Wide beach..,"One of our stopover of BUTI tour. The beach is wide with a lovely ocean view and its clean . There were crowds but its probably not that much since its October, we sat a little bit and took some pictures. There are cafe’ and restaurants at the other side of the road. "
Nice sandy beach,"A nice stopover using BUTI tour. Beach is not crowded as it is already October. The sand is nice & clean. If you are hungry, just cross over the road for plenty of cafe & restaurants there. But the seafood is so expensive! I would have thought it to be cheaper...."
nice beach w/ beautiful ocean view,"very long stretch of nice beach w/ beautiful ocean view, great sunrises & sunsetspromenade alongsideocean however is somewhat polluted"
Lively Beach ,I loved the beach. refreshing & lively. Visited on my first night in Busan. But I didnt manage to visit during the day. Will come back again! 
Beautiful ,Manmade beach with a promenade at the back. Lots of statues and toilets. The beach is wonderful and not busy in October. It's a short walk to Dongbaek island. We'll worth a visit and walk around.
Good beach but crowded,"It was a good beach but it is always crowded. When I went, school children were performing at the beach. Over all a good beach to stroll or sit, relax and enjoy the breeze."
"Nice beach, better city, Busan, South Korea","I was very fortunate to visit Busan, Haeundae district, the last week of October, 2018.We rented an appartment through Air B&B close to the beach. I enjoy jogging in the mornings, and the views at sunrise were beautiful, so peaceful to run along the beach and into the city. Later, I discovered walking/jogging paths that run across town, where you see many elder people exercising, and an occasional group of cyclist going to the mountains nearby. Strolling around town, I saw more Starbucks cafes than in western cities; also other brands of coffee houses, that made me discover than Koreans have learned to taste coffee. We also enjoyed narrow streets full of small restaurants of typical food, based primarily on fish. My wife enjoyed the handicrafts, fine embroidery and very fancy Korean clothes. At only 20 minutes by car, we visited Shinsegae shopping mall, which was awarded with the Guinness record to the largest mall in 2013 I believe. Many luxurious brands, the finest food court I can remember on one floor; even a Kidzania attraction with such imagination that we really enjoyed visiting. A wonderful place I would visit again in the future. "
Outstanding crystal clear water,"The Haeundae Beach is a short walk from the Ramada Encore hotel with many restaurants, local market and food stalls along the way. Change money at Sea Cloud Hotel but do NOT miss the most beautiful site in Busan, the water.Crystal clear water, clean sandy beach and a boardwalk are waiting for you at Haeundae Beach. My photo says it all."
Nice beach and nice waves,"Nice beach, and it was not busy. If you are from Europe nu example, the people from South Korea look at you as if you are a touristic attraction. But we don't mind, the people are very friendly."
The must visit beach in Busan!,"Ask any Busan visitors, they would recommend Haeundae Beach for people watching. It is just like anyother beach around the world to be seen or to see. It is filled with people during summer and fun activities going on.The walk to the beach from the metro station has been renovated for pop-up events or sale. A whole lot of restaurants catering from western, european, indian, asian cuisine are available.The beach looks fantastic during the early morning or sunrise.Also, Busan Aquarium is located near the entrance of Haeundae beach and a perfect spot for family with kids to kill time in the afternoon."
Lovely evening walk,This time of year the area is not overly crowded. In the morning numerous folks are exercising at this beach and in the evening one can have a lovely stroll along the path above the beach.There is access to a public bathroom.
Nice beach!,"Spent a day here, weather wasn't ideal to relax on the beach. Rain aside, found Haeundae beach to be a nice place. A good place to go for a walk! Didn't find it crowded."
Beautiful and long coast,I booked a hotel intentionally near this place and it was worth it! 5 mins away by walking and I am rewarded with a beautiful beach (i had the perfect weather during my visit btw)! They say you can rent bikes around the area but I did not see any. It would have been nice to ride one along the long coast. Our hostel is near Dongbaek Park so I would recommend to walk from the beach to the Park which is accessible from the Westin Chosun Hotel. There you would see the whole Haeundae beach.This is my favorite beach of Busan to be honest. 
Good visit ,Big and nice but busy and morning visits contain a large amount of trash with few people cleaning it. Trash cans are not enough I guess.
Nice evening stroll ,"We where in the city for a business visit, decided to take a walk along the beach & visit the Holly's coffee. Really nice & plenty of places to eat & drink. Would really recommend this to anyone, beautiful sky line to view also."
Busan trip with my Son,"We stayed at Shilla hotel at Her under beach, since both the beach and hotel have excellent reputations. Beach is large and clean. We were there in the off season, so not crowded. I've heard it can be very crowded during the summer. "
Beautiful clean beach with stunning city backdrop,"I wasn't expecting to treat any beach in Korea as a sightseeing spot. However this beach is different. Plenty of people around which gives it a vibrant feel, but on an Autumn afternoon it was not crowded. Our kids enjoyed walking on the sand and watching some locals fish for crabs.There are beachside stalls selling street food snacks but there is also a nearby restaurant/ cafe street - Gudeok ro - which has every kind of cuisine you could think of and a great spot for people watching."
New year countdown,Great place to stay..Walking distance to the beach and the night market..Can go crazy with the fishcake n hotteok
clean and safe,"Our hotel room was right on the beach front we spent every evening having a sundowner on our balcony. Beach very clean and had life gaurds. We were there begining of Sept and beach was pretty empty. I have seen pictures of it in July and it was rammed. Its a nice walk from one end to the other. The left hand side has small fish restaurants and a small fish market, at the other end there is the Westin hotel, good for a drink and take in the views"
Disappointing,We arrived at the beach for sunrise and were disappointed with the amount of litter scattered around the beach which is very surprising as Korea is such a clean place.
Chuseok Holiday in Busan,"Haeundae Beach in One of the most visited beach in the city. More people during summer. Nice view for picture taking and family bonding. We were there at chuseok holidays, last week of Sept 2018 and just few tourist are visiting the beach. I didnt enjoyed the swimming because the beach guard were keep on asking us to stay away from the deep part even though its just below waist. I dont know why, so most tourist were just enjoying the view and took photo instead of swimming.. There are no shower area where the guest can take a bath after swimming, instead they only have a 2 shower booth where you have to pay 1,000 won for only 80 seconds. Expensive. What if theres a lot of guest?? "
Clean with activities ,A place that define the modern south korea ...swim in the summer and tan and walk in it in cold times 
Love this Beach!,"With couple of beer and some food, chicken and you have a beautiful night on beach with your friend. "
"Clean, organized beach","A very long stretch of beach, which is very clean and you can see the lifeguards and all the facilities available. However don't expect your blue water and white sand :) great for cooling off, thought it has some waves so some sections may not be ideal for small children.You are able to rent parasols and inflatables at this beach, and there are many restaurants on the roads.Weird thing is at 6pm all lifeguards were asking people to leave the water?I wonder if once they get off that people are not allowed to swim?"
Lovely stroll along the beach,SO nice for an early evening walk I went in November but it was still so so warm in busan I only needed a light jacket nothing much but at night the Westin chosen all lights up and it's so pretty would highly reccommen staying in haeundae if you're going to busan
Cultural Field Trip,"Very nice with a broad stretch of sand and lovely view of the bridge (name unknown). Stroll along the wide, broad sidewalks. "
Very Busy Late July,"When we arrived at Haeundae Beach, Busan, at the end of July 2018 the beach was completely crowded. It's a great shame there are so many tower blocks on the seafront blocking the sunrise. I would like to go back here when the resort is more quiet."
No crowds this time of year,"Actually, no crowds today because it's raining, but during the summer months... according to our son who lives here .... it's a ""zoo"". But looks like it would be totally worth it to face the crowds. Gorgeous wide beach. "
What an amazing place ,Glad I made a visit to this place. The day was amazing although the heat and the humidity but is all worth it the efforts 
Great!!,You always hear how popular and busy this beach gets. Go off season and it's almost empty and you can enjoy the whole beach to yourself! A few too many pigeons and a few seagulls but otherwise a really wonderful sandy beach. 
Nice White sand beach,lovely white sand beach with really clear and transparent water. Infact the water all around Busan was really clear. 
Lucky Visit!,"We visited and there were sand sculpture and live entertainments such as dance groups, solo performers with their guitars and lovely photo spots"
Lemme take you to Haeundae Beach,"My family and I spent about 2 hours in the late morning on a Saturday at the 1.5 km long Haeundae Beach, considered as one of South Korea’s famous and beautiful beaches.Getting there: take the Line 2 (Green Line) metro to Haeundae Station (203) and come out of Exit 5 (the steps show a picture of Haeundae Beach) and then walk along the road for about 10 minutes lined by restaurants and shops. As this is a public beach, there is no entrance fees.The Attraction: This wonderful beach has a wide expanse of light yellow sand and is swept by waves that are not strong (in June). Lining the beach are hotels, restaurants, shops, a casino, SEA Life Busan Aquarium and three towering tall buildings still under construction. You could also rent the beach chairs and parasol (umbrella). Haeundae Beach has great views on the right (facing east) of the Nam-gu peninsula and Oryukdo - a group of small islets East of the beach – and of course the Sea of Japan in front of Haeundae Beach. I like the following things that you may want to check out: (1) A row of white heart-shaped structures that make a great photograph opportunity(2) Small sand dunes and the maroon word “HAEUNDAE” in front of the sand dunes for photograph opportunity (3) Sand sculptures from the concluded 2018 Haeundae Sand Festival.While you are in Busan, don’t miss this very clean beach (despite huge number of visitors daily); go there preferably on a weekday but do bring along sunscreen or a hat on a stroll on a sunny day and check the weather before you go."
Try pizza and beer at night ,I dont like it when haeundae is too busy and crowded. So I usually head here after 12am. Try to have some pizza and beer with friends on the sand. You can enjoy the groove and breeze of summer night. It feels always wonderful to walk barefoot here.
Just another beach,"It is easily accessible to the beach by subway and is very close to the city. The beach itself is quite common one, and as I am there during summer, it is packed! However, the beach is surrounded with alot of restaurants, bars, massage parlour and casino. No lack of fun around the beach."
Great beach area,"We stayed at Haeundae beach and it was amazing! Nice people, near good restaurant options and a beautiful view!"
Nice beach,"Haeundae beach is a nice location where you can enjoy the beach while being still very close to the city. The beach itself is quite common one, nothing special but still very enjoyable even though it can be quite crowded both during the day and night. The surrounding is interesting with lot of restaurants, bars, massages, street entertainment and casino"
South Korea Busan,"If you visit South Korea, Busan should be one of the cities that you should see and Haeundae Beach is the most famous place you should visit in Busan. Paradise Hotel is a nice alternative to stay in Haeundae Beach, especially the NYX restaurant "
Super,July 2018 was very hot so the beach was not too busy. Great for morning or early evening swim. Night time had beach music and entertainment mostly free.
Not as fun anymore!,"It used to be a blast visiting this beach..especially during peak season during the summer months. However, that great atmosphere of party time on the beach has all but dissappeared...I actually now prefer visiting this place during the colder months, for a walk along the beach. "
Lovely sandy beach with life guards ,"We spent a couple days on the beach and paid for the beds / parasol option (around 24,000 won 2x adults). The bay has a nice sea (warm and clear in August) - plenty of places to eat within 10-15min walk. Gets a little crowded but adds to the atmosphere. Great facilities around the beach, showers (1000 won) available or you can walk to a nearby hotel and power air jet the sand away. Oh yes - you van actually order chicken wings + beer without leaving me the beach!"
"Don't miss the beach, it's worth a visit","I enjoyed going to this beach. It’s the best way to relax after a long day of walking around. It appeared to be a very clean beach. It can get quite crowded though. If you get hungry, theirs lots of restaurants and bars nearby. If you like taking pictures, then visit the beach during the day as well as night."
Beach Time is worth the Train Ride,"Pros:Clean beach with lots of people, places to put your stuff and as far as I can tell you are allowed to drink. Cons:Tons of people are there depending on when you go and you cannot swim more than 50 ft from the beach. Lots of fun, being a raft!"
"Beautiful beach day or night, must visit","The beach is absolutely beautiful no matter what time of the day it is. I'm surprised the sand is so smooth and the beach is very clean, don't see any trash. At night, you can see many performers whether they are singing or doing magic, they are pretty good and have large audience. Some people light up firework at the beach too."
Summer best spot ,"After long day hiking or trekking or shopping, best way to chill and cold down at the beach. While chilling best to eat with Korean fried chicken. Best combo. Beware of operating hour of the beach as after 6pm, the life guard will chase everyone out of the water. Anyone trying to swim after closing time will be whistle by the security. No swimming after 6pm. Night swimming is allow but near to the tourist information center, limited area of swimable. "
Crowded Fun,"Pros: The Beach was easily accessible and clean. The water was warm in July but there were lots of people there. Cons: You were not permitted to swim further than about fifty feet from the sand, and there were many hecklers on the beach trying to peddle products and souvenirs. Nowhere to buy food or alcohol readily on the beach. They should open a beach bar."
"Night view, Street Performances","Visited the famous Haeundae Beach at night. Some people are chilling and sitting on the beach. There are also artists selling paintings and offer face sketch. Also, there was a street performance with people gather around the singer. Actually we pass this beach as we want to go to Bay 101 which is also famous for its night view."
Couple hours to relax,"Went to Haeundae Beach as the last stop of our Busan visit. The weather was quite chill so didnt swim or tan. There are quite a few sitting areas: enjoy the air, people watch and occasional pigeons. Had lunch in the area, and then went back for half an hour more to enjoy some overpriced watermelon juice hahaThe beach itself is wide and super clean."
Lively and relaxing,"Haeundae Beach is one of the big beaches in Busan, surrounded by a lot of hotels and high rises. I visited the beach at night and was surprised to find that it is quite lively. There are buskers putting out performances, tourists and just people relaxing on the beach.We exited from the Haeundae Metro station and walked down the Gunam Cultural Street to reach the beach.Loved the experience here because the beach is lively but yet relaxing at the same time. You get to hear music and just enjoy the atmosphere and scenery. There are also numerous eating places along the Cultural Street if you're hungry or need a drink. The beach is also quite huge so there are spaces for everyone. Compared to Gwangoli beach, the journey to Haeundae feels more fun. But each has their own strength."
Beautiful beach,"It is beautiful. Passed by at noon. In summer! With high radiation level, not a wise time. It’s searing hot. But it’s beautiful. Can’t comment on the swimming though as said, it was noon..."
Surprisingly beautiful and clean,Actually I was surprised how clean and nice this beach in the middle of Busan is. Highly recommended for an evening run or some lovely hours on the beach!
Leisurely stroll! Night view is good.,A nice beach lied with seafood restaurants at one end and eateries but pricey. I particularly like the night light scene.
Beautiful Beach With Amazing Scenery,"The curving beach is very clean and wide. Its so beautiful. The view of the city is very beautiful from here, we can see many futuristic tower under construction. There are green landscape beside the beach. In winter, not many people on the beach. We stay here about one and half hours."
Beach surrounded by high rises,"This is one of the most popular areas in Busan, where all the top hotels are located. The beach is very clean and surrounded by high rise buildings. It gets a bit crowded in the weekends. You can rent the beach umbrellas and lounge chairs. Sea Life aquarium is also located on the beach."
Ranked one of Korea best beaches ,"A well managed man made beach, the shipped in sand is very nice quality. I prefer wild natural beaches but this riviera is really well done. The beach front is dotted with high rises and there are big unexplainable statues in the water. However after visiting this beach many times I always appreciate its charm and easy access.There are lots of easy going bar restaurants right in the beach. "
Great beach ,"We were traveling with 8 in our family and arrived around 10:30 am on a Tuesday morning. The rental umbrellas are separate from the lounge chairs, each costing $8,000 won. By the afternoon, the beach was crowded. The water was extremely cold, but refreshing. "
Disappointed but not because of the beach itself,"Disappointed but not because of the beach itself, we came in a rainy day. The typhoon day, that was why the beach look likFe a scene from Folk Town or something. But even so it seems very chill and if it was sunny, it would be perfect."
Impressive Beach,"I was here at the end of May and it wasn’t crowded at all. There were many impressive sand sculptures on the beach. There is a wide promenade running parallel to the beach. The Sea Life Busan Aquarium is located next to the beach. In the evening, there were buskers performing on the beach. There are several hotels within walking distance of the beach."
Great overcrowded beach,This sandy beach is a nice one with life guards and beach umbrellas till 6 pm . It Is almost always crowded . Chairs for rent are around $10 a day . No food vendors . Showers for $3 a person . GREAT BEACH .
Perfect for getting some sun and some swimming!,"Me and my parents went here and we totally had fun! The water is a little chilly and a bit choppy but it's still great! I wish I brought my boogie board though! There was plenty of people sunbathing foreigners and Koreans alike! Reasonable price to rent some beach chairs with umbrellas. My mom really liked it! The beach also is good for doing some beach running or some casual walking! Showers are located right across from the Busan Sea Life aquarium and only cost 5,000 Won each person. Plenty of parking in the basement near one of the hotels! Check this place out, you won't be dissapointed!"
Still fun in a typhoon,Took some great photos as the waves came in from typhoon Prapiroon. Not a lot of people on the beach which was great.
Clean and beautiful beach,"Overall, a delightful visit as the beach is very clean and beautiful. However there was no facility for washing off the sand after playing at the beach. There's a toilet nearby but we didn't want to wash our feet in there because we didn't want to dirty it and wet the floor making it unpleasant for other users.If there is such a facility and we somehow missed it, we hope there will be more signs in English to inform the public. We saw other beach-goers resorted to wiping their feet with wet wipes before putting on their shoes and we had to do the same thing.There is shower facility however it was closed when we were there."
Visit for the food street ,"Haeundae beach is always overcast when we visit and the surroundings are not particularly scenic so it's not a must-see though there were some buskers around the last time we went so it was livelier. I like the happening food street near it with the usual streetfood like gimbap, tteokbokki, fish cakes etc and also seafood. Noticed the central reservation in the main road has been pedestrianised with some craft stalls and a fountain which is lit up at night. The area around Haeundae beach is interesting to wander round and worth a look."
Very nice!,We had a hotel by the beach and could enjoy direct access to the beach just a few meters from our Hotel. We also had a rooftop at the hotel so that we could see the beach and the surroundings at all times. What is cool with this beach in Busan is the skyscrapers and the city vibe just behind the sandy beach. 
Very livey on a Saturday afternoon.,"We visited on a Saturday in mid-May. Although there were many people on the beach, very few were swimming. Most of the spectators were admiring the temporary sand sculpture exhibit, walking along the promenade and enjoying the restaurants and bars.A green plastic walkway was constructed so that admirers of the sand sculptures could enjoy the exhibits without getting sand in their shoes. There was no free wifi in this area.The atmosphere was very lively. A radio station was blasting k-pop music which most of the young people seemed to enjoy."
Great beach,The beach is awesome! Buildings around are fascinating and makes swimming fun! At night also very nice!
Iconic Beach,"As a tour guide had told me, if you come to Busan and want to take a picture, Haeundae Beach is the picture which represent Busan.Indeed, if pictures could tell a thousand words, you will indeed sense the beauty of the ocean and fine sand beaches.I think this is a good place to hang out for a relaxing day, to enjoy the waters and bask in the hot summer sun.Many restaurants and bars line the front of the beach and you will have a hard time choosing which one to go to as all seem so tempting.Comparing this beach to the Gwangwalli Beach, i would say this is more beautiful and longer, but a litter further away from Busan downtown.Getting to this location can be easily accessible by subway or the Bus. Just download the Naver Map App which i used and found it to be a real Gem. With this app, you will be able to choose either to take a Bus, Taxi or Subway with estimated time and cost advise. A very good App to have if you want to travel around "
Nice beach ...,"... if you do not know really great ones. Too full on weekends, too many regulations and restrictions by authorities."
From dawn till dusk,"I came to Busan from Seoul, only to go to shore, just to feel the sand under my knees! Yeah, i did it!The beach is great, it has a great view! Lot a loooooooot of places to stop... you can even stay at the beach! But, for me greatest minus is, that there are lot of drunk people around. I did not see any accident or something extremely dangerous things around me, but there are also a lot of fireworks! And when the drunk people with fireworks starts firings, that is lil scary. I sought that i will see the sunrise, but i chose wrong position may be?! Nevertheless i found new friend... and please welcome... "
Lovely clean beach,"Long fine sandy beach with lots of space for families to enjoy the sand, view and sea. We saw a number of amazing sand castle along the beach...as it was the sand castle building festival. My two kids enjoyed themselves chasing the waves and playing with the sand. "
Wonderful beach,"It's the most crowded beach in Busan but that's where you could enjoy the sun, cheers, and laughter with everyone else."
Busan's best beach,"Stayed just next to this beach and it was the highlight of our stay. Big, wide, and soft sand for a good kilometre just in the middle of the city. We had wished for a bit more bars and restaurants along the beach. Lots of life, though. Popular hangout for both locals and tourists. "
“Clean & Tidy Beach”,Haeundae beach in Busan is a funtastic beach and very clean. You can enjoy walking on the corniche and along the coastal line. Very good place for kids and capoules as well. One of the attraction you must visit in Busan and enjoy swimming.
A must to see,"Whether you like on a beach, this one is still special, long beach with lot of high rise building, beautiful sand, nice water but all the hotels are quite expensive around the area.Seafood restaurant available, and few others Koreans and westerns options, not many bars or activities (still some tho) but more like a touristic place but I did enjoy there.I spent two nights and you can just walk out of your hotel and go swimming, get a quick lunch and do it over.For people that wants even more quiet and cheaper, Songjeong Beach is the one to hit."
Beautiful night beachfront,We were there during the International Dance Festival and Sand Castle Building Festival. With the lighted skyscrapers and buildings along the beachfront there was an air of festivities. The basking culture was very active and alive with different genre of performers.
Attractions around the beach,"There are many hotels lined along the beach front, with four to five stars hotels. There is just about the same number of activites for the beach goers as well as the non beach lovers. If you happen to be there at the right time, you can get to see interesting beach structures on the beach. There is a markel just about 50m away from the beach front. The place has no lack of restaurants and cafes as well as busking activity to keep one occupied."
Nothing special ,I would say beach itself is not that amazing and developed. And not big as well. Meanwhile the area around is nice for walking and dining.
Nothing much to do,"Beach was quite boring but some of the sandcastle exhibition from the competition that took place a few weeks ago were still there and were nice to look at. The food stalls by the beach were decent and found commonly everywhere. The beach is good for relaxation, just sitting by the beach and watch the sea, birds and people. The beach was not very crowded when I went and was quite clean and debris free. "
Nothing to see unless you love the beaches ,"Nothing like the pictures, some construction was ongoing and the beach was quite deserted. Was there at 1 on a cool sunny day. Great milmyon near the metro, market was nothing different from the ones at Nampo. Quite a distance to travel if you are staying on the other side of town. "
Beautiful beach,"It takes nearly 1 hour to reach this beach from the centre. We went there on a heavily rainny day. But the rain stopped for a while so that we could go there to watch the sand art exhibition. The sand is not so white but there are a lot of activities there. It is so close with the main streets then a lot of people come to have a look, walk, or swim."
Very refreshing!,"Korea can be tough on the spirit as a foreigner, and getting access to a good beach, with easily digestible facilities is not easy. Haeundae Beach is just lovely, and so accessible from the beachside hotels. We stayed at the Paradise, which looks like the choice pick? We walked the length of the beach on the newly constructed promenade. It’s stunning early in the morning as the sun rises. As a result, Haeundae Beach is gloriously refreshing to the spirit. Just behind the beach is a huge selection of shops, restaurants, coffee places, etc. It takes a day to orientate yourself, but after that it’s easy."
Beautiful beach,"I am not a beach lover but what I like about here is the mounds of sand (not sure if it’s because of the sand festival) that they have heaped in this area, which they carve into interesting sculptural shapes where children can climb all over. There are also several other sculptures serving as additional photo points, including some busking area; not forgetting the big washing up area. When you have enough of the beach, just cross the road into the lively town with cafe, restaurants, and shopping areas. There are also a lot of hotels near by. In short, a great place to stay if you are in busan. "
"Very busy beach, lot of things going on","Easy access from the Metro station, toilets around, lots of street artists/performers; worth to walk along the beach by the sunset moment, enjoy the vibe around."
The most famous beach in Korea,"Great beach. This is very touristic. But, you can relax too because it's big.During summer, there are lots of visitors and festivals.Haundae has been developed for the past couple of decades. If you escape the beach, you can have many shops, restaurants and skyscrapers.Gwanganli Beach and Songjeong Beach are also famous and close."
Small beach,"Wanted to come here for the sunset but did’t catch it since it was the other direction. Easy to get here through haeundae beach station. Cooling and breezy. Lots of gukbap here if you like rice in beef or pork broth. It was sand festival when I came so saw lots of sand sculptures. Other than that, there was nothing much. "
Little rough,"The beach itself is very good, nice sand and beach. Being the most famous beach in the city it is busy and a wide range of visitors. Worth a visit but not a place for sea vacation "
worth the visit,"worth the visit although the light show is a little underwhelming. WE had a good position and appreciated the show, we also spent some time on the beach and felt the sense of relaxation"
Crowded,The beach is nice but simply over crowded but worth a visit if you are in Busan. There are many restaurants & hotels just opposite the beach
An Excellent Evening Trip!,"In between business meetings and hectic trip, a trip to the Haeundae beach was a refreshing break! It's a new breach-side city with lots of high-rise, shopping malls, restaurants and other activities. And the beach just adds to the overall attraction of the place!"
Sandcastle Beach,"Arrived in Busan to catch the end of the Sandcastle building festival they have in the 2nd half part of May. The sandcastles where amazing and there must be about 20-30 of them on the West side of this very big beach. The festival had music, art and street performers which added to the party atmosphere. The beach itself caters for all leisure activities including beach football (A game of headers and volleys), beach volleyball, waterproofs and more. The beach is also perfectly situated within walking distance of Haeundae's main shopping and restaurant streets. Perfect spot for sunbathing or swimming and can't wait for my next visit preferably in time for the sandcastle festival of Busan International Film Festival (BIFF)."
Really good beach but swimming might not be allowed,"Haeundae beach is worth visiting, usually there are some attractions or preformers. Small port nearby - you can get fresh see food in the morning. In May swimming was not allowed."
Beach and Seagulls,Haeundae is the most famous beach in Korea. It is worth going even if you are not there in summer. It was nice to take a stroll on the sand. It was also a great deal of fun to feed the seagulls. You could get a bag of prawn crackers from a convenience store nearby for them. It was impressive to see the seagulls up close when they came for the prawn crackers.
Long stretch of beach,Walked a short stretch of the beach. Saw piles of sand hill possibly for sand castles. Nothing much to see. 
Fun place but packed on weekends ,"Nice place to visit. Also seafood restaurants and street performers near by. Very touristy and crowded but certainly worth a visit, particularly near sunset time. We were fortunate enough to catch the Haeundae Sand Festival and it was certainly an extra bonus ( also extra crowded!)"
Figata,"Haeundae is magic above all in low season.the place to be, full of things to see and the largest beach in Busan"
A beautiful beach in the city center,A wonderful place in the heart of the city. You can walk along the beach where street artists bring life to the surroundings... lots of restaurants nearby. A must do in Pusan.
Running review: Haeundae Beach,"Oddly this quite ordinary beach is a real mecca for Koreans. They even made a slightly bonkers movie about it. It's an okay so-so run along the path along the beach, but if you turn right (if you're looking towards the sea) and head towards the park up on the small rise, it's much nicer. Shady, great views, a gently rising and falling 750m loop. "
"Haeunde Beach, a must visit",Haeunde Beach is a nice place to be anytime any day. You are gonna love the environment. Not far from the subway. You have got a lot of good hotels like Novotel and you've got places very close to the beach you can hang out. Place like Thursday Night party is a place to be. You are gonna have big fun in Haeunde. A lot of people speak English in the environment. Communication is not a problem. Good restuarants.
Nice photo ops,"Not much to say. It's a beach, brown sand, and water. Nice sculptures, and romantic type photo ops. I recommend going right before dark to get daytime pictures and nighttime shots."
A 10-15min walk away from subway station,"Dubbed the place we have to visit while in Busan. A long stretch of shops pathed the way to the beach, however, there was not much to see. Just a sandy beach overseeing the vast ocean. A good place to chill and catch the sunset as the place is not too crowded. "
Perfect for Sight seeing,"Since it was still spring when I arrived here, the weather is a bit cold but it wouldn't stop me from going there to see the beach for myself. Lots of restaurants nearby to soothe your hunger. I think this spot is perfect for summer."
A vacation spot beyond Busan,"You may consider it a different destination, a holiday town at the edge of Busan. A lot of hotels, cafes, restaurants, aquarium, spas, festivals, promenade. Construction sites. Quite pleasant in the spring, when the beach is empty. I can imagine it very crowded in the summer season."
I liked this beach a lot! ,Do come to this beach if you are in Busan! Loved it as the scenery is beautiful and it is easily accessible from Haeundae subway station! 
Worth Visiting,The sea is beautiful. The beach is spectacular. There aren't many visitors since it is still Spring time as the temperature is not high.
Beautiful beach,"We visited in the fall but the beach was clean and beautiful. I would want to go back in the summer months, but even in the fall it was a nice place to take a break. "
Scenic beach,"Took some great photos here with stretch of white sand ringed with incredibly tall buildings. Would have liked to spend more time here, must be a great place in summer."
Mix of modern and relax,"Big building can be seen but still nature takes a spot. Not the most foreign friednly place but if you enjoy local places, this is very nice. "
Staying in Haeundae,I love staying at this part of Busan. It is perfect for a quiet yet not so lonely holiday. Haeundae traditional market is just nearby and there are people busking along the beaches even in the cold night. There are youngsters playing with the fireworks is just so pretty. listening to your mp3 looking at the calm horizons. is nothing you could ever wish for.
Haeundae Beach,Vibrant community with great options for dining and walks on the beach or in the city. The subway is close for exploring on the weekend.
Romantic beach ,"In spite of fact that Busan is mostly Industrial town it also offers nice relaxing part Haeundae quarter with number of hotels, restaurants and nice beach. "
Beautiful stretch of white sand beach ,Strolled along the promenade from Park Hyatt to Haeundae Beach. A beautiful Saturday in the high teems. Long stretch of white sand beach with lots of activities. Mainly locals and perhaps Korean domestic travellers. Scenic and relaxing. Must visit if in Busan. 
Popular beach,Nice sand to walk on and easy access from the street. There is a very nice walk around the point(near the Westin) and great views. Lots to eat and see nearby. 
Charming ,"So beautiful beach in Busan. It is charming, clean and amazing. It is must to visit if you visit Busan. You can enjoy the beauty and exercise. Many hotels are located near it. Many restaurants and cafes are reachable. Toilets, and shower ares are available. It is by all means one of the most beautiful beaches I ever visited "
Nice and beautiful beach,It was not as crowded as I thought it will be. Nice place to take some photos and just chill by the beach. Grab some tibits and you may even feed the seagulls after as well!
Bustling tourist and resort area of International intrigue,"Haeundae beach is a long stretch of beach, boardwalk, resorts, eateries, and entertainment. There is a street food alley right off the main street from the Haeundae metro exit. It is a popular area for travellers and tourists. Koreans tend to holiday here... feels a bit like Hong Kong but Korean. Lots of fresh seafood but there are also Indian restaurants, Thai massage, and International and local cuisine to be found. There is a cinema and aquarium as well. A good place for food and entertainment."
Great place to enjoy buskers and the ocean ,Visited on a Wednesday evening and enjoyed the sunset and lights on the beach. Lovely place for photos before it gets too dark. 
Nice view ,"There's a performance act during night, some singing, magic show. Its near Busan sea life aquarium. There's a lot of dating couples here. "
Couples beach,We visited the Haeundae beach and after talking about this beach with our Korean friends we found out it is a beach specifically for couples. There are a few heart sculptures where couples can take pictures together. It was an average beach but not something to drop everything and go to.
Beautiful and breezy beach to relax,"The sand on the beach is really fine and soft. You can feel yourself sinking into the sand while walking on it. It is still very cold in the early spring and thus even the water is very inviting, I choose not to step into the water. Very breezy and nice to just walk around the beach as there are not much people around. Lots of restaurants along the beach area."
Really really nice!!!,"This is one of the 3 public beaches in busan accdg to our tour guide Steve Kim. And there are plenty of seats for you to enjoy the view or eat your food peacefully. The view is really spectacular. There’s a public toilet too. We actually went here during our free time. It’s really a nice place to just hang out and chill. And before you can reach this place, you’ll pass by haeundae market with all the streetfood and seafood! This is a must visit!"
Beautiful beach in busan,Many new hotel and delicious restaurant near the beach and beach is clean a have walking path a clean public toilet 
Good place to relaz,"Spent the afternoon here. There’s lots of benches/space to sit, as well as a walkway if you don’t want to trek in the sand. Very pleasant! "
Beautiful white sand beach ,"The beach is beautiful with soft white sand. The sand is not powdery but still quite comfortable to walk on. A couple of photo zones dot the beach and some people used it to even shoot ads when we were there. Plenty of people were seen jogging along a walkway. There was construction going on that blocked access to the walkway. Not sure how busy it gets later in the afternoon but definitely worth a visit. A aquarium is almost right on the beach, so I don't anticipate any one getting bored quickly."
Beautiful ,It’s 20 minutes photo taking place. Doesn’t hurt to visit but sunset must be impressive here (we could not see as we arrived in the evening) there are few nice Indian and Arabic restaurants along the street and there is a street market too. 
Beautiful beach at Busan,beautiful beach and very crowd if weekend. So many attraction in here. In 4-6 pm you can see the seagull flying in sky. Awesome. 
A walk on the beach,"Nice sand, but it’s a typical city beach surrounded by skyscrapers, is not really my type of place to go to seaside, however the surrounding area is full of restaurants, from street food to more luxury one, clubs, pubs, etc, so think the perfect place for whom is looking for a place to stay on the beach on daytime and have fun in the evening."
Very busy stretch of beach,This is a super busy beach area with lots of restaurants and shops. All fairly cheap and cheerful but interesting. It was extremely hot when we were here and I don't think actually sitting on the beach would have been much fun. It all seems clean and well organised and there is lots to do. Lots of hotels too and staying in this area seems like a good alternative to downtown Busan.
Best Korean beach and Best Iinternational beach,"Haeundae(海雲臺) is located eastern part of Busan facing east sea. It has 1.5 km beach and many expensive apartments. It has reastaurant named Bay 101 which can see the view like HongKong wtih many high rises. Also there are many eateries such as Korean galbi(sparerib bulgogi), Japanese restaurants, and you name it , it has all kind of foods in Haeundae. Many five star hotels. Park Hyatt, Westin Chosun, Haeundae Grand, Novotel Ambassador and Paradise Hotels are good to stay in the level of 5 star.And ther are many 4,3 2 star hotels such IBIS hotels and motels. You can reserve the hotel in your budget.  You can stay here for at least 4 to 5 days enjoying swimming, surfing, food, hotel and cafes (cafe paradise- starbucks and many different names of cafe) and art exbitions galleries in the Dalmaji hill in the north of beach. Haeundae is the best site you can enjoy your time in Korea."
Just like Hawai but not,High rises and even more being built. Lots of hotels facing the beautiful coloured sand. Apparently the sand is barged in every year. People walking around but I did not see anybody swimming and there is no surf. Very picturesque in the Honolulu style but not my kind of beach. I enjoyed the rocky path and swing bridge around the cliffs going to it more.
Never stops to amaze you!,"A beach, a place for fine dining, an aquarium, a sightseeing location, a place for night fun, a place to enjoy the open sea,... and the amazing architecture around.... Haeundae `beach, amazing place not to miss if you are at Korea"
Its ok,"This is a very nice beach, and the walk around Dongbaekseom Island was nice, you get to view where the 2005 Apec conference was. The walk wasn’t as good as Igidae walk or Songdo Beach & Cliff walks for us personally.We visited a few street food vendors in the area and you could tell they deal with tourists, prices were higher or when you queried price the pause was long enough for you to know that the price was going up. For us we enjoyed the vibe of BIFF square more and the beach at Songdo.Still a nice place to visit for the scenery and to tick off the list."
A pretty little beach,"If you are used to long beaches like those found in Australia, then this is not so impressive, but if you compare it to other beaches in the region, then this one is great."
enjoy beautifu sunset,Haeundae Beach is a nice and still quiet beach where you can take a rest and enjoy the view of the mostly quiet sea and beautiful sunset. It's a great experience at the end of a busy day.
Sunday Morning at the Beach,"A fair amount of people stroll along the beach on a winter day. Great for people watching. At one end of the beach is an access to Dongbaek Park with the Nurimaru APEC House, with a beautiful walkway along the water."
Impressive,"Stayed a week at the Western Chousan Hotel, so had the pleasure of seeing this beach at sunrise, sunset and also during the daytime on a Saturday. Was most impressed by the cleanliness and the layout. Also the entertainment in the evening the dancing and the massive bonfire were a wonderful experience."
so cleand,Haeundae beach is so cleand and rest destination so you can walk in feeling good and near APEX house and another.
beautiful,"the beach is along a major area which is Haeundae, lots of activities going on almost every corner like dance exhibitions, magic shows, mini circus, singing groups, bands, its one of the stops of BUTI Busan City Tour and also along subway Line 1, a lot of restaurants in the area. Highly recommended!"
the popula beach in Busan,"when you come at here in Summer, there is the crowded beach with people and bikini, but when you come in winter there is a romantic beach."
Nice beach ,"For once in my life I see people go to beach wearing high heels , so impressive. But overall the beach itself was nice and clean."
Lovely beach with Singers around,"A nice beach to visit while in Busan with local singers performing at night, as well as a few activities occurring from time to time. Beware of seagulls though!"
Cold during winter,"One of the recommended place to visit is Haeundae beach, seeing some property development coming up. The beach is clean, swimming is possible. Since it was during winter, we didn't see anyone in the water."
Beautiful,"Well kept, clean beach with some cultural aspects. We saw one guy busking and there was an art installation for lunar new year. Would love to go back in the summer time. "
Huge Beach with City Backdrop,"Nice clean beach, shame about the city backdrop. Good sand. Toilet facilities nearby which was quite clean."
Great view. ,A good place with wonderful beach and city view. I enjoyed the walking and sightseeing. Highly recommend. 
The city seems to be making significant improvements.,"Lovely beach with excellent views. City doing some work, which appears to be high quality and classy."
Very Clean Beach,"A clean beach surrounded by many hotels and restaurants. The restaurants can be a little pricey. In the summer there are a lot of activities like soccer and beach volleyball. During the winter months, locals go for walks along the beach. At night, there are a lot of buskers along the beach."
lovely beach,"what a lovely beach must be visit in Busan! you can see the beach surrounding with the city view, so many local seafood restaurant ( bit pricey) also fast food. the beach is sooo clean, and family friendly also maybe pet friendly ,because when I was there, some people stroling around with their pet near the beach."
Nice and interesting ,The Korean people come here even it's winter. The parents take their kids to play with birds and watch the waves. 
Totally overrated,"This beach is pretty far from the center of town and really not worth the trouble. It is not that vast, and surrounded by hotels and other big buildings, mostly uninteresting. The beach does seem to be very popular, however, given that even on a winter day there were quite a few people."
Relaxing place to walk.,"Not a surfing beach, rather a relaxing, walking and 'smell the roses' type of beach. Lots of sand, small waves, seating areas to sit and chill, small shops selling a small selection of drinks and snacks, families flying kits and walking dogs, and at night there is small fireworks and buskers. Very close to the main area of town, hotels, restaurants and all the usual tourist life of Buscan. We stayed on the beachfront and witnessed beautiful sunsets and sunrises finding it very relaxing."
Nice beach and easy to reach,"It's a nice beach and directly in the close urban area. The Street around will be renawed and the beach itself looks quite nice. There are not many open shops and so on at the cold time, but in the summer must be nice place."
Great beach ,"It’s a great place to engage with locals, particularly young Koreans. We also recommend you to stay around Haeundae Beach ( e.g. Indy Guesthouse ) and try one of the Korean bbq restaurants ( e.g Oban jang) "
"Beautiful View, Big and Super Clean","We were staying at Citadines Haeundae Hotel. Which is very close to this beach by walking distance. During the first morning that we arrived in Busan, as soon as we dropped our luggages in the hotel. We went straight to this place. Even though it was winter, the view still drown many people to come to visit. Mostly local folk. Around the shore there were many high buildings and stores which you can also enjoy! Haeundae (Busan) is beautiful and less crowded than Seoul, very recommended to everyone. "
SUPER CROWDED IN SUMMER,"I would recommend buying drinking and beers from a 7/11 or G2 Mart down the street rather than purchase from the people selling there. It will save you half the cost! You can also rent areas with shade. The bathrooms are kinda far, but there is one in the aquarium down the street. "
Beach bumming,We went there during spring and swimming is not allowed but still we were able to enjoy beach bumming. It is clean and i'm amazed how people around are disciplined to maintain its cleanliness. Hotels and other commercial establishments are reasonably away from the beach to preserve its serenity and cleanliness.
U will still enjoy it even u live in coastal city,Worth to go as weather is prefect with nice coastal line! U can have a relaxing walk there with coffee and afterwards enjoy the famous fish soup there! 
Winter trip ,The beach is so clean and well maintained so for sure we will pay another trip here later when the temperature is good for swimming:)
Entertaining Beach,"Haeundae Beach is situated conveniently around Haeundae metro station (Line 2), take the stairs up from exit 5 and you will find yourself around this beautiful place. The beach is around 400 meters from the metro station.There are many hotels around this small and compact area, ranging from the luxurious Westin, to the lower range Budget hotel. Casino, restaurants, Starbucks, Holly’s cafe, Korean BBQ, food street and etc can be found along the streets. It’s not difficult to navigate at all. Exit the station, take a stroll from either side, walk all the way to the beach and enjoy the scene. When you’re done, back track the route u just took in opposite direction and that’s it. The beach is around 1.5km from my estimation, but the sand is fine and the place is very well maintained. It was freezing but there is no lack of street baskers (young Koreans) and entertainers. You don’t see many people Swimming because of the weather but walking along the beach is recommended. Take off your shoes and walk on the beach. I’m sure you won’t regret the view! "
Nice Beach - Even in the Winter,"We were in Busan during Christmas and stayed in the Haeundae area. The beach looks nice, even when it was too cold to go into the water. Beach was clean and the water was clean. No trash. It is a really nice area to walk around."
Better in summer?,"Less activities to do in the winter, so I guess visiting in the summer is better when you can actually go swimming or sunbathing. Still not a bad place to visit in the winter. Do note it's far from everywhere else like the Busan station, Seomyeon. The Haedonggu Yongsan Temple is a 15 to 20 minute cab ride away. "
"Even in winter, amazing","Even though it's to cold for a swim in winter still a great place to vist. Soft sand, great views and lots going on in the streets surrouding "
"Chill time, fun, food, drinks and relaxation at Haeundae Beach","It was early Fall and the leaves in Busan were starting to change colors from green to yellowish-orange and the air was very crisp and the weather chilly when we landed in this beautiful and charming southern city of Busan in South Korea. I'm with my family and on our first day of activity we decided to go straight to Haeundae Beach area. From our hotel in Seomyeon we took a direct MRT to Haeundae Beach station. The ride took about 40 mins and the moment you exit there's the huge plaza with lots of restaurants, cafe's, bars and shops for your all needs in different kinds. The street at the end of the plaza is the main beach itself. The beach is free for tourists and open all year round. It is a stretch of perfect white sand for about 1.5 KM and plenty of activities around the area. During non-summer months you will see a warning not to swim. Plenty of street performers stop and play around the area every hour and it is a perfect spot if you are on a family trip, romantic date, self-relaxation, and group outing. Numerous benches and tables line up the whole stretch of the beach area. If you are feeling hungry go grab some traditional Korean food and other cuisines on the street across the beach. And there is also the famous Haeundae Market where you could see fresh produce, live seafood, and traditional Korean items. At night the beach becomes more lively with plenty of tourists (local and foreign) enjoying and having fun. This beach also has the emblem of BIFF (Busan International Film Festival) which hosts the festival yearly. We decided to eat traditional Korean BBQ at the Haeundae street and it was sumptuous and nice to experience a hot and delicious Korean cuisine at the same area. After 4 hours in the beach we had so much fun and definitely worth another visit when we go back to Korea :=)"
"Clean, expensive, people are rude","Traveled to Busan for work and went to Haeunde Beach/town couple of days. It's busy, surprisingly clean for a beach town. As we went there just few days after being in Japan (Sasebo, Nagasaki, Tokyo) where people were so courteous, extremely helpful and go out of their way to help you, and also really friendly I was kinda expecting the people in Haeundae to be at least friendly. But I found them to be downright rude, unhelpful and unfriendly. Beach was really clean, but even when the weather was really good, hardly anyone was having a dip. Everyone was covered top to bottom so it was rather weird."
A beautiful coastal park on a seriously urban beach,"Haeundae Beach is ostensibly a popular Korean go-to location, but in the dead of winter it's pretty quiet. I visited the coastal park that comprises a stony hill adjacent to the beach proper, which offers great views of the (very built-up) beachfront and some dramatic vistas of the water, with statuary and other kinds of typically Korean decoration. There is a boardwalk along the rugged waterline that is worth walking, and you're near a lot of eateries just off the coastal road. The beach itself is a clearly man-made enterprise, which in December is an empty swath of sand run right up against the coastal highway. Can't imagine the place as a summer go-to, but it was an interesting wintertime visit."
charming,It was a cloudy and cold day but people were enjoying themselves by playing on the beach and surfing. A lot of people were surfing.
Haeundae beach - always good in the right Season,"Living on Haeundae beach, there is always activity. At the moment side walk repairs are being undertaken. Always during winter construction work is going on preparing for the summer. The summer is always very busy with big crowds but the council provides lots of activities to attend eg, sand festival, concerts, buskers etc. Always worth a look to see what is going on and has some good quality restaurants down past the Novotel."
Great for hanging out,Even though it’s winter it’s still worth visiting. A nice walk to take in the view of the sea. Plenty of places to sit down as well.
Ok Beach,"We visited this place during fall so we did not get a chance to swim. The beach is clean and looked very good. However, there's really nothing very special about it. Still, it's a very good place to visit. There are also lots of good restaurants in this area."
Beautiful in all seasons,"A lovely arc of beach, plenty of restaurants and cafes, hotels, cine, aquarium, all a tourist could ask for or a Sunday wanderer. Lovely in all season but super crowded with umbrellas during the high summer."
Nice and big beach,"Visited in November, so beach was empty and nice for easy walk. Located near Busan Aquarium. Only missing some caffe bar were you can sit and drink coffee and enjoy in the day. Also there is small park with trees to hide from the sun."
Beautiful Beach,I love this beach ! Its is huge and clean. They were doing some upgrades to the seawall walk that will make it even more pleasurable. 
Amazing sand sculptures!,"We just checked out the beach, saw that it was being prepared for a huge celebration and gigantic sand sculptures were being built. We had Holly's coffee and it was the best one we tasted."
Nice at sunset,"I visit the beach at sunset to get some food with friends. We walked around near the local markets enjoying street food before stopping at a Korean bbq. The beach was very clean, I’m sure it would have been more enjoyable in the summer. Lots of attractions, hotels, and places to eat nearby. "
A Touch of Magic,"On a brief overnight trip to Busan, I was a little underwhelmed---too western---but then I went to Haeundae Beach. The minute I came up from the metro the streets and the sky opened up. The main street leading to the beach was lined with fun stores and street food and then I reached the water. It was just the refreshing bit of authentic Korea I was craving. I was there in November so the beach was sparsely populated so I was able to just sit and enjoy the beautiful view and people watch. There were street musicians and performers and kids running around. It was perfect."
Beautiful,Beautiful blue summer skies with energetic beach-goers making this place feel and seem like Hawaii !!! Love the energy of this beach!!
Go in October ,"I'm so glad we didn't go during busy season. We had weather in the low 80s, sunny, gorgeous.We took the seaside path- lots to see. Check out the museum from the summit meeting."
Beautiful beach,"Its one of those kind of beaches you can take long strolls with your loved ones, or just laze about for the entire day.The beach is very clean and very breezy."
Busy beach,"You can access this beach by the Busan Metro. (Just purchase a T-card for your stay in S Korea, which you can reload at convenient stores and at the Metro itself. You can also use it for buses, and we used our T cards throughout S Korea, not just in Busan.) Haeundae Beach is a beautiful long beach and is easily accessible from the city, which is great for the locals. I think I would avoid it at peak season, which is typically July-August unless you love to be shoulder-to-shoulder with others. When we visited in October, the waves were impressive so I'm not sure how easy it is to swim here."
Nice and under construction,This beach side is wonderfully busy and enjoyed by many. However it is under construction so there are exposed work sites that need to be addressed and I’m sure on completion it will be great! What they are working on looks fantastic! Can’t wait to come back to enjoy the beach front in about 10 years time.
relaxing,the beach is a nice place to relax especially after hours of walking. it is so relaxing just watching people come & go.
Nice beach,"Nice beach, gorgeous view of the bridge spanning the water. Plenty of restaurants nearby, Starbucks across the road. Tourist information and facilities in building near the boardwalk. Popular place for young singles."
Quite overrated,"I do not know why but feel that Haeundae is a little overrated? Or maybe is because the weather that day is not sunny, which makes everything dull. Anw, it is quite accessible from the train station, just a few minutes walk."
WORKS GOING ON,"This is WINTER, so obviously I did not take full advantage of the beach. But, I must say that it is a pleasant and relaxing place, that is for sure. I will also say that (most probabily) in the summer... it must be filled with people taking in the sun and beach activities.The promanade was nice to walk up and down for a few hours. I do understand the need for maintanance, and also upgrading the place. That is of course, extremely important... but took a little away from my personal experience, to have to zig-zag my way through works going on along the beach."
"The beach is always bumping, even in the off-season. Definitely go to Abnormal Taphouse and Cantina for craft beer...","Many restaurants to choose from. Stellar views and a cool vibe for travelers. Abnormal Taphouse and Cantina. The Wolfhound. Sol Taphouse, etc..."
Best beach everrrrrrrr ,"Best beach in Busan I’ve been to. Grab some takeaways and sit by the beach with your friends or alone. Best view of the beach and with different buskers busking at various spots, people hustling about there’s never a moment you are bored. "
Rest and Relax,"Nice beach, not too crowded. Sand is soft.During the night, you will see buskers there, enjoy the music with the breeze. There is a water sports center that you can visit and get information. Will visit again."
Relax ,"Still warm but got chilly as the sun went down - a beautiful dusky pink sunset with a pretty view. Went with a book, a takeaway cup of tea and a scone - chill out and take it all in after a crazy day of sight seeing"
Beautiful clean beach with surrounding city life,"Haeundae beach is a very large and beautifully clean beach with great views across the ocean and many hotels and restaurants in the area as well as plenty of public transportation and restrooms. It is surrounded by city life as well as mountains and tranquil gardens to explore. You can walk the beach itself, the concrete boardwalk or skip it and walk along the streets to the various shops and restaurants. A very nice place to stay if visiting Busan. A mere 40 minutes by city bus from Busan Station at a cost of around 1.50 USD, or you can take a cab or train."
Big wide beach ,"Stayed at a hotel here, it was autumn so not many people on the beach. Very clean and loved walking along the beach. Great view "
Many teenager and restaurant,There are many restaurant nearby. The beach is nice and clean. Sealife is located here. There are many young couples here on the contrary most of the places are full of grandpa and grandma.
Hay own day! Is the correct way to pronounce it,"We stayed in the Haeundae area in Busan and we were not dissatisfied at all! The hotel was close to the beach so we were able to walk along the shore. What was amazing was the activity that was on the beach in 50-60 degree temperatures! Lots of lovers huddled in twos, friends sat in groups, guys shot of fireworks, some for the thrill and some to impress their girl. It was the liveliest night life beach scene I have ever seen!To top off the experience there are loads of hotels surrounding the beach that made for lots of great night pictures. The BIFF was also set up on the beach with huge ARTISTRY letters in the sand. The tree and bench lined walkway also provided a quite and safe place to sit and take photos, all while watching the people on the beach and the waves as they created foam along the shore.There were also showers that needed tokens to operate."
Clean,"Beach was clean. All the areas near the Haeundae Beach was clean. I would have love to have stayed in Busan during the summer season to enjoy the beach more. But regardless, the beach was really nice."
Worth the visit,"Probably one of the more picturesque places we visited during our year stay in Korea. A bit crowded at times, but worth it. "
Very good beach,Haeundae Beach is a beatuifull beach to spend an agternoon and an evening. You will really hav a nice time. Highly recommended. 
"If you want to chill, then this is not the place you want to go","Since there was a festival around summer time, and it's also a vacation for local, so it was super crowded. If you really want to visit haeundae, be prepared for how touristy it is, or just don't visit during summer vacation, especially after 4pm."
A fun beach to hang out and take in the sun,"We went when the swimming season was over, but you could wade in up to your knees without getting into trouble (being asked by security to get out of the water if you try swimming). There were no beach chairs, but probably because the season was over.The view there is beautiful, and the beach is clean.Oddly enough, only tourists sunbathe or swim... the locals were fully clothed, and just dipped their toes in. "
A Sunday on Haeundae Beach?,"This is a pituresque spot, with the city aquarium nearby, as well as a famous Busan eating district. The beach itself is rareltcrowded, peaceful, neat and tidy and bubbling with youngsters. Stay until after dark and savour the ambience. A peaceful broad walk way with food joints and shopping outlets which leads to the beach. Make sure to have a look at the sea creaures on sale at the pop-up restaurants running along the beach promenade. A terrific view of sunset."
Great Beach,"This beach is great! Whenever I visit it, I could see many people are enjoying their time. Around the beach, you could find convenient facilities such as hotels, restaurants, and others. In front of the entrance of the beach, many temporary restaurants, pojangmacha (포장마차), are waiting visitors and tourists. There you could enjoy fresh seafood and Korean foods such as pajeon (파전), tteokbokki (떡볶이), eomuk (어묵), udong (우동) and others. "
"Pretty beach, not much to do","Very nice beach, one of the tourist hotspot in Busan. Definitely worth checking and explore the area quite a bit. Don't spend too much time on the beach, explore the rows of cafes and restaurants on the street as well!"
Great beach and sunbathing in October ,"A really pleasant beach off-season, not crowded at all.Sea temperature is cool but once in, quite the delight."
Great location to people watch ,"While you may not always be allowed to swim in the sea you can certainly people watch. Officials will close the beach to swimmers of the waves are deemed to high, but we found it was open when we went.Beautiful also at night when there is plenty of live entertainment and fireworks for sale."
Overrated beach ,"Although there's nothing wrong with this beach, there is also nothing great about it. It wasn't too crowded, though there was a digger there and lots of building going on getting ready for the Busan International Film Festival (BIFF) next week. If you're short on time I'd give it a miss."
Gorgeous beach,This beach was across the beach from my hotel. Lots of sand and beautiful water. Saw people out there doing group exercise very early in the morning.
Awesome Beach,"Not crowded, peaceful, neat and tidy and bubbling with youngsters. Some entertainments were being arranged like some shows which adds to the ambience. A peaceful broad walk way with food joints and shopping outlets which leads to the beach. A terrific view of the sunset."
Nice beach,"Very comfortable, kids running around chasing the birds, very clean, and stop by the Sealife Aquarium. Children will be happy."
great beach with lots of people,"THis is beautiful natural beach and if you like crowds, it's the place to go. It not surprising that the city continues to expand and develop around it, but that's to be expected in a big city. So enjoy the nice sand and water, walk around the APEC park and grab some yummy local Busan Mil Myung (cold noodles) nearby or street food down some of the alleys."
ITU World 2017,"Haeundae Beach is just at the back of our hotel so it would be nice to see the beach up front. We walked to it around 11am and it was already too hot to walk by the beach. I observed that Koreans go there to play, run and be with friends. Busan is such a small place wherein you can see when you drive around in 1 day. This is a nice beach for the Koreans and tourist to hang out during summer. Not bad for a beach. It is near sea life also.."
Haeundae street,"The street from Haeundae subway station to the beach was quite dirty, especially the street which Hard Rock Café is situated. You need to look down quite a lot to prevent from stepping on orange smash, spit... Nonetheless, the government has made a broad and long ""island"" between exits 3 and 5 to lead you to the beach. Last year, when I went there, it wasn't there. You can take photos safely when you walk towards the beach. Medicine, food, cosmetics ... are on both sides. Near the metro station, luxurious and budget hotels as well as motels are found in this area. "
Great experience,"Haundae is a very nice beach, I had a great time here with my friends.... I recommend that you can visit the beach as well on your trip to Busan."
Relaxing spot,"Nice place to let loose for kids. Just be careful during those windy days, hang on to your little ones."
No swimming?,We were so excited to go to Haeundae Beach for a swim. Weather was perfect. Perhaps it was quieter because it was a Monday. But there wasn't anyone actually swimming and enjoying the water. Just people fully clothed taking selfies. We thought it was weird but went for a dip anyway. No signage saying no swimming. We stayed within the marked buoys. We were in the water for 10minutes max before a man in a little Jeep drove past with a sounding alarm telling us to get out. No explanation just waving his arms in a cross. We did so promptly but he had already driven off and not bothered to explain what we did wrong?We relaxed on the shore and saw some others go for a quick dip and nothing happened to them.Was disappointing that such a beautiful beach is marketed on Trip advisor as the number one thing to do in Busan and you can even enjoy it. Still a beautiful beach and nice area. There were no umbrellas or set up anywhere for us. Again perhaps this was because it was a Monday. Worth checking out. Just don't expect to go for a good swim :(
What no swimming,"Well I was staying right on the beach so I was looking forwards to a swim in the sea....but there are signs up saying a 100,000won fines for swimming!!!! what are beaches for. Other than that a very busy beach but walking along the top is a little difficult at the moment as there are some reconstruction works that are not pedestrian friendly. Not going to knock it back as it is one of Korea's better beaches, but wouldn't rate to highly on a world beach scale."
 Busy!," If you like your beach to be busy and full, this is it. This was the sort of beach I liked back in the day. I give it a very good rating because it is still fun and I enjoyed the stroll down the strip. If you like hustle & bustle, side shows, and tourists, this is for you. Have fun! "
Relaxing beach with a lot of people,"Haeundae Beach is one of the most famous places in Busan. The beach was very clean and big, which made it a really nice place to spend an hour or two even you are just sitting there. It was filled with people when we went, luckily the beach is really huge so it doesn't feel really crowded. People were mostly sitting there to enjoy the view, a couple of people were playing near the water but none of them were swimming. I visited during May and the Haeundae Sand Festival was held at May 2017 this year so we got to see some sand sculptures. I think it's better to check online about when they are holding the event. Overall, it is just a nice and huge beach so I recommend to visit if you can during the Haeundae Sand Festival."
Australian Travellers,"A nice place to take a rest from the city area which borders the beach and is a nice backdrop. Some good hotels in the area, e.g Novotel and the beach is in walking distance from here. Good clean sand and quiet area. Possible to rent umbrellas and some small shops in close vicinity. Nice to visit. "
Safe and fun.,"You can pretty much rent all the beach going equipment at the beach. I rented an umbrella for $5000 KW, and that is the price for a whole day. It also came with a place mat under the giant umbrella. There are life guard high tower/chair maybe every 50 yards on the beach and a life guard in the water as well by the rope. There were also life guard on jet ski beyond the rope patrolling. During lunch time vendor will come by and offer you Korean lunch box and drinks. I left my belonging under my umbrella and went for swim and they were all still there after I did my 1000 yard swim."
Spacious beach and good sunshine in August,"We visit the beach during the last week of August and the beach is not crowded at all . The temperature and weather is perfect and you can have a nice sun bath or swim during this period. However, there are strong wind during 1-2 Sept and we cannot even stay along the beach with the blowing send."
Great for a morning/evening stroll,"Spent 3 nights recently in Busan and if you get a hotel close to the beach, it is ideal. Great for a morning/evening walk or a jog and lots of commercial places, eateries in the vicinity.Beach is quite busy in the summer."
Pretty view,During the day you can spend nice day sunbathing but the best time comes at night. Right from the beach you can see all the best hotels and skyscrapers. 
"Ok, a city beach, not a nice vacation beach","Thie is a city beach with facilities, a long stretch with paved walkways all along the beach. It is not anything special and not what I would describe as a nice vacation beach, but the same can be said for Haeundae in general. It'd ok, feels safe but not beautiful as such with lots of costruction right by the beach."
Beautiful beach with surrounding large skyscrapers ,Beautiful beach with cool sand. Many kids play in the cold waters during autumn. Beach has many facilities available and also many restaurants nearby. It is surrounded by towering skyscrapers. 
Good for decent walk. ,Right next to Haeundae Beach ⛱️Beautiful nature view and good for a decent walk.Enjoying the sea breeze 
Goode spot to escape the bustling inner- suburbs of Busan.,"For a beach in a city the size of Busan, Haeundae has clean and well maintained sand and relatively clear water. It is well serviced by the city's metro and has many cafes, restaurants and food stalls to satisfy that after swim hunger. It has a number of both small and large hotels and would actually be a good area to stay if being near the beach is your preference."
Walk along the seaside and Enjoy the Sunset View,"We walked the entire coast line of Haeundae Beach, stopped several place to have coffees, meals, and soaked our feet at the spring water pool as well. Nice and cosy walk, and nice sunset view as well. Gonna be there if you around the area. "
Love the Calm of the Ocean,"We visited here during our anniversary weekend. There was a lot of people on the beach but it wasn't crowded. The noise level was low for it to have so many people. So you could really kick back and enjoy the sounds on the ocean. They jet ski, paddle boards and speed boats there. Not to mention Busan SeaLife Aquarium is right on the beach. It was AMAZING!!"
The most popular beach in Busan,"We went in October 2016. We walked along the walking path beside the sea from Dongbaek Island and the Nurimaru APEC house until we passed the Westin Chosun at one end of Haeundae beach. It was in the evening when we reached Haeundae beach and the were not so many people around. This is quite a long and nice beach and we took a short stroll to enjoy the breeze. It got dark pretty soon and we could feel the mosquitoes swarming over our heads and decided to leave for the metro station to catch a train back to the city. You can come to this beach using metro line 2 and exit at Haeundae station (exit 3,5)."
Favorite Beach in South Korea!,"This is my favorite place to be at in South Korea. Not only is it the best beach but it is in the best city the Country has to offer! You can get a little bit of everything here, from the beach, to great clubs/bars, amazing restaurants, temples, sports, you name it!"
Beautiful sunrise,"Must visit this beach. Lots of people but not crowded, always things happening. It's in a very convenient location, great place to watch a sunrise"
"Very nice beach, but I am missing the beach volleyball places","It is a very nice beach, but it gets crowded in the summer. The water can get quite cold. I was missing the beach volleyball places and some more showers (or at least signs for them)."
A must visit when in Busan,A beautiful beach... this place offers a lot of activities that is suitable for people of all age. A must visit when one is in Busan. 
walking and talking,to get from hotel to some of the venues you can go along the walk way on Haeundae beach which goes all along to the far hotels.well sign posted and lots of friendly kids who practice their english by saying good morning or hello-and that's its -but much more dialogue than i have walking along London streets.
"Convenient location, clean beach",Located walking distance from our accommodation. The road towards Haeundae Beach is lined with restaurants and shops. Suggest to buy snacks at a convenience store and have a picnic by the beach. Overall nice place but you may skip if you have been to Gwangalli Beach.
"Nice beach, very convenient",The beach is very nice with plenty of vendors to get whatever you want. Plenty of great restaurants & bars within a 5 minute walk.
Beautiful seaside,Haeundae has a beautiful seaside. There are lots of good restaurants nearby. It is suggested to have dinner at Haeundae and stroll around at night. You can buy little fireworks to play by the sea. In summer there is sand-sculpture festival.
Amazingly fun place,"The waves were lots of fun to play with. My kids enjoyed exploring around the rocky area nearby Westin hotel where there were many small animals like crabs, hermit carbs, fishes, mussels, etc."
Lovely beach,"Spend a full day on the beach , amazing area full of activities and people too , beach is nice clean and great atmosphere"
beautiful beach,"Haeundae Beach is Busan’s ultimate beach. The Ipanema of Busan. It was really a beautiful day. Blue skies meeting the ocean on the horizon, sandy beaches that’s easy to walk on stretches out into the crashing waves. The entire beach stretches for 1.5km and in summer is the destination to come for a summer’s day out. Even in spring, when it’s still a little chilly, the beach is filled with people, perhaps because they can’t wait for a taste of summer. I know the feeling.I figured why people love beaches so much. It takes you to a place that you can love. Fun and laughter, moments of peace and calm, love and serenity, even heartache and sadness. The sound of waves providing a soundtrack to the multitude of emotions of life."
Not the greatest beach,This beach is overrated and over crowded. Whilst we were there it was closed off and area for swimming restricted with life guards constantly blowing whistles and the beach is closed at 6 or 7 at night. 
Summer Vacation,My friend and I were there on summer vacation. There is a nice beach and views. But we were banned to go to the deep place. It was not so fun within 1m deep. We wish we can enjoy our sleeping. You guys should come here on Jully or August. 
City side beach,"A built up, busy metropolitan beach area.Lots of facilities near by including toilets, showers, sun loungers and lockers. Just across the road from a busy main street for food/ drinks etc"
"Hot, hot, hot","As the pictures show, an extremely beautiful beach that has become a HUGE tourist hub. Well organised, with tubes & umbrellas for rent, LIVE shows on the beach (both day & night), promotions, fun, fun, fun and people from all the world. Kept clean regularly and lots of shops for both drinks & souvenirs nearby. Great place in summer. One new tower over 65 storeys under construction. Busan is the future!"
Haeundae beach,Nice beach with umbrellas available. Good restaurants. Many hotels and other tourist attractions. Available on Busan city tour on off bus
Family Beach,"In my personal opinion, this is better than Waikiki beach. Water temp is lower than Hawaii, but it is cleaner and bigger. Kids enjoyed the sand and cooler water temp did not keep them away from swimming. Board walk along the beach excellent for jogging or just strolling. Street performers will entertain you on the weekends. One thing impressed me was there was no garbage bings on the beach, hence no flies, no birds on the beach, and visitors are expected to carry their own garbage and throw it once they leave the beach. Cleaning crews pick up garbage early morning and keeps the area as clean as possible. Some may find it a little inconvenient, but we loved it. I'd rather have clean sand with no flies."
The best beach to foreigner!!!,"Haeundae Beach is not so big as Florida, Daytona, Miami beach but people in there are so nice to foreigner and they do know play. The problem is so crowded like a arcade market. If you really want to play with this crazy people, drink!. There is two more things you need to know.  1. Don't use Korean language and all the hotels aground the beach give you 30~50% discount.2. Don't drive the car, they are crazy driver like a mod dog. I almost get killed by Busan driver every hour every minutes.Go and Get some fun, specially single young man...:) "
FANTASTIC,Must see when in Busan... beautiful beach and well maintained. many western food places within easy walking distance.
Great entertainment ,The beach is one of best beach in southern part of Korea. There has aquariums at beach and so many events on the beach at night. Good to walk on beach board during day and night with families. 
Good atmosphere,I went there when there was beach festival. So enjoyable. This is the first time I went to beach in Busan. Don't miss it. 
24/7 Beach,"I was coming to this place in the night time. the beach is crowded but you can still have a good view. This place is a one stop place, when you're done with the beach you can have some traditional meal around the place or even shopping because there are so much store around the area considering that this place is an elite area."
Beautiful beach ,"Haeundae beach is very beautiful. But during our stay there were so many people. The beach is very well organized. Everything is there: shower, toilet, restaurants, a lot of activities. "
Very crowded but Beautiful,"I walked the width of this beach several times. It was full of people as August is the peak season. Vendors hawk everything: beach chairs and umbrellas, food, and particularly , cold beer. There's a designated area for swimming (though there wasn't much of it going on when I was there) and just farther out, another area for water sports like jet skis. The beach has nice white sand, and there's a wide sidewalk on the periphery of the beach, making access to restaurants and shops easy. Along the way, there's a raw fish eating area, the Busan Aquarium, and a few blocks inland, you can find numerous places to eat or shop. Much of Busan is devoted to business and trade; I think this might be the best place to stay."
Very Crowded,"A nice beach with good access to the ocean. But it is very crowded, especially in weekends. There are a lot of people and a lot of noise.If you don't like this, go to Gwangan beach. The sand is also much nicer there, a finer grain size."
Unimpressive beach,"Compared with beaches in Australia or England (ie Bournemouth), Haeundae Beach is disappointing but it's still a fun experience in Korea.Pros:- Generally clean- In July the water temperature is comfortable.- Close to restaurants and bars and a subway station.- Life guards on duty- In the evening there is a buzz with various performancesCons:- The swimming area is roped off and it is quite a small space so you're jammed in with other people. The guards keep whistling at you to keep you within this small space.- There are no dedicated changing facilities that I could see.- There are pay-to-use showers but no free showers."
Haeundae Beach,"Good for family visit. However, the water is a bit chilled even in July. People there are nice. You can buy drinks from the convenient store opposite to the road. The rent for the umbrella and the chairs are quite expensive for tourist. However, if you don't want to rent any of them, no worries. The hawkers won't force you. They are very polite and friendly."
Nice to be by the sea but...,"I have heard so much great stuff about Haeundae Beach, but I must day I was quite disappointed. I went in esrly June and didn't expect the water to be freezing cold...also I was expecting to see nice nlue hues of the beavh; instead it was dark and brown. I rented a cgair and a parasol but after 1.5 hours tbe guy told me I had to get off..even though it was still early - around 4:30pm...I also vidited Gwangili beavh which I preferred much more."
Great tourist beach,"Busy tourist beach, lots going on, lovely views and plenty of restaurants and shops nearby. Not our favourite beach in the area (Gwangandaegyo) but still a must visit."
Summer? It's time for Haeundae!,"Busan is indeed the city of summer. My visit was not really in summer though, it was in early summer at the end of June but the weather was so fine. Not so hot, just perfect. From Seoul or other cities as well you can choose Korail (KTX, ITX, or Mugunghwa) or intercity bus to reach Busan. As far as I know the tickets are same between Mugunghwa and intercity bus. The trip takes almost the same duration, approximately 5 or 6 hours from In my case, I went with intercity bus from Cheonan and continued the trip from Busan Bus Terminal to Haeundae. Haeundae located in the east part of Busan and have its own subway station (Line 2, green), if you travel the same trip with me, it takes 1 hour from bus terminal to Haeundae station and you need to transfer in Seomnyeon (the same case if you use Korail at Busan Station). The beach has lots of huge hotels, guest houses, bars, restaurants, and another tourist attraction near the beach, Busan Aquarium. At night, you can enjoy outdoor performances by young people in the beach, the same one you'd find in Hongdae. For bars, they often hold parties and events start in the afternoon till dawn, mainly offer drinks and music. The restaurants, usually serve seafood as the main course with price start from ₩30,000/person. It varies depend on your menu and place. If you want to explore more, don't forget to check the Haeundae traditional market to enjoy fresh vegetables, korean meat dinner (samgyeopsal) and fresh seafood. They also have delicious giant tteokbokki and fish cake as street food. In summer they hold Haeundae Sand Festival which you can enjoy hot sand bath and othee entertainment events."
Nice but water too cold,"This is an excellent option for families, there are a lot of cheap stores along the beach where you can buy beverages or snacks, all along the beach there are free toilets, a really beautiful beach, but the water is too cold"
Haeundae Beach,"Nice beach with smooth sand but cant compare to the long beach of Gold Coast as the length of the beach is not that long. Peak of summer should be packed but at the point of visit which is only the beginning of summer, it wasnt. Lots of umbrellas and sun-chairs for rent which provides a colorful view of blue, red, orange. Waves arent particularly large and is a good spot for a family outing."
We chose a good location,Our holiday plans changed several times during the planning. We compromised and ended up so pleased that we chose Haeundae Beach are and a condo for 3 plus our son's dog. Worked out perfectly for us all.
Great Nightlife,Very interesting to visit at night. Lots of street performers and food near the region. Would visit again.
Korea family Visit 2017,"It's very good ,clean and fresh See water. We enjoyed swimming 4 hours coz it's very cold and freezing water and area close to all hotels and main market and restaurants.Also, it's free charge and deserves to visit and try it you will never forget ti experience .Regards Taha Ansari"
Nice clean beach ,"Nice clean beach and good to spend a few days there. It is an ocean beach, therefore there can be strong waves and the water temperature is cold! Plenty of umbrellas, deckchairs and life guards."
Looks amazing even in winter,"I went in March so the weather isnt the best for going into the water. However, the view was nice and the beach was clean. "
Happening beach,"Considering their weather, this is the place to be if you happen to be there during summer. However, it can't beat Thailand or philippine beach. Plenty of food around and nice to walk around. Water is not precisely clear but still a nice beach to swim. Bear in mind their weather, it can get pretty chilly in the evening although its summer time. "
Awesome Beach,"Lots of nice food around the beach. I love the fish cake, the fried chicken and if you go in the evening with the wind blowing, its so romantic and you can totally forget about all your problems. "
Nice marriage of the beach and the city,"The vibe is so carefree in this area, with a lot of families and couples enjoying the sand and sea. There are street performers around, too! :) It's surprisingly clean, given that it's a public beach that's near the metro. I love that there are a lot of shops and restaurants by the boardwalk!"
busy little beach,This beach is one of the more popular destinations. It can be reached by metro (the metro station is the same name) and it is about a 10 minute walk south from the metro station. Clean and safe. Lifeguards on duty.
Nice beach with soft sand,"A stay at this beach is always a good idea. At day time you can rent a sun lounger under a sunshade, go swimming or just enjoy the clean sand for a good walk. At night time you can find dozens of musicians singing at the beach sidewalk."
Love this beach,"The sound of the wave hitting the beach is so soothing to the ear and calming to the heart. Although there are lots of family and friends doing picnic by the beach, it's so well kept and the sand is smooth u can walk without you shoes worry-free. There are eatery stalls near by and clean toilet + shower place to use. Korean seems to get everything meets ur need... If given chance, would like to stay in the Westin hotel by the beach. Waking up with the sea view will certainly make my daysssss! "
Beautiful!,"It was pretty packed when we went, but it was still a lot of fun to see. The view is really beautiful and there are places to eat close by, which is really convenient. If you are looking for a bit more peaceful experience, I would try Gwangalli, but if you don't mind the crowds, it's a beautiful stop."
Very interesting area! Relaxing and great calm beach,"Haeundae Beach is located at Haeundae station, it is the city's most popular resort both for locals and tourists, the beach is sand kissed with low waves and a great setting in which to walk, tan, bathe or just see. Around it, plenty of restaurants, markets and stores to keep you busy. Also you will find the Haeundae Market, this local market boasts a variety of fish alongside meat, fruit, clothes and miscellaneous items. Nice to visit during the week but extremely busy and packed at weekends with thirsty spenders, the market gives tourists an insight into the more rural side of Busan."
"Nice place, especially on a sunny day","The beach itself is pretty, clean, and well equipped with public toilets. There are many restaurants to choose from in the neighborhood nearby. Check out the smaller side streets for the fresh seafood spots. "
Relaxing and astonishing view,The view of the beach was spectacular. Need to walk around 10-15mins from MRT. Many tourists are around but still find it a relaxing place there. 
Great Beach to Walk and Sightsee!,This is the beach for people viewing and enjoying a cool to cold dip in the water. The hot temperature is only matched by the cold South Sea beach. 
Nice beach,We had a great time at the beach. Chair rental with umbrella is $8 each. Inter tube rental is $8 each. They close down at 6:30pm. Ahjumma's will try and sell you fried chicken and beer every 10 minutes. There are plenty of restaurants nearby and places to buy drinks and beach toys. Water was a little rough and cold but we still had a great time! 
Beautiful Beach,"Visited here with my partner in July (summer) 2014. Really nice beach with lots of people, fantastic views of the sea and adjacent city. Close to nearby attractions such as shopping and aquarium. Unfortunately we were not allowed to swim at the time due to the strong swell. Beach is patrolled by lifeguards in summer. Highly recommend a visit here if you are in Busan during summer."
"Excellent, lively and very clean beach","Coming through Bangkok, my first impression was there were less number of people, the beach had a spectacular view and it was very clean. Living close, I had the opportunity to visit the beach multiple times during my stay. The beach really comes alive in the night with colorful lights from the high-rise buildings and restaurants and group and solo musicians putting up a show.On the right flank of the beach there is a beautiful hill with walking platforms to up and around with viewing points to enjoy the sea views. Place not to be missed in Busan. "
Nice beach,"If you go to Busan,don't miss Haeundae beach area..it's really different atmosphere with Busan city centre.you can feel relaxing here.Just stop at Haeundae beach station exit 3,and go upstairs and you can see 2 row of high buildings. In the middle is pedestrian where you can walk until the Haeundae beach.You could find many restaurants around this area"
"As part of our 4 Corners of Korea tour, we visited Busan.",We arrived in Busan as the sun was setting. The view of the beach was beautiful and the lights from the city as well as the bridges were absolutely amazing! Got to try out a tent bar where I ate fresh abalone and drank a bottle of beer...it had Song Joong Ki's picture on it so it was even better! The next morning I went down to the beach again and it was so peaceful and beautiful. The water was clean and blue and the sand was so fine! I am from Hawaii so I appreciate beautiful beaches! It was a dream come true to be standing on the beach in Busan!
Good beach,"Not quite beautiful to be in Rank 1, still you can spend some good time watching the waves. There was a mermaid statue on the rocks which was unexpected. The sand art was good. The algae floating in the water made the beach look poor."
Very clean yellow sand beach,It is a long stretch and can cope with the large volumes of visitors. Options to hire loungers and umbrellas. Shower and changing facilities available. Cliff side walkway at western end to the lighthouse. Easy to get to on the metro and very short walk.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.
Free shower and toilet,"The beach is not really beautiful, but ok for hanging out with friends. There is a volleyball- and soccerfield which you can use for free. Also the shower and toilet container is for free. If you want to rent a chair, umbrella or the picknick blanket you have to pay 10.000won.During the day they have lifeguards.Early in the morning the beach is pretty empty and you can go for a run or do exercises."
Long beach,Beach is a short walk away from the station. The beach has a nice view. The surrounding place was just recently upgraded and walking along the place when the sun is not so hot is quite enjoyable
Free and easy,"For people who comes from a small city state like Singapore, the horizon looks awesome. The beach is just like any other beaches I've visited. It so happens that there were some sand sculptures on display which make the visit interesting."
Good chilling area,"Stayed one night near the beach area. It is relaxing with many shops and amenities nearby. The beach isn't suitable for snorkeling kind but the sea water is still considered clear and nice . The beach chairs on the beach are for rental, cost 24000 won for one whole day ‍♀️ Tips: go earlier in the morning before the rental collector start work and u will get to lie on the chair for free "
Friendly beach ,"We had the opportunity to stay right at the beach , yes it is a city beach not a tropical paradise but it is lovely and friendly , easy to rent a beach umbrella for around 8 USD with a mat or with lounges ( more expensive ) . It has a nice waterfront to stroll around , all kind of facilities and good restaurants and the Aquarium. Entertainment for everyone .We also had the chance to see sand sculptures , amazing "
Beautiful beach,"With blue sea in front and mountains at the side, great breeze, its a great place to get a tan (though it might be chilly) and just take a breather.There are also lots of huge sandcastles exhibits that will grab your attention.Shower booths are available at certain locations along the beach. A short walk from the Metro station. Lots of coffee cafes along the way."
Good beach,"You can watch people do magic on the beach, you can swim in the sea, you can get drunk on the beach. Overall it's a good beach"
Nice Beach ,Nice beach with lots of activities during the time we visited. There was a stage set up for dance competition and huge sand art in part of the beach.The water is nice and clean but unfortunately too cold to swim even during end of May.Still it's worth a visit as there are some nice seafood restaurants at the end of the beach on the end near Paradise Hotel.
Beautiful beach with plenty nearby,"We were at the beach during the Sand Festival, which was quite interesting. The food booths were only set up during the weekend, but there are plenty of restaurants just a block off the beach, and bathroom facilities available along the beach. In addition, there is a paved walkway for those unable to traverse sand. There is also a wooden walkway which goes around the point (on the Westin end of the beach) which takes you miles along the breath-taking coast. Unfortunately, while we were there the walkway was under construction, so only about the first 1/4 mile was available for walking. But it was still worthwhile."
Nice sand art,There are a lot of sand art building in the afternoon. Nice for pictures. Lot of restaurants before heading to the beach. Many performancers for cool entertainment. Perfect for walks with family and pets.
Crowded Beach,Popular & therefore crowded. Easily accessible from Gimhae airport by airport shuttle. Short taxi ride to the Buddhist temple -Haedon Yonggungsa Temple
nice coastlines but no need to spend too much time there.,"checked out the famous beach and to our pleasant surprise, there were many sandcastles (HUGE ONES) along the beach and so everyone went trigger happy snapping pix with them. other than that...nothing very much happening. some cafes, a small market near by and that's it. it's very walkable from the nearest metro."
Pretty View of the City,"We met up here with a friend visiting from Seoul who was showing us around Busan, and another friend from Japan. This was the first place he wanted to bring us because there is a nice walking path right near the beach. We arrived not long after a typhoon and the weather that day was kinda poor, so there wasn't really anyone on the beach at all. It was kind of interesting because the beach had flooded from the earlier typhoon and one of the huge ocean buoys was washed up on the shore. We met up a couple hours before sunset and took a nice walk on the path, getting some really nice photos of the sunset and the city at night."
Nice visit during weekday,Visited during a weekday in early June and the beach was pretty with nice sand festival and some street performance. The beach is accessible by subway from city center and was clean and several kindergarten groups visiting at the time. Seawater was cold but for that day heat was refreshing.
Nice beach,"This is a nice beach but it gets very crowded. There's a lot of people who drink alcohol on the beach. That's not a problem in itself, its just not great for a family atmosphere. There are a number of popular events that take place on the beach, so there's always something going on, besides swimming and tanning. The boardwalk is lovely to walk on and it has a number of toilets and places to wash off the sand adjacent to it. The showers cost money to use.There are restaurant and convenience stores nearby, so you can stock up on necessities quite easily. There are a number of carparks located next to the beach. We were there for about four hours and the carpark fee was around 12,000￦.I don't think this beach is great for young children because there's a steep decline down into the water and the water seems quite deep for toddlers.In my opinion, Dadaepo beach is a better beach for families with young children as it's more level and the water doesn't get deep for quit some distance from the shoreline."
Decent beach but the sand festival was pretty good,"the beach was clean despite tons of people walkin by.but the beach was pretty much the same, but the sand festival was amazing and street performance at night was quite good."
a clean and attractive beach,"going to the beach in the evening is not delightful because of darkness, there is no light all around"
Amazing Sand Festival,"It was the Sand Festival last week and the sand sculptures were absolutely amazing. There was also a concert by the beach to celebrate the festival, performed by local artiste. Didnt know them but the locals were excited and the concert rocks !"
Beautiful Sand Sculptures,We arrived mid afternoon and got a beach view upgrade. What we saw took our breath away a very large expanse of beautiful beige sand and about a dozen very large sand sculptures. We had to go and get a close look as well as photos. Magnificent. Sadly it was very windy and cool so we did not get to sit on the beach but a beautiful Beach it certainly is. 
Just another beach,"This beach was just by our doorstep from the hotel we are staying in.The beach was clean and had sand sculptures when we went, not sure if that's an everyday thing or a one off event thing.It was a pretty long Beach, but I wouldn't say it was anything spectacular. You also couldn't swim in it as it wasn't swimming season. Could be due to a number of reasons- rip current, season itself, or certain sea creatures in the sea at this time.If you're in the city then might as well visit the beach as it's so close! "
A Beach,"There are many other beaches in Busan, each with different aspects to promote them. Haeundae is peopled in, well, people. So, go in the morning if you want a good spot in the sand. Be aware of umbrellas, tents, and clothed people. (If you're a foreigner, it's nice to know.) Also, enjoy people watching, walking the boardwalk, and eating at the different restaurants nearby on the eastern end of the beach. I like Haeundae for its neighborhood nearby and long stretch of beach. Enjoyable."
beach korean style,"i've been there with my korean Mum which grew up in Busan and live for 40 years in Seoul. If you are in Busan, this is fun and if the koreans are not in holidays (like in early july), beach was empty.I was only allowed to swim with a big yellow swimring ! Koreans women over 30 do not wear bikinis...but only one piece....It was beach korean style...I would not come to Busan for the beach. Busan has impressive modern architecture and is near the Unesco world heritage bugulksa and co. "
Enjoyed it much,Good travel spot in Korea. One of the must go place where one can find multi nationality people and all kind of food and restaurants. Can plan at least 6 hours to 1 day for this spot. Good to go with family as picnic or outing.
Sunny with cooling wind,There was an sandcastle event that showcase many different things. very nice. worth the visit. Similar like our sentosa.
Photo-taking & chill,"There was a sand exhibition so we took photos with many sand art as well as took pictures of the pretty beach! Wasn't as crowded as we thought it would be so we managed to get some pretty shots! Good for hanging out or relaxing. Even went to the end of the beach, climbed up the stairs and took photos near the rocks"
Too many American soldiers but nice eating options ,Nice beach with good food options all over. Personally only tried Sharkeys but other places seem nice and diverse. But in the bars there are a lot of American service men. They are proud and loud which might not be your thing when you're not American.
Popular and crowded,This is a very pretty beach but was ridiculously crowded. The water was also quite cold. If these factors don't bother you then by all means give it a try.
Urban beach with lots to do,"We visited the beach during the Sand Festival. It was great to people watch the Koreans on the beach - they have an entirely different take on frivolity in the sun than most western cultures. The Haeundae beach reminded me of Oak Street beach in Chicago, except that the views of the environs here in Korea are better than Chicago. The beach is definitely packed into the midst of urban sprawl of Busan, but it was convenient to get a drink and just walk out to the surf and enjoy life.Take the Busan metro to Haeundae, stop 203, and walk 800 meters to the beach."
Clean beach,You are able to enjoy the breeze in the city area. The beach is full of nice sand sculpture when I was there. Nice to spend an hour. 
Beautiful Beach in Urban Midst,"We came here first on our private tour of Busan during a cruise stop. It was beautiful! The sands were a glorious deep yellow & the waters were deep blue. Having high-rises in the background further enhanced the beauty and uniqueness of this beach! I would've loved to be able to swim here but time wouldn't have allowed it as we only had 5 hours in Busan. If I do go back to Busan in the future, I will definitely come back here to swim! "
Wide beach with good waves,"I only pass by the beach. The sand was soft. People were building sand sculptures. Maybe because it is not summer, so it is not crowded. Worth going."
Great beach,Clean and sand the sands looks very inviting to walk. Went before the season changes and the wind blowing from the sea was cooling. There is a sand dune where you can slide!
Gorgeous Beach,"You can't leave Busan without checking out this beach. When I went, no one was allowed to swim since it was off season but there are a lot of other things to do, lots of places to eat. The view is amazing. A must!"
Relaxing and clean beach,"This beach was about 100m away from our hotel so was very relaxing to stroll down to. Kept very clean and surrounded by lots of restaurants and stores, this is a lovely beach easily reachable from most places. The closest subway station (Haeundae station) is just 400m up the road."
great beach in a great city . .,"Very decent beach in a very decent part of town . . . Guess it gets heaving in summer but it was just right this weekend,. . . will be back. . "
Beautiful city beach,"I was surprised how nice can be city beach.even in large city as Busan is. Clean, not many people and toilets."
Heaundae Beach really beautiful!,"Very clean and beautiful beach. I had wonderful time here.I like to walk the beach and I was not disappointed.Full of sand, wind and sun...I will be back here for my next Korea trip."
Nothing really special,"Worth a visit just to say ""you came"", but as it is really out of the way, I would not recommend if you are on a short trip. Yes, you might miss the beach umbrella but go gwangalli instead."
Sand sleigh!,The beach was very clean and beautiful. What was interesting was there is this huge mountain of sand on the beach and you can borrow a sleigh from a booth nearby for free and slide down the sand on the sleigh! 
Nice beach in Busañ,Here is most famous beach in Busan. There are many hotels and resorts but you shoul not expect East Asian beach. Because here is always crowded and the beach is not clean.
Enjoyable!,Truly a gem in a big city. It gives you a chance to unwind and relax. One of the most beautiful views in Busan. 
Nice beach if you like sand.,"Pretty large beach, otherwise nothing special. Lots of rules about what was forbidden (e.g. $600 fine if you do ""leasure activities"" in the swimming area)."
Big and crowded ,"Nice beach, pretty clean. A lot of hotels, so a lot of people. We visited when it's still cold water (in early may)and it was pretty crowded. Still I liked it. There is small port with 2 types of sea tours. One at day for Orykdo and other for bridge at night. Cost is 22000 won for adult and 13000 won for children."
Great spot for families! ,Haeundae beach is a small beach in comparison to those in Australia. Very family friendly. You can easily get food and coffee on the beach front. The beach is very safe and great for swimming. Highly recommend!!! 
Nice place at night,"We visited this place yesterday at night. So beautiful at night. Crowd of people. So nice for walking. So many hotels, motels, restaurants and cafes. So u will not stay hungry by the way u can find halal restaurant called punjab. So hope u will enjoy also"
Hali Hai Festival,Went on a group trip for the Hali Hai Festival. It was a lot of fun. This older Indian lady was walking around the crowd putting dots on people foreheads. I almost cried cause it was so heartfelt. She said it's the meaning of friends and love. It was an amazing experience. 
Nice vast view of the sea with things to do around,"It will be even better during summer or autumn as we went during the start of spring, it was still pretty cold and we couldn't do much on the beach.Pretty much like any other beach with fine sands.But there is a sea aquarium along the beach and opposite it are rows of cafes and eatery.Hotel located there promise a nice view of sunrise and set."
Not sure what all the fuss is about!,A white sandy beach set against an urban landscape. We were out of season visiting and understand that the beach ends up being packed in summer. Facilities are available nearby.
Its just a long beach!,"It is a nice beach, but buildings come right to its edge and there is nothing very special about it. But it is very well looked after and clean. "
Ultimate your view,Really a nice view even I can't say that the beach is the most beautiful and cleanest in the world but I can say that's really amazing view for walking along the beach with taking a deep breath to relax yourself
Best beach of Busan,"Best beach of busan... Not just in terms of quality of beach or swimming... But at excellent location... With aquarium, restaurants, bars, casino around... "
Beautiful Beach,There is so much going on down in Busan! This beach is ranked at the top in Korea! There are so many great restaurants and places to shop. The sunsets are not to be missed!
Lovely beach,"Beautiful beach, lots of coffee shops next to the beach and loads of hotels in the area for every price range."
Cozy place,"It's really good to walk with your companion here. The View is nice even you are not going to swim there. The beach is very clean and the sand is so white. When the weather is nice, recommend you to walk here it's very cozy. There are nice BBQ named 오반장 (伍班長)near this area and you can have it after walking."
A beach with beautiful view,"Haeundae Beach is beautiful. its clean, well taken care of, seagulls were flying.. it was calming just looking at the sea. the color of blue sky and white clouds.. its a stress reliever. must visit if you visit busan. just take line 2 using the subway station to haeundae!"
Beautiful!,Very clean and beautiful beach! Beyond of my expectations! I've been to beautiful places in Southeast Asia and Haeundae beach is almost as good as Thailand :)
Beautiful ,"It's very sad that it's cold because the water and the beach looked amazing. I definitely recommend anyone that visits Busan to come see it and if it's in the summer, take a dip. "
Clean and beautiful ,"Our hotel was located really close to the Haeundae beach, so every morning we sat in a coffeehouse and we were watching the view. Very calming place and there is a nice little road you can go on and get close to the sea without having to get your shoes off, it's near to the Novotel."
Big Beach,I visited Haeundae Beach in the spring so it was still quite enjoy. The beach is very nice and is surrounded by hotels and restaurants. It is a very deep Beach so lots of room. However my friend say that it's super packed in the summer. 
Sunny day!,"It's quite a pleasant time walking by the beach on a windy afternoon. Not a lot of people at this season, which is great because not so crowded.Weather still pretty cold so no much of swimming activity by the beach, but my niece had fun playing with the sand slides Nothing much besides the great sand and clean beach though. "
People watching is equally as fun as beach activities!,"Haeundae Beach has the best of both worlds - you can have the sand between your toes and splash in the water, OR you can stay relatively sand-free and walk along the promenade. There's always something to watch here - be it someone swarmed by seagulls, someone terrified by waves but nonetheless taking a selfie with them, or someone letting off fireworks at night - you'll always be entertained! There's also free wifi on the beach which is a fantastic feature!"
Heavy wind and fine sand,"A really nice beach for a romantic walk with your soulmate, which unfortunately I don't have one. Sigh..."
Beautiful place to hang out,Must visit this place in Busan! Beautiful water and beach with a backdrop of new and old highrise buildings. Taxi or subway here and spent a few hours walking around the whole area. Worth it!
Just a beach with good sand really...,"We never understood why this place was rated so highly. When we got there, it was 14 degrees in April so too chilly to swim but the beach was crowded with locals and tourists taking selfies and writing their names in the sand (which granted was quite white and stone less).It is also close to the sea life centre (expensive to enter) and a few side streets for street food.What was more interesting for us was a small path leading off from the beach which led us to the Korean version of the little mermaid and several large rocks which are climbable. "
Beautiful and full of people,"It was really nice. Indeed a lot of people enjoying the sun, even a kpop group dancing there. There are facilitites for changing your clothes and the beach it self is really nice with a lot of (paid) chairs and sunshades."
Beautiful Beach,Love the wonderfu view at the beach. Nice photo shoot location. Have a nice stroll at the beach to see the sunset.
Great beach,Lovely beach with many restaurants and bars on the beach to choose from. Very clean and pleasant to spend time at.
Beautiful beach,"It was to cold to swim but it is a beautiful beach, extremely clean. Very nice boardwalk. There was always some type of entertainment. Great to walk anytime day or night."
Nice beach ,Very nice beach though there are construction. People feeding seagulls. You can just relax & enjoy the sea breeze.
really good place to enoy the sun,"Just rent an unbrella, buy some fried chicken (people pass selling it) and some korean beer and enjoy your day."
"Spacious, enjoyable sandy beach",Several times visiting Haeundae Beach and always happy to return back. Biggest beach area I've ever come in S.Korea. Must visit in Busan.
Stunning beach!,"The day we visited this was forecast to rain, but in fact the sun was shining beautifully, which was lucky. The sea is a beautiful colour and the beach itself is lovely and clean. Lots of restaurants in the surrounding area, and interesting street performances going on in the entrance. We really enjoyed ourselves here!"
Best beach for fun in North Asia,"This beach has beautiful sand and is cleaned daily. The water is actually clean, blue-ish water too which is very nice considering this is basically in Busan City. The beach is lined by hotels and from May onwards to end of October its the hottest beach in Asia and is famous for beautiful ladies and nice guys hanging out. Next to the beach are a myriad of bars which are all happening too in summertime.The beach is of course white sand and it has some surf, yet not much so is safe for everyone too. In winter its cold but clean and peaceful."
Prettiest Beach in South Korea,"I was here ages ago (sorry, I couldn't select a date earlier than April 2016, so that isn't really accurate), therefore I can't speak for today, but this beach was really beautiful when I visited! I honestly didn't think a place like this existed in South Korea until I actually went there. I have friends who still live in South Korea and tell me it is just as beautiful as always. It can sometimes be crowded, which is really the only downfall, but even then it doesn't ruin the experience. The sunset at Haeundae Beach is stunning! A must see! "
Lovely beach.,"This season, there was a few people. I could feel winter wind and wave sound. You can find many coffee shops include a starbucks. I defo visit here in Summer."
Nice beach,Beautiful beach with soft white sand. Come here with your family after visiting Dilmaji for cherry blossoms. 
Nice walk,"Nice to walk along the beach and see the city from a different spot. Durri g the liw season (when were there) we haven't seen any one swim, to cold, but from pictures and videos of how it is durring the summer, it's doubtful that you'll enjoy your swim because the place is over packed."
Nice beach,Nice beach to relax. We went here during sunset and it has a nice view and there is a lot of seagulls during that time that entertains the tourist.
Beautiful Views,"Even in the winter time this beach still offers incredible views, great sunrises, and a fantastic place to run along the boardwalk. There are plenty of options for lunch or dinner and some restaraunts even offer a very reasonably priced weekend brunch."
beautiful spot,"beautiful spot to visit though we go here during winter, but the still a lot of people coming and walking along the beach. And lot of restaurant nearby where you can eat."
Very nice beach,"We love this beach. It has a very Long Beach before you get to the water. Lots of people present, but beautiful spot to visit. "
Beautiful and crowded,Was winter and still so many people there. You can get some local food just around there. At night you'll see fireworks even though there is a message saying that's illegal 
Best place in Busan,"An absolute must when in Busan. As I see it, the most beautiful place in the city.great place for an evening walk.I usually stay at Westin Chosun Hotel at the end of the beach.Recommend 8th floor with a Biznis room, which also gives you access to the bar for invited guests."
Nice long beach,"A nice long beach with entertainer. Many locals went there in the weekend. To avoid the crowd, maybe you can go on weekday. Traffic jams around and made the taxi fare very expensive. From the temple to beach, it costs almost W10000."
Average beach,Went here today hoping to find good food not sure if i went to the right place almost all good restaurant were closed maybethey are all open at night. Beach is nice i wonder how the place looks like in the summer. Area may become too crowded and lots of ongoing charges constructions. Too many people feeding the sea gulls. The sand is also nice!!!
Great view,The place is always flocked by tourists because of it's majestic view at night. You can relax while looking at the different colors of the bridge.
Good to see beach in Busan,"So glad to see white sand and taking pictures. Morning view and we can see many people do activities, like running, walking, and so fun!"
Beautiful and so much to see,"This is a beautiful beach with a great walking tour. You can see interesting sites like the mermaid statue, the Five/Six Islands and the APAC House."
One of the best beaches in Busan,This is located near our hotel just a few walks. It was really great to see the beach with too many seagulls. We had fun taking videos and photos. 
Haeundae got may seafood,"I personally come here to see the beach and go to market buy some fresh seafood.. at super cheap value the seafood are also in big size,plusmore you may saw some different kind of fish and other things.. i also eat some unknown fish that causes me allergies but it was okay..the fish is delicious even im just grilled didnt put any sauces on it., here you can ."
Average beach,The sand was clean but the water not so clear .It's good place and and you can also explore the market/street food market on the way to the beach from the subway.The kebab was yummy !
Great beach (even in winter),"We had a great time exploring Haendae Beach. Even in winter time, many people still hang out here (but with coffee in hand including us). It is very accessible via subway, and you can also explore the seafood market/street food market on the way to the beach from the subway."
Crazy Busy Haeundae Beach,"If you go and want a good beach experience the month is June (Swimming is cold). If you go and want a good beach experience and some swimming (though if you go too far out someone will probably blow a whistle at you) then it's September. If you are people watching, July and August. July and August are the busy months, the beach is packed with people and stretching out to do a sand angle isn't easy. Umbrellas are so close you stretch your legs and you're under someone else's umbrella. It's too crowded imo and I don't like it, so I don't go anymore at those times. Actually a beach that while it isn't considered as ""nice"" but I think it's equal in ""niceness"" and is much less crowded, has lots of water sports and a view of the Gwangahn Bridge (unless you don't like that sort of thing) is Gwangali Beach just to the west. More space to stretch out, play some Frisbee, go for walks without having to bump into people. I love that beach much better than Haeundae."
"Awesome beach, lot's going on!","There was always something going on at Haeundae Beach! While we were there, it was a sandcastle contest/exhibition and a large concert so we really enjoyed the atmosphere.It's also really pretty to watch the sunset from here, makes for a good Instagram pic! :)"
Cold beach,"Haeundae is one of the most famous beaches in Busan. Although it is minus degree during winter time, you can still see many people hanging out at the beach. The beach is average. It nether have crystal clear water nor white sand. It is a good place for local to hangout, but nothing fascinating there."
Great beach but surely better in the summer,The beach here is long and wide and would be a great visit in the summer. I was told that it's encouraged to bring food here and have a beach picnic. However in the winter I was mostly watching people feed the seagulls and take selfies near the waves. Will be back in he summer for a nice tan!
Windy,Windy and cold due to it's winter.. Would love to go back again during summer! There are also live performance at night.. 
Long and wide beach,"Went at night after our dinner to have a stroll. There were many people walking around and some of them were releasing wishing lanterns up to the sky. The atmosphere was good but nothing spectacular.The beach however took on a totally different setting on the morning of 1st January where the Koreans would celebrate the First Sunrise Festival. Rather than staying up late to countdown, they would gather at the beach to look at the first sunrise of the year with renewed hopes as they release the balloons into the air. Extremely meaningful!"
Beautiful place/cant miss in Busan,This is oneof the most popular beaches in korea. Prbably overcrowded in the summer but it was not empty even in January. Lots of hotel outside. Little ones canhave a good time with the seagulls. They love snacks. Its avery long beach. Clean sand to walk on.
Really nice in the off-season,"This is a gorgeous beach, but the umbrellas rather ruin it in the summer. During the off-season, you can walk along the whole length of the shore. There is a nice boardwalk too. Lots of restaurants and coffee shops all along the way. There are usually fun street performers at night, too! I saw several singers, guitarists, and even a magician last time I was there!"
Most famous beach in Busan,"I stayed at paradise Busan, right next to the haeundae beach. I'm not that much of a beach goer, wasn't that exciting for me. But the stretch of road north of haedunae beach along the shore was very pretty. That walk is definitely worth it, but can get fairly steep."
One of the few swimmable beaches in Korea,Most other beaches in Korea are cold and not as good for swimming as some other Southeast Asia or Caribbean beaches but this is one of the few that is warm(during summer) and enjoyable. However it could be very very packed during the summer.
Beautiful sunset view,This beach has a stunning sunset view. Even though I visited in the winter I enjoyed my time there. Great place for pictures.
Simply amazing ,"Like no place I have ever been before. Breathtaking views over the beach to the sea and back into the city, even better at night time "
Hae (sea) un (cloud) dae (mountain),"Beautiful clear blue beach and peaceful park to stroll around. Highly recommended to come in summer but if you come in winter, make sure you are fully equipped with winter clothes. Korean BBQ must try!!!"
Very convenient,"I visited Haeundae beach during the winter season, and although I couldn't swim because the water was too cold, there were plenty food vendors near by who had the best seafood that I've tried in south korea."
City Tour,"This was part of the city tour we took. We were so glad we took the tour. I fell in love with Busan. It is very rich in history and culture. All the places we visited are ""instagrammable"". ☺"
good place for taking photos ,"Great place for taking photos. Probably encounter crowd at the noon time, better go in morning, and a lot of restaurants nearby. Must try barbeque food!!!!!!! "
Lively beach for a great weekend get-away!,"We have traveled to Busan from Seoul a few times and Haeundae is a must when you visit! The restaurants, the activities, the street artists, the whole atmosphere of it all! We went in May (which was perfect weather and just before the main tourist season so we had the beach relatively to ourselves) and then again in January (SO cold but still beautiful to see!) and regardless of the month, there are always things going on! There do not seem to be any places to rinse the sand off after you play so keep that in mind when you are navigating back to hotels, cabs, restaurants, etc. While the sand is very clean, the water had TONS of garbage in it which was kind of gross to navigate around but still a fun beach!"
Sunshine in december :),It was my first time in korea.My bf is from this counrty and from busan so we've visited many of famous turist places. And Haeundae beach was of course one of them.First of all in Busan wasnt cold at all! It was like spring :) and that day we've visited beach was sunny and not even single cloud on the sky. We took thousand photos -its very picture perfect place. It wasnt overcrowded at all and it was clean. U must check it when u go to Busan for sure. 
Beautiful clean beach,Impressed with the cleanliness and how wide the beache waterline is. Just by the roadside with abundant of cafes and eateries. Also next to Busan Aquarium. Perfect time to visit is either morning or evening for the sunset.
"Looks really great in winter, even better in summer","Very clean an great beach. Unfortunately we go on winter its very cold. The wind really killing you, freeze your hand. Birds all around. Many places to go here, casino, nice food, etc. "
A beach with many tourists,"There are many tourists here! The best way to get here is to take the bus 1003!But in the evening, the bus can take almost a hour and half to back to busan city. The beach was fair but there was a lot to do around the beach! Worth to.visit!"
Quite good,"The swimming area was quite small , surrounded by a safety net , which is good of course , but because there were lots of people theres not much possibility for comfy swimming. Still is quite good , the water is clean , at all times there are things to do around, from beach games ,to magic tricks , i got involved in a quite franctic one (hahah) overally very good, especially to coffee-lovers like me, in the evening ,in one of the coffeeshops near the beach. :)"
Surprise to us - hot spring for soaking your feet for free,"We we walk along the beach in late morning to enjoy the nice beach view with lots of seagull flying around and warm sunlight in a cold day. Very enjoyable. To our surprise, there is a hot spring along the beach you can soak your feet for free as long as you like. The hot spring temperature is about 38 °C (as it is indicated on the wall). Local are already have their towel to dry their feet when they are done. We are not prepare for this and just make do with whatever cloth we have in our bag. We felt that this is so nice experiences in a winter time."
Must visit,It is the landmark in Busan. You must visit. Staying in the hotels on the beach would be the best. 
Very clean and pretty beach,"The beach was very pretty and the water was beautiful and warm. I felt weird wanting to get in the water as no other adults were in the water, mainly a few kids. Neighboring casino was not good."
Weekend break,"Beautifully kept beach, clean with plenty of places to stop and enjoy the space! can be super busy in the summer months "
A nice beach to relax,The beach is a cool place to hangout and have a few beer and chicken (Chimec). Hard Rock Cafe is close to it!
So-so beach,"Maybe it is because I visited the beach in winter time, when it was so cold and not sunny, the beach wasn't in its best form. The shore was quite narrow. However, there was a special vibe there, it was very lively with performance. And birds, there were so many birds."
The most beach,It is the most beautiful beach in Busan. And visit the The Best Views Gulls have been many episodes. Everyone enjoy and relax 
Nice view to stroll,I visited the beach with family during recent trip to Busan. Good to stroll around and enjoy the view
Fine sand and nice view,"The beach is long and the sand is very fine. At the far end of the beach is a ferry pier for U-dong Island. There are some seafood restaurants near the pier. However, there are not many cafes along the beach. In fact, more choices can be found along the main street and around Haeundae Metro Station. At the far end of the beach is a sloping road leading to the hillside where you can see the panoramic view of the beach. There are also some decent hotels up the hill too."
Beautiful scenery and ocean breeze,"I've been there last November. The weather was so cold and I was amazed by how good Korean take care of their beach. It was clean and I have a nice strolling there in the morning. Since there is a pedestrian walk along this beach, lots of their citizen spend their evening to have physical activity such as jogging, cycling and walking. It feels so nice to ever come Busan and have this experience."
Better than Waikiki :),"Be sure to look to your left and to your right when you're on the beach to see the impressive ""40-to-50-storied"" buildings on each end of the Beach, and yes the beachfront itself is a ""complete stretch"" of high-rises (though not as high as those on the far ends) with ""glittering signs"" for all kinds of retail establishments on the buildings near the entrance to the Beach (where there are stairs for a short height from the street to the Beach), and just near the beach entrance is also a market street by the same name as the Beach with quite a number of food vendors in it (some of them are where you buy from outside like those at 'walking streets' in Thailand & Laos, but these are all under roofs and pretty neat & tidy); all in all, this is an ""absolutely developed"" beachfront area with all kinds of establishments catering to the needs of consumers especially in the streets branching from the big street 'Gunam-ro' between the Beach and Haeundae Metro Station (you won't fail to experience the ""festive atmosphere"" of the semi-outdoor restaurants on decks in those streets although I'm not sure if that's only a ""summer thing"", and yes the ""accommodations"" are abundant too in those streets with 'We Guesthouse' where I stayed at being one of them).The Beach itself is also ""pretty sizeable"" both in length & width with very gentle (if at all really!) waves, and I did get to see a boxing match right by it last June at the time of my visit with also some guy performing a ""fire display"" show right down the stairs on the Beach. In short, if you think Waikiki is great, you will be ""awed"" here!Coming by the subway, it's Line 2 to Haeundae Station. If coming from Busan Station (after arriving by train), you'll first have to take Line 1 from Busan Metro Station (right beside the train station) to Seomyeon Station where you change to Line 2."
A pristine beach,"Since I visited in winter, it wasn't really swimming season, but the beach is worth seeing. It is incredibly clean and a good place to go for families. A word of warning, if you bring any food you will be mobbed by seagulls."
"Wow, Nice beach","i stayed at Citadine Residence and walk 5 minutes to Haeundae beach. Nice. Clean and lots of activitiy. Was there 21-24th december 2016, there was a nice big Christmas Tree and surrounding lights in the neighbourhood as well "
Winter stroll,"A lovely winter's walk on the beach from the Haeundae food street to The Westin Chosun, with buskers singing Christmas carols, seagulls, crisp air and big waves all adding to the holiday atmosphere. Continued around Dongbaek Island to Bay 101 and Marine City. "
Just a beach ,I would say busan is pretty quiet. There's nothing much to see hence we visited the beach although it's winter. For me it's just a simple beach but it's ok to walk by the beach coz we had a heavy lunch. Other than that I don't find it fascinating enough 
Bread for the Birds,"Bring some bread if you are visiting the beach.There are many sea gulls around and local birds. Once you feed them with food, they will flock all over you. You will get to see them flying in from everywhere in Busan to your feeding ground. However, i am not sure if it is recommended or legal to feed the birds. Overall if you are a beach-goer, this is recommended to go as there is nothing much along the beach. There are many shops at the road leading out to the metro or bus. Remember to wear sun blocks and water if you go in the summer. The weather was cold when i visit."
Wonderful beach,"Lovely large stretch of sand, with rows of restaurants behind and the bridge (wonderfully illuminated at night). A must-visit when coming to Busan."
"Nice beach, nice weather",We visited the beach on a nice winter day of around 7 deg C. Lots of sea gulls and pigeons flying around and well maintained beach. Not a very big beach though compared to those in island resorts that we go to. Nice eateries and Haeundae market around the beach.
Still the best beach area apart from Cheju Island,Hyundae Beach area is great for anyone who loves clean ocean rocks and the sound of the sea. You have all types of accom and meals for $10 or 100! That's Korea. My first visit was here in 1990 and apart from high rise and marinas it has not lost its charm. Early morning walk reminds you of Bondi Sydney. A lot of locals out and swimmers too! Just like north bondi. Do yourself and family a favour. Relax with any budget. 2 -3 days is enough. The local seafood is plentiful. TGIF has $13 burgers and O'Kims bar great views and Guiness. What more do u want?
"Rent a bike, watch the light show","The beach is crazy crowded during the summer, but off season it's a wonderful place to hang out and walk. The light show at night on the bridge is a sweet way to spend your meandering time. At one end of the beach you can rent a bike by the hour for a few bucks. The bike path is easy to use and safe. Nice place"
Perfect (but cold) Day,"Lovely beach, great view out to the ocean and the day was just perfect sunshine and no wind, so the water was almost mirror like. Great board walk and joins up to APEC house."
Nice,I was here wintertime. Can imagen that this beach is crowded summertime. There several hotels and cafes along the beach in addition to an aquarium. Not to mention the beautiful walk to the island. So plenty of things to do if you are not only interested in a good tan. The sun is on the beach side the whole day. 
In winter .. just the sand n the sea,We were there in early December. It was windy and cold. There were only a few people on the beach. Some locals were feeding the seagulls food and you can see the whole flock of them following the people around. Not a sight of the colorful umbrellas. We took a few pictures and stayed for a while to enjoy the beautiful scenery.
Huge beach with clear waters,"The beach is easily accessible, there are a handful of pubs in the vicinity. Safe and crowd is mostly of children and families."
Beautiful place,"Haeundae Beach area is certainly a nice area to stay in Busan. The area is well kept, beautiful and there are many restaurants. The feeling is safe and generally the people running the shops and restaurants are friendly. The beach is picturesque and the terrain around the town is hilly so some of the backdrops of the hills make it scenic."
Beautiful beach,"I was in Busan in November, but the beach is a beautiful place to visit. Also, many shops and restaurants nearby.There is an aquarium as well. Regrettably too cold for swimming. Weather was around 20 Celsius. Made it just in time to enjoy sunset."
"The cleanest, safest and most luxurious beach i have been to- comparable to None!","This beach overlooks some luxurious hotels in BUSAN- South Korea. It is a classic place, very clean, well light 24 hours , very safe and within town proximity- easily accessible. One gets boat rides across to the other town side. It is a smart place for couple outing, individual rest, family outings and group events. It is convenient for individual rest- where one can sit, meditate and enjoy the gift of nature. I really had all the time i needed to rest while accommodated at Sea Cloud Hotel. It is near other hotels like Novatel, Seacloud and Paradise. Easily accessible!"
Not as big as what I have seen online,The beach looks okay but not as big as what I have seen on TV.. not sure if the Haeundae beach is actually bigger than where I was.. overly rated..
Good beach ,Do not compare with other beaches Bug nice and lively for busan we were there in winters but still a lot of people and if u are in busan a must beach to go 
Very nice,"One of the nicest lookin beaches, as a view... But I have never been swimming there. I only love the looks and the sounds of waves hitting the shore. To me, that is a relaxing sound to listen, while fallin a sleep"
"Beautiful, Peaceful, and Clean","I went in the off season, so a bit chilly and not typical ""beach"" weather. This beach is beautiful both day and night, clean, safe, and peaceful. "
Haeundae,"During the three-month summer holiday vacation, I travelled to Busan, which is a seaside city of Korea. It is also a nice city for people to play the water activities. It is covered with sea, ocean and beaches. One of the most famous beaches of Busan is Haeundae Beach. Actually, there is also a movie named Haeundae, which was taken here. It is a wonderful place to take a holiday here. I took the KTX railway from Seoul to Busan. It took about 4 hours. And then we went here by subway. After getting to the beach, you can have a whole view of the sea, which is boundless. It makes you comfortable. What’s more, you also can see many people are surfing in it. Super cool! I prefer a sun bath here. At last, I recommend the people who want to visit here need to check the weather situation in advance to avoid the foggy or rainy weather."
A long beach,It is cool the time I went there so I didn't swim. It was a sunny day and it is quite comfortable taking a walk at the beach. The water is blue but the sands are not soft.
crowded,"local and tourists gather around,there are recreational activities around or you can just sit somewhere and watch them all"
Clean and Beautiful,"This beach is the most famous beach in Busan. Very easy to come here. Quite recommended if you want to spend your time in a nice, clean and beautiful beach. Once you tired to play in the beach, you can easily find many restaurants, markets and entertainments nearby."
nice beach,probably the most beautifull baeach in south korea..we stay there in windy day but the beach was still full of people.
Nice to walk in the morning ,We weren't able to fully experience the beach since it was already fall when we visited Busan. It was already too cold for a swim but we had a leisurely morning walk there. Our Korean friend told us that the beach is a very popular summer destination and can get pretty crowded. There are many hotels in the beach area if you want to experience the beach in the summer.
Beach surrounded by modern buildings.,"The beach is located in the northeast portion of Busan and is only a 10 minute walk from the subway - although it takes approximately 35-40 min to get there by subway from central Busan. The open air Haeundae Market is also located between the subway station and the beach and well worth a walk as well.The beach itself is a bit barren - no trees, no lounge chairs (none that I could see when I went in November), although there are some sitting areas at the edge of the beach. The beach is also surrounded by modern buildings, shops, restaurants, hotels, and more, so you do not get much of a secluded feeling. However, the closeness of the restaurants makes it a very convenient beach to go to. I also didn't see restrooms to clean up along the beach, though I may have missed these facilities. I also didn't see any permanent lifeguard stations. The beach was sparsely populated when I went in November, although I can imagine it being very crowded in the summer time. Sand is very fine grained as comfortable, though not as fine as beaches in Sydney. The beach is quite clean as well.It is worth a short visit in the off peak season, though I'm not sure about the atmosphere during the peak season."
Beautiful beach,"Beautiful beach even in November! The lights in the evening are really nice, and in the low season you have a lot of space. Nice place to go for a walk!"
Nice beach to walk around ,"Easy to find .. just 8-10 minutes walking distance from subway. Morning & evening view totally different, surrounding a lot of hotel and restaurants. Hard Rock Cafe just next to Novotel .. "
Great beach,Beautiful beach.Nice supporting surroundings with good amenities for all.Relax and enjoy and doing nothing really.....
Clean and beautiful,"2nd time at Haeundae beach, 1st visit was during June (summer), however weather was too foggy to get a good view of the beach, 2nd visit was in Nov (winter) and gosh it was beautiful. The beach is also more quiet during Winter which is great if you like some peace during your beach strolls."
Average beach,Nothing special here. Not to sound negative but I'm not sure why the KNTO promotes this beach so much. It's an ordinary beach. 
Super beach,"I was here in November, when swimming seemed to be a problem. But for walking, jogging et al, it is a perfect place. In difference to places like Copa Cabana, here they have toilets (Politically correct US term ret rooms) and also smart showers. I would not recommend the place in summer because it seems to be densely populated."
Nice view,Bring a packet of snacks to feed seagulls. Very close contact with them. Enjoy having fun time with the seagulls. There's an area where you can do foot spa. There's a market in Haeundae area as well. 
Beautiful,"Part of a guided tour.My hostel overlooked the beach and mile upon miles of stretching sand,clean without debris or trash make this an endearing spot to come over and relax."
Peaceful Night View,Went there at night. Not much people. Great view of building surrounding the beach. Stop for awhile listening to group busking. Be aware of people asking for donation. They are targeting foreigners.
"Visited on a very wet and cold day, but I am sure when the sun shines it would be beautiful","Needs the sun to shine so that you can fully appreciate it.There are zones on the beach for families, couples, etc, etcWhen we visited it was very very wet and cold, but I am sure it would be beautiful on a warm, sunny day"
Beautiful view,It is easy finding the beach. I took Humetro subway till Haeundae station exit 3 or 5. The beach was about 10 minutes walk from the exits. It was not a crowded beach (maybe because it was a weekday and early evening). The beautiful scenery and the beach is beautiful and clean.
Nice and relaxing~,The beach was cleaner that what I expected and it wasn't crowded for Sunday. It was nice to walk around and enjoy the breathe. It has a beautiful scenery. We recommend visiting here. There are tons of places to eat and relax throughout the day. 
Nice place for a walk!,"Haeundae Beach is one of the must visit place when you are in Busan. We visited the beach few days after the typhoon struck here. We thought that the beach would be very dirty due to the flood, but they cleaned everything as like nothing happened before. Salute to their speed cleaning. Worth visit~ "
Typical beach,"Free wifi within the beach. Lots of hotels and restaurants around this place. Maybe in the summertime it's a nice place to hang around. Went there autumn, so it was quite cold. There were not much people around. Good time to take picture though since it was not crowded. "
Amazing beach 24/7,"The beach is really worth something to look at and walk by. We came in November and always had sunshine. If possible when in Busan, please stay at least one day at a place that offers seeview rooms"
Average Beach Among Skyscrapers,This is a popular and clean sandy beach in the downtown area of Busan and with surrounding skyscrapers. It is a good place to relax.
Wonderful beach with a lot of food stall!! ,Great place to spent time in busan other than the shopping district. Is very relaxing and sand is clean and fine! ;)
Surf beach,"Haeundae beach is quite picturesque and is popular with local surfers too. The beach was not busy and hardly anyone was swimming due to the cool weather, but this would be a great place to cool off and enjoy the surf in the summer months. There are plenty of restaurants and cafe's nearby with views of the beach too. Easy access from Haeundae subway station"
Good but not too big,We came here in October and the beach is still popular so I can imagine just how crowded this is in the summertime. There are lots of restaurant around and the usual souvenir stalls and gaming booths.Its near the metro so very accessible.
Enjoy the breeze,2nd time to these place which i recommend everyone to visit because at night there are a lot of street performers and the weather is cooling even in summer!
The Best Beach in Busan,Absolutely the best beach in Busan area. Beautiful white sands! Must visit this beach while you are in Busan
A lively and crowded beach suitable for all ages,This beach is easily accessible by public transport. There is a aquarium in the area if you are bored of walking around the beach. Many beautiful Korean can be spotted here and there are many restaurants where you can enjoy the beach view.
Cloudy and strong wind in winter,"Everytime i went to Busan, i will visit this beach. Summer, july- rains a lot but able to walk around, play some games but nobody swims. Winter, jan- cloudy, very very strong wind. Struggle to walk, had to hug on to a pole. Mother and daughter holding on to each other. Some umbrellas damaged and caps flying around. Great, funny experience.May spring- great night walks, great weather. have to see the street magic show at the beach in the evening. The guy is fun. "
Nice beach,"Visited this beach in autumn so not much action. Still, a charming beach with great view with many nice photo taking opportunities."
nice beach on the winter (8C),"The most quite beach i ever visited and it's so beautiful,clean, and warm.Busan one of warm city (on winter) compare with another city in korea.There is a haeundae subway stastion as well, but i decided to walk (because my accomodation is near) and pass by traditional market near haeundae beach.I won't comeback on summer time because people said it's super crowded."
"Beautiful beach, best visited out of season...","I my view this is one of the best beaches in Korea, and certainly the most popular, which is why I recommend visiting out of season. Haeundae Beach is at its most frenetic during July and August, but if you choose to go in early September or October, you'll have the Beach almost to yourself, even though the weather is still reasonably warm, although the sea can be a bit chilly...Whenever you choose to go, you'll have a great time on this clean sandy beach..."
Quite a beach - but off-season no action!,"I can imagine this golden stretch of sand heaving with sun hungry Seoulites, but on a clement 18C day in October it was dog-walkers and a few kids. No one seemed to fancy braving the breakers. Still the Westin provided a nice view of the mile or so of beach for a little drinks break. Come back in the Summer I thought..."
Great and clean beach,"A lot going on at and around this beach, you can walk at the cliffside to the right and left or listen to the buskers on the boardwalk area at night. Great street food and other eating options just off the beach as well."
Gorgeous Beach,Weather was perfect and there was a reasonable amount of people there on a weekday. Eateries and markets are nearby - lots of festivities
A nice walk,We spent an hour wandering around. It's a nice walk and well worth the visit. The trails are extremely well marked and it should be accessible to most people. Some good views of the sea.
clean boardwalks,didnt get to exercise much during my work trips but made it up by strolling on this beach up and down several times to get to the seafood restaurants!
Beautiful beach,"The beach is beautiful, there are all the necessary facilities and cafes around. I usually travel to Busan at the end of the season when there is no more umbrellas and sun beds. But is is still warm and nice. It gets very busy, but fun in the beginning of October for the Busan Film Festival. There are not much waves and the water is still (apart of the day when the typhoon passed by in October 2016). Nearest beach for surfing is only within 10 minutes away and about 5$ Taxi ride - the Songheong-Dong beach, where you can rent a surfboard or take a surfing lesson. If you watch the water - on your left will be many cool seafood restaurants to visit. Lots of them are still recover after that typhoon though. Also, if you walk towards the Westin Chosin Hotel - you can have a beautiful coastal park walk and see the light house and Apec. The walk takes about 25 minutes. Highly recommended!If you will go from the Aquarium towards the inland there will be lots of cafes and shops around, including a small fish market, where you can eat very cheap freshly cooked fish. That's a very local experience :) Otherwise you can just watch blizzard seafood creatures."
Busy Beach,"The beach is great to visit once, but it is incredibly busy. You are only allowed to swim in a roped off area, and it is so crowded in the water you don't have much space."
Relax on the beach and enjoy the breeze,"The beach is really nice and very clean. Find a place to sit, have a nice hot drink and just laze around to enjoy the breeze."
Fun time,Haeundae is ine of the most popular beach in South Korea specially in Busan the city of summer and winter to leve for its great weather.
Clean and scenic.,"This has too many ships going past to ever be the beach it desperately wants to be but it's lovely nonetheless, especially at sunset. Tonnes to eat and drink round here too, especially really tasty street food!"
Excellent to see in springtime,"Haeundae including the beach is best seen in springtime when the surrounding streets are lined with flourishing cherry blossoms, the most famous being Dalmagi-gil Road. It is advisable to visit the APEC Centre and then Haeundae Beach in the afternoon and after dinner take a taxi to the top of Dalmagi-gil Road to see the cherry blossoms lit up by the street nights and to view the night scene of the city from the visitors' platform (at the lower end of Dalmagi-gil Road). There is a seaside walkway between the APEC Centre and Haeundae Beach; it is a scenic walk. In late March/ early April ie the cherry blossom period, it is quite easy to catch a taxi before 6:30 pm (when the sky is still not dark) from the beach area to go up Dalmagi-gil Road, but one has to walk down to the nearby subway station Jung-dong after the visit because the road will be heavily jammed after dark; catching a taxi is very difficult. Having a position-locating app on the mobile phone is highly recommended, as the local people do not seem to understand English when you ask for directions. It is a long walk to the subway station, but it is worth the effort."
Not very exciting!,It's good to visit and enjoy a cup of coffee. You can walk around the whole area in an hour but that's it. 
Love the fresh air,When you go there in winter you will feel the fresh air while enjoying youth vibes in the beach. So many people singing near the beach. You should visit food market near this beach and eat the cheap and super Dwaeji Gukbap (Pork soup with rice)!
Busan's most popular beach but not a great one,"Our hotel room overlooked this beach and it was pleasant to watch people walking along it but very rarely going into the water. There was a very good boardwalk along the beach which was enjoyable to walk along. But if one is expecting something like Daytona Beach, Florida or even Miami Beach, you will be most disappointed."
Go else where if you wat beach holiday,"Nothing special about this beach, it just an alternative place to hang out while at this area. A place for the locals to hang out. Pack during weekend nights."
Who ever thought of taking a beach holiday in Korea?,"Fabulous and magical, with crystal clear waters (a little fresh), soft clean sand and gentle breezes. After sun baking you can meander around the coast for a gentle sea side walk, culminating in coffee and ice cream."
Nice Beach,"Enjoy the seaside with family, it was still cold when we visiting, however i must said it must be good place for summer. Lots of local food nearby too!"
Beautiful beach in Busan,This is a beautiful stretch of beach with nice pavement to walk if you don't feel like getting sand in your shoes. There are plenty of leisure activities to do - you can visit Busan Aquarium or pop into a small covered mini library on the beach where you can just site back and enjoy your view or read a book there. There are young music buskers so you can just sit and near their music. A nice place to relax and just chill out
Breath taking Seaview!,"Very long & clean white sands beach, the view is stunning. Along the beach there are many pub, restaurant & cafes. You can also find Haeundae food tent stall or sit down & do nothing. Just enjoy the view."
Great Beach on the east coast,We loved being near the beach in Haeundae. Our AirBNB was perfect and the nightlife and buskers along the beach were of a high quality and entertaining. Great atmosphere.
Beautiful beach - well kept,The quality and cleanliness of the sand is very good. The wide beach means lots of space for walking and enjoying the sea air. Quiet when we visited in mid-October but still warm and pleasant. We were able to paddle in the sea - lovely!
Great views,Either day or night you can see the city. The beach is well taken care of. At night you can see people singing and entertaining anyone walking by. The sea walk is nice for a romantic stroll or night run. 
Cool and Clean Beach,"Very well maintain beach. I was there in October during the Autumn, Many runners were running along the beach like me. The pathment were very well maintain, cleans and free from sands. It is a must go scenery."
Beautiful Beach and sand is clean,Haeundae Beach is located at BusanIt's a popular beach in Busan Haeundae sand is clean and water is clearYou can Swimming at there so remember prepare your swimsuit to go ;)It's a beautiful place and easy to go Nearby the beach got a lot nice restaurant too after beach you can enjoy your breakfast lunch brunch or dinner ;)
Absolutely Beautiful,"Haeundae Beach is the perfect location for couples, families (with kids) and friends for a gathering/picnic/simply to enjoy the breeze and take pictures! It is also very accessible by the subway (alight at Haeundae station itself). Highly recommended when you are in Busan!"
Nice clean beach,Very good - not too busy. Close to business district in Haeundae and plenty of area to walk with easy access from the main street. There was a busking festival perhaps coinciding with the Busan Film Festival in 2016.
Hello everyone 👋🏼,"Hello guy Today I come back to haeundae is my favorite place I am very like here,sometimes I tired from work here is the first place for my vacation I think next summer before I come back to Thailand I will come back here again "
visit here when spring or fall and clean day,if you visit here clean day of sping and fallyou must experience wide beautybut sadly nowdays korea's sky is not clean cause of dust from chinaso when you visit here not clean dayyou can't feel here is beautiful.
"Very packed beach, I prefer the night scene","The beach has a lot of those umbrellas so it feels too touristy to me. However, it is definitely worth a visit to this area to have a feel of the vibe. I went in late noon, so I didn't stay on beach but walk towards Dongbaek Park. When I returned on my way to the train station at night, there were people performing along the beach as well, so it was nice to watch.There are alot of eating options along the way. I ate at small eatery recommended by my hostel. The boiled pork in soup was absolutely superb. Hence I was glad I made my trip to Haeundae Beach to immense in this recommended spot!"
Beautiful beach ,Visited the beach at night as unfortunately it was raining most days while I was visiting Busan. Nice beach to go for walks and worth having to go and spend a bit of time and enjoy local buskers showing their talents. Also close to lots of dining places so you you're sorted on that bit :) I can only imagine how awesome this place will be on a bright sunny day!! 
BEAUTIFUL CLEAN BEACHES,Haeundae Beach offers a great opportunity for a nice and relaxed walk along the Korean coastline. Beaches are very clean and well maintained an offers excellent views.
Amazing Beach to visit,It is one of the prime locations to visit in the city of Busan. Crowded with people. Has the aquarium in proximity and thus amusing for kids to visit. One can spend a nice eve enjoying the view of the endless sea.
Stay around the beach to soak up the atmosphere.,"This is a beach not to be missed. Though there are plenty og stars hotels around, there are budget accommodation like motels, guesthouses, homestays, hostels too.The area around and before the beach front is lively especially at night with lots of activities and happenings. Restaurants and shops lined the street leading to the beach.Very touristry and always full of foreign tourists. Hundreds of restaurants and eateries at the side roads too selling Korean and western food. It is a place that never sleep. The beach is wide and big. Good for swimming and people watching. The best beach in Busan."
Night Swims in Busan,"We stayed a 5-minute walk away from the beach on our trip to Busan and we loved it. Even though it was raining most of the days we were there, at night the beach is just as phenomenal as during the day. It's definitely relaxing to head down to Busan and catch a break from the hustle and bustle of the city and take in the beautiful ocean air and friendly warm environment. "
After the tsunami,the beach was not so clean when I visited. It was a really nice sunny day though so I can imagine what the normal view would have been like. Unfortunately all the BIFF set up there on the beach was washed away and all toppled over even the vending machines. The sea water was also not that nice in colour but maybe it's just because of the storm.
Pawalg,Haeundae beach is really clean. I love to see people come and do activities here at the beach especially for playing beach volleyball.
Largest Beach in South Korea,Good and nice beach for morning or evening walk. Plenty of activities during the weekend especially if you like to people watch. There are also buskers in the night performing on the beach front.
City Beach,"Nice and very clean beach in the City of Busan. Smoking free zone at the beach, very positive.A lot of restaurants, coffee shops, bars etc. nearbyRelaxing day at the beach!"
Big!,"Really big beach with clean sand. No waves and the water was a little cold for my liking. Great for beach sports as we played rugby on the beach. Very clean public toilets, but no water to wash your hands afterwards. One thing I noticed, no bins anywhere!"
Famous beach,"Since I went there in late September, beach crowds were no longer around. However, it was a sunny,breezy day. Nice to walk on the beach. It was very clean. The aquarium is also located here, saw a few groups of school kids on their field trip there."
"Nice beach, nothing special.","After reading and hearing people rave about Haeundae beach, we thought it must be breathtakingly beautiful, so booked accommodation in Haeundae during our stay in Busan. Well, I don't know whether it's because we're Australian and so are spoiled with some of the best beaches in the world.. but this beach leaves much to be desired. During our stay it was constantly packed with tourists (most of whom didn't even get in the water), the water is really not vibrant blue or as clear as Jeju-do, and the waves are almost non-existent.. I'm not sure what people rave about? It's really just an average beach with sand, nothing more."
"Miami, just smaller",No idea why everybody is highly praising this beach. I have been around Korea a lot and seen much better places. 
nice beach to visit except hot summer days,Nice beach to visit and spend time to play at the beach. Lots of sashimi and sushi place nearby beach.
Excellent and convenient location for a great beach holiday.,"This exceptional beach especially if you are with children. During the season it thoroughly clean. So is running on the beach are very strict and vigilant lifeguards who watch over any accidents on the water and rapidly suppress any violations. Some do not like it, but I believe that it is right.Near the beach there is a good infrastructure with cafes, shops, hotels of different levels of expensive and exclusive Paradise to cheap hostels for students."
Busan Adventure,Didn't go in the water but the beach was great day and night. Fun during the day beach combing and entertainment at night with warm breezes and felt very safe for an evening stroll.
"Nice, but...","Nice beach, perfect sand, but misses a bit of the atmosphere of other famous beaches. September is definetly too cold for a bath or even sunbathing, but it's always nice to walk next to the see. Not having bars and pubs next to it made it more relaxing to be honest. We would come back in summer, when the atmosphere should be better."
"Summer, Sand, Love","It's packed with people, both locals and foreigners alike. The water is clear and cool, sand is fine not so coarse, there are some water activities as well. Also there are nice food nearby the beach as well as beachfront hotels so do come here and enjoy the natural beach in a busy city"
It's a popular beach.,"Living an hour away, I've been to Busan several times and this is one of the more touristy places to visit in Busan. There are many restaurants and bars right off the beach and in the area. The SEA LIFE Busan Aquarium is right here if you're looking to do that. You can ride the metro (Green Line) to Haeundae Station and walk a few blocks to the beach. It's a touristy beach, nothing too special about it."
Trip to Busan - 3days,Ultimate 3 days visit to Busan... Haeundae Beach was awesome to be at night and stroll around. The beautiful skyline at night gives it a more majestic view. A must visit..!!!
Night view,"Visit here for a night view of the beach. There is a food Street at the western end of the beach selling fresh live seafood. You can have it in raw or bbq , a dish of octopus cost 20k won and patronise by the locals. Can see a lot of locals strolling along the beach at night. "
Give a miss,"The beach is nothing spectular amongst other beaches around the world. Unless you're going for water activities or Casio or dinning, recommend to give the place a miss. Also the weather in September month seem still in hot summer.Probably the attraction is to lunch at Gukbap Alley for the pork soup."
Peaceful and beautiful beach,"I went there in autumn. There was no swimmer but some people walking around the beach. Maybe it was the off-peak season, there was some construction undergoing. Yet, it didn't affect me viewing the scenery. Near the tracks, there were several poles that allowed you to place your mobile phone for taking picture. It's a smart service for visitors."
Beautiful weather and view ,"I visited the beach after the summer season with a friend. Luckily the day we went to the beach was a sunny and relatively warm day. The view was beautiful and the walk along the beach with the ocean breeze was great! The sand was soft and fine. Overall, a good experience given that it's already September. "
Very nice beach,"Only spent a few hours here on a business trip, but will definitely be bringing my family here in the future."
Perfect beach,"Hard to fault this as a beach. White sand. Big spaces. Clean; in fact very clean. Plenty of bars and coffee shops nearby. Safe for kids and good for sunbathing. Perhaps because it's wide and long it is not perfectly romantic in some small way. But that's a small critique of an otherwise lovely strip of sand and sea that's good to enjoy. If your tourist spot hunting plenty of hotels with direct access to the beach, Paradise, Novotel and Westin Chosun to make a few. But loads of others. "
Urban beach,"It's nice to visit and a good place to walk arround - but it's not a paradisiac beach, it's an urban beach. Crowded in the high season."
In the night is awesome,"I went there in september, the beach was very clean, nobody take a sun in this time of the year.A lots of dangerous waves, but a beautiful place to go in the big city and disconnect.Beautiful by night, u have to go to a nice walk."
Good beach in civilised Korea,We stayed in Busan for 4 nights. 2 days weather was bad. when sun came there was wind but we enjoyed beach. there were not so many people. good waves. very expensive umbrellas! toilet available.
Nice night walk,"We have a nice walk in the evening from the park to Haeundae Stn. It was a nice walk along the way. Many eateries including halal restaurant. There were a lot of ppl but not packed. Still, it's an enjoyable night for us"
Great recreation area and relaxing,"Although not a breathtaking view but it's a great place to relax and stroll. If you do not want the sand to enter your shoes and dirty your pants, there's a wooden path you can walk to the beach. The skyscrapers beside the beach make a great night view. There are many shops and restaurants near the beach so it's very convenient to get food, cafes. "
Long sandy beach,Lovely long sandy beach. 17 September there were no beach chairs not sure why. Could do with a few more beach bars nearby too. 
Breezy beach with baby stroller in Spring,"Was there during Spring 2016 during Chuseok, which makes the area quite quiet. But, it was a fun things to do after taking the kids to sealife aquarium. We stayed in Nampo thus taking the taxi was going at 17,000 KRW, which you could go by Metro Nampo - Haeyundai with 1 station switch at about 1,350 KRW per person. There were 4 of us, with a baby on stroller, Taxi were more convenient. It is surrounded with hotels and also casino (but for foreigners). Went to had our lunch at hardrock cafe busan which was only open late Oct 2015, Our 1st non Korean meal for the whole week here. There are some other restaurant here, which we did not venture, there are some famous korean cuisine but mostly are booked by korean family having reunion and only doing dinner during chuseok.For cheaper eats better head over to centrum city ~"
Great place to see the Sea of Japan,Beach was very clean and pleasant. It can be busy at times but lots of beach to roam! Lots of restaurants and hotels across the road from the beach with great views
A great place to visit in the morning,I recommend this place to visit in the morning if you want to relax and get some fresh air. The place has free WiFi for the visitors.
nice place,"the beach is so clean as in the morning there will be a group of local people to clean the beach. If you strolling around the beach in daylight, you'll see mostly elderly, it so relax to see them. but it is different when it night, the place is full of youngster and if you go on Saturday night it get even more interesting. we went on Saturday night and we get to see a magic show and busking, it is so enjoyable."
Haeundae Beach Busan,We are spending our time here during Chuseok. Came here quite often and enjoying the beach and mid temperatures. Many people are here and having fun. At the moment big waves and police is busy driving out people from the sea. Espacially in the evening a lots of things going on. Musicians and magicians are busy. Fire works at the evening are not allowed but nobody cares. Every morning quite a lot of waste has to be collected by garbage collection. It is quite disgusting that so many people leaving their rubish around. On the other hand the town Busan does not do anything for improving it. There are world wide solutions available but here ..... 
beach,nice place. now is mid of september and even koreans told me that its restricted to swim i saw people swimming but mostly foreigners i also joined waves were quite strong for me  its interesting cause the officer driving a small beach car ashore was telling through the speaker to come out of the water there were guys on water motorcicleswatching people not to swim far from the shore )
Great,This is a public beach. Anyone can just access here that's why it's over crowded.The wave is fun. This place is clean and safe.
Absolutely gorgeous,The sand is soft and the water is clean! We were able to lay out on the beach and relax at 3am which was very calming. There aren't alot of annoying birds or seaweed everywhere but there are beautiful shells.
Spectacular beach,"I was only here during the night, but it was spectacular, beautiful lights and filled with people.Tons of entertainment from buskers to magicians and even aneed aquarium "
Good quite beach,"I went there on Chuseok day, it wasn't crowded and great to take pictures. It is quite windy. In the beach free wifi is provided. There was also some magician performance playing some tricks. "
No crowds in September but still warm,"I hear this beach is crazy busy in summer but come 2st September, they pack up all the parasols and the beach is back to it's natural beauty. "
An excellent place to be,"I went in september so the beach was closed (which means you can't swim). But it doesn't stop you from enjoying the great views or walking along the shore. Attractions: ferry ride ( I would suggest after sunset, the skyline appears to be beautiful). The sea-life aquarium is also on the beach. Several other things to do as well"
Beautiful beach and very nice weather,"While walking along the beach, I stumbled upon a pan pipe musician playing one of my favourite song from ABBA, the winner takes it all. That really make my day."
Calm beach,"The beach is quiet not much waves,lot of students come during day time.is neat and clean,Spacious beach"
Nice beach,"What makes Haeundae Beach outstanding is its proximity to commercial centres and city proper. If a worker would like to relax by going to the beach, he can do it in just a matter of minutes. The beach is a walk away from good hotels. A walk away from the traditional market. A walk away from everything. This makes Haeundae Beach perfect for everybody (solo, friends or family) on vacation or work or whatever purpose."
Clean beach,"We went to Haeundae Beach on a rainy weekend, but the sun did shine through form time to time. Though it was not crowded due to the poor weather, the beach seemed to be relatively clean. The waves were not too strong and our 4 year old was able to run and play in the water a bit. The water was really cold in July, and I am not sure if that's the norm or not. There are tons of restaurants and shops near by as well. Would love to go back again sometime. "
Great beach in Asia,"The only downside of this beach is the amount of tourists that visit here but thats because of many reasons. Some good foreign bars there but my favourite is Wolfhound, classy Irish bar. "
I came here for the second time,The last time I came to Busan haeundae Beach was in 2014 and I'm back!!! I would recommend coming in September because of the humidity being a lot less than in June and it's not as crowded as it is in June September is a really good time the waters fantastic a bit chilly but the weather is still really warm I would really recommend going to this great beach!
Empty & clean,"In september the place is worth a visit. It is still warm and the beaches in Busan are almost empty, except for a few old ladies selling beer to tourists. Good for relaxing in the sun / swimming. "
It's just a beach,"Normal beach, there is sealift aquarium nearby, worth going. There are many bars and food place. As I'm not a beach person , I didn't enjoy it. "
"Full of people, especially pretty girl","Beach beside the sky high building not really is my cup of tea, but it is a very happening place, all the way from subway station until the beach is full of people. It is not like the ordinary beach I used to know, no beach bench, no shady tree, but have street performer singing or playing gitar here and there."
"Beautiful sunsets, and enough room to relax and enjoy.",A lovely and quaint beach. Make sure you visit the Aquarium and various statues across the broadwalk.
Very nice beach,Very nice beach with lots of white sand. Amazing view of the skyline. Lots of street performers. Great great place. We walked all the way from Haeundae Beach to Gwangalli beach. A long walk but very picturesque. 
A good beach to get soaked and relax,"The beach is very clean and the water is excellent for taking a dip,The shower facilities are also good but the toilets could have been a bit more cleaner,Overall a nice beach to hangout,"
Clean nice beach,The beach was clean and nice and big. The wave was fascinating with very little contamination. we when on beginning of Sept and not much people was there. 
More western and busier than Gwangalli beach but still worth the visit ,We stopped here took in the view and popped down to the Haeundae market place for a bite to eat. More people at this beach but less shade. Beach stretches out far and it directly at the coast whereas Gwangalli is more sheltered I can only imagine this is an amazing space doting the intense summer days. We arrived in September. Cooling down but still warm. 
Party beach,Second time visited here. Crowded of people. You can feel happy and passion here. Good place for relaxing.
Nice sand but big waves,"I came on 1st of september and i was surprised to find an almost empty beach. It's one of the most famous in korea so i thought it would be really crowded. But i was told that the summet season ended at 31st august,so there were less people. But unfortunately the weather also becamr worse (ay least for swimming and tanning it should be warmer). Thr beach is quite dangerous because of its big waves. You can not really swim here and it's not suitable for small kids.I really liked the sand. No watetplants, no rocks...greatYou should also visit the the haeundae food market which is right around the corner."
Big beach - plenty of room,"Thought this beach might be one that was overcrowded but it had lots of room for sunbathers and beachgoers. Plenty of umbrellas, although we didn't use one as we only had time to take a walk along the beach. We were there in August when it was exceedingly hot, so possibly that kept a lot of people away. Would love to return when the weather was more bearable. Beautiful views though."
Wonderful beach and lovely crowds,There is no other reasons not to come here if you like summer!!!! Nice sea views and there are too many hotels there for you to choose your accommodation. Walking distance to metro station - haeundae. You can find aquarium there as well. But the most important thing is walk around to try the local food especially their seafood!!!!
Nice Beach! Nothing special!,"Me with my friends went there for a quick dip in the water, the beach wasn't crowded at all perhaps because of the bad weather that day, but I heard that It could get really crowded in there on a typical sunny day specially in summer, there are a lot of shops and restaurants nearby and a smart shower for everyone to enjoy, there are some birds hovering around the beach so I suggest that you bring some bread crumbs and you can actually feed them! The beach is accessible via subway or bus, yoi can even take a taxi and everyone knows about the beach. "
Typical Beach,"We went here summer, there are many people that time. The beach is just fine. No special at all. What is nice is seeing the birds flying around the stretch. :)"
Good beach,"Busiest beach on Busan, lots of things to do. Very popular and this can make it too busy in summer. The hotels around here are of high standard at a good price. "
Miles of ....,Miles of sea and sand .... and on the weekend or during holiday time all the space are brimming with people. During quieter times very good for photography.
Wish it were open later,"Nice relaxed beach but closes at 6pm, and they force you out of the water. Evenings are pleasant to hang out to listen to the buskers."
Beautiful,"Haeundae beach is arguably the most beautiful beach in all Korea. The view is amazing. Right by the big city of Busan, offers a little bit of everything. Must see place."
Gréât beach,Gréât Beach / sea sideOk I preferred wild nature one but here you are in town and on the beachI had great weather and some pretty waves.I place to see and spend some time 
It is a beach,"Almost empty on a slightly rainy Tuesday morning in August. Very little in the way of cafes or shops at the beach - shopping district is in several blocks. Beach clean, water inviting"
Busy beach with lots locals,"Even though the beach is well-maintained, the crowd was a bit much for my taste. There are beach chairs with umbrella that you can rent for the whole day."
Nice day at the beach,"My friend said it wasn't gonna be clean or clear, but he was wrong. If only it had better waves, but i guess it's more of a chill beach. It had a pretty nice vibe and ambience to it at night, as buskers play and perform. "
Awesome place to soak the sun.,"Very nice beach by so many restaurants and with so many umbrella to rate for shade. Also, the proximity of the SeaLife aquarium will make it a great location for families to spend their day."
Awesome for spending time with small child,"My son enjoy so much, swimming is quite scary because the waze is so strong but good is they have lifeguards who was very attentive taking care the safety of the people who are swimming."
It's a beach! ,"It's a beach, what more could you want. I originally planned on only dipping my toes in the water, so I dressed completely inappropriately for going to the beach. The weather was sweltering so dipping my toes was only going to leave me wanting more. It can get very very busy but still a pretty site and everyone is very friendly. I left my belonging on a random patch of sand and hoped for the best. Spend a whole afternoon, running around and playing in the water, very much fun. The views are very nice, the skyline is pretty! "
Nice clean beach with warm water.,Nice clean beach with warm & clear water. Lookout for the floating donutsAt night is very relaxed and safe with great food places.
Nice Beach,If a nice place to spend an afternoon with a lot of restaurants and coffee shop. You also can swim in the beach. Around the beach area there is the Dongne Island that is a good place to see the sunset. 
Blue sea with warm water - no need for convincing,It's great. Go there if in Busan during summer. Beach is clean and smoke-free. Not so crowded on a working day.
Korean Beach,"This tends to be the most famous of the beaches in Busan, so is more crowded in Summer. However, don't come here expecting a beach experience similar to other coastal towns such as places in California. Most people who come to the beach cover up alot and sit under provided beach umbrellas. At peak times if you want an umbrella spot, you should arrive early. Tubes are also available for rent. The beach is fairly well regulated and patroled by lifeguards on the beach and in the water.Other than the umbrellas there is no other shade on the beach as there are no trees, so prepare accordingly if need be.The strip along the beach has many hotels, cafes and restaurants. It's a good place to stay if touring Busan.Expect many people on the beach taking photos, if you are uncomfortable by this, it's best to stay away from the middle of the beach to have a little more quiet and privacy. At night the boardwalk around the beach has various different kinds of entertainers. You are allowed on the beach at night, many people come in the summer to drink and shoot fireworks in the evening. Overall decent beach, but definitely not a place for ""beach culture"" so some may leave disappointed. Beach open year round but swimming ends in September."
An interesting place to see how Koreans enjoy life!,"Haeundae beach is of the most iconic beaches in South Korea. It is easily accessible by metro.Haeundae beach is well organised. There are a lot of parasols for renting, lifeguards, many coffee shops, pubs, restaurants and hotels accross the street and always events and night music concerts. An interesting place to see how Koreans enjoy life!"
Beautiful beach,Haeundae Beach is a beautiful beach which is easily reached by subway. At the time we visited (aug 2016) it was clean and not crowded at all. Definitely a nice spot to re-energize! 
Over rated,"It's a nice beach, my friend and i went in autumn and the beach was not crowded. The beach was alright, I'll give it a miss the next time I'm in busan. I think we had too high an expectation. "
Love love love,"We live in Seoul and just wanted a beach trip with sand, waves, umbrellas and relaxation. We found it! We loved all of the Hawaiian ice stands and the umbrella and chair rental were reasonable. For 16000￦ you get an umbrella and chair all day. No time limit. Restaurants for lunch are right across the street and food vendors walk the beach selling chicken and beer if you dont want to leave. Remember to bring toilet paper though as the beach bathroom doea not have any. We definitely will be back. "
beach beach beach,A great place where everyone gathers and relax themselves. the beach is very organised with shelter umbrellas for rent. You can see everyone enjoying themselves. The atmosphere is there
Always fun at the beach,This isn't our first time to Haeundae Beach but it was certainly our best. The water was warm even at 10 P.M. There are tons of places to eat and there are events right on the beach.
Mom & kids,We loved the beach. Lots of umbrella seating. Renting water inflatables was easy. All of the vendors were willing to make deals. Yummy korean chicken and drinks also were sold. A great time. 
Amazzzinngg!,"This beach is huge! And accessible by metro which seems rather strange. Even though it is packed with parasols, we pitched our towels closer to the water and it didn't seem as crowded. The water isn't so shallow so the water can be crowded but it's enough to cool off. When we went the life guards were telling people to stay closer to the shore for safety reasons. It's perfect for building sandcastles though and there is lots nearby in terms of food and drink. "
Best beach in Busan,I love the atmosphere! I loved it in June and July. (Do not go in August as it's overcrowded) There are many places to enjoy foreign food.
Good beach with many rules!,The beach itself was good. You could hire a parasol and a chair to be out of the sun. While in the water the lifeguard is very active preventing you from going to the area where you cannot stand. The whistle got quite annoying after a while.
Beat the heat,"Not by any means a world class beach, but certainly a decent place to have a dip in the heat of Summer. Surrounded by many bars, restaurants and other attractions, Haeundae Beach is worth a visit"
Like a flock of sheeps,"Haenduae Beach is quite an attraction. Not primarily by the sand or water quality. It is more of an attraction in regards of culture and achievements of human kind. The achievements are the very impressive sky line, particularly at night and shouldn't be missed while you are here. It really gives a great flair to the beach. The culture experience is more about how people enjoy beach/water. Like a flock of sheep people are kept in a thin (maybe 5-10 meters) line close by the shore by rescue waterjets/boats. If one sheep (swimmer) gets out of the line (marked by red bouys) the lifeguards (shepards) whistle and come close with the waterjets (horses) to bring the sheep (swimmer) back in line. At 6pm the life guards whistle all together, walk along the beach and make sure all sheeps are getting back a shore. It's like bringing home the flock to let them rest. From a birds eye view it is an interesting observation. If you want to swim - don't come here. If you want to be an individual tourist enjoying a beach - avoid. If you want to bath - perfect, play with kids in the sand - perfect; watch Asian culture - a must. "
Average one...in terms of security its good,"The beach seems OK. You can gather around and swim. The nightlife of the beach is interesting and good for travellers. Anyone can enjoy the late night concert. In terms of security at night, this beach is good from my point of view. "
Clean Fun Beach with astounding sand sculptures,Great beach with many food options and pubs across the street. They also have a really nice aquarium on the beach. It is cool to see the difference in culture as in no locals in bikinis hahaha. I felt under dressed. 
A window into Korean lifestyle and leisure,"We went on a Saturday afternoon, a lot was going on. It was a great way to see how Koreans enjoy life, the streets around were pumping and several events were happening on the beach. The view is nice, a wide white sandy beach surrounded by skyscrapers and residential areas against the blue water."
Awesome Beach,"I'm from California and I can honestly say that this beach is nicer than any I've ever been to. The water was nice and clear blue, and the beach itself was very clean."
Clean and breezy beach,Full of entertainment. Quite windy during end of spring. Usually crowded from evening until night. Nice place to leisure and relax
좋지요!,Visit here during the winter and you can enjoy the beautiful & peaceful beach. It's too crowded in the summer. 겨울 해운대는 정말 아름답습니다. 너무 춥지도 않구요. 저는 개인적으로 겨울에 가는게 좋을 것 같아요. 여름에 바글바글ㅠㅠ 해수욕 좋아하지 않으신데 가보고 싶다면 겨울을 추천합니다.
Croud,Full of entertainment. Crowded at weekend. Enjoy your summer by swimming there. You will find also a lot of performance and swim shops there.
Day Trip to Haeundae Beach from Cruise Port,"Had one day in Busan during a cruise. Traveling with a family of 4 with teens.One of the most popular summer destinations in South Korea. Haeundae beach attracts tourists from all around the country and gets really overcrowded in late July and early August. Deck chairs and parasols are available to rent. There are numerous hotels including International chains nearby with the Busan Aquarium is on the beach front. Most cruise ships will drop you off downtown near BIFF Square. There is a subway station and tourist information center located in this area.Take the red line. It will take about 45 minutes to reach the Haeundae Station. Walk a short 5 minute walk to the Beach.I suggest renting an umbrella and mat. Especially, if it is hot! Many of the beach goers will also rent an inter tube. Not worth the extra price since it isn't very deep.Note: This is not a surfing or boogie boarding beach. You can only go out approximately 20 yards (up to the bogeys). This must be due to either a rip tide or lack of experienced swimmers since the lifeguards are constantly blowing their whistles and keeping watch to keep you within the designated areas.I am from the California coast and did not notice any dangerous conditions or signs indicating rip currents and would have like to venture further out however, I was stopped many times.Many young locals and tourist all along the beach having fun playing in the water. Many of the local girls are there just to take selfies of themselves. They never seem to leave the umbrellas or go into the water.After spending time at the beach, we walked around the area. Many small shops and restaurants. There is also a street lined with food vendors.Water is nice and warm (July) and the sand is soft. A nice fun time to spend the morning and just splash around and enjoy the gentle waves."
Night swimming,The view of the city once the sun goes down is amazing! You can swim right up to 9pm in a wee section under supervision of the lifeguards.
Awesome beach,"Great, huge beach. When we were there, they had giant bigger-than-life-size sand sculptures on display. We went early in the morning before all the vendors were open. Plenty of places to rinse off, rent umbrellas, etc. A great place to people watch."
Nice Beach,"Beautiful beach! Lot of activities.Strong waves for surfing. Suitable for kids to swim. Many family activities. The beach is always crowded with locals or tourist especially on Summer. Gentle reminder, beach will close @6pm evening. "
"Busy, but delightful","Who knew this was the time when Koreans take their vacation? No worries - plenty of room for all on the beach and it's fun to watch the children at play. Everyone loves the beach, regardless of the language spoken! Easy to rent an umbrella, mat, and/or tube for the day."
Plan accodingly,"We went to the beach during July. It was hot outside but we thought maybe the water would be warm. It was not!! It was ICE cold. The type of temperature that you would use to ice your body from an injury cold. We were only there for an hour. Nice to take pictures. However, I was a little disappointed with the amount of litter that was on the beach and the water. They should a crew to clean more regularly. "
One of Busan highlight,"You can go there by using subway (Line 2 - Haeundae station). The beach is situated just about 800m from the subway station. Quite a number of foreign restaurant (Halal food anyone?) and stalls selling street foods. The view is nice, modern skyscrapers mixed with the background of old village at the hill. Perfect for a short escape from the hectic city life. We visited the beach at the final day in Korea, and yep it was an awesome end for our K-trip."
One of the cleanest beaches in Korea,"Certainly the most crowded beach in Korea, but also the most action and scenery. If you go towards the East side (towards Paradise Casino), the beaches feel a little more secluded/ Also the cleanest, and most properly maintained. Lots of seats and parasols for a reasonable price. Wish there were more beachfront restaurants though."
Good for a beach in Korea,Not the best time to come as the weather was still a little cold. The beach is good in terms of size and there are lots of areas to play around it. Can't really fault it but there isn't anything to ride home about either. I'm sure the parties in Summer go off though.
Funny beach rules,"The beach itself extends over about 1k and during our visit was almost overwhelmed with local tourists with flat conditions. Westerners few and far between. This is not normally an issue as the locals are so welcoming. We found the swimming control oversight very unusual as lifeguards (many in full UV costumes) effectively stopped you entering the water beyond a couple of metres with a line of buoys for their guidance. It felt like locals could not swim (although they certainly drank beer at the waters edge which is far more dangerous potentially!!). You just can't ignore these lifesavers with their whistles, boats and over the top management!The second day in the area we swam early when no locals were around (about 0730) however there was a man on a 4WD blowing his whistle on the beach continuously at us although there were other swimmers further out. We ignored him and he finally left us alone."
Nice place for food hunt,The beach area is cooling and a bit crowded. The area have a lots of good food but open in the evening. There is a street food market as well.
A great beach to visit,"Haeundaue Beach is a classic crescent shaped beach that is a great attraction in Busan. On the land side there are many new hotels and there is an excellent walkway along the beachfront. It is a classically tourist beach with brightly coloured deckchairs and umbrellas organised in rows. The beach is also a ""Smart Beach"" with access to wifi in booths along the walkway. At night the beach looks stunning as it is lit up beautifully and viewed from the harbour end looks great. "
Nice Place!,A clean and nice beach suitable for family and friends! Been here for a visit during a biz trip. Don't forget to apply sun screen before any activity as the weather is very hot!
nice for a day trip,i went at the end of may. the water wasn't too cold and it wasn't too crowded either. there was a sand castle competition going on at that time. the aquarium is along the beach.
Nothing Special,"Compare to the beaches in Bali, this beach is nothing near to the attractiveness level of Beaches in Bali. It is also extremely difficult to catch a taxi around the beach because people do not queue to get a taxi. "
beautiful beach,"walk from dongbaek island park to haeundae, go further towards the aquatic museum, u can see beautiful sand sculptures on the beach. "
Needs a revamp. ,"Not the greatest beach, and the town surrounding is a little run down. Not hip and cool like we thought. A little bit touristy and tacky. Also located at the end of the line so a little bit far away. Dining options were all a little limited and not very inviting. Needs a revamp. Gwangalli beach is a much better options. Prettier, and a lot more modern and on trend. "
Amazing Beach...!! Only Good For summer," Haeundae Beach is one of famous beach in south Korea,u can enjoy if u went this place in summer..!! :)"
Beautiful & Well Managed,This is an amazing beach surrounded by a beautiful city. Totally worth visiting day or night. The beach is clean and well staffed with a lot of lifeguards. There are lots of clean bathrooms and showers. Tons of nice places to eat and drink as well. Very nice and worth a visit if beach going is your thing. 
Sand Castle festival,"A spectacular display of sand castle art. There's a laser light show, concerts on the beach and on the stage across the street. ATV obstacle course, sand sledding, free give aways and surfing. "
Long stretch of beach with good food around ,It was cloudy when we visited Haeundae so it was sad that I can't see the beautiful blue sky with blue water reflecting off sunray. But the wet weather did not dampen our spirit! The water was chilly and we still had a lot of fun! 
Clean beach with lots of people,"The beach is really clean. The sand is not as fine as other beaches I've been in South East Asia but definitely clear waters! It's summer now and the water is cold! Most Koreans visit the beach and dip in the water with friends taking lots of selfies. You can rent a Beach Umbrella and relax. An interesting experience, it tends to get foggy! By 5pm on that day of my visit there is a speed boat guarding the sealine pushing people back to shore. Also an announcement in English to get out of water as visibility dips. Definitely a safety precaution well executed and in my opinion something that happens frequently?"
Nice beach ,My husband and I love walking on this beach and drinking at the restaurant near by. WE enjoy swimming and tanning here. It wasn't crowded. Quite and relaxing.
Beautiful but busy.,Haeundae beach is lovely long expanse of sand that is beautiful in every season but it is super busy and crowded with the rented umbrellas in the hot summer month. There is an amazing cloud that sneaks in from the ocean and curves onto the hill into the tall buildings. I prefer walking here in the winter. 
Only Visit during Summer!,We were there in April and it was still really cold. Would definitely recommend people to visit during summer time. There were many shops and markets nearby the beach as well.
Just alright ,"Coming from Australia and having grown up near the Gold Coast, Haeundae beach is far from impressive. However it is a nice place to relax for the afternoon, as it's spacious and clean with a good atmosphere"
Winter In Busan,"Was there with family and it was quite cold during winter but we had a nice walk nearby the beach , we took a cab to the beach because initially wasn't too sure where it was but it was quite near to where we stayed, and there was Sea Life Aquarium nearby and we walked from here until Nurimaru APEC House.Along the way we stopped by Dongbaek Island where there was a mermaid statue. As we walked a long we could also see the Gwangan Bridge from far and we took a cab back to our apartment."
Best place for relax,"If u plan to visit Busan, Korea for a relax trip I strongly recommend here! Haeundae !Firstly because of the beach, it have a very long white sandy beach and very clear water here, i never thought the beach just in the cities can be so clean ! Second u can get a lot of restaurants and bar in this area, pls come here on weekends! It is very happening, the whole street was young people chill around ! Also, the hotel here is a lot a lot , very sure u can have the best one here ! If u love seafood there is a lot of stall just in front the beach and almost every stall have the fix price for u to choose. Best place to holiday, I will revisit !!"
Good beach with a lot of entertainment ,"It's good, clean enough beach. With blue water and yellow sand. There are a lot of different cafes, Busan aquarium. On weekends and almost every evening U can watch concerts and artist performances. "
Average Beach polluted with tourists,There were way too many chinese tourists on the beach and there was nothing much to see. There are some stalls nearby and market worth going to that might be a better time well spent.
Beautiful,"I know why this beach is famous now. Unfortunately I went here during winter and the coldest time of the year. We just strolled around to take a look before we went to the aquarium to get heated up again. But would loved to stay in summer and take a swim. Perfect location with amazing surroundings close to other attractions and restaurants and shops. Will defenitely come back, and it is defenitely a must when visiting Busan. "
Nice beach cold water,"This is a beautiful beach with many activities that you can do for free. Beautiful walking path and at night they have free entertainment. Such as musicians of all varieties, Comedy shows, fire eaters. "
Haeundae Beach,"I decided to go to check out the beach for the weekend. I ended up having a great time. Unfortunately, the weather wasn't cooperating as it rained the entire time I was there. Due to the weather, it wasn't too busy on the beach, but I made the best of it. There are several restaurants, hotels and other places to hang out. They also have the Busan aquarium there for those who would like to visit. Overall, it was a great time and if you are considering going, you would not be disappointed. Take your beach towel and sunscreen."
4th of July ,"It is an awesome beach place to enjoy time away from reality life ect... many choices of restaurants of all kind and entertainment too as you can see from pictures. Although it was raining season in July ""for real July!"" It is definitely worth coming again when sunny lol."
well managed but over priced food,We visited the beach and near by shops. Beach was a good size and clean but near by restaurant was too over priced for very small portion. I can compare two to three people portion of meat might be similar to one person's portion in US. Very disappointed. 
Overrated,"The beach was rated as traveler's choice for 2016 so I had to visit out of curiosity. I guess I expected breathtaking views since the ratings are so high. I was a bit disappointed by how average the beach was. It may be because I've visited the Caribbean several of times or I visited during the rainy season. But it honestly looks like any other typical beach. Nothing breathtaking or spectacular about it. If you live nearby then go for it. But if you are far, I would not recommend traveling so far to see this average beach. On the upside, there are many authentic delicious restaurants nearby. "
Beach was what the doctor ordered.,Checking out the beach was great. It wasn't too busy and lots of places to hang out. Too bad the weather was cool otherwise I would of swam in the water. 
Beautiful Beach ,"Perfect beach for hanging out. People are friendly and the sun was hot! Beach chairs and umbrella were 24,000 ₩ for 8 hours, talked the vendor down to 20,000₩. Fought off the fog monster twice."
Nice and Relaxing Beach,"This beach is very wide and it's nice to take a stroll here. My friend and I happen to stay nearby and visited this beach twice, during morning and night, this place is always popular with people. A very nice place to hangout with friends and enjoy the sea breeze. We did not catch the sunrise during our stay, but have heard that it could be really nice."
Awesome :) Depends on when you visit,"We stayed in Busan 3 days before weekend and 2 days weekend (nearing summer).There is a huge difference. Please are a lot less during the weekday and weekend by Friday night the beach was starting to get some read crowdsPros:- Plenty of smart beach booth so you don't need to run around sandy and wet from sea water- Plenty of shops and tiny food stall opened nearby- There is almost always some people hanging out at the beach - Dogs are a common sight at the beach - Most activity happening during the weekend (boxing match, DJ beach party, fireworks, sand sculpturing)"
Not overly impressed,"Visited the beach recently not overly impressed did not think that the water was too clean, there was also a tractor pushing sand back from the shore which generated a lot of dust. There was also a great deal of repairs being done to the pavement along the road that leads to the beach which added to the dust.I had high hopes but was dissapointed."
Wide beach,A beautiful wide beach that you would not want to miss. It's a rather quiet and less crowded beach compare to Gwangalli beach. I prefer Haeundae beach than Gwangalli beach over its wide and open view without any blocking. 
Fantastic beach clean,Great beach nice sand like Australia beaches. Water nice clean good for swimming close to subway bus 131 from busan station close to coffee shops food outlets
A must go at night ,"We went to the beach quite late at night, around 11pm and it was still busy. There were people singing like street artist and making magic shows. Lots of young people gathered and hang out. A must go if you like beach life and entertainment shows. "
Beautiful,"Four day trip and we stayed in front of haeundae beach. There are a lot of things to do nearby and also many places to eat and drink. Definitely recommend visiting! Try to avoid driving too much as there's always some traffic in the area, best to take the subway "
Beautiful beach close to famous hotels and restaurants,"I like Haeundae Beach especially because I don't need a car here because so many hotels and restaurants are close to here. So If I arrive here, I don't need to rent a car or ride a bus for a few days! Beautiful beach and awesome Dongbaek Island and delicious food makes this place one of the hottest place in South Korea!"
An ordinary beach,"Just an okay beach, nothing very special. Nice to enjoy a breeze. Quite crowded in summer, especially on weekends."
Not impressed ,We wanted to see the famous Haeundae beach after seeing it so many Korean dramas. I really was not impressed when we got there. I'm surprised they let people leave trash everywhere around the shops leading to the beach. Since it's a tourist place they should keep it clean. There were not much people at the beach when we got there so it was good.
Average urban beach,A sort of copa-cabana in Korea. But the weather was bad and the water very dark. Nice too see but for a Portuguese nothing special. Worth a visit/walk because it is a fashy area of Busan but that is it...
Ok Beach,"We went mid June which initially I thought would be sunny and fully packed. However, the weather was pretty chilly still and hence the beach was quite deserted although there were a few brave soul frolicking in the water. The beach is clean and easy to find. There were not much activity when we were there, and hence it was just strolling and taking in the view. SEA LIFE Busan Aquarium was along the beach and could be another option to visit when you are there."
"Great not only for the beach, but also the glitters","My favorite place in all of Busan. First of all, the beach. Simply huge and beautiful, very inviting to go swimming or just rest there. There are some limitations regarding swimming and it gets very crowded in the summer, but if you manage to avoid peak season, it shouldn't be much of an issue. In addition to the beach, theenvironment is great, as you can take a quick walk to Dongbaekseom or Dalmaji Park. So the park doesn't feel like it's being stuffed in the city. That being said, if you're into big cities and tall buildings, you'll find yourself right at home. The waterfront is loaded with tall buildings, with brand new skyscrapers recently completed or underway (Marine City, LCT The Sharp...). It overall feels very dynamic, cosmopolitan and festive. The streets behind the beach are full of nice restaurants and bars. With the beach, nature, food options, and skyscrapers, you can easily spend an entire day there without getting bored. The best time to visit would be during the Film Festival, as the beach will have a Cannes-like feel and events to promote the festival."
Great urban beach,This is by far the best beach in Busan. It is right next to the city and subway and has bars and restaurants right next to the sand. The beach is clean and has a team of people keeping it tidy all day. There are lifeguards all along the beach and it has chairs and parasols to rent for a fair price. Also my favorite addition is the ladies who sell beer and fried chicken!!!
Beautiful beach,The beach was pack with a lot of tourists and college kids which was a little of a detractor but understandable. At night tbe bridge is lit up and has an amazing view from anywhere on the beach. Make Sure to bring a good camera
"Nice beach, should come in summer","This among the best beach in Korea. I come here during winter, dont have much time to be there since the temperature very cold. But definitely i will be enjoying thing if come during summer."
Haeundae Beach,"Beautiful beach, long and sandy, visited in June not crowded as summer, walking along with beach to the end is Westin Hotel, which accessible to Apec House within walking distance. Nice scene for jogging along the beach to Apec House."
The place to be in Busan,"It's sort of like an Asian Riviera but nicer really and not as pretentious. Great clean safe beach and surfing at times. Great variety of foods and accommodation options. Trust me, you'll love it."
Beautiful beach to stroll ,"Came in April and weather was too cold to enjoy a swim. However we walked the beach several times a day. Nice view, plenty of small places to have an exotic lunch and a lot of people enjoying life. There is an aquarium in the centre of the beach. We did not try but it was told to be exciting for children. In the far end it is an open fish-market where they can prepare the seafood for lunch if you like."
Packed beach,"I came here during weekend and there was festival held there. This beach was packed with tourist and local. However, there were many performance along the beach that will entertain your tired soul."
Nice beach,"We know sand festivals end at 6 of june... but luckily see some of it during 8 of june. Eat the nice pork rice soup as breakfast around here and only cost 5,000 won with so many slices of pork meats...also have a aquarium here but very expensive entrance fee."
