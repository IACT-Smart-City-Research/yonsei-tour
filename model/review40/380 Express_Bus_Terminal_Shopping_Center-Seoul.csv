Express Bus Terminal Seoul,"The area is mostly full of ladies stuffs and other home decorations, accessories etc.. I went during Autumn and the clothes are cheap. You can also find other things there and it was a good experience."
Excellent Shopping Place,"Convenient and accessible. Located at Express Bus Terminal station, exit 8. Love this place, neverending shops. Bought a few stuff from there. Suitable for females only. "
shopping cebter,"There are many shops and mostly selling ladies clothes, shoes, accessories and beauty product. Prices are comparable if not cheaper then Myeondong though atmosphere is not comparable. There are also phone accessories shops as well as food outlets. "
Recommended for women's clothing ,"I personally enjoyed shopping here more than the Hongdae shopping street (for women's clothing). There are two long rows of shops parallel to each other selling lots of affordable women's aparrel and jewellery. Not exactly premium top-class items, but decent quality for the prices. Did not see any menswear but I did not manage to explore the whole length of stores. It's a good shopping option for a rainy day and there are a couple of food options located at the end of the indoor shopping street. "
Six days in seoul,"Actually this is the second time in Seoul, but this time me go shopping in express bus terminal underground , really its good experience , good quality, cheap, we enjoyed so much there, everybody whom visit Seoul should go there."
Endless shopping but a better experience on weekdays,"Endless rows of shopping for everyone including shoes, clothes, accessories, spectacles, household stuff, food, anything! I made the mistake of coming here on a Saturday and ended up having to jostle elbow to elbow with people with or without trolleys. Beware of wheels! This is directly connected to Shinsegae Department Store, Shinsegae Duty Free, and JW Marriott hotel so its quite the weather proof activity which can be a god-send when you are caught unprepared. Mostly for ladies though, didnt see alot of men's stuff around."
Great Shopping Place for Ladies Clothing,"There are many many shops in this shopping area and most shops offer very reasonably priced female clothing. To me, it's the best place to shop for clothing & accessories compared to myeong dong, Ewha Womans University shopping, namdaemun market and dongdaemun shopping district! You can give a miss to all other shopping area but not this one, especially if you're looking for fashion wear!"
"Chanel, Hermes and more . . .","There's not an upscale retailer which is not represented, though one may have to wait in line to get into the store. In addition, Shinsegae has a large store with an exceptional food market in the basement."
Visit if you have time,This is a large underground shopping area with many shops selling clothes and accessories. We find that the shops sell similar things and the vendors are not friendly. Visit only if you have time.
You should come here before doing any shopping in Myeongdong,"If the purpose of your trip is to shop clothes in Myeongdong, you should come here first.The same item can be 30-80% cheaper than myeongdong or other tourist area."
Adequate and out of the weather ,I did some souvenir and gift shopping last weekend when the rain was pouring down and i didn’t wanna stay in my flat all day. I took the Metro No. 9 express line (fantastic!) from VHS station and arrived at Express Bus Terminal very quickly. I wandered around underground and found everything i needed at reasonable prices. Its not the best in town but all in all it checked all the boxes.
Mostly Ladies Boutiques,"2nd visit here. Mostly ladies boutiques, others like socks, HP covers, shoes, cosmetics, men clothes etc. It's basically 2 rows of shops parallel to each other, walk 1 side then u-turn & walk the other side.Somewhere u will find a bread shop, the corn cheese bread is yummy! this underground shopping is link to Shinsegae shopping mall. Good to shop here when weather is too cold to stay outdoor at nite."
Lost ! Lots !,"This place has changed a lot since I was there at least 3-4 years ago. It's brighter but more confusing. First, the there may be exits to the subway which you need to exit twice. That's mainly because express bus terminal stations is an interchange (bus and subways) with many lines. The upgrades and restructure of the underground space caused all this weird exits and the signs did not always direct you completely. Eg. I was looking out for exit 3 and along the way, that signage was lost... I had to base on my intuition and memory to navigate out.. worrying if I may end up entering the station twice and paid again. Once you get out of the confusing subway exits, you should walk within the underground shopping street. The place is crowded with people but well organized. You could also consider shopping in the mall area (where Shinsegae is). There are shops there that offer direct tax free discount with freebies if you bring along your passport and your flight (out of Seoul/Korea) itinerary for their input into the system and verification. This saves you time in the airport, hunting and waiting for those tax-refund machines."
Express Bus Terminal Shopping Center,"There are a few indoor shopping, dining center in the city that I get to appreciate more especially during winter when taking my two yr old son around.Around the Gangnam area is the Coex and the Express Bus Terminal. The EBT’s greatest strength comes from all-in-one compound nature of it where the Bus terminal that virtually goes anywhere inland, Shinsegye Department Store known to be the most profitable in the country, and the five star JW Marriot hotel and the duty-free shop all being connected without a need to step outside.During the weekend esp. on Saturdays, the traffic jam can be absolute disaster because everyone around constantly always wants or have needs to come to the area so I would recommend taking the subway to get here"
Haha are we even in Korea?,"More tourists than locals especially from China and HK that anything else here. Rows and rows of shops selling similar stuff, all at reasonable prices and designs.You’ll see things repeated in shops as you browse through more. Don’t expect to find great quality items here but if you want a cheap thrill and have time to kill, this is the place for you.Express bus terminal station, exit 8. The stuff here is Sicilian to Hongdae or Ewha. In the end, all the same."
Loving it ,"I love this place so much. Got lots of my bags, made from Korea at 10000won per piece. Good quality and nice designs. There's so many things to see, clothing, shoes and etc just like what you can get and see at myeongdong but of course the prices are much cheaper here. One might get lost in finding this underground though is stated as express bus underground shopping. Just ask around and many kind people will guide you. As I, too lost my way and found it while just walking around the underground. You will love the place "
Shopping and food,"It's a very big station with lot of shops selling clothes, handphone assesories etc. mostly have shops selling the same stuff. Doesn't seem that we can bargain here although some said it was possible. There is a Japanese eatery which serves pretty nice food for the low price. Can easily get lost inside if you are not familiar with place. Crowded. Toilets are located inside which require a distance to walk. At different corners of the underground place."
Huge underground complex!,"You can spend hours under here shopping for cheap clothes, decor items and even some furniture. I'd highly recommend coming here but come during the afternoon, not when it opens at 10am because that's when most of the stores start to open up, not when they are all open up by."
Cheap Finds!,"Forget about going to large departmental stores when you are in Seoul. Instead, head to budget shopping areas like this to get your cheap clothings. The prices here are so much cheaper than average stores in Seoul but make sure you look around the entire place first before deciding if you should get your hands on that pretty dress hanging on the rack as products here are generally similar and you should compare prices before making your purchase."
Hundreds of stalls of clothes,"This is the place to shop for fashionable but inexpensive clothes. As soon as you step out off the train station, you will be overwhelmed by all the stalls that display fashionable Korean clothes. You can spend an entire day here shopping. If you have the money. "
Cheap deal! ,"Always come here for good deals, most clothes are 10,000 won even pants! Fashionable and trendy apparels at good price , some even with good quality, good buy. When you are tired you can go to the end of the corridor and there are good fares, don forget to try the really hot and spicy ddeokboki and fish cake soup! Yum "
Lots of options,"So much here. Plenty of restaurants, shopping, access to buses and the subway. Great central meeting point in Seoul"
Be strategic !,"There are many stores but in the end, they are selling more or less the same thing. I focus on clothing section only. Don't have high expectations but it's an interesting experience to search for good bargain and negotiate with the aunties staff. Better wear a facial mask cause the place is packed not only with tourists but also local housewives."
One of the better place for shopping!,"I find the shopping experience here much more pleasant than in Dongdaemun. It is indoors, so it is ideal when it gets too hot or too cold outside. Price-wise, it seems to be cheaper than other place, with mixture of local-made and imported ones from neighbouring country. At start, it was abit hard to find my way as the area is large.. I managed to get some food at the end after getting tired from shopping. Hence for shopping experience, it is 4/5 in my opinion~"
Nice place,Not a big one. Still one of the best places to buy cheap clothes. Goto Mall is better than this mall. 
A Must shop place for ladies,"Similar to taipei railway station underground shopping area. Lots of cheap causal clothing, shoes and bags for ladies. Trendy and you will be spoilt for choices. However, not many business wear or blazer for working. "
The underground shopping mall,"We visited this shopping mall twice as we wanted to get shelter due to the rain. Not really a big underground mall but it has whatever you need. Clothes, shoes, accessories, makeup products and eateries. The prices of the apparel I won't say its very cheap neither too expensive. Prices are comparable to those you get find it in Myeondong. Can visit this mall if you have the time."
Shopping paradise,"A superb place to shop for cheap and trendy clothes, bags and shoes. Indeed it is never ending shopping. It is a long stretch underground shopping. Definitely creates a great shopping activity. We went there twice but still isn’t enough for us. Strongly recommend for fashion shoppers. "
Great shopping experience ,This is like a never ending stretch of shopping mall next to the train station. Will take about 4 hours at least to walk the entire stretch without really browsing at shops. You can buy everything here and no need to go to Dongdaemun. The shops here have reasonable prices and good range of designs. Must visit for every trip I have to Seoul. 
highly recommend for shopping!!,"this place is sooooo.. awesome! looking for a place to shop? Well I definitely recommend this place if you love shopping! but you need the whole day or even more...there's a lot of good offers from clothing and korean make up...this is literally shop till you drop..its left and right! So, you better eat first but then there are restaurants as well that you can stop by to have some quick snacks or coffee...but it's a bit far from the airport..took like more than an hour if you take the metro...aside from that....!!! it's all worth it! will definitely come back here again!"
