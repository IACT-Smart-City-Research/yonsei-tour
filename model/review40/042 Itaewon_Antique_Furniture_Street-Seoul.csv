Heaven to someone into antiques,Its a place where my mom likes to bring me to walk around. Huge collection from furnitures to antique electronics. You may find some great deals on things that were discontinued decades ago!
"If you're into antiques, this is heaven.","Antiques galore. There's nothing you can't find if you look hard enough, The whole street is lined with antique stores, and it's a two minute walk from the main street which has restaurants, cafes and clubs. "
A lot of antiques !!,I bumped into these streets in Itaewon during their October Antique week There were nearly 50 merchants on the street showing their wares. I spend a while afternoon walking the stores the next day. Very friendly and very interesting to see how Korea looks at some of our antiques.
Worth a visit,"We were on a business trip so didn't plan on picking up a table and chairs but the shops were great and I love the old stuff . I'm sure like all old places they hike the prices for the Faranges but who cares , Lovely reception in each place no hard sell , even got water in one place. Just down from the Hamilton hotel. If you like old stuff then this is for you . Take your time and browse"
Lovely antiques street to browse,This street starts close to Itaewon's main street so it's easy to find and is a quaint lovely area to browse through. Most of the antiques are of western origin but it makes complete sense when you take into account the country's past - foreign soldiers were stationed there.
Smells of old furniture ,If you're into antique really old stuff this place is for you not far from the station at Exit 2 or 3 and you'll be there it's full of really cool antique stuff like Furniture jewelry pretty much anything ancient and antique definitely check it out it may be expensive but worth taking pictures of. 
Love the vibe and feel,This area is the antique hub of seoul. It sells all sorts of antiques from clothes to vintage records and bags. If only I could buy some to take home. Some of the pieces are quite heavy since they are furniture. 
Antique ,"Located couple streets behind the main one. Some cool and old stuff to buy but like almost anything in Itaewon, it is overpriced. "
2 houses with a lot of old stuff to sell in their yard,"Avoid. Unless into regular streets with a lot of old stuff on display for selling. Also, there were only 2 houses doing that. I might have been there at the wrong time though (6 pm)."
Bustling steer ,A bustling and busy street with many international and middle eastern restaurants. I highly recommend visiting this street
I stayed in this neighborhood ,"With my dog. We walked it everyday and night. It's not a ghetto at all, but a street with lovely old antique shops on both sides. Most of the antiques are from soldiers who bought while they were stationed there, then sold when their tour ended. There are some beautiful things, but not really Korean things. It starts one block off Iteawan's main street so its easy to get to. Its also just around the corner from Rodeo dr which is another cute place to stroll and grab a Korean bite to eat with the locals."
Great place,"Oh, this is a perfect place for a foreigner to buy all the gifts and have a good meal.I will not hide from you, this is not the most cheepest place, but Itaewon has a lot of authentic gifts to choose from"
The ghetto,Not sure how to say this except not worth the trip... pretty much was stepping into the ghetto. There was nothing to see or buy and the smell in some of the streets was just horrid.
Wasn't my cup of tea,Was expecting a lot more Korean antiques but nooooooooooooIt was rather disappointing for me cause I was expecting to see Korean antiquesI heard they r beautiful but damn....plus.google.com/u/4/dashboardvisit my blog for more sight seeing in korea
Bit disappointing. Only European antiques,Walked around the antique street today. The positives are that it is in a spacious area unlike most antique markets across the world. This was started when the Europeans were selling their furniture etc when they left the country so if you are looking for Asian antiques this is not the place for you. And if you have been to Europe this will seem overpriced. Also the shop owners do not want to share the history of the piece so it's quite disappointing. Note that the market is closed on Sundays
I love antiques!,"I was here on the 2nd week of November 2013. I appreciate the long street full of nice antique pieces. Yes, antiques are pricey. But I believe it is worth it. I wish I have the courage to buy and have one shipped back to Manila, but i dont have a place for anymore additional furniture. It is worth a visit. Put it on top of your itinerary."
Don't go if looking for Asian antiques..,"Don't go if looking for Asian antiques. The street is filled with antique shops but mainly ""western"" (US and British) items from families of nearby US military bases. No Korean or Chinese antiques."
One of many Seoul visits over past 42 years.,This area is purely European antique style. Did not see a single Korean antique shop. Why would I come to Seoul to buy that? Seemed pretty odd to me.
