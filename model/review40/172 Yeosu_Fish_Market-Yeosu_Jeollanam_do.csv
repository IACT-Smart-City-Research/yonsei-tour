It’s a fish market,"We came here. It’s a pretty typical Korean fish market. Lots of fish. Also other things (fruits, vegetables, meat, nuts, textiles, etc). Nothing special. Nothing wrong with it. We tried to go to a nearby eel place - but they were grilling with charcoal in an enclosed space with no ventilation. Amazing!"
Can't get any fresher than this,"We went to the fish market, picked a fresh fresh, and had it sashimi-ed. All of the vendors pretty much charge the same price and no room for haggle. For one flat fish, we paid about $30 CAD. They give you the sashimi and all the left overs for making soup, which either they take it up for you or you take it with you to the restaurant number they give you. The cost to have the soup cooked for you plus the set-up fee is about $15 for two people. All in-all, it was a pretty cool Korean experience. The restaurant we ended up at wasn't as friendly, but the lady who prepared the sashimi was awesome. The people are known to be a rough in the fish market - be aware. "
Awesome fish market in Yeosu!,Dropped by the market to see some fresh fish and seafood. Numerous vendors selling all kinds of fishes. Decided to order some raw fish from a vendor. They prepare your fish right at the spot then you can take the prepared raw fish upstairs where you will find tables to eat them. It does not get any more fresh than this.
A great morning at the fish market.,We arrived pretty early in the morning. Markets are my idea of fun--wandering through interesting booths and all. The morning auction began and that was a complete fun time. We got to watch merchants signal their bids for the fish. It was great!
Extensive and exotic,"Fish sales people are amazingly friendly, and want you to try their products. Oxtopus legs, still squirming. How many varieties of fish are there?? Take your time for an hour or two!"
Challenging but great fun!,"We were taken to Yeosu fish market by our Korean friends so it is hard to give an accurate review of the experience as English tourists on our own. First impressions were completely alien-everything is still alive and swimming around (many of the beasties we'd never seen before) Once we'd made a decision as to what we wanted to try, they were fished out of their tanks and killed right in front of you with incredible speed and accuracy. We then took what we'd bought to one of the many restaurants above the market, where the idea is that you inform the kitchen staff how you want each thing prepared. Luckily we had Koreans with us who knew what they were doing because otherwise we wouldn't have had a clue. While we waited we were sat around a traditional low table (one of the reasons the rating dropped a star was that as westerners we found it really uncomfortable to sit on the floor for so long) and served the ubiquitous kimchee and plums. They brought each course out as it was ready, starting with scallops, clams and raw fish which you wrap yourself in lettuce and sesame leaves with the traditional chilli sauce. Next came huge tiger prawns, fried Hake (millions of bones beware...but there is a magnificent trick of how to expertly remove them with chopsticks if you can find someone to show you how) To finish off we were served a really spicy soup made from all the pieces of fish left over after preparation (including tails,fins,heads,eyeballs) We found it delicious, despite not being the biggest seafood fans. This was all washed down with gallons of 'Somak' - a glass of beer mixed with Soju, very tasty. The waitresses were very hospitable and attentive without being smothering, and the locals enjoyed seeing foreign faces (as usual!)"
