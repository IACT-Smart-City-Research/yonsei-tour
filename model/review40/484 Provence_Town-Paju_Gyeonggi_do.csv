Another French Town inspired.,"If you are a fan of KDrama, this will be a familiar sight. Other than Le Petit Town, Provence Town is another option. When I came here, it feels like Christmas is all year round. :)"
Quite Romantic in the night,well if you are Asians and never been to western country this place might be quite interesting for you. but if you ever visit Europe for example this place is not really interesting. only like European theme with Christmas tree every where.
Nothing Special !,"Being from North America I found this place is not an attraction at all. Unfortunately, this is one of the stop on our day tour ( I think this place is one of the setting for a famous Korean drama). To kill time, we stay in the nearby coffee shop - not the one inside the town."
Picturesque shopping complex,"Provence Town virtually has nothing to do with Southern France. This place is mainly clusters of shops selling fashion and aromatic products, eateries and bakery, all one storey buildings, in pastel colours. Fashion and accessories are quite pricey in terms of the quality. There are also beautiful murals outside these buildings. The picturesque setting is good for photoshooting as well as a stroll on a sunny day. Just 5 minutes' drive away from Heryi Art Village."
