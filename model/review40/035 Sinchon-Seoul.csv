The typical Seoul live,Sinchon is an area with less to non foreigner. You just have the typical korean restaurants and people will look at you like you got lost. It was an interessting experience and this part of the city is nice as well
High vibe,I enjoy this area very much. Relaxing. Nice street and cute places. Very pleasant to see young people all around. Shops are bustling. But yet it is so relax to shop. 
Nice place during the weekend.,"You can visit this area any day of the week but on the weekend, the metropolitan government closes the main street of Sinchon in order to let pedestrians to have more space. Moreover, street performers and musicians come to Sinchon and they take the streets of Sinchon to give their audience a good spectacle. There really nice restaurants, coffee shops, ""norebangs"" Korean Karaoke and of course a shopping mall.Very close to Sinchon is one of the most famous Universities in South Korea. Yonsei University has its main campus across the street and you can go there and check the facilities without the need of a student card."
Pleasant surprise,"We went to this area in search of a specific shop and ended up at a street that was closed off from car traffic. It offered restaurants, shopping and really cool street performance (similar as Hongdae). We actually ended up listening to opera which was cool. Wouldn’t spent a whole day here, but definitely a couple of hours. "
The real University area in Seoul,"Of those many campus business areas in Seoul, this is one of the best for University students, I think. It's not as touristic as Hongdae. But, also good to visit for tourists.- There are malls, shops, pubs, restaurants, noraebangs, houses for studio rooms, etc.- Prices are definitely cheaper than business areas for office workers like Gangnam.- The road to the main gate of Yonsei University from Sinchon Station is a great blvd. with cherry blossoms.- It's really crowded if there's any event like Yeongojeon(The sports week against Korea University).- The campus of Yonsei University is beautiful, too.- Sinchon is also close from Seogang University and Ihwa Women's Univerity. Hongdae is a bit away to walk."
A place to grab a drink and see how college students are like here,"Just walk around the district and enjoy the college atmosphere.Since students are fluent in English, do not hesitate to ask someone to help to find best bars and restaurants."
Great place,Visited Sinchon on our last night in Seoul. It’s a great place to shop and dine. Not so crowded as Myeongdong. Lots of dining choices. Love the live performances at night
Shopping malls and Cosmetic shops,the underground of Sinchon subway can walk to another shopping mall and department stores with different exit ways. 
Modern life of korean youngsters,"The area is very energetic, plenty of cafes, restaurants, ""love"" motels, clubs & bars, shopping etc... However the main attraction is people ~ stylish Koreans, foreign student ~ absolutely lovely"
Hidden Night Life After Midnight,"Around Sinchon you can find a strip of street food, bars, clubs, traditional restaurants, and arcades. It's perfect if you want to avoid foreigners, mostly locals in this area. Although a great selection things to do late at night, there tends to be a lot of S. Koreans drinking beyond their limit to blow off work steam and consequently friends carrying each other home. Completely, safe, but not best environment for a romantic stroll nor to bring young kids."
An amazing and cool area on Seoul,"Lots of people, restaurants, bars, pubs, there are 4 universities around so Sinchon is always packed with young cheerful crowd. the proximity of Hongdae makes it a perfect spot for meeting friends, clubing, eating out, and just chilling. the atmosphere is great, it's safe, pretty affordable and simply cool."
Food Paradise,"It is just near the Ewha University, you can just easily combine two places in a walking distance. This place is more a place for searching food than shopping. Lots of restaurants could be found in the area."
Enjoyed ,"We visited sinchon station for a dinner at Jyoti Indian restaurant and look around upplex . It was nice and enjoyed the vibrant vibe of sinchon . You may find great curry restaurant , shopping cosmetics and clothes . "
Good location for solo travellers,"What I love:-lots of guesthouses. Perfect choice for solo travellers-universities nearby. Surround yourself with young, hip and energetic people.-accessible by nearby subway stations and bus stops-going to and from the Incheon Airport is easy using the 6002 bus. -restaurants and street food vendors are everywhere. Never be hungry. -street performers come out at night-make-up and skincare stores are all over but not as crowded as Myeongdong"
Vibrant mix,"Getting to Sinchon is fast and easy. This is a place with many stores (including department stores), places to eat and to hang out. There's many activities out on the streets as well. Take the rest of the day and hang out in Hongdae which is close by!"
Cool Play Bus!,"There are many retail shops and restaurants in Sinchon area. And guess what I found here? A Play Bus!!! How interesting a bus parked in the shopping square. This bus converted into a music club, DJ booth and reading area. I wish they have all the latest Kpop music. It is pretty cool to check it out though if you are shopping in the area."
Same as Ewha,"There's just so much you can buy here because of the affordable prices! You will be able to see many shops selling similar design of clothes and bags and shoes in other places but much more expensive. But here, price is good! Street food is good too:)) but prepare to walk and walk and walk as this place is long and big. Remember to exercise self-control too!"
"Sinchon is Ehwa Womans Uni, Ehwa Womans Uni is Sinchon","Basically, Ehwa Womans Uni is located in Sinchon and the shopping street outside the university. Just take the subway to Ehwa Womans Uni and Sinchon is within walkable distance. Prepare 3 hours for this area as it is long and a lot of shops and stalls to visit."
Was just so-so,"I was looking forward to Sinchon but I have to admit I was abit bored here. The shopping didn’t really appeal to me as there were more shopping malls opposed to small quirky shops, and I much prefer the selection at the streets over at Edae. Lots of food places and drinking holes. This seems to be a place that comes alive only at night as a lot of the eateries etc weren’t open when we were there (around lunchtime) and seems more catered to a younger demographic/students etc."
Nice place for night hopping,"Likes Hongdae, this place is vibrant at night. There are lot of food stalls, but less crowded. You can enjoy walking in the road, listen to street live music or watch some street magician. We spend around 2-3 hour here"
Sinchon,"Lots of restaurants and shopping places around here. Riding Subway Line 2, is can go straight to Hongik Univ., Gangnam and Jamsil. Sinchon is famous for all the motels and hotels to stay "
Wow!,"So many choices for food and shopping. Found an arcade my young son enjoyed, would love to visit later in the night.. looks like it would be fun. "
Vibrant and happening young adult place ,"We booked an airbnb guesthouse si I stayed for 8 days. I haven't been to other parts of Seoul so I can't really compare. Sinchon is compact and an young person haven, a university town sort of. Young people walk here and there, cosmetics shops aplenty, (but then this is kr) and many cheap eateries abound. Hyundai shopping centre was fantastic, the food basement even better than takashimaya back home. There's a daiso so quite a lot of shopping options. It has a young person vibe I guess. "
Cozy & Colourful,"This place is pretty popular among youngsters. Many university around this area, most popular is Ewha Women's University, my friend said this place became shooting location of some music video clip & film. Hotel & backpacker hostels also quite cheap. If you are fashion lovers, you definately must visit Sinchon where you can find many funky clothes, shoes, bags etc with student price. Cafes, clubs, bars, street foods & restaurants are in every corner. If you are an explorer you may find some hidden fabolous spots. I would say this place is never sleep :)"
Happening place,"With heaps of restaurants, cafes and shops, Sinchon is a very happening place. Affordable lunch and dinner options. Great place to grab cheap eats. Norebang or singing rooms and bars are plentiful. Also has plenty of guesthouses around the area. "
Sinchon is party place!,I love this area primary because it has the best chicken place in the city! Everything is open all night and has so many options! The entire streets are filled with everything you might possibly need to do at night! Mainly has a wide variety of bars and eating places.
Great place for low price meals!,"If you are a traveller with budget, this is a great place to look out for. I had korean bbq buffet (but can't rem the restaurant name) with a wide spread of cooked and uncooked food for only around 10000won! You judge on the price if its affordable! There are more affordable priced food around as well... Hunger your stomach and start to take your pick! ✌ "
Perfect place for youngster :D,"I spent 2 weeks of my winter holiday staying at Sky Gositel located in this area. The guesthouse price is very very cheap, and the area is full of campus student from 2 nearby university. There are a lot of place to hangout, especially at night. :P. Definitely will stay in this area again for my next visit"
Another shopping area in Seoul,"There are a lot of shops selling clothing, accessories and cosmetics in Sinchon. The targeted group would be for the young people but visitors can also shop for goods with reasonable price at Sinchon."
College girls celebrate,"As a young college students, this is where i like to go for shopping and strolling along the city street. Super good places to eat and grab soccer. Hongdae is 2 subways stops near by."
Foodies haven,Lots of good restaurants here with cheap but mouthwatering food! you should come with an empty stomach and a full wallet!
Place of sightseeing!,"I like the cafe on the corner of exit 1 , and the shop around this area are quite good, lots of cafe and shops"
Beautiful Yongsei University Campus,"Said to be one of the most beautiful university campuses in Seoul, the reality is even more beautiful. Set against the fall foliage, the University grounds were alit in orange, brown, red colours. The campus is large and has many buildings. If you are tired of shopping in Seoul, this is the perfect place to soak up some fresh air and clear your mind. It is just a 10-min walk from Sinchon subway station."
"My fave place! For those who like the nightlife, accessibility and shopping!","Whenever we are in Korea, the husband and I make it a point to stay here. There are eateries open till late, and this is the mid-point between Hongdae and Edae which are easily accesible by walking. If you look close enough, there is good food to be found at student prices! A good mix of fast food, restaurants, street food and cafes. Some cafes offer a 50% discount if you take-out your americano/espresso/other beverages. This place is brimming with stylish students due to it's strategic location near a few universities. There is a department store at the main junction for those who prefer their branded goods, and also some established retail brands in the vicinity. I love that this place opens till late, so it's easy to grab a bite on the way back to your accomodation, regardless of the time. Sinchon Station serves the green line, and close by is the Sogang Univ Station that's the Gyeongui Line as well. Area is accessible by many buses, and has a stop for the airport limo as well. I find that I always have something new to discover whenever I visit this area. "
Better Food Choices Than Myeongdong,I stayed in a guesthouse around this place and I find it to be a fun place to be at. It can get a little loud because of the hundreds of restaurants and bars surrounding our guesthouse but you will never get bored. U-Plex Mall is only a stone throw away and hundreds of restaurants to choose from. I had better meals here than in Myeongdong. Close to buses and subway too.
Different from Myeongdong,"Chanced upon this place when trying to located a BBQ restaurant. It's a more pleasant place to shop and rest your soul with plenty of restaurant to choose from. As it's near Ehwa University, prices are pretty much the same you get from Gangnam area and Myeongdong"
very busy area,"actually, i visited this area last year. i also stayed in guest house at this area. very busy area, you won't get bored because you'll find many street food stalls, cafes and restaurants. there are also fashion boutique for youth people and many famous Korean cosmetic shops. this area actually is near Ehwa Women University. take a walk around 15 minutes, you can reach Ehwa area."
Meh,"it's like all the other college neighborhoods in Seoul. Go to one, you've gone to the all.it's like all the other college neighborhoods in Seoul. Go to one, you've gone to the all."
Great party,"We had a great time eating, drinking & dancing at the different restaurants, pubs & night clubs. It also is a good place to get some America food. It is located very close to the U.S. Base so there is a lot of 20 something guys out having fun. "
"Lively, youthful atmosphere!","I have been to Korea 3x now and I still am discovering new and wonderful places to visit. I visited Sinchon just last week and I was not disappointed! On the main drag, there are any number of local shops, restaurants, cafes, as well large mass merchants such as the UL 8 fashion house (a unique Asian concept where you house many fashion vendors in one building - nothing similar comes to mind in the U.S.), and various other fashion, and cosmetic vendors. The UL 8 complex alone probably has more selection than all of downtown San Francisco put together. Also to note, there is a place across from UL 8 that specialzes in Korean desserts and a cat cafe on the main drag (same side as UL 8, look on one of the buildings - it is on the 3rd floor). The charge is 8 dollars unlimited time with one free drink. You take off shoes in the foyer and change to slippers. You pay the admission at the coffee counter. Ehwa University is about a 15 minute walk (maybe less) and the area around the college has even more affordable dining and fashion options. For example, many shops were advertising 10 dollar backpacks, 19 dollar shoes/flats, 10 dollar blouses and pullovers (I will post separate photos under Ehwa University). You could easily spend a whole day in the area!"
great place for youngsters !,"Young and Energetic street / area to visit, shopping yes, food yes, cafe yes! There's a Cat Cafe just opposite Lotteria Fast-food store. Plenty of mobile phone shops for those who want to get a prepaid card. Students, yes you can get what you need there. Cafes, one of the highlight, lots of nice cafes there. Mostly 2-3 levels. There's a U Plaza with 7 or more floors for young fashion brands, mostly students around the mall.You can visit Yonsei University and Ewha University its all near and easy to locate."
"Food, drinks, department store, university students!","Situated in between of some of the most popular universities in South Korea, Yonsei, Ewha and Sogang (hongik university is a bit further away so doesn't count).Because all of these universities Sinchon is crawling with students, especially after 4-5 in the afternoon. There are hundreads of drinking places, resturants, coffee shops, shopping and anything else an university student might like! Also they have a lot of street performances on the weekends. A must go if you are into that kind of thing."
Cheap and convenient,Easy and convenient to travel anywhere in Seoul by subway/bus/taxi. It is also a walking distance to Hongdae if you don't want to take the subway. They also have one of the cheapest guesthouses!
No seat BBQ,"I have experienced a wonderful BBQ beef at SeoSeo Galbi at 109-69 Nogosan-dong (32 Baekbeom-ro 2-gil) . It is a local, small, and no big sign to show where it is, but it has special source with hot crispy BBQ beef and big green chili"
Lively atmosphere.,"Sinchon is one of the most lively district in Seoul, lots of universities, restaurants, pubs and cafes, a very youthful atmosphere. Accessible thanks to the large network of underground trains. If you plan to spend the night here I suggest you to go somewhere..there is not much."
Great walking street,"Sinchon is an area in Seoul that is the home to a number of colleges and universities, notably Ewha Woman's University and Yonsei University and a number of smaller ones. The best area you might like to explore is a pedestrian street that is lined with shops, bars, restaurants and coffee shops and cafes. You can visit here for a good walk, some shopping and a bite to eat. Take the metro Green line 2 to the Sinchon station. Take exit 3 and walk forward. You will be amongst many young university students. You will find many shops, many small places with some interesting items. Also many restaurants, bars, coffee shops and every possible eating place you can imagine. Walking forward the pedestrian walk turns right at the square that has a stage and sitting area. Continue walking up one side and then you can walk back the opposite side. There is a great Italian restaurant called Crevasse. See my review for directions. This is a fun few hours walking, eating and shopping. The streets and sidewalks are bricked and comfortable to walk. I visited during the day, but enjoyed it enough to visit again next time at night, which I am sure will be much more active."
"Exchange students around here, your heaven","Sogang, leewha, Yonsei hahaIf you are going to these universities as an exchange student, then Sinchon is your hottest place to play.There are many pubs and restaurants.You can enjoy Korean barbecue in a reasonable price, and you can drink as well. There is no club in Sinchon but there are many similar one so if you wanna dance, but don't wanna go club then you can dance at there.So Yonsei, Sogang, leehwa this is your heaven.Enjoy your time in Sinchon haha"
Sinchon Area,"Sinchon is a good, not great area for nightlife but not much else although its convenient to walk to the university area or other areas you maybe interested in. Having lived in S. Korea for 4+ years, I have spent many a night in Sinchon."
Good location,"Pretty good location, has many hotels and University type food joints. Everything is closed after 2 a.m."
Many cheap food and shopping places,This area is near the universities making everything cheap. There are also all you can eat korean bbq places for only 8500 won. This place is also for the young and hip. This place is also very accessible by train.
So Convenient,"We lived here in Sinchon for 10 days and went out everyday and every night. Everything is so close to this location, including shopping centres, cheap and expensive. There are food outlets and restaurants dotted everywhere in large streets and backstreets. There is entertainment all around the place such as bars, clubs, PC bars, table tennis hire, pool and billiards, coffee everywhere. Transportation is also very convenient with Sinchon subway and several buses on either side of the suburb/area/district."
"Accessible, vibrant and less touristy","This area is a good place to stay. Hotels, restaurants and streetfood shops are less expensive and largely cater to local market. It has a vibrant and youthful ambiance due to its proximity to some universities.Many of the budget hotels are at the same streets as love motels. A bit off but still decent and safe."
Great place,Suitable for the young and hip. Less touristy compared to places like myeongdong and dongdaemun. Great for budget shopping. Enjoy the inexpensive food around too.
Beautiful Ehwa University and lots of shopping @ Sinchon,"The european architecture of Ehwa university against the autumn leaves backdrop was a really beautiful sight. If you have time, do take a 10 mins walk from the subway station along Sinchon Ladies Street, and you will reach the university. If you have time, you can tour the compound.As Sinchon Ladies Street is located besides the university, clothes are selling cheaper. And you can find cheaper food there as well. Pretty big area for shopping if you like trendy young clothes!"
Good shopping day & manicures,"Came to Ewha/Sinchon Ladies' shopping street,which this shopping area is called, due to the fact there is very little here for men. Great area for makeup, and clothing shops with junior size and style clothing. I also saw more cute little manicure and pedicure shops here; prices are reasonable.There's a little bit of everything in this area, so come prepared; wear comfortable shoes and get ready to shop!"
Wonderful place,"Great for party, shopping and dining - it may not be the most cultural part of seoul but a wonderful place indeed that most people would love"
Pretty cheap stuff!,"They do have stuff selling at cheap prices. Like knitted tops for 10,000 of good quality and bags for 10,000. It is indeed a good place to get cheaper items. You'll see many students as well, I recognised them by their looks since school is out for them now, and just experience the street buzz in the evening."
Woman's street,This place sells little things that girls love. Price is reasonable and there are cafes around. Hang out with friends here is a good idea.
Vibrant youth community,"Sinchon is just four stations (green metro line) from downtown Seoul. I love the vibrant, youthful vibe of this area, which is home to Hongyik University and the Ewha Women's University. The place comes alive in the late afternoons and evenings when undergrads/postgrads stream out of classes to chill out in the many pocket friendly cafes, fast food restaurants, noodle shops. The cluster of alleys that make up Sinchon are full of shops and pushcart vendors selling all sorts of affordably priced, sometimes cheesy, girly stuff like cosmetics, toiletries, casualwear, bags, footwear, sunglasses, hair grips, cellphone accessories, fancy stationery etc etc. If you want to break away from the crowds head to the Hyundai Department Store on the main road which sells upmarket adult stuff, has a well stocked basement supermarket and a few restaurants on its top floor for a more sedate but still easy on the wallet dining experience. Good to visit Sinchon's shopping streets at least once just for the experience."
Heaven for women,"Since it is located near to Ewha university, most store you can find is cosmetic store, you want to splurge on Korean well known make up and skin product? This is the place for you, purchase few amounts of your won on the products, you'll get free samples, not only 5 but LOTS, even cosmetic pouch, merchandise of the endorsed kpop idol/celebrity, you won't be sorry."
perfect for girl shopping dates,"Probably not for those who don't like shopping.It's a quaint little part of town with one clothing store after another.Lots of cute cafes too and obviously, being close to universities, full of students.Went yesterday and found the cutest burger place with surprisingly decent burgers.Check out my blog post for pics.http://www.girlwhodoeslunch.com/2012/05/saturday-saturday-gotta-get-down-on.html"
I don't like this place.,Sometimes I have pain in my mind and body when I'm in the place where there are so many people. and That street of city is not clean. So I don't like that place. One point I like is that place has young people's wave.
Good place to hang out.,"So many uni. student walking through.. Lots of PC room, restaurant and clothes shop.. Usually I go there buy some clothes and play computer game with my friends. Sometimes I go see a movie at megabox.. http://www.visitseoul.net/en/statics.do?_method=includePage&p=09&m=0004009001007&url=http://ticket.visitseoul.net//uPortal/Movie/Place/PlaceInfo.asp%3FPlaceCode%3DM1000%26position%3D;) go there and chill out."
