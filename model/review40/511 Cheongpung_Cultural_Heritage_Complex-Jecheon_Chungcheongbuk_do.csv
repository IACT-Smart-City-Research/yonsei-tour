Good stop in the fall months,"Cheongpung Cultural Heritage Complex contains artifacts collected from the region before it was flooded to form Chungjuho Lake after the construction of Chungju dam. Eungcheonggak, Hanbyeongnu Pavilion, and handful of Goryeo and Joseon era structures are the highlights of the complex. A small section of a fortress wall at the top of the complex provides some great views of Chungjuho Lake and the Cheongpung Cultural Heritage Complex. We were a week or two away from the fall colors reaching their brightest but the area was still colorful enough to make the trip worthwhile. The two museums housing the artifacts seem to have been neglected without much explanations and displays that looked to have been put together without much effort."
Wonderful,"Very korean. You'll know some things about Korea's history. Very scenic, big and beautiful. A must see if you love culture and nature."
Great view from the top,"At first, the idea of random cultural complex out of nowhere really didn't appeal to me. But I would say this place is totally worth visiting if you are visiting Jecheon. The thing to check out is the last stop in the attraction where you can have amazing view of the lake and surrounding mountains. I loved the view from the top. Amazing. Beautiful view. Don't get turned off by some animal figures near the entrance. Keep moving on the map!"
Beautiful View in Autumn Season,"If you have spare time when visiting Seoul, there is a place in Jecheon city that you can go to. Jecheon from Seoul Station is about two-hour train ride. I would recommend Cheongpung though the transportation is a bit hard going to this place after alighting at Jecheon Station. There is a bus going to there but the frequency is very far and between.The place itself is a combination beauty of nature and culture into one, and you can hike to the top of the hill to see the bridge and traditional houses. The view is breathtaking when I went there when it was autumn. Some say that's the best season to visit South Korea."
Cultural heritage,"It was raining when we got here, we walked the path leading to the model houses of the past centuries of Korea. We were also educated by our tour guide on how was life during those times which was pretty much the same anywhere in the world, except the knowledge on how they cope with the cold weather and what they do to seal their houses. It was a nice place for photo op.Nice that there were people selling some food items outside, like water chestnut and mushrooms."
Good place and the setting is great.,Good to see korean traditional houses. The setting is very good with the lake around. Unfortunately it was raining so we couldn't do the monorail which is supposed to give an excellent view of the entire valley.
Historical dramas were true! Its beautiful!,I visited here while it was raining and it was a great experience. The pavillion at the top has a priceless view and the flags at the top makes you feel like its a small fortress. Do not forget to follow the way going down and take a boat on the lake! Its beautiful :))
Large collection of traditional buildings in gorgeous mountain setting,"The place is big, and has a multitude of buildings that range from the simple farmers houses to nobility dancing ball pavillions. The view across the lake below is fantastic, and if you time the visit to see the dancing water jet you get an extra benefit. At our time there were shows at least at 1100 and 1330, lasting about 20 min.There is some walking involved in getting to the top of the mountain. There were salesmen of ""real root beer"" and rosted chestnuts + many roots and grasses at the parking lot."
