Bemusing - No information in English,We couldn't figure out what was public and what were teaching or workshop spaces as no information in English.
See some interesting art and fascinatng people,"We came across the Incheon Art Platform as we were walking to Chinatown early on a Saturday afternoon. We saw quite a few young people participating in activities around the building, we liked what we saw outside and so went inside to be further impressed. If you like looking at art from different perspectives, this is worth a quick visit."
art lovers MUST GO,"all art lovers will love the place to enjoy the art, the history of Korean. do visit The Museum of Korean Modern Literature nearby. you can also enjoy the workshops provided by different NGOs which have booth there."
This is an excellent historical place to visit that capsilizes the highlights of the Korean Art,"The museum has posters in Korean, English, and a limited number of other languages, i.e., Japanese, German, etc., with accompanying photos larger than life. There are several relic static displays of weaponry used in the defense of South Korea. The statues of the soldiers scaling the sea walls of Incheon during the Incheon invasion are haunting and sobering. It is an accurate depiction of historical events."
