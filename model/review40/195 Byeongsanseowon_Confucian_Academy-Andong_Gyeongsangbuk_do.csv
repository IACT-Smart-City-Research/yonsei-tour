Fabulous setting,"This beautiful Confucian academy was founded by one of the Ryu family from the nearby Hahoe village. Take the 246 bus there, and if staying in the village, hike back 4 kms through the forest and then fields of rice, millet, pumpkins and edamame beans. "
Enjoy the silence,After a bumpy ride we arrived at this scenic place. A nice authentic retreat for confusianist scholars of the old days. Just walk around the premises and let the beauty of the place and its natural surroundings soak in. Loved it. 
Go there!,This place is not big by any measures but I enjoyed it more than the whole Hahoe village previously visited. It's much more quiet and relaxing. I guess not a lot of people know about it. The road going there isn't even paved. There is no information for visitors(yet..they were renovating the parking lot so there might be something else in the future). I don't know about the history of the Academy but whoever built it picked the right spot.
superb view,"This is one of the most beautiful private academies in Chosun dynasty. In fact the front scenery is too beautiful to study hard :) Though it is worth seeing, visiting is somewhat restrictive: you should get before six pm through an unpaved and winding road. "
Oustanding old Academy,"This place is located near a river and between hills in a beautiful scenery, that was chosen for it when the school was created during the Choseon Dynasty, many centuries ago. Everything is magnificent. The temples are very well preserved, all of them amazing. There is not difficult to go (few kilometers from the main road). There are not a lot of people. It has been visited by many important dignitaries (G. Bush, Queen Elizabeth etc.). If you are in the area not miss it."
"So peaceful, wonderful place.","We were lucky to visit this wonderful place with a local who explained a lot to us. It was so peaceful and calm with the river and mountains nearby, well worth the visit - easy to fit in a day visit with Andong Hahoe village."
Byeongsan Private School in the era of Chiseon Dynasty at Andong,"This is one of private schools in the era of Choseon Dynasty, a boarding school of about fifteen students to be more soecific. You can see classrooms, a library, a press center, a shrine, and so forth."
"So Serene, So Tranquil... AMAZING","I visited Byeongsanseowon Confucian Academy nearly it's closing time. So we were there by ourselves. This place really captivated me. I can image how peaceful and calm this place were for studying for the Confucian Academy followers back in the ancient time. That specific area in front of the red door with 3 sign actually gave me goosebumps... Hahahahaa...Totally worth visiting. If you like serenity and tranquility, I strongly suggested visiting this place."
A little haven of tranquility,"A stunning location looking over the river and across to mountains fringed with bare-branched trees, like toothbrush bristles. The buildings are simple and beautifully-crafted, and the cherry blossom set them off to perfection. The place is so peaceful that you can imagine the scholars of old having the space and lack of distraction to think profound thoughts. Look out for the ""snail toilet"" - ingenious design! We'd just missed a bus from Hahoe Village and didn't have time to walk (about 4km) so ordered a taxi via the tourist information desk, who waited for us and then took us on to the bus-stop we needed to return to Andong - not expensive at all."
Small Collegiate Academy,"Located on a scenic piece of property, this is a prestigious academy was built by a renown scholar in the 1800's. The complex consists of dormitories, classrooms, library, and prayer halls."
Small but beautiful seowon!,"This is a 'seowon' (college/academy) built by RYU sung-ryong, one of the most renowned scholar of Chosun in 1800s. The seowon complex consists of lecture halls, library and dormitories -- the architectural style and the layout of the buildings make this seowon one of the most beautiful colleges of the times. Pink flowers of bae-rong trees adorn the seowon in summertime; the trees represent strenuous effort and incessant learning. 3 buses make it to Byeongsan seowon each day from Andong city center (train station)."
Great Hike to Peace,"We hiked here from Hahoe Village and it was well worth it. A wonderful gem we stumbled onto after our long hike and had the place to ourselves. We took it all in and meditated in this wonderful quiet place sitting on the balcony areas looking over the valleys. We also planned on the transportation by public bus from the Monastery to Andong itself to enjoy a late lunch. Again in this area plan your hikes and transportation, given it is limited. Believe it or not there is a tourist office just down the road and across from the bus stop. While the tourist office did not speak english, she offered us hot coffee and cookies while we waiting for our bus --what a wonderful treat after our hike and during our wait to get to Andong."
Great place ,"Nearby Haheo village, it is much nicer. Green, quiet... With been warmly welcomed by a local guide speaking English, very gentle. Park where you pay for entrance, then walk, the way to go worth to walk through, especially during spring time "
Nice hike to the academy,"Try to get the right bus so you can avoid walking here. However, the walk to the academy is pleasant (make sure you have enough time). The academy is traditional and well preserved. It was very quiet and peaceful and the setting along the river by the mountains is beautiful.It only takes 10 minutes to see the academy but worth a visit with Hahoe if possible."
One of the best academies of Confusionism. ,One of the best academies of Confusionism. Seowon is a ancient times school. Retired scholar taught students his knowledge to produce good juniors. This is famous for the place where queen Elizabeth 2nd visited. 
You should visit it on the way to the folk village,"I took the bus to the Hahoe Folk Village which also goes to Byeongsan Seowon, which is only a few times a day. The bus drivers in Korea, as I soon found out, are crazy-drivers, and we got to the school in half the time written on the timetable! The bus stops at the school for 15min before leaving again for the Hahoe Folk Village, but I saw that the distance between the two has not that large and since it was a nice day I decided to walk from the school to the folk village. Since I didn't have a map, I just walked back the same way the bus did, and I even stopped at the Andong World Dolls Museum which is on the way.My entire trip around Korea is described here: http://ttlgawift.weebly.com/around-korea-in-15-days.html ."
