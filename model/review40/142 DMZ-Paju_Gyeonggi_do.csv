DMZ & JSA experience,Full day at DMZ with koridoor tours.An easy day trip from Seoul and a must see thing to do when visiting Korea.A place where world history is being written
DMZ," Half day tour to DMZ with VIP Travel.Collected on time and enjoyed the very informative Jenny on what was required to be done regarding admittance to various sites.Also, the history up to the present day and her excellent method of getting us to the various stops ahead of the queues."
Must Do experience!,A 'must do' experience every tourist! An easy day trip from Seoul - easily and cheaper to arrange through hotel reception than online before travel. 2 day tours packing city tour and DMZ can work out as better value and offer hotel pick and drop off.
"I now have a ""North Korea"" stamp in my passport!","While it wasn't the very best historic tour I've ever been on, it was interesting. And very sad. Until we went, I don't think that I really appreciated how, similar to the Berlin Wall, in the blink of an eye, families have been divided and lost to each other.We were able to go underground to one of the tunnels that N Korea had built to infiltrate and invade S Korea. You get hardhats so that you don't knock your head on the ceiling, and you have to keep hunching over so that you don't hit it. But if you're over 6', you can count on bashing it anyway, as my husband repeatedly did. The ground is slippery and very steep in some places also. When you reach the bottom, you're at a midway point and you can see a small room that's the last place any N Koreans could enter. Anything beyond that room is the DMZ and N Korea. Nearby, there's a museum that you can walk through that explains how the country split and various military campaigns.After visiting the tunnel, we were taken to the Dora Observatory, where you can stand on a covered platform and with high-power binoculars see into N Korean countryside. If you turn around, you can see S Korea, and the contrast between the two is pretty stark. It's definitely one of those ""selfie"" times, because you can have a nice photo with N Korea in the background.After the Dora Observatory, we were taken to a restaurant, where we were provided a Korean lunch. Nothing spectacular or fancy, but it was decent and filling. Then we were taken to the Dorasan Station, which is the last station in S Korea and was intended to connect the entire country with rail lines throughout Asia and into Europe. It has been finished and updated but doesn't have any trains in or out. However, there is sort of a museum on the inside, and we were given train ""tickets"" that allowed us to go out onto the train platform. We also had the opportunity to stamp either the tickets or our passports with a pretend N Korean stamp. It will not be recognized, but it's kind of fun having that stamp in my passport.Once we left the train station, we were taken to the Nuri Peace Park, which has some lovely gardens, a shrine, and an unfinished suspension bridge between the two countries. S Korean families leave small flags on the bridge in remembrance of their family members still trapped in N Korea. This, to me, was the most humbling part of the tour. While we most often hear about missile tests and Kim Jong Un, it shouldn't be forgotten that there are real people whose lives have been altered by the separation and deaths of their family members still in N Korea. (Sidenote: We had to skip the bus back to the base and instead took a taxi to our hotel near the airport. Our taxi driver didn't speak any English but he kept saying ""Kim Jong Un"" in a very derogatory manner. I think it's safe to say that he didn't have a good opinion of him. It added another layer of understanding of how the population has been affected - still - by the splitting of the country.)Was it the best thing I've ever done? No, but it was very interesting and informative; if you have to opportunity to visit, you should."
It was ok,"I originally wanted to go on the longer tour together with the JSA tour. Unfortunately it was canceled the evening before the tour. They offered me the shorter tour, only to the DMZ. It is okay. But I think the JSA tour would be more interesting."
Birthday trip,"A DMZ trip was not on my list when I arrived in Seoul, but with 2 days with nothing planned, I decide to add this tour to our list. Our tour guide Christian was great. She triple checked us to make sure we had our passports, because we would not be allowed to access the DMZ without one, and it had to be a physical passport book, not electronic or a copy. It was like clearing custom to go into a foreign country, except soldiers were doing the checking. No picture taking were allowed once we board the bus, with others to go across the bridge. Big surprise, there’s a Popeyes restaurant at Imjigak park. There are remnants of better days “a train” still sitting on its track, and more. We did the tour of the 3rd incomplete tunnel. This was harder than I thought, going down and back up from the tunnel, was like walking down the side of an upright pencil. I almost panicked, but I made it to the end, definitely a once in a lifetime experience, not for the faint hearted. There’s a monorail choice to tour the tunnel as well. If you go make sure to stop at the supermarket and pick up a few boxes of chocolate covered soybeans. Wished I bought more. From the Tower you can see some activities on the other side. Pictures can be taken once you are off the bus, but no personal belongings can be taken into the tunnel. So much to see at the DMZ. "
Memorable Place,"One of the top places to see when visiting Seoul. Always include this as one of the top five to visit in Korea. Such an amazing place how they preserved and maintain the tunnel. Just a reminder, make sure that you have your passport when you are joining this tour for there are security check when entering DMZ. "
Overhyped,I don't really understand the hype. It is a border. How fascinated can you be about that? There's North Korea on the other side... how fascinated can you be about that. Pretty dull in general though I heard there's great nature trails.
 Must visit! ,"If you go to Korea, you can’t skip this tour, it can be book the day before from most hotel concierge services, the tour leaves early and is about 1 to 1 1/2 hours drive which is full of information by the tour guide, you need to bring your passport for military control, we went during summer and it was hot, so make sure you have sunscreen, sunglasses, a hat and comfortable clothes and walking shoes, you don’t have to bring food, as there are places where you can buy something. "
Great tour to hope of peace and unification in Korea,"I made a day trip there with a group of my friends. It was about 2 hours from Seoul. The trip was great, offering you knowledge about korean war, DMZ, and the hope of Korean people about peace and unification.It is DMZ but i dont feel like that way, everything is normal, green rice paddy field, nice park..."
DMZ,While my wife was not keen she throughly enjoyed the visit. Very well run by the army on duty that day and very informative on all aspects of the area. A must do if in Korea
Special experience,"Very lucky to have been able to visit the DMZ on a trip to South Korea. Would probably say this is an absolute must see thing to do when visiting Korea. Managed to do a full day tour, an eerie experience and can still see the tension. Coming here helps you understand a lot about the history though."
Impressive,Very unreal to be at the place that is part of the history books and still get’s New pages every day. Half a day tour from koridoor was perfect. We had a great guide(vincent) who showed us all. A must for all who visit Korea.
Fascinating Trip,"I booked a tour called ""Seoul: South Korea Demilitarised Zone Half & Full Day Tour"" from ILoveSeoul available through the GetYourGuide website. They sent me information before the tour about pick-up times from my hotel along with instructions to bring your passport as well as other normal rules. I chose this particular tour because it did not have any shopping stops, which seemed like a waste of time for me. I was incredibly impressed with the tour and really enjoyed learning about the history of Korea from our tour guide. Our tour included Imjingak park, Dorasan station, Dora Observatory and the Third Infiltration Tunnel. One thing that is worth noting is that you are never actually in the DMZ. As the tour guide explained whilst we were in Dora Observatory, where they had a maquette of the area, we were right next to it but not in it. To go inside the DMZ you need to book a tour of Panmunjom as well, which is the halfway house (if you will) between South and North Korea that sits inside the DMZ. We didn't opt for this as it was twice as expensive and riskier in terms of getting the tour cancelled if Panmunjom was needed on the day by officials. That doesn't retract from the experience though as the whole point of the trip was to see the efforts made by the South Koreans to repair their relationship with the North. Our tour guide wanted us to leave having expelled the thought that North Koreans are evil. She said, political parties and policies aside, they are all just Koreans, separated by force, wanting to go back to their families. I think that is a very important thought and it was clear from the rebuilding of the destroyed train tracks, platform at Dorasan station and openness shown during the tour that South Koreans wholeheartedly wish for reunification.Definitely a must-see for anyone wanting to understand this country better."
Amazing Experience,"This is about as weird as it gets, soending a few hours technically in neither North or South Korea. The Demilitarized Zone stretches for two kilometres inside both borders and contains many noteworthy things to see like the Dora Observatory, Dorasan Station, the Third Tunnel and Imjingok Park with its Peace Bridge You cannot go here privately. You must go with a tour group and you must have your passport.It's a great experience though and you learn so much about the history of the conflict and tentative recent attempts to come together as symbolised by Dorasan Station which could potentially link the two Koreas by train Superb day out. One like no other, that's for sure!"
A MUST VISIT,"This is a must visit when you are in South Korea. One should ;plan the visit (including driving time from and to Seoul and lunch to take somewhat over a half day. See as much of the area as you can (it helps to have a guide). Unless you are claustrophobic, take the walk through Tunnel Three; visit the train station linking South and North Korea. It was built in anticipation of unification. it is large mostly empty, but awaiting the future. Walk to the Dorasan Station Observatory--check out the exhibits and use the telescopes to peer into North Korea. The area can get quite crowded, so it is best if you start early. ."
Spot of Peace and Unification,"Interesting Journey from Seoul entering DMZ (DeMilitarized Zone) with highlights on Unification.The Story started hundred years ago that China (War of Ching Dynasty & Japan 1894-95) lost the battle with Japan and failed to protect Korea being invaded and colonized by Japan on 1910.8.29-1945.8.15。1945.8.15 Japanese surrendered to the Americans and Soviets on Korea Peninsula and since then Korea Peninsula had been taken over by the Two Super Powers with demarcation along Imjingang River ( Now where the Imjingak Station of South Korea established) . South Koreans favoured Americans and declared independence as Republic of Korea 1948.8.15. North Koreans favoured the Russians and established The People's republic of Korea thereafter on 9.9.1948。In 1950-53, during the Korean's Civil War , this piece of land we now touring was a complete disaster. In the first four battles 1950-51, Seoul was changed hands FOUR times. Everything was destroyed by War from Dorasan in the North to Incheon & Seoul in the South including the Gyeongbukgung that we love to visit.Since the Joint Communique of 1971, Imjingak was rebuilt and the DMZ now we approaching was born. Points of interest at DMZ are:Imjingak river and view pointDorasan Train StationFiltration Tunnel Dorasan Hill ObservatoryPanmumjeon(since Oct 2018)Haemaruchon (restricted for 60 years) conservationTongilchon (unification Village)Tomb of Heo Joon (1539-1615) famous Chosun Doctor"
DMZ Peace Tour,"Learned a lot from Korean History through an in-depth immersion at the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The theatre, exhibition, and tunnel is a must-experience. This will make you appreciate ROK more. It will take a lot of walking so best to wear comfortable shoes. Enjoy! :)"
No Man's Land,"It is required if visiting the DMZ that you are part of a tour. Also need to bring your passport and be dressed decently. Our bus met at the President's Hotel in Seoul which is only 30 miles from the border. The DMZ was created after the Korean War in 1953 and is the world's most heavily militarized border. The 3rd Infiltration Tunnel was discovered in 1978 and ran under the DMZ from North Korea and would have been capable of an invasion of 30,000 troops into Seoul in an hour had it been completed. It is one of 4 known tunnels. It is a long steep descent 240 feet underground and altho I tried to keep my head down and crouched over I kept hitting my hard hat on the low ceiling of the tunnel. When we reached the concrete barriers blocking off North Korea we knew we had to come back up and out. At the train station we got a symbolic ticket and a visa stamp. These railroad tracks lie in wait for unification. We had hoped to be allowed into the JSA (Joint Security Area) but it was a no go at this time. This is where South Korea's President Moon-Jae shook hands with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in April of 2018. That gesture brought so much hope yet they still are so far apart. Following that day however the propoganda speakers were turned off. North Korea's leader tells the people that they are poor because of the United States. Lastly we went to the Mt Dora Observatory and had the surreal experience of using telescopes to peer into North Korea. It didn't feel scary to be in this area and although I took a couple of photos, one cannot overlook the seriousness of the situation as it is always in the news. The cleanest air in South Korea is up near the border so there are rice paddy fields and ginseng is grown here too. My tour was with Cosmojin that I booked thru Viator and we had a North Korean defector on board the bus with us. The tour bus made a stop at an amethyst shop which was just a waste of time. I wish tour companies would stop doing these kind of stops. Overall I was happy with the tour and very glad I had this travel experience."
VIP tours ,"We booked about a month in advance with VIP travel who were excellent. Our English speaking tour guide was excellent and very knowledgable. We met at a hotel and took their air conned coach to the DMZ. You have to provide your passport several times. Here you can visit (and should visit) - Dora observatory, third tunnel, park and the train station.We went for lunch near by which was great.From there we went to the JSA which was fascinating. Really recommend going here - it was just incredible and we learnt so much history."
A lot more walking than initially thought - must visit still,"We did this tour, and learned a lot about the Korean peninsula history. Our guide was very knowledgeable. Walking under the tunnel was an incredible experience, but strenuous. Not only was the tunnel walk long, but there were places where you had to bend down for long periods, which may not be easy to do for some people taller than 5'10. There was also another building nearby where you can view North Korea through binoculars. Driving to the DMZ, you cannot take photos in some areas, according to our tour guide, so that's something to keep in mind. Included in our tour is a visit to the old train station that leads to North Korea. It was fairly cheap to gain access onto the platform. There was a section in the ticket counter where you may find a ""stamp."" I think this was meant to stamp tickets for travelers taking the train (at some point in the past). Some people in our group stamped their passports with it, and I'm not sure that was the intention of why that was there. It'd be good to know if those people had trouble with their passports after that."
DMZ through my eyes!,"I've been wanting to visit DMZ for awhile, and it finally happened! It was definitely a very unique experience that left me with mixed emotions. We first visited the Tunnel that was made by North Korean soldiers and it was so thrilling! P. S: Might be hard to pass for tall people (I'm 170 cm and I was bending most of the time) Afterwards, we went straight to the Observatory and You wouldn't believe what happened! Our tour guide took a photo of the North Korean base using close up, and We could see them straight back at us! It was definitely shocking and creepy :') Afterwards, we went to Dorasan station which is basically will be the first train station to North Korea in case of Unification. All in all, I definitely enjoyed my first trip to DMZ "
Not what I expected but worth a visit,"You can't go to South Korea without paying a visit to the DMZ. But it was completely different from what I expected. I expected the see the JSA (those two blue buildings) but apparently that area is closed. On the tour we went to an observatory, a tunnel, a village and a train station. You don't get a lot of time to look around at those places and there is no explanation whatsoever. The obersevatory is worth it, the train station is fun because you can take a picture of the sign of the train to Pyeongyang. I didn't understand why we stopped in that village and the tunnel is interesting, but it's definitely not worth going in that tunnel."
Visited with aged parents (wheelchair),I highly recommend Mr Chang’s Korean Wheelchair Tour to anyone who has mobility challenges and yet still wishes to visit DMZ.Mr Chang has a lot of initiatives when it came to helping us to take photographs and also making sure that my aged father had regular visits to the washrooms. All the little things count a lot for us especially when we were in a foreign land and do not speak its native language.He took care of my father in the wheelchair throughout the trip and that allowed us to also enjoy the sightseeing without having to worry too much about my father’s wellbeing. A big thank you Mr Chang and his associate - David! 
Tour too rushed,Just given insufficient time to take in the political enormity of the DMZ. Felt the tour was far too rushed and too little explanation provided about the different elements
Closed for security reasons.,I just paid for a tour and finished a dmz tour. They didn’t tell us that the JSA was closed until the very end of the dmz tour.
Very interesting place,"Visited the tunnels, a little cramped for big people, have to bend over. Very popular but extremely interesting to see into north Korea from the top of the hill. The war, in many ways continues. The younger generation need to carry on the vigilance against the North. Reconciliation is being attempted by the South. Unfortunately JSA was closed when we visited."
DMZ and JSA four KORIDOOR,"The tours to the JSA were reopened May 1, 2019 after a seven month halt and we visited May 4. Due to the political tenseness, final confirmation of our tour was not made until the day before and the time of the tour was changed. There are many tour companies and our American military guide at the JSA did say that tours are available from Pyongyang in North Korea for citizens of countries other than the US or South Korea.Now the guards at the JSA are unarmed and the two sides remain out of the way of each other. We did not see any North Koreans during the visit. If your visit to the JSA is close to noon, you may see foreign visitors and their escorts from the Pyongyang tour at a distance.I took the half day tour two years ago and the Dora observatory building is new and the Dorasan station was full of pictures of Kim Jung Un and Moon Jae-In meeting in cooperative talks. Quite a change in two years. The sites are crowded with many tours and the lunch is served very efficiently for the crowd. Bring your own sandwich if you don’t like Korean food.Do not book this tour if you are not flexible on your timing.The third tunnel has a tram available from certain much more expensive tour companies. Research that and book that tour if you are not physically fit. We were both senior citizens who are very active; however, the third tunnel climb back to the surface was a challenge.There are many tour companies offering the tours. KORIDOOR tours start near Yongsan or Pyeongtaek (Camp Humphreys).My partner experienced the Korean War first hand and the tour had a special meaning. Your experience may be different.Picture shows tree of cooperation planted leaders of both sides."
DMZ - A look at the War that has never ended,This is a exciting eye opener for many who did not experienced any real battles as we are technically in a war zone even after 65 years since the Armistice was signed in 27 July 1953.
Based on attitude. I would not recommend,After asking for information about a tour. It did not fit my travel plans. Which i polietly let the comapny know. The responce I received was very rude as shown in the picture below. I am now very glad I am not taking the tour if this is the attitude potential customers are treated to. I didn't realise asking for information was such a issue for a tour company! I would avoid people with this quality of customer!
a place to think about countries divided,"I had looked forward to seeing the DMZ, I booked the tour on the internet from Seoul. I did not know that it would be like Disneyland. Hundreds of buses, hundreds of shops, crowds of people. Our guide kept on telling us she was the best, but she provided little information. The visit of the infiltration tunnel was disorganized and crowded. We waited in line for a long time. The train station was meaningful to me, it created the hope that trains might one day run through a united Korea. but Koreans do not wish for reunification. And the big business of the DMZ tourist trade would disappear with unification."
Must-see on visit to Seoul,"This is the closest you can get to North Korea on a DMZ tour. There many artifacts drawing you attention to a divided country and the desire of the South Koreans for reunification. As you drive through the area, it is sobering to see the many red, inverted triangles on the roadside fences, alerting you to the presence of uncleared anti-personnel mines. You are reminded that officially both North Korea and South Korea are still at war; there is only an armistice between them."
Covers most of the points of interest,"I booked the DMZ1 full day tour run by Seoulcitytour.net through the very helpful tourist information centre in Myeongdong. There were very few foreigners and the narration was in Korean only, but the guide did explain some highlights in English. The tour covered most of the places I wanted to see, and there was a good view into North Korea using binoculars from an observatory, but we didn’t see the unification village. There was not enough time at the first stop at Freedom Bridge, and the walk in the infiltration tunnel is a bit hard for the less agile visitors like me.My tour included an excellent lunch at a restaurant back in Seoul, plenty of time for walking around the shops at Insadong, and hotel pickup and return. It also included a ginseng shop,"
So much history and political background,"There is this realization that at one time this place used to be one of the most dangerous borders in the world because of the tension filled conflict between the 2 countries. So much that even if I didn't get to see the JSA , my disappointment is not that much. But there is still the 3rd infiltration tunnel , which can be physically challenging to traverse for some, and the dora observatory among others. Be ready to deal with the many tourists particularly those eager to have photo poses with that DMZ signage. Can be frustrating at times though ."
Insightful Visit to DMZ,"We booked the DMZ tour through Panmunjom Travel Centre (PTC). Wanted to visit the JSA but was informed by PTC that it was cancelled by UNC due to demilitarisation job at JSA area. Was told by the PTC tour guide that JSA had been closed for tour for the past few months already. We joined the alternative tour at discounted price which included visiting the Dorasan Station, Dorasan Observatory, 3rd infiltration tunnel, Odusan Unification tower and also interaction with a North Korean defector. Lunch was also included. Have heard about Korea peninsula conflict through news but this tour gave us an in-depth understanding of the conflict and being here allowed us to experience the tense situation here. The most interesting but tiring part of the tour was going into the 250m 3rd infiltration tunnel built by North Korea. Surprising, this tunnel is much spacious that the Cu Chi tunnel in Vietnam. The tunnel has a slope going down and coming up can be tiring. The height of the tunnel is also quite low. Tall people have to lower their head to walk thru the tunnel which can be uncomfortable. Wearing helmet is mandatory to avoid hitting your head against the rough ceiling of the tunnel. Overall, the PTC tour was very organised. We were given a receiver so that we could hear the tour guide clearly. The tour guide, Sally, was professional and knowledgeable. She gave the tour group background information before we reached the destination and make sure we were all on time. We enjoyed this tour."
Book a Shopping Free Tour........,"You can get a shopping free tour from some tour companies.....it shortens the day as there are better things to do in Seoul than spend too much time here. It was packed with tourists...I found the trip overall disappointing. The trip down the Infiltration Tunnel was a highlight but time spent at Dorosan Station was really just looking at a building! The Observation Tower was OK. What was disappointing was the whole lack of any context from the Guide, limited history and certainly nothing about the current day situation...although in response to my question she did admit that only 50% of younger people wanted unification."
Interesting,"This place is extremely touristy, with shops everywhere. It’s likes going to a zoo. It takes away the real history of the DMZ and what happened to the country and the korean people. I am glad I went to see it and to better understand but it sure has turned out to be a big money business for tour operators and the likes."
My trip to THE DMZ,Book a DMZ full day with Seoul City Tour. Pick up FROM hotel okay but very disappointed IN THE tour. Cost about $ 45 us .when we got there only spent 10 minutes at the freedom BRIDGE had to go to the toilet so so that one should have been allowed to spend at least and hour there. THE 3rd infiltration tunnel was great spent some time there worth it actually the high light of the tour. The JSA we did not see was told on THE bus that it was closed to anyone very disappointed came all this way and not to see it we should have been told when we were booking THE tour. Dorasan Station was okay Unification Village (passing by) it reminded me of my PNG tour there it is the Koitaki Showgrounds going pass at 80 ks on the Sogeri highway. The Ginseng center we could have done without. Had a great time IN Korea but I miss what I went for. Don't think I will be going back so soon.....
Meaningful Experience,"I have longed to see the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) for years, knowing the history between North and South Korea in the wake of the Korean War. This long-awaited guided tour was meaningful. There are just some things that are better seen in person rather than just reading about it on the Internet. Unfortunately the guided tours for the time being exclude the JSA (Joint Security Area), but it was still worthwhile visiting the Dorasan station (you can pose with the train sign going to Pyeongyang), the Dora Observatory (look out for the difference in heights between the two Korean flags), and the third infiltration tunnel. Do note that the tunnel requires walking steep slopes to get in and out in a space without tall ceilings, so if you are physically unfit you can either take breaks in the seats between or skip this. Please wear your helmet inside the tunnel too, I bumped my head many times with the helmet on! Also, there are many different tour groups so stick with your group and follow your guide's timings strictly.P.S. Do remember to bring your passport, and when your guide tells you no photos are allowed in a particular zone please pay attention."
Quick but fun and informative,"Took the DMZ tour after seeing advice and recommendations on TripAdvisor. The bus was within 4 minutes of the scheduled pick-up time, picked me then other folks up from other hotels, then off we were to the DMZ.The ride was fun and interesting, and a lot of information was provided by our tour guide throughout the way. I was originally under the impression that we may temporarily cross over into North Korea (there is an option for that), but turns out not to be in our specific itinerary. There were also plenty of stops allowed were we could get tea, snacks, visit some sights up close and get a real feel for the area.All in all, it was money well spent - my only suggestion is to ensure you pick the option where you go to the tent which is half-way in the North, yet still open to visitors."
Only worth it if visiting the JSA,"Book the JSA tour and hope for the best that it is open.Otherwise, visiting the DMZ may not feel authentic even inside either the civilian controlled area, Dorasan Station and Observatory.The 3rd Tunnel can pique your interest but it will not replace the feeling of being between a walking distance of North and South Korea."
Best and Thrilling Experience,"This is the most heavily guarded border between North Korea and South Korea. I visited the 3rd Infiltration Tunnel, Dora observatory (You can see the North Korean propaganda village) , The Bridge of no return and Dorasan Station. JSA was closed due to some military reason. But it was very thrilling and informative experience. Go for it."
Fascinating spot,"There is a calmess and optimism here...at possibly the world's most dangerous border (and despite the tour buses). Peering through the electrified fences and past the land mine signs and having military police check your identity, one sees a calm 'valley'. The loud speakers belching out their propaganda are silenced. Locals seem to view the north as inevitably reuniting with them...almost as it is a bygone conclusion. They see the current leader through much more moderate lens than we in the west do. Unfortunately we could not attend the JSA the day we were here, but it was still well worth the trip."
Wealth of knowledge ,Every tourist need to go through Sth Korean Military checks with your passport prior entering and leaving DMZ. Wealth of knowledge in history and in making. Best to go with tour guide for you are well informed of the latest development. 
Private tour must see ,"it's a must see... the observatory was interesting to see, to be able to see North Korea, he museum is good to also see you can learn about the civil war and the history of DMZ from a souh Korean perspective ofcourse. "
An Experience you cannot barter with anything else,"This 2 km wide stretch of land on both sides of South Korea and North Korea was formed as weapon free zone was during the Korean War. Four tunnels were discovered by South Korea originating from the North Korean side. This is a must visit place if you are visiting Seoul and one of the main attractions in Korea. This attraction needs a lot of walking and one needs to put in some extra effort while returning back due to the steep slope. But this place is worth it.Those who are not used to walking on rough terrain or fragile knees, better to avoid getting down the tunnel.The tour also includes a visit to an observatory from where one can have a look at North Korea, a museum which has the model of a train used long ago and also to a train station built on the hope of a unification in future.A visit to this attraction is a must as it gives one a firsthand experience of the systematic planning and efforts made by North to sneak in and attack South Korea. Do not barter the visit to this attraction to any other when in Seoul.Visit to this place needs proper planning as one needs to book their visit at least one day in advance. Entry of visitors are strictly monitored and those visiting this place needs to carry their passport for verification.Keep aside one day for this visit."
NORTH KOREA,"From here you can see the other site of KOREA, you can see a bullet train, No return bridge and a new train station to connect to North."
"Interesting, but not worth the money",We booked with Viator for a private tour while lay-over at Seoul airport. The tour guide was really good but not really what we expected to see. It's not like what you see on TV. We did not see any North Korean soldiers and can only see North Korea through a telescope at an observation deck.
Most interesting part of my stay in Seoul,"Plan your tour in advance, since tickets are sold out fast. A bus will take you to the location, the most interesting part of which is the tunnel dug from N. Korea to S. Korea. The tunnel is narrow and steep, so make sure you are up for it from the start."
Learning about S & N Korea history,"nice tour provide by the guided, and it give a better understanding of S & N Korean - why and how it become N and South, what the local thinks and how they want the N&S to be.quite alot of ground to cover quite a bit of walking especially the 3rd under ground tunnel.note: picture are not allow inside the under ground tunnel."
trip to my dream place,i go to north koreaua i meet lots of famous people and in hotel in which i stay was beautifull you should take camera with you and i take classes of marchel art i engoy very mutch all people should visit there
History between NK and SK,I participated in DMZ tour & got the chance to visit the border of both Koreas. It was really cool how this tour works and the tour guide gave us a more better understanding about Korean War.
gives you better understanding of the korean war and the stalemate,I simply thought I would know more about the history leading to the stalemate between the North and the South but I didn't expect that the DMZ has become a nature and wildlife reserve. It is now home to several endangered animals and plant species. The experience of walking up and down the slope of the 3rd infiltration tunnel is not for the faint of heart.
Good place to see and learn abt the korean history,"Make sure you take ur id with you otherwise you wont be allowed to buy the entrance ticket. The shuttle will go to dora observatory, dorasan station and the peace park "
A one time experience to the DMZ,"The DMZ is the most heavily guarded border in the world. Purchase the tour package to save time. There are different tour packages and the one I bought was travelling around imjingak, DMZ tour in the third tunnel and Dorasan station. The third tunnel may be a little steep, narrow and dark for some. It is an interesting experience that I recommend everyone to visit once and learn about the history between North Korea and South Korea."
DMZ South Korea,"We bought this tour to have a glimpse of demilitarized zone. They pick us up in our hotel in a big bus. Everyone in the tour must carry their passport because there is a check point where they want to see physically your passport or else you wont be allowed to get in the restricted area. There are only designated areas where you are allowed to take photos. They will bring you to Imjingak Park and you will be able to see old train & train tracks, as well as statutes and monuments regarding the Korean war. You'll see a fence with rolled barb wires and an array of prayer ribbons hanging. You'll also see the Freedom Bridge. Then the tour will bring you to the 3rd Infiltration Tunnel and the DMZ exhibition hall. They have sections where you can take photos. If you want to see and walk inside the tunnel they have lockers where you leave your belongings. No small bags or camera, cellphone allowed. Just be aware that you need to be physically fit because going down to the tunnel is easier because of gravity but walking back is really a struggle to most. Next stop is the Dora Observatory where you can see a panoramic view of North Korea. Then finally they will bring you to Dorasan Station where supposed to be South and North Korea line connects. In each area of stops they have shops where you can purchase souvenirs. I bought two magnets of DMZ. Last stop is the ginseng shop. We did not purchase the one with lunch because we want to be on our way soon to explore Seoul. Actually they pick us up in the hotel around 7:20 and ended up around City Hall around 2:40. Overall, it was value for money considering the area that we visited, time spent and history that we learned on the tour."
A must see,The number one thing to see in Korea. So much to see and learn politically and historically. Simply stunning to look into the landscape of North Korea. The tunnel is great though a long tiring walk back up.
A once in a lifetime opportunity,"A must see, absolutely amazing. Worth the trip. If you are able, you should walk in the tunnel. Take your time on the walk back as the tunnel is straining."
Best thing to do in Korea,"If you have the chance to visit the JSA, you must do it but if even if you visit the regular dmz it is still worth it"
"Worth a Trip, Would Include JSA Next Time","We booked a trip through the website VELTRA which was very professional, would highly recommend. We booked a half day trip which provided bus transportation to a few sites including the train station and third infiltration tunnel both of which were very good. The tunnel is a decent walk and you need to crouch for half of it so being able-bodied is important, but the end of the tunnel is highly worth it (a wall which is about 150 ft away from North Korea)It's just such a unique experience visiting what is essentially a war zone in a light-hearted context - our tour guide was singing and dancing. My one suggestion is to try and incorporate the JSA into your tour if possible. That is the building where N. Korean and S. Korean soldiers are having a staring contest in the famed room. Our tour did not include thisWorth a visit if you have 3+ days in S. Korea, took about 5-6 hours with traffic."
DMZ is worth a visit.,"We took tour on very clear day .Small Seoul City tour picked us up and drove around and hour to pick others traveling parties from different places.After an hour drive we were transferred to Large coach with other group.Passport is must and after ID check up we were on our way.The Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) is a region on the Korean peninsula that demarcates North Korea from South Korea. Roughly following the 38th parallel, the 150-mile-long DMZ incorporates territory on both sides of the cease-fire line as it existed at the end of the Korean War (1950–53)We avoided going into 3rd Tunnel As it is very steep .Instead watched short video.There is lot of walking and climbing stairs.Observatory is worth a climb to see both sides on clear day.Check weather before booking."
DMZ visit ,"The DMZ itself was very interesting and a great experience. I only wish the tour could’ve been better, the military morale and welfare experience felt very rushed. If I were to do it again, I would split my tour in half and on separate days if that were even possible. "
DMZ is the fall-back tour when your DMZ/JSA tour is cancelled,"We initially booked the DMZ/JSA tour through Tripadvisor/Viator. Note, that they immediately take your money and state that there are no cancellations, but that they reserve the right to cancel the tour. We were initially told to be at our pickup point 07:10 AM, but the day before we received an email that the pickup was delayed to 07:50. A van picked us up and transported us to a big bus. It was only then that the kindly guide informed us that our DMZ/JSA tour was cancelled, but offered a JSA tour that we had to pay for immediately (Tripadvisor/Viator, we were advised, would refund our money for the cancelled tour a week later). What kind of racket is this? Viator had learned that the UN decided to make the JSA off-limits to tours the proceeding afternoon, but they only informed us to go ahead for pickup but 40 minutes later! Why couldn't they have stated, up-front, that their tour was cancelled?It seems that the JSA cancellations are a common thing. My wife had booked the same DMZ/JSA tour a year ago, and the JSA portion was cancelled. I had a brother 1-2 months ago who had his JSA tour cancelled.Now for the DMZ tour itself: There are three major stops, the North Korean tunnel, the Dora Observatory, and the DMZ train station. For the North Korean tunnel, one must walk about 650 meters at a steep slope until reaching the actual North Korean tunnel that is about 5 feet high. The walk back up to the surface is tiresome. Frankly, the time allotted for this stop is not adequate, unless you are physically in great shape and can quickly walk up/down a steep incline. Prior to the tunnel, we were ushered into a theater for a 10 minute or so video presentation -- but there were not enough seats for everyone.The second stop, the Dora Observatory, has participants waiting in line to peer through one of the telescopes -- so the majority of time is spent waiting, and not peering from a distance into North Korea.The final stop is the DMZ train station, where you can pretend to go to the train platform for a train to North Korea (that hopefully becomes a reality someday).At all three stops, there were souvenir stores where some supposed wine/liquor from North Korea is available for purchase.On the bus, we were presented with a North Korean defector who could answer questions through the guide-translator.Finally, however, we were not transported directly back to Seoul downtown, but stopped first at a jewelry store where the guide made a pitch for some gemstones. This wasted about 30 minutes of everyone's time."
Normal Place,I think this place is a military place. Everybody must shows a passport. There located at the border between North&south of korea. All tourists must buy a ticket and take a military bus for visit a whole place.
Great experience,So cool to visit the DMZ after having heard about for my entire life. Well done exhibits and a true monument to peace. Lots of difficulty for the residents here. Moving stories. Historically significant. Well controlled by a South Korean military.
Good Layover Tour,"With s 12 hour layover coming. I took advantage and booked a DMZ tour. Well worth the effort. Somewhat costly to get. Private driver ( 1.5 hours ) for distance, but glad I did. The tour company was VIP tours. Once on board the bus made three stops at relAted locations. And a final stop at the 3rd tunnel.A good way to use my extended layover "
Over paid,Payment for DMZ tour18 August 2018$200.54VIATOR4155033977I have paid the price above for DMZ tour but they took me and my friend for a half day tour today.Please check my payment with the name of Nicholas Mavroyannis ThanksSonya
A Great Tour,"Great experience to visit the De-Militarized Zone. Had to submit passport copies to the tour company ahead of time to get clearance. But it was a great experiences seeing the history of the Korean peninsular war.We also went into the 3rd infiltration tunnel which was very close to North Korea. If you are claustrophobic don't go into the tunnel as it is very narrow at times and there are lots of people. You also need to be physically prepared because it is somewhat steep slope going down and a difficult climb coming back. If you are tall, be prepared also to bend most of the walk as the tunnel roof is not that high."
Absolutely worth it!,"Visiting the JSA is well worth the trip. Need to submit passport information in advance to be cleared. We had USA Army soldiers as escorts and they are terrific-- very knowledgeable, professional, personable.For obvious reasons, the visit is structured and following the rules/instructions important.The history of the DMZ and current state is fascinating. It's a serious place, you can feel the tension but so worth seeing."
The Best Tour,The DMZ is a must if you are traveling to Seoul. The Demilitarized Zone is roughly an hour from Seoul and it follows the river and the border for part of the trip. There are a number of ways to visit the DMZ. You can go in a tour group and they visit Imjingak park where the Freedom Bridge and railway line are situated. There is also a steam locomotive which was derailed by bombs in the Korean war. The tour groups then visit the Dora Observatory and 3rd Infiltration Tunnel which is the best part of the tour. You get to walk 70m down into the tunnel which is really close to the North Korean border. We went with Seoul City Tours and they were great. A must see!
North Korea border,"Ok. Had to go. Very interested in history and politics so had to. Had a good guide and all but was a bit disappointed. Hadn’t booked early enough so not possible to go to JSA/Panmunjom. Parts was fun but Imjungak park is crap, tourist trap... and the movie they show at tunnel three is like the worts b-movie trailer that lasts 9 minutes... but Do i regret going? No. It was interesting in all."
A Very Interesting Visit,"This was one trip I will never regret! The tunnel visit was interesting, a bit tiring but definitely worth it. It gets a bit chilly in the tunnel and the trip back out was a challenge. We did a half day DMZ tour and continued with the Panmunjom JSA (Joint Security Area) tour which brings us a few steps into North Korea :).Very much recommended. "
Interesting tour,A unique experience. The DMZ is the area between north and south korea and they are technically still at war. Nice tour and i even got to purchase north korean currency at the gift shop
Interesting!,It´s a nice option visit this place. Sometimes is sad but it is a part of history. The organization is excelent!!!
Historical Tragedy,"I have actually been to the Paju DMZ twice; the first in June 2017 and the second in February 2018 (following the last minute cancelation of a tour to the notorious Panmunjeom). I thoroughly enjoyed both trips, as they shed light on one of the greatest tragedies in modern history. My favorite part was a trip to the third infiltration tunnel. However, I also greatly enjoyed Dorasan station, the observation platform, and other points of interest. Now, I must get to Panmunjeom!"
History plus a little bit of Descendants of the Sun ;P,I joined a day tour from Seoul to visit DMZ but only managed to visit the 3rd infiltration tunnel. The tunnel requires a bit of physical fitness when going up (it was a very steep and long climb going back - out of breath/sweating even if it was cold inside) and stooping for those taller than 160cm. I would suggest to visit the JSA Panmunjom also.
Worth a visit,Our excellent tour guide from Korea GPS Travel had fixed so we also had the Panmunjom visit included in this tour.Very exciting with the 3rd infiltration tunnel. Everything becomes more close and a bit unreal and scary. That US soldiers that accompany the tour is young and very serious but very polite and correct. It is well worth the trip. Very interesting sights and you learn a lot about the history and see everything up close.Our Guide Vic always had some interesting fact.
Private DMZ tour: spy invasion route ,"This tour, through Viator, was fantastic. We were picked up at our hotel by Minho, our guide. He provided amazing perspective on history and current affairs. Time spent at the Odusan observatory and military base were highlights."
2nd time in DMZ,Part of our tour package is DMZ. Although i have been here before i still get sad looking at the video and pictures in the.museumA visit to DMZ is highly recommended.There is a good reataurant in the 2nd floor that serves beef soup
Day Trip from Seoul,"Originally, I had signed up for a bus tour to the DMZ and the Joint Security Area (JSA) but the JSA part was cancelled due to a meeting between the leaders of North and South Korea being held there. It was still a good trip to see the DMZ.At the DMZ, we toured the inside of the DMZ Pavilion and saw a short video on the history of the Korean War and the DMZ. We also visited the 3rd Infiltration Tunnel which was across the road from the DMZ Pavilion.Before we arrived at the DMZ, we made a stop at Imjingak Park. After we left the DMZ stop, we visited the Dora Observatory and the Dorasan Station before heading back to Seoul."
Worth the Tour!,"To get to the DMZ it is required to be on a guided tour, personal vehicles and walkers are not allowed into the DMZ. Lots of options, I looked online and just picked a cheaper half day one and was able to communicate with them extensively via email before hand. Make sure you are clear on where you are going as there are many different places to see. We wanted to go the the Blue Buildings, Panmunjom, but the waiting list was until next month. We went on another tour that went to four different places, the park, the tunnel, the observatory and the station. It was definitely worth it and so cool!Besides Panmunjom, the next best place to see is the Dora Observatory because it is so unique. After that would be the third tunnel, and the other places are more like museums or relatively regular buildings. Bring your passport!!!!!!!!! South Korean soldiers will check you at the beginning and end, if you do not have the right documents you cannot go in."
Eye opening but don't pay beforehand,"You're only able to visit this area with specific tour groups in Seoul and it's a unique experience being at a place that is both well known and dangerous at the same time.There were no North Korean guards when we visited and we have to follow many rules like specific clothing and no random photo taking, but the trip itself was well worth it.Will strongly recommend visiting this place if you're into history and politics, but be aware that trips here can be cancelled at any time due to various reasons, so be sure to go with a legit tour company. Be sure to go with a tour company where you can pay only on the day of the tour, so you don't have to go through the hassle of a refund if anything happens.We went with Cosmojin and the tour company allowed us to pay via cash on the day of the tour itself. "
At the brink of the hermit kingdom,"Touring the DMZ is a must for anyone visiting South Korea. Within a few hours, you’ll see at least four important sites that offer a glimpse into the most mysterious country on earth! Walk through Dorasan Station, the last train stop prior to the abrupt termination of the tracks just shy of North Korea, perhaps in the not so distant future a metaphorical bridge between the two countries.Peer into the secretive society of the DPRK from the optimal vantage point at the Dora Observatory, where barb-wire fences to the south and a watch tower to the north mark the framework of the DMZ, the actual international border lying between the two. A gleaming North Korean city stands on the horizon while a decoy propaganda village lies to the east.See the terminus of the Third Tunnel discovered in 1978, the North Koreans just feet from a secret entryway into the South before being caught in the act. Read my TripAdvisor review on this location and DON’T take the lengthy walk to the actual barricade, a complete waste of time. But the tunnel is of moderate interest.DO book a tour that includes Panmunjon! The tourists who had to depart without any hope of stepping into North Korea were jealous of the few of us who did our research. This kicks the DMZ tour up to a perfect 5! Visiting the infamous blue huts, the table at which presidents and politicians have sat, and standing just inside the most dangerous country in the world for westerners was enough to put chills down your spine! Without this addendum to the DMZ tour, your trip will be incomplete and the experience only 4 stars."
Come and compared north and south,"This line separates the north and south, make this place is the place too visit if you want to see how different the north and south"
Amazing atmosphere right on the border,"I did a half day tour. It was amazing to see the NK-SK soldiers just next to each other on the demarcation line. Though taking the photos is a bit limited due to security reasons, the opportunities do arise. We saw the waving NK visitors just over the border but were told not to wave back."
DMZ - PEACE breaking out across the Peninsula,"With peace breaking out across the peninsula, going to the DMZ is like going to the Berlin Wall before it was torn down. We took a DMZ Spy Tour guided by Sunny, Our tour started near the Presidential Blue House where we stood at the checkpoint that the North Koreans were captured 100 meters from the Blue House trying to kill the South Korean President in 1968.Next we went to the Odusan Unification Observatory to peer into North Korea. This observatory was not crowded and allowed for deep reflection as we saw how close North Korea is. We could even see people farming through the binoculars.Next we went to a section of the DMZ where the 1968 North Korean soldiers had cut through the fence in their assassination attempt. It is amazing to see the overgrowth inside of the DMZ knowing that it was a mine filled wasteland in the 1950s.We finished off our tour at the Korean War Museum in Seoul to round out our experience.Unfortunately, when we scheduled our tour, the JSA where the North and South Koreans guard the border at Panmunjom was closed to tourists because peace talks are still taking place. You will need to ask your tour operator if the JSA is open during your visit. I definitely want to go back when the JSA is open. Amy Moncure Travel YouTuber"
Mandatory tour if you visit SK,"Very impressive tour to the border of North Korea. The infiltration tunnels are amazing and you learn a lot about the history and the conflict between the two countries. The only ""negative"" aspect is the exaggeratedly heroic (Americanized) portrayal, which is more reminiscent of ""patridiotism"" than of factual and historical discussion."
Nothing like being there on the ground!,"We have been hearing and reading so much about the tensions between North and South Korea in the past few months and finally we got the opportunity to visit the DMZ - but only at Imjingak region (the whole area is a military zone). We were told that there is still land mines hidden in the forest areas and only certain areas are cleared of mines, safe and accessible to the military and public. The Panmunjon area was closed off however. Our visit also took place 2 weeks after US President Trump met North Korea's Kim in Singapore on 12 Jul.We booked a 1/2 day morning tour and were picked by around 730am by coach. The group was around 40 and our local guide spoke quite good English and was friendly and helpful. We toured the war relics and old locomotive that bore the marks of the Korean war. Walked into one of the tunnels that the North has dug into South. That was a challenging one as it was around 300m deep and steep descend. About 2/3 of the way, it was the tunnel ceiling was low and we had to bend while walking (with safety helmets. After that we visited the Dorasan international rail way station terminal which is the last station before leaving South Korea, before entering North. There we used the immigration chop to stamp onto a KRW1000 note to get the ""chop mark"" for souvenir. This station is operational and visitors and tourist can take the train from Seoul to Dorasan station to visit the DMZ. Its only 56km from central Seoul.At the observation deck, we could see North Korea's flag flying on a flag pole that is more than 100m high. Of course there is also a South Korean flag on the near side. Our guide shared with us that the it used to be competition of egos as to who has the tallest flag pole - but she said that its not the case now and the North's flag pole is not higher. ""what's the point of having the highest pole any way?"".It was a good trip and experience for us to be there, see, touch and feel it for ourselves. The recent Trump-Kim meeting added the the overall experience and excitement in some ways. Let's see how history will play out in the future as there may or may be a DMZ in the future."
Just being there is worth the effort and time,"We went to the DMZ as part of a tour group. Being my first time to South Korea, I really did not know what to expect. I was amazed how close the DMZ is to Seoul, and how quickly we arrived there. Unfortunately, the DMZ seems to have become a tourist destination, and the history and meaning of the area seems to have been lost. We also did the ""Tunnel #3 tour"", which was interesting, but not really much more than a giant whole in the ground. This is one of those places you should visit at least once, but really, not a whole lot to see."
Must experience,"A trip to the DMZ is definitely a trip worth taking when visiting Seoul. Visiting the DMZ gives you a chance to see North and South Korean soldiers standing face to face on either side of the 38th parallel. While you must go with a tour group and can only take pictures when given permission, the trip is educational and a unique experience. "
Not the best tour-,"The 1/2 day tour we booked started very early (pick up before 730 am about 1.5 miles from our hotel). NO Breakfast nor lunch options was provided (other than BYO snacks). Also, at the end of the tour we were inclined to stop by this Ginseng shop, which was a flagrant tourist-bait-trap wherein vendors attempted to vent the miraculous merits of the plant as a desperate selling pitch. Based on my experience, which spans tours over nearly 100 countries, I would not recommend this tour-"
Fascinating!,"Went to South Korea for my birthday and I was never disappointed. Everything was just absolutely amazing, especially our tour to DMZ, it was worth the 5:30 am early wake up call. It was a 6 hours day tour, visited the 3rd infiltration tunnel it was very steep going down the tunnel and you would literally get tired but it was all worth it, (should not be missed) Dora observatory point where you could see the difference between South and North Korea. Learned so much about their history. Worth everything!!!"
INCREDIBLE! Dripping history and hope of what's to come.,"This was one of the highlights of my visit to South Korea. To see and walk about in the places viewed in documentaries, the news and history books was an amazing experience I'll never forget.We booked a six hour trip and could have spent much longer, so fascinating. So much to see and experience. From the huge observation area you can see far into North Korea and get a bird's eye view of Freedom Bridge. The site is a dichotomy of a tragic and divisive past and a renewed hope for a united future. The rusty old train engine riddled with bullet holes transported me to the time of terrible combat between the North and the South, yet metres away sits the shining new train station, patiently waiting for the coming together of the two sides.I can still smell the earthy rock and water scent that hung in the air of the underground infiltration tunnel as we walked to the closest point civilians get to the North Korea border. You can see North Korea past the South Korea blockade in the tunnel. One can't help but think of the North Koreans toiling to dig the lengthy tunnel and wonder what exactly was the purpose, the plan. The tunnel walk is a fair distance to complete, easy going in with a decent slope down. The lighting and hand rail helped and the walking surface is flat and even. Coming back up can be a bit of a challenge if your'e not in okay shape. I took my time coming back and appreciated those handrails. Seeing the Joint Security Area where talks between North Korea and South Korea occur was thought-provoking. Recalling images of the exact place a soldier ran for his life in a barrage of bullets on November 2017, was humbling. The contrasts were mind-boggling as I faced the most militarized border in the world. Having left Seoul, a bustling, dynamic city full of architecturally brilliant structures to view a vast land of emptiness left me in a pensive state. How could this be?Then we were off to see the beautiful, gleaming train station, never used but for tourists, built in anticipation of peace and open borders. The security area of the station remains empty, visible through the glass ceiling to floor wall. A gift shop looks minuscule in the cavernous space but surprisingly holds a nice variety of decent, quality souvenirs. I love baseball caps and found a great DMZ number that's become my favourite.This tour is the most intriguing tour I have taken. With the yo-yo events of the past year being at North and South Korea's heavily guarded demilitarized zone was exhilarating!When you go don't forget your passports. And bring a jacket. The tunnel is chilly."
Must visit place...,"Straight from the airport to DMZ Zone. 3.5 hrs drive. First stop Imjingak Park to see the Freedom bridge. Fascinating history. Second stop Dora observatory point. With binoculars we were able to see North Korea boarder. Look out for the flag posts and North Korean propaganda town.Next stop at 3rd Infiltration tunnel. 1.95 m high, 2.1 m wide and 1635 m long tunnel is one of the four out of 17 tunnels found by South Korean military. Jackets, cameras, phones should kept inside the lockers outside. Incline pathway is easy to walk down but coming up is another story. Steep climb .There are benches along the way to rest. Must wear the helmet provided to protect our head in the low areas of the tunnel. At the bottom of the tunnel ceiling is much lower than the other parts. At some places we had to bend our knees. We were allowed to walk as far as the third concrete blockade and saw the second blockade through a small window. Hard but worth the walk.Audio – visual presentation at the auditorium gave the history of Korean war.Last stop at Dorasan station which is the last station before North Korea.A day well spent. A tour won’t be completed without visiting DMZ."
P E A C E !,This was our 2nd visit to this place - the mood is kinda relaxed as the north and south are talking. This is a good development and hoping that our next visit to include Pyongyang! 
AWESOME!!!,I had one of the most memorable experiences of my life going here. Make sure you take the time to go visit this place
"if you like history, It's worth it.","Will be able to visit 4 different sightseeing points, that....without history knowledge, they will not be a big attraction ! But if you know a little bit about korean war history, definitely worth it!Almost all the tour includes a Jingsen museum ( kind of boring) so Its better if you only take the half day tourInstead of taking all day tour, I will definitely advice you to visit the War memorial of Korea (free)"
A must see!,We travelled to the DMZ on a tour. There is so much history to learn. The view to North Korea was fantastic. We also visited the 3rd Infiltration tunnel. It was very steep but amazing. Well worth the effort to see.
Vast majority of the DMZ is a nature preserve,"The actual DMZ consists of a 4km swath of land throughout the width of the peninsula. Except for 1 village on either side, directly opposite each other adjacent to the JSA, the entire DMZ is completely devoid of any human interaction so it’s turned into a fantastic area for flora and fauna."
DMZ Tour,If you are in Seoul then you have to take the DMZ tour.You'll learn so much about the history of South and North Korea.
"Worth a visit, full of interesting sites and stops, and full of modern political history.","The tour along the DMZ in South Korea is an interesting lesson in modern history. There are many stops along the way at nature area parks such as Freedom Park which has an eclectic set of educational and quirkiness with its photo opportunities and exhibits. There is also Dorasan Station and Observation Post where you can look over in to North Korea with binoculars for 500won. There is also a topographic recreation of the DMS inside the auditorium where photos are NOT allowed. Soldiers come out and delete your photos of the map if they see you taking pictures. =DThere are also restaurants and Imjingpak Station where there is a park and restaurant as well. Most tours to the DMZ are arranged by bus tours. You can find them on Viator and more online to compare tours and prices. We took the DMZ Train, that only runs once a day. It's great if you are an adventurer and want a different experience from the bus tours. A couple cautions is that it is entirely in Korean and that it it's an all day experience. If you want an English speaking or Chinese speaking (and some Russian speaking) tours I highly recommend you book a bus tour through a booking company like Viator or Veltra.. In Korea it is Cosmojin and a few others that run big tour operations. "
Quite an Experience,"We took a guided tour of the DMZ and it was quite an experience. While the DMz has become a tourist destination as you explore around it is important to understand the history and current day tensions that exist. I really believe it's important to take a step back as you view across to NK and contemplate all that has gone on around the area between the north, south and rest of the world. Definitely a must see if you are visitng the region."
DMZ Tour,"We booked the JSA / DMZ tour with Korridor Tours. They gave us a quote of KWR 96,600 per person for the entire tour and KWR 45000 per person for the DMZ tour .You compulsorily need to go through a tour company and book well in advance to reserve the dates as it does not operate everyday. In the JSA tour you technically enter North Korea from inside the UN building. We were very excited for that part of the tour but unfortunately got a mail saying that the JSA had been cancelled due to inter Korean summit. We could now only do the DMZ tour. We met our tour operator at 8 am and it was a 40 min drive. We passed through all the outskirts and entered the military controlled area. Our first stop was the 3rd infiltration Tunnel where we entered th tunnel secretly dug by North Korea. People suffering from heart diseases, leg / knee problem, claustrophobia are adviced to stay away from entering the tunnel. Dora observatory was our next stop where we got to see a city of North Korea. If you are lucky you will spot the vehicles and people on the other side. The propoganda being played in North Korea can be heard loud and clear from the observatory tower. Dorasan station was our next stop and it is the last station of South Korea. Various slogans hoping for unification and a small train museum can be visited inside the Dorasan station. The entry is 1000 KWR per person.  They arranged for lunch in a restaurant at our own cost. It was around KWR 7000 & KWR 10000 per person for a chicken or a beef meal respectively. They had variety of options and it was a scrumptious meal. We then headed over to the Imjingak Park to see the monuments from during the Korean war. You can also see the foundation of Eurasia railway tracks which leads to North Korea and then all the way to Europe. Overall it was a great experience and everyone visiting South Korea must do this tour. "
Fascinating,"Getting so close to North Korea was amazing. It’s truly fascinating to think of how this country is run, so close to where you are.The observatory is great, the tunnel is interesting and the whole experience is definitely worthwhile."
Not sure whats going on here,"It was an interesting visit. Very young soldiers. Follow the rules and your ok but wander off...watch, who knows what will happen. The tunnel is difficult if you have a bad back and not worth. Overlooking the DMZ was very interesting if you can stand the loud music and announcements."
DMZ,"what a great place to visit. it was very cool when i went through the tunnel it was magnificient, its very easy when you go down but when you go back, it was very hard. this place is very historical for me. this is the place that you must visit when you in south korea. not just for holiday, you can learn moer about korea history speacially abotu south korea."
the only place on earth that hasnt been touched for past 70 years.,DMZ is a result of the sad Korean War in 1950~1953. The country was divided into north and south artificially and temporarily in 1945. however it became virtually permanent for past 70 + years. But We Koreans still dont give up hopes to see Korea to be reunited again soon in the democratic way. Only God knows when North Korea will crumble and fall so the Korea can be one again and the divided families can meet again ~
DMZ - A trip not to be missed when in Seoul,"Joined a half-tour to DMZ and it was quite a good one. Journey took one and the half hour and we visited Freedom Bridge and the main highlight spots, Infiltration Tunnel and Dorasan Observatory. The tunnel is quite long and as you walk down the tunnel it gets narrow at the bottom. Look around the tunnel and you can find dynamite marks around it. Walking back up the tunnel is quite tiring so please wear a pair of comfy walking shoes. Dorasan Observatory offers you a very nice view of the border so go for the binoculars and see North Korea border from the platform. Get some DMZ souvenirs from the shops. "
Good one!! A must in Korea,"It was a great tour, the bad side is the short time in each of the stations of the tour, but it was great to visit the most tense frontier in the world!!!A lot of people doing the tour but is enought space for everybody"
Do you research. Then go.,"One of the most interesting things I’ve done. The tour I went on went to the JSA and then stopped by a park afterward. Things to know: The tour doesn’t last long. In my mind, it was going to be a bit touristy, but it wasn’t at all. This is the spot where it all goes done. As soon as you get close, the tone gets really serious. People are definitely hurried along, but that’s largely because you at a military site. Before you go, lean a little history. There was a lot of interesting tidbits that come out on the tour. The guide I had was very nice, however English was definitely a second language. If I was talking directly with her I could understand without a problem. But I know people in the back of the group, where she wasn’t as loud, as a hard time deciphering. Also, the tour is just a lot more interesting if you have a sense of what you’re looking at and don’t need to be told every detail. Overall, I’d definitely go. Kids would probably find it pretty boring. Wait until they’re old enough to appreciate standing on the North Korea side of a conference room. Tip: you can pay for this tour with a credit card. The meeting place is at a hotel, but the agency’s office is on the second floor. When you go there to check in, they take cash or credit."
Solo trip by DMZ train,Most people tell you to book a tour to visit the DMZ tourist area but you can go alone and at short notice. You can buy a ticket for the special DMZ train from Seoul Station to Dorisan and then you can purchase a bus tour ticket from the Conductor on the train. Much cheaper option and the bus takes you to some great spots to appreciate the history including one of the infiltration tunnels. I bought a ticket and travelled on the same day in March 2018.
Must do,Well worth the half day needed for this visit! Eye opening tour that helped us understand the history and tensions on the Korean Peninsula. It takes about 3 hours to travel back and forth and at least 2 hours to do the tour there.It’s been more than 6 decades that the demilitarised zone was agreed upon but it looked very much militarised because of the continued tensions.It’s mostly outdoors so wear comfortable shoes and have a warm jacket handy.
My dream to visit this place,"I have always wanted to visit this place, but thought I would never get there!Excellent place to visit.Dorosan StationGet in to the station quick. They have some interesting souvenirs and you only get 15 minutes.Hint: buy a ticket at Dorosan station for your trip to North Korea (one way only!). Great memento.Lookout site.Get to see North Korea and some of the guardhouses alone the border.Tunnel site.The tunnel ride is not for the disabled, so spend some time, doing the movie and the museum. Very interesting to read about the tunnels and the various incidents.Lots of space, to wander around, but not much to see at the tunnel site otherwise."
A trip to another world,"A day trip to remember to the border to North Korea. One wishes that this will soon be a memory of the past. Demilitarized zone at Panmunjeom Village with US soldier who gives you a 10 minute briefing ot the history that should take 15. But he speeks sooo fast that most - also lots of Chinese - can’t follow. Whole day trip which gives you a view in the worlds probably most secret country. Somehow pervert that South Koreans make money from of the unwanted border. You can spare your self the walk down to the third invasion tunnel. You don’t really see much there, not worth the exhausting way back up (unless the transport works). Freedom bridge with look through the fence impressive and a bit depressing. Close to the Dora Observatory you can hear the propaganda speakers from North Korea. All together: go there! Makes a trip to Seoul complete (transfer by bus around 75 to 90 minutes one way)"
Worth Visit while in South Korea,"I took one day trip from Seoul, i do recommend to go there while you are in Seoul. You can see North Korea from the boarder. "
Do not miss a chance to step into North Korea,"This was the one thing I did not want to miss on my trip to South Korea. There are several tour options involving the Demilitarized Zone between the Koreas; be sure to book one that includes the Joint Security Area. That's the highlight of the DMZ tour: a visit the U.N. building set aside for face-to-face talks -- and it straddles the Military Demarcation Line so you technically can stand in North Korea. This is one of the last remnants of the Cold War era, but it's more than just a tourist stop -- you are constantly reminded that tensions are still high. The DMZ was created to enforce a cease fire, but the trappings of war are everywhere -- barbed wire, guard posts -- and your ID will be checked by military personnel a half-dozen times. The most bizarre stop on the tour is the observation platform where you can look directly into North Korea, and hear their propaganda broadcasts and music being blasted to the south. There may not be another place like this on the planet. Be aware, too, that even though you book a JSA tour, it could be canceled at any time if military activities are scheduled. Generally they will give you enough notice that you can move your tour to another day -- that happened to me, and I was lucky enough to have the flexibility -- but you also could be stuck with a last-minute cancellation."
Dynamite and tunnel,Amazing! A must do if you're in Seoul! Our tour guide Gabi is so knowledgable. The commemoration stamps at Dorasan station is a must too! When walking thru the tunnel you can see the Dynamite marks on the ceilings (:
A border that shouldn't be missed.,"Anyone visiting Korea really shouldn't miss the chance to see this symbol--more than a symbol, really--of the division of the peninsula."
Great tour,"It is a really amazing insight of the border between South and North Korea.We went on a tour that lasted approximately 3 hours. Seen the Dora observatory from where you can see through a telescope in North Korea and learn a bit more about the DMZ, the Third Tunnel (nothing to see down there really) and the Dorasan Station.I really enjoyed the expereience"
DMZ half day tour,"I recommend for travellers to get the DMZ full day tour with JSA. It’s the most exciting part of the tour but unfortunately, my friend and I just bought the tickets for the half day tour. It was good but not as good as with the full day tour. In the half day tour, you will experience visiting the tunnel to north korea and visit the Dorasan station that connects North and South. "
Pointless without JSA,"The basic DMZ tour doesn't allow to see the houses built on the border, and walk into DPRK.We basically spent a half day to walk into a dark tunnel and see DPRK from a hill 1km away...Please make sure you book the full-day tour that includes JSA, Panmujon"
Get the Full Day Tour!,"I went with the half day tour with the DMZ, tunnel, dora san station/observatory and imjin bridge. it was quite interesting (though walking in the tunnel is really tiring!), but it seems I got a half baked experience. I guess seeing the Panmunjom would answer my other questions. So if you got time, book the full day tour."
DMZ,Interesting place. It is worth visiting for people interested in history and politics. There are several tour agencies which offer daily trips. Prices are acceptable. A half day tour gives quite a lot information. Full day tours are also available. DMZ tunnels and Dora Observatory are the most interesting locations to visit in my opinion.
Experience DMZ,Visitors should defently visit DMZ.The most safe place all over the world.Interesting experience and a place with high historical importance!!
A tour which includes Panmunjom should be more interesting,"Our DMZ tour did not include Panmunjom as you have to book it 2-week ahead of time. We went last October. It was very warm the day before (27c) and we were not able to find weather forecast of DMZ. So we wore light summer clothes. Wrong. It was cloudy and with light rain on that day. The temperature was just around 15c. Weather can be highly unpredictable. We departed at the Seoul Station. The special train that runs from Seoul to DMZ is painted with cheerful cartoon figures on the outside. The inside of the train is painted with cartoon animals. It tries to create a sense of peace and happiness (?) for a ride to the border of the most secluded country in the world. The whole train ride is about 1.5 hours.The train stopped at a train station. We stayed there for about 20 mins to take picture, use the washroom and buy snacks at the convenient store. As I mentioned, we had only light summer clothes, we bought t-shirts and wore them on top of our shirts. A hoodie with the word DMZ is US$50. Then we took a tourist bus from the train station to a memorial square. We spent about 20 mins there and boarded the bus again. Then we went on to go to the observation deck which is near “tunnels”. An important tip: before you leave your seats, put something (a newspaper or a jacket) there to “hold” your seats. A guy and his family took all of our seats when we finished the memorial ground and went back to the bus again. There is really no point to explain or argue as they do not (or pretend that they don’t) understand English. Frankly, even if they didn’t speak English, they knew very well that they took our seats. The tour guide just ignored us and we needed to search for empty seats. It left a bad impression after this.Then we went to the observation deck area and visited the tunnel. We could see the other side of the border. It is just like any other rural area and you need to add your own imaginations. It took about 15-20 mins to go down the tunnel and come back up. It is cold there and the slope is quite steep. We then visited the small museum before we boarded the bus again. We spent less than 1.5 hours there before we returned to the tour bus. The bus then took us to a gas station type of area. There is a canteen and a convenient store for people to get lunch, snacks and souvenirs. After this stop, we were back to the train station and headed back to Seoul.I don’t find the tour too interesting. Other than the tunnel and the museum, everything we saw was just like a trip to a poor rural area. You see only grass and plants with the use of the binocular at the observation deck to see the other side of the border. The trip can be condensed into a half-day. The tour to Panmunjom, to see the blue houses and guard change should be a lot more interesting."
Very interesting and quite a workout!,"I've always been fascinated by North Korea so I could never miss the chance of being this close! I paid 60usd for the tour and I think it was an OK price. Could have been way cheaper if I got there by myself. There you not only have the chance to see North Korea as you can go down a tunnel built by North Koreans in an attempt to invade Seoul. Going down the tunnel was easy, coming back not so much!!!"
Peace,"A must see place when you plan to visit South Korea. Very historical, very informative. This place must be one of your top priorities in SK."
DMZ - South Korea.,"The DMZ is a spectacular area dividing South Korea from the North, with 4 exposed tunnels so far built with invasion in mind, a new railhead and station already built and awaiting reunification, watch towers, guided tours and lots of detailed information, a meeting area for relatives wanting to leave messages for loved ones still living in the North, and a whole lot more."
Recollection of the Cold War ,"We started from Seoul with an organized tour. The plan was to visit monuments, 3rd tunnel, train station and observation point. The full tour was excellent, giving a good overview of the war, aftermath to current situation. Strong recommendation if you come to Korea."
Historic Place,"It is the closest you can get to North Korea. You can see the other side and feel quite weird as ""they can invade at any time"". Historic divisional line to settle the Korean War. Place to see once in life. I visit this place 2016."
Take tours that includes Panmunjom,"We booked a tour through Tour dmz agency. The booking needs to be done few days prior so they can arrange it. It was mentioned that this agency is the only company to handle saturday tours to panmunjom.If you are visiting the dmz, specifically check if it includes a visit to panmunjom. That's the most heated place and the highlight of the whole tour. "
Tense JSA,"Utterly silent whenever I've been. DPRK and ROK soldiers standing guard, stock-still (and looking very cool, I gotta say). Beautiful, clean, and presumably empty buildings."
One of its kind ,Epic journey.. the tour was very well organized and the guide was fantastic. Everything was timely executed. The security is well organized and have strict rules. If visiting south Korea this is a MUST VISIT
Sureal place,Very intresting place to see and feel the ongoing struggle between north and south.Take a bustour - I missed JSA but i heard it should be really worth it!A must for everybody who wants to see north korea with his own eyes... even though just from distance
DMZ Tour Great experience,When we were there there was a paju ginseng festival interesting to see fresh produce grown from the DMZ. We went on the DMZ tour and went to the infiltration tunnel and toured around the DMZ. A nice experience when you have extra time in Korea to know more about South and North korea relations.
Dmz,"Ok to see, but it's really that much. Take a quick tour and see. Be there and å Nice day and you can ser ut all"
Great to hear their side of the story,I just loved my trip here. There is a slight tension in the air which is definitely helped by the soldiers who accompany you. The guide was excellent and very friendly. It was hilarious as he told us the story of the place where the armistice agreement was signed. It was in a tent so the Americans could not be humiliated by the presence of a permanent structure to show their defeat. So the Koreans built one on the spot where the tent was - that will show them !Very interesting and a lot of fun !The afternoon we were there one of the soldiers got shot running over to the south. I hope it wasn't any of the soldiers we were with as they were such nice guys !
Must do,When in Seoul this is a must stop. To be so close to a very dangerous regime and learning about the history of Korea is a must do. We went through USO office at Camp Kim. Half day tour $41. 
Informative and Surreal,"Very informative tour and the whole experience seems so surreal that you can go into a place that is technically at war and you can go into the heart of the war zone. The 3rd Infiltration tunnel (be wary of the walking since it can be very tiring going back up), Dora observatory where you can see North Korea from afar and the Dorasan Station where the train that supposedly goes to North Korea are the three main attractions in this place. The JSA is usually a separate half-day tour (stricter rules like no children, proper clothing, etc.) where the actual meeting places of the representatives from both sides can be found."
Very Interesting,"Great tour, throughly enjoyed it and highly recommended. Only slight downside was I felt that it was a little rushed, but that didn't take anything away from how good it was!"
Private tour,"We took a private tour with Kmemories. You still go with the DMZ bus that drops you off the areas but it was great to have a guide to show you around. There were a couple of stops at the train station, dora observatory, 3rd infiltration tunnel and the gift shop."
Great sample of history,"Visiting the DMZ puts a lot of history in perspective. It shows to what degree a crazy mindset can take that whole Korean nation, one half against the other.We drove from the Seoul area to Imjingak, where we took the tour. Driving from Seoul is only 60km but traffic is pilling up fast. So leave early. We left very early in the morning and it took 90 minutes.Arrive early!!! The ticket office opens at 09:00, but the line starts before 08:00 and grows fast. The first bus leaves at 09:20 , and there is one every 20 minutes. The tour takes between 2:30 and 3 hours. It includes a visit to the 3rd tunnel (do not miss), where you can see how much work was invested by the North, until it was discovered after 1600 meters, in 1953 to infiltrate the South.The tour also includes interesting view of the border and the North side. At that border point, the South is playing loud music towards the North.We took the monorail to the tunnel, although you can also walk these 360 meters. It saves time and is unique.The tour costs 12,200krw (about $12) per petson.It is worth travelling regardless of the time it takes"
Great Visit,This was a great and informative tour. I wish we would of prepared more for it to go on the day long tour as we did not know it was only offered during certain times and with 48 hours notice. The half day tour though was still well worth it. 
"Interesting, but very rushed","Although the place has an unquestionable political and historical importance, I would only suggest this tour for people who have a long period to stay in Seoul. The tour is very rushed, and you will only have a few minutes to enjoy the sites. The descent into the third tunnel is a nightmare, and recommended only for people in good shape. Although the guides are friendly and the company serious, there is a final stop at a ginseng factory that is totally unnecessary and that makes you lose 40 precious minutes. Conclusion, do this tour only if you are fanatic about the subject, or if you are going to stay a long time in seoul."
Sobering even when going there for a second time ,Did the half-day trip again and still a sobering experience. Last time the grim autumn weather added more desolation and grimness to the place. DMZ 10-minute video show was good and did hit a raw nerve that until recently the 'North' has been keeping up the physical attacks on the 'South'. The Koreans still talk glowingly about unification and helping out the wretched people while others in the world think otherwise. Hopefully it will all end up well.
"Sobering, there are still divisions in the world","Just a wonderful experience to see the DMZ and learn more about the history there. I did not know it is covered with land mines for example. A beautiful place. After seeing how big Seoul is and really a lack of much open space, it is interesting that the location that was born in conflict is really a refuge now to wildlife and open space. Definitely worth the trip and the tour was wonderful. "
Excellent tour,With all the latest drum banging that has the world on tender hooks it becomes even more interesting to visit the DMZ. The concept has been designed to give people hope but I don't know why as they have uncovered quite a few enormous tunnels and they suspect there are more which make it possible for the North to sneak into South Korea. However despite all that it is a fascinating glimpse into the mysterious shenanigans of these two countries and to hope that all the nonsense will end soon. You can go on a walking tour down the tunnel but I preferred not to as I heard it is quite claustrophobic and rather low for tall people.
Do the full day tour its a good experience,"We did the DMZ-JSA tour. I think this is unique to Korea that's why you have to really see it yourself. It may change in the near future.I wasn't comfortable sending my passport information to the travel company but from what I have read it is pretty common. Read all the reviews about the tour group before you book.On the bus ride you will have your tour guide and an actual military guy to give you background, reminders and warnings. The tour guide speaks good english, he can answer your questions and the military guy is an American stationed there. There are certain areas where you cannot take photos, one of them is the 3rd infiltration tunnel. We chanced upon a platoon of young cadets in the tunnel. As soon as we are back in the surface, some ladies took pictures with them. I guess the K-drama ""Descendants of the Sun"" was one of the reasons why men in uniform in Korea became more attractive to the ladies. Everyone one took photos with our own military guy guide in the camp. If you are claustrophobic or not really physically fit, they won't recommend you to go to the tunnel. You will just actually walk down there and the last stop was a very small glass where you can view the other part of the tunnel and it is really nothing much. It's the experience of walking through the tunnel not what you will actually see there so don't expect much.The tour guides didn't really highlight where the Axe Murder Incident happened but when I got to the Freedom Bridge it brought back those articles I read about it. If you know the history or if you will read some of info before you go there then you will appreciate it more. Even if you do not read beforehand, it will be part of your tour since they will ask everyone to watch a video in a mini theater.The Freedom House was interesting too. We saw a ""Bob"" a North Korean military guard. Apparently he doesn't stand there all day, they will pop out and then will be gone without anyone noticing.I think there is really nothing much to see at the Dora Observatory as well but since it is part of the tour just go ahead and check it out.They built a train station and it's not really operational. You can get a little slip where you can stamp something that proves that you have been there.Those on half-day tour was separated from us who booked a full-day. The first half wouldn't be enough if you want to get the actual look and feel of the DMZ."
Excellent tour of living history,"The demilitarized zone of North and South Korea needs no explanation. It is an active war zone and every step of the way you are reminded of that fact. Driving to Paju, you see barbed wired fences and guard towers lining the Han river, and you feel that you are approaching a place in the world that is far from normal.The arrival area has the friendship bridge, a monument to the Korean War, and some remnants of the conflict. From there, you can only peek into the South Korean side of the DMZ. For the real experience, the bus tour is a requirement. The highlight of the tour was the Dora Observatory, where you actually can see into North Korea and the eerily uninhabited Propaganda Village. Bizarre was the best way to describe it. The Third Tunnel was also an amazing experience. This is a tunnel dug by North Korea for the purpose of invading South Korea, which was discovered in 1974. You can go into the tunnel all the way to the blocked portion. The North Koreans attempted to mask their invasion attempt by painting the tunnel walls with coal dust and claiming it was to mine coal. The walls are still lined with coal dust. There is also an ultramodern train station ready to accept passengers to and from the North as a symbol for peace.This is an amazing experience that ought not to be missed when visiting South Korea."
Full Day Tour,"Booked a full day tour of the DMZ and JSA. Cost was 260,000 won. We had to meet at a hotel in downtown Seoul at 8:00am. We then got on a tour bus and off we went on our full day tour. Also, before hand, we had to send in our passport pictures and information. You will also need to show your passport at all DMZ checkpoints. Full day stops included:Joint Security AreaMAC Conference RoomFreedom HouseFreedom BridgeThe 3rd TunnelDora ObservatoryDorasan StationBriefing in CampBonifasAlso included in the tour was lunch. This is a full day tour and will take around 10-11 hours. Tips:Tour route and schedule are subject to change without notice whenever there is an official request from the UNC."
"A quite different tourist experience, highly recommended","Our DMZ tour was in the morning, part of a combined DMZ-JSA tour booked via Viator, well organised, on time, and a well spoken English language guide. The tour took in the Dora Observatory, the Dorasan Station, the 3rd Tunnel, and Imjingak. Very enjoyable and highly recommended."
Great experience and firsthand view of an ongoing conflict,"Many people forget that the two sides never declared an end to their civil war - they only signed an armistice to cease hostilities. This can be clearly seen if you take this tour to the DMZ. The tension in this area, which is evident by the readiness of the South Korean guards that will watch over you while on this tour, is palatable.Once you read the museum/gift shop area, you'll get a quick briefing on the war, the agreement, and the current state of the area. After this brief video, you'll board a bus controlled by the military in this area and head to the DMZ buildings we have all seen in photos. This part of the trip is very tightly controlled, as it is still an active war, even if neither side is shooting.They will cover some of the more unique sites in this location, such as Freedom Village and the guard towers that can be seen on from the road. Once you get to the DMZ negotiation zone, however, that is where the real sights can be seen. You'll get to enter one of the blue buildings (hopefully, sometimes they are closed for security purposes) and see where bilateral talks occur between the two sides. While inside here, the door to the North Korean side will be closed and guarded, which will allow you to move around freely and even stand on the North Korean side of the building. You can claim to have been inside North Korea, even if only along the DMZ.If you're really lucky, you'll see a few North Korean guards on their side of the DMZ doing their drill and ceremony or merely watching you. It is quite interesting to think that these two people, who share so much in common, are so hostile towards one another. The guards on the South will tell you though that they hope for a unified Korea one day.Overall, this was a very intense and worthwhile visit to an active demilitarized zone. The fact that the tensions between the two sides has been high of late only made the trip all the more worthwhile."
An unusual destination,"The visit was to the Demilitarized Zone, between North and South Korea. Recent activities in that region prompted to make this trip. With the help of a tour group by bus we traveled almost an hour from Seoul to reach the DMZ. First stop was at a railway station that connected North and South Korea. The stay was very short, about 15 minutes. Then off to to a place closer to the boarder, where you can see through binoculars, North Korean town, it's flag and country side. This stay was about 30 minutes. Then off to visit the tunnel. It was a short ride, about 15 minutes. This is a tunnel supposedly North Korea has used to infiltrate into South Korea. It is long and not so high tunnel with 15 degree incline. Visitors with disabilities, asthma might find it difficult to go down and come back up. You can see dynamite marks, black powder on the ceiling and at the end of the tunnel you are about 5 km from North Korea."
Highly recommended,"Took us an hour to reach the first point. Imgingak park. Or the freedom park. This is where the dispersed family get to meet on a periodic basis. Consists of a theme park, few monuments and the bell of peace. The old bullet ridden steam engine was the highlight of this place. Spent 30 minutes walking around here. From here we headed into the demilitarized zone and into the 3rd infiltrated tunnel. It consists of a 8 minute video followed by the museum visit. We then get to descent via a long sloping walkway into the tunnel. No cameras or any other personal belongings allowed here. This was very good and it showed the lengths the country's went to to sabotage each other. From here went to the Dorasan train station. This used to the transit station between the south and the north when there used to be limited amount of industries and trade between the two. It has been disused since 2008. Now only used for one train a day to Seoul for tourists. We were supposed to go to an observatory tower. But it was unfortunately closed today due to a military training exercise. Shame as the weather was perfect to view over across the border. Perhaps another day.After the train station we were told a bit about the history and some interesting stories. The guide has a friend (who is also a guide for this same company) who defected from north Korea 5 years ago. An interesting insight to the ways of the northern Korea. From here we headed back to Seoul. Overall it was a decent tour. It did feel a bit rushed. We did waste a lot of time collecting people. I reckon a smaller minivan type tour would've been better as they try to maximise the entire 45 seater coach. Our guide was good but would've liked a bit more about the relation between the south and the north and some first-hand anecdotes would be good (the north Korean defector story was interesting, Maybe A Bit More On This Topic)"
Very interesting and well worth the time,This tour was the highlight of our trip to Seoul. Seeing the area around the DMZ and being able to walk inside of the 3rd infiltration tunnel was very interesting. Out guide was quite informative and spoke excellent English. We were taken to a variety of areas in and around the DMZ and it was all quite interesting. Traffic in Seoul can be quite challenging so we spend a fair amount of time on the bus getting to the DMZ and returning. The DMZ felt reasonably safe and was well worth the visit.
A real eye opener,"I did the DMZ tour along with the JSA tour all in one day. This tour is not for the clostraphobic! The tour takes you to the border between North and South Korea, about 40 miles north from Seoul. You stop off at, what I can only describe as a motorway rest stop, and have time for a coffee and get a pretty good view of the infamous DMZ. There's a bridge going over the river that runs along the start of the DMZ. From where I stood the DMZ did not look at all inviting. We got on to our bus and enter the demilitarized zone proper. There were fences two miles either side of the demarcation line which is the actual DMZ. To be honest I enjoyed the experience but felt after the JSA tour in the morning, this was a bit of an anti climax. All there was to really see was the incursion tunnels which you get to go down with its continually decreasing height ( I managed to smack my hard hat so hard on the roof while bent over it caused my head to bleed). The tunnels are small and cramped and not for the faint hearted. To be fair they are quite an achievement as the North Koreans had to blast through solid granite to dig the tunnel and nobody heard them. More worrying is the fact they found 4 of these tunnels, thanks to a defector, and according to him there are actually 20!So in short the DMZ tour is worth it but do it first before the JSA tour."
Must do in South Korea,"This was probably the highlight of our trip to Seoul. A part of history that is ongoing..Used a day trip option from Viator (this area is heavily guarded, tours only).Pick up and transport to the DMZ was uneventful, we had a good guide who gave enough pertinent information.Tour involved1. Imjinjak Park - park built for those from both sides who can't return home), you can see the Freedom Bridge here and barbed wire fences with guards. Plenty of food options here.2. Dorasan Station - the train station meant to link South Korea to Europe, but never used, 3. Third Tunnel - closest tunnel to Seoul built by the North Koreans to infiltrate South Korea. You can take a walk down the 73m deep, 300m long walkway/interception tunnel to the infiltration tunnel. The tunnel is well cooled but is a bit of a hike back up! 4. Dora Observatory - Overlook the DMZ, be prepared for the loud music played to drown out the Propaganda by North Korea.Did not opt for the JSA option where you can see the north and south korean army face to face - this aspect has much stricter dress codes etc so be prepared and read up before you go.Must: bring plenty of water, Passport is a must. No strict attire unless you are adding the JSA option to your tour. It's a tour, so remember that you only get to spend 20 minutes at one venue, except the Tunnel where you're allowed about an hour."
Unique experience,"No where in the world that the people is still divided and seperated, unable to communicate or know living status of each other. Only some hundreds meters away by a river section and land mine. We bought half day tour with VIP tour operator, very professional! Paid a visit to 3rd Tunnel at -70m depth, to see the attempt by North Korea to invade South by digging various underground tunnels.Worth your visit! "
A must visit when in Seoul,Very interesting visit. Given the current height in international discussions it is definitely worth a visit. Lots of people visiting so you may have to wait a few minutes to get to the front part of the observation deck. Telescopes (500 KRW) are available to view the North. A bit hard to see when the weather is rainy but well worth the trip. 
Interesting Military Zone Tour,An interesting Military Zone Tour with rich active history education on Korea. Must visit. Kids may not be allowed. 
"Tour guides were extremely knowledgable, eye opening!",This was a great experience and was very eye opening. The tour guides were extremely knowledgable and were able to answer any questions we had. If you have time while you're visiting Korea I would recommend a stop to the DMZ.
Excellent peace initiative and awareness program,The theme park concept is one of the excellent peace initiative which can create awareness to focus more on man's quest for Family happiness and peaceful aspirations.Suggestion - the facilities like elevators and toilets need round the clock maintenance.
"Excellent tour, guides are very knowledgeable.","I had high hopes for this tour and was not at all disappointed, for those expecting to get an abundance of photographs I wouldn't expect much because there are only a few areas in the JSA where you are allowed to take pictures. The U.S. Army tour guides were very knowledgeable and professional, they knew the answer to almost every question we had and the full history of the DMZ as well as a broad history of the Korean War. To history buffs and those looking to get a rare look at what it's like to see North Korea up close this is a must see."
Stepping in the border of NK & SK..,"I booked my DMZ tour through Viator - actually I wanted to get the DMZ-Panmunjom tour however, you need to book it two weeks before the schedule. Still I had a great time with my half day DMZ tour though if given a choice I will still choose Panmunjom tour since it's more challenging. Going to DMZ you need to drop by at Imjingak Park and take pictures, where you can also find the stone of peace wall. At DMZ you can walk at 3rd infiltration tunnel which the North Korea dug to attack SK, its a long walk so if you have heart problem or knee problem don't bother to go, anyway, there's not much to see and you can't take pictures inside.Go up to dora observatory where can use the binoculars for SKW 500 and take a view of NK, see the Propaganda village or fake village which the say that no one is really living there and the tall north korea's flag. And lastly, we stop at Dorasan Station - a railway station situated on the Gyeongui Line, which used to connect North Korea and South Korea, however, it's not in operation now. If you are taking the DMZ trip don'd forget to bring your passport."
Something different ,"We visited the DMZ and in the process learnt a bit of history which was really good! When you're driving there, the places where dynamite are placed are pointed out to you, then you get out at the park to do your sight seeing, there's carnival rides there as well as military! Really weird! Worthwhile to go to and look across into North Korea ! I particularly liked the freedom bridge and locomotive !"
Being on the border between North and South Korea,Always wanted to visit the border between Noth and South Korea. Booked this tour in advance and visited the DMZ and JSA area. I enjoyed every moment of the tour which was very well organized and showed all the special places. A must to visit when coming to South Korea
Good because of its rarity but truly just propaganda and boring in places,"This is a one-sided introduction to many sensitive topics. It gets a bit much at times and in truth, the tour is quite boring if you have visited or lived in other countries with a similar approach to their history.Looking into NK is only cool because we have told ourselves it is. In truth all you see are empty buildings through a binocular that you pay for while listening to music blaring through the speakers.Security/military theatre at its finest and all a bit pointless."
What an experience ,As close as one gets to North Korea. Was a clear day and could see as far as one can. Educational trip. Walked the tunnel too. Visited the train station. 
Unusual Experience,"Visiting the DMZ is an unusual experience. You can take a tour bus to the DMZ but the military provide the actual tour. There are a number of places where you cannot take pictures, even when you can there are limitations. When standing at the DMZ the military officer leading our tour advised us not to take pictures to our left, right or behind us. The formality of the tour was striking, especially given the recent rhetoric from North Korea. Even though it felt a little tense we enjoyed the experience.We also visited the The Third Tunnel. The tunnel is the third one found by South Korea since the Korean War. You can walk down a 350 meter tunnel to where it ended on the South Korean side of the DMZ. It is a steep hike about 11 degrees and then you can walk in the actual tunnel for 200 meters to where the tunnel is blocked so no one can get through any more."
JSA tour,"There are different tours: DMZ tour and JSA tour.I went on the JSA tour, because you actually visit the place where the North and South Koreans are only standing a couple of meters away from each other on the border. This is a weird place...You will visit the room where the UN and North Korea negotiated for peace, exchanging prisoners and other things. Very impressive.You also have to sign a paper that it isn't the fault of South Korea or the UN when something happens to you. Like when the north attacks and kills you or something.Costs of the tour: 85000 won. Duration: half day. You get a description what you can and can't wear, because the north Koreans take photos at you for propaganda purposes when you look like a bum or when you dress to revealing.The tour was very impressive!"
Cool Tunnel,"We went on the half day tour with Seoul City Tour company. Our wonderful tour guide named Rebekah did a wonderful job. Our tour bus picked us up at 7:45 am. Our first stop at the DMZ was a train station built for when\if South Korea and North Korea unified into one country. No running trains of course, but was fun to take a picture in front of the sign that pointed to North Korea. Our second pit stop was at an observation deck of North Korea. Our third pit stop was at a place to watch a video of how Korea divided into two parts. Finally, after that, we reached the main stop: the 3rd infiltration tunnel dug by North Korea. The tunnel is REALLY COLD INSIDE!!!!! I'D recommend being a sweatshirt or hoodie. We also had to wear a helmet. Once we walked to the divider of the two countries, we walked back. By the way,be prepared to do a lot of walking!! The only thing that was not so fun was that we were driven to a ginseng building where many people tried to sell expensive ginseng to you. That part had nothing to do with the tour whatsoever. Finally, we got dropped off around city hall around 2:30pm."
Cool experience,"Did the tour from Seoul to DMZ and had an amazing time during the entire trip, was able to visit the tunnels excavated by North Korea and to see the North Korean border/flag. The train station to Pyongyang is also very funny to visit, since no trains leave or arrive at the station..."
Bucket List - ticked ,One of those things on my bucket list is to visit the DMZ. Done this today with Panmunjom Travel Center in Seoul. Your tour guide spoke English and gave us a detail history and perspective it the Korean War and the 38 parallel.Visited the Joint Security Area and the DMZ. Walked down into the 3rd tunnel. Paid my respects at the memorial for the Korean War dead especially the Australians.Worth the trip if you have a day in Korea.
If you can't go to JSA not sure it's worth it,Long day got picked up at hotel in Seoul at 7 am and came back at 430 pm. If you want to set foot in the Hermit Kingdom then you want the JSA tour. You can only take photos facing the North. This is the real deal. The soldiers are there to protect the base
"A ""Must Do"" Tour","A visit to the demilitarized zone in South Korea is a “must do” tour, especially the 3rd infiltration tunnel and the observatory. When you look across the border, the hills that do not have trees, that is North Korea and the music you can hear, that comes from North Korea."
Seoul in a Day. ,DMZ tour was great. A must do if you are able. Book a tour with an agent. There are plenty available. 
Great History Experience,"This is a great place to visit to know, understand how the two Korea came about. You get to go into the 3rd Infiltration Tunnel, have a view of the North, etc.But you will need to register with a tour group. I do not think you are allowed to go on your own. "
Surreal Experience - JSA,"Our family - 2 adults & a 12 years old were there in early June. It was a wonderful, unique experience in Korea. My child really wished to step foot in North Korea and her wish came true. We joined Kooridor's afternoon tour from 11:30am - 7pm. Their tours got sold out fast, needed to reserve it when the schedule posted online. The cancellation policies are very generous. And Kooridor was very responsive if we emailed for questions. Remember to bring passports!JSA is the best part among this tour because we followed the US army into the borders. And you can feel the intense environment."
Going down the tunnel,"Visited the 3rd infiltration tunnel and demilitarized zone DMZ. Very interesting. Hike the tunnel. Hard on the back if you are over 5'5"". Almost at the door of N. Korea."
A Must See in Korea,"We did the Kooridor tour of the JSA, 3rd Tunnel and DMZ. We didn't have the most pleasant of days to experience this, rainy and dreary, but it was a wonderful day. Our guide was full of information and very clear English speaker, Vincent. He answered all of our questions. The military personnel at the JSA were professional and informational, cut and dried. I don't know of another way that you can, safely, step foot on North Korean soil without the red tape that entails. Must do while in South Korea. "
Combined tour of DMZ (Panmunjom (JSA) and the 3rd Tunnel ),"Lots of options to book your tour - but you need to do it in advance and get your passport to them so they can ""approve"" your visit. Dress code is there for a reason and can't be ignored - they will not let you do parts of the tour.Good day out - interesting tour and the tunnel itself is a strenuous walk. Some on the tour didnt do it as they had some claustrophic concerns - but if you can do it head down the tunnel but save your strength as the climb back up is hard going"
Great value for money and well worth the trip!,"We travelled to the DMZ by the train from Seoul. We didn't book a tour group ahead as you can join one affordably for less than 10,000 won. You visit Dorsan station, Dora Observatory, and the 3rd tunnel. The tours are timed so you only get a certain amount of time at each stop so prioritise seeing the most important things. Travel from Seoul to here was simple - we only had to take a train then a bus. This is a much more affordable way to do it compared to hiring a tour guide. The DMZ is definitely something to see if you are coming to Korea. There are two options at the ticket booth for when you see the 3rd tunnel. There is a shuttle and a walking ticket. The shuttle costs more but you don't have to walk up and down the tunnel entrance which does knock the breath out of you due to less oxygen at the bottom of the tunnel. You then join a tour bus, there is an informational movie on the bus but ours was in Korean. The sites themselves have explanations in English and later on there is a movie about the DMZ in English. Make sure to pick up headsets at the desk if you need another language like English, French, ect. The tour finishes at a souvenir shop. I suggest if you want to buy something do it here, there wasn't much in the way of souvenirs in the town!"
Worth it,Definitely worth it. However long your trip is make sure you make time for this. The amount of things you see depends on the current political situation but most of the time you get to see a lot. We were very impressed and recommend to any first time visitor to Seoul. 
Interesting visit,There was a movie shown here that was about 8 minutes long. It explained how the the DMZ came into being
Worth the trip..!!!,I cane here with wife via the KR pass on the DMZ train..the journey took awhile as the happy train travel at a much slower pace than the normal train..theres food to buy in the train..you will have to fill in declaration form in the train and will be given an identification pass which you will have to show during the military check one station before arriving. we purchased a compulsory tour package (around 8USD) at dorasan station.this includes the entrance to the third tunnel..there will be buses to take you to places here..and there will be people guiding throughout so no wories..just relax and absorb the history..
No more wars! ,The place looks scary! It's a one hour ride to Paju. You see barb wires surrounding the civilian area where farms are located. Strict military rules. Passport is required. There are tunnels which can be viewed by people. What is scary is that when you go to the observation deck one sees North Korea about only 2km. away! 
Whist did not see as much as we hoped it was worth the money,Had a good long day with 7am pickup and 6pm return. We booked the Viator DMZ and JSA Tour both guides were very good although sometimes a little hard to understand but hey my Korean also sucks. We spent 5 memorable minutes in North Korea which was worth the money on its own. Good Bulgogi Lunch included and certainly this so called Demilitarised Zone is the most heavily Militarised Zone in DMZ history it was a very lay back Tour. The JSA Tour was very regimented and we had strict instructions about photos and any type of non verbal communications to the North we had a good time and were able to take most of the pictures we wanted
Interesting,I am glad I had the possibility to visit this zone. It is living memorial. This is good to maintain this zone in order to keep it in memory.
Politicly interested,It is a political place you must see as if you cant be in Korea without seeing the DMZ. That is the nearest place you will be to that NK devil. 
"Beautiful place, interesting history & hopefully good future...","The area is green and beautiful, in contrast to the known history of war and fighting between north and south Korea. I arrived to DMZ station by myself and took the bus organized trip to Dora train station, observatory, and the 3rd tunnel for less than 15$. In addition, there is a nice park next to the tickets purchasing office. Recommended :)"
DMZ tour,"Amazing experience to see the DMZ place, especially the 3rd tunnel. It was a long underground tunnel. Easy to walk down, but hard to walk back up. Also you can see N.Korea from the observation centre. "
Great experience,"DMZ + JSA Tour. We booked thru KLOOK. Cost is around 130,000 korean won per person inclusive of a full meal lunch at a restaurant. Please make sure you have your Passport with you during the tour.We were picked up by a private car in our hotel at around 6am then dropped off where the coaster bus is waiting for all the tourist. On our way to the first stop, our tour guide Darya gave us the do's and don'ts and brief history of South and North Korea with her flash cards.Here are the tourist spots that are inclusive on the tour:1. Imjingak Park2. Freedom Bridge3. 3rd Infiltration Tunnel4. DMZ exhibition hall5. Dora Observatory6. Dorasan Train Station7. JSA to see Freedom Hall of South and North Korea and go inside UN Conference Room where you can step on North Korea Territory.They implement a strict security when entering the 3rd Infiltration Tunnel and JSA. Each bus is stopped for check point. A soldier will aboard the bus and check each and every passengers passport and matches them with your face.Overall it was a great experience and of course a story to tell. Hoping next time, I'll experience visiting this place again but on the other side."
Dmz train,"Here are some tips if you want to visit the DMZ; what I didn't know is that you need to book a tour with at least 48 hrs in advance so by the time we wanted to visit we only have one choice which was to take the DMZ train. This train takes like 2 hrs 30min to bring you to the border, the ride is quite nice and it is much cheaper than booking a tour, but the problem is that it is all in korean, not a word of english. My point is, if you want to see the border and some important landmarks and you forgot to book a tour you can take this train. ( the train leaves at 9:27AM and comes back at around 16:30 from Seoul Station) when you get to the border you pay for a mini tour; they take you in a bus to all the land marks and there is a guide but as I said before ""no english"" they also give you lunch and then they bring you back to the train station) This tour doesn't include all the cool stuff like the tunnels, that's why for this one you don't even need to show your passports, it's very basic. Conclusion: this is a good option is you really want to visit the DMZ last minute. "
Dmzzz,"Was disappointed, was told it was open, (Wednesday May 3 2017), When we got there it was closed, national holiday. Had to return the next day. The visit was ok."
Tunnel,"The tour is well run. Make sure you have your passport. There is a monorail to take you down the tunnel. Try to book that tour, if you don't want to walk, it is a pretty good incline. You will learn a lot."
DMZ Tour,"Did the DMZ tour which took about 3 hours (includes shuttle bus travel). Make sure you get there early around 8:45-9AM to catch the first few shuttles as the parking lot was probably 75-80% full by the time we left around 12:30pm.The ticket booth opens at 9:00AM with the first shuttle / tour (1 bus) being at 9:20AM and every 20 minutes afterwards. We arrived at 8:45AM and was able to catch the 9:40AM tour. The tour was very informative and you stopped at 4 different locations to take pictures of the signage, view into North Korea, visit the 3rdTunnel. You can pay to use the telescopes but you can also just bring your own bincolulars. "
"Educational, interesting.",Interesting to learn about the demilitarized zone. There are some lookout points where you can see towns towards the border of North Korea.
A chance to visit a spot in the news,"Plan ahead! We were in Seoul and wanted to go to the DMZ but all the tours advertised in local brochures and hotels needed 2 or 3 days advance booking. Found one through the internet that didn't cover all the sites available but was available the next day. pick up by car to a central spot and a good guide made it interesting and only a small group of 10. We went to the Plaza where a shuttle bus took a bigger group to the viewing area, Third tunnel and the Dorsanyang Railway Station which is the end of the line in S. Korea. Not enough time at these three spots to read all the info and ""soak it in"" but adequate. Beware the 3rd tunnel. It's hard work. A steep, paved decline to see where the tunnel dug by N. Korea was discovered in the 70s so of course a steep climb back up. They all have the usual knick knack shops and drinks for sale. Our guide gave a good commentary about the village near the DMZ where the villagers get special treatment because of the inconvenience of living there - curfews, constant passport checks (tourists as well both in and out) We found the whole area very ""touristy"" but as it is popular with both local and foreign tourists, understandable."
JSA-DMZ,We went on the JSA then DMZ tour done by Seoul City Tour. It was educational. Rebecca our guide pointed out important notes for the participants with lively stories in between. She was cheerful and helpful. The trip was well worth it. 
Not to be missed,It's a very somber place to visit. You can see the Freedom Bridge and Mangbaeda which is an alter for Koreans to pay respect their families living in North Korea. You can then ride and walk through the 3rd tunnel and Dora Observatory.
An once in a lifetime experience ,"I was so happy I took in this full day tour of the DMZ, 3rd tunnel and the JSA. It was quite interesting to see the military and all the tensions in your face between the north and south. Lunch was included in my tour and cost 130,000 won. The bus tour was full with approx 40 people. It did not seem to crowded but would have preferred a smaller venue. "
Just a peek into DMZ,This is an interesting place to get acquainted with the background of the Conflict between the north and south. Let me just say this that kids are allowed on this half day tour. This tour is different from JSA tour. The guide told us that the South Korean authorities only allow 5k visitors per day for the DMZ tour and 500 visitors per day for JSA tour. Visitors are not really going INTO the dmz but just having a peek on what is DMZ except if you go through the tunnel which is under the DMZ; whereas JSA allows visitors to see north korean soldiers in the flesh and JSA tour needs advanced reservations.Passports are required to avail this tour for security purposes. The tour itself is quite time constraint as the authorities monitor the flow of each tour bus. Visitors cannot go by themselves if they want to visit DMZ. They need to avail of an accredited tour company.
"DMZ, 3rd Tunnel & Railway Station - Highlight of the trip","The North Koreans shot water on us while we were using the high-powered paid binoculars! Propoganda and music was blaring the entire time from the North Koreans. Can't imagine having to hear this all day, every day. This was definitely a must see for us, and the 3rd Tunnel was very interesting, but not recommended for anyone not up for a hike up and down a very steep grade. Soldiers board your vehicle to check passports. We were in a large tour bus, but it wasn't full, so we had to get some people to ride with us so we could bring our vehicle in. This tour was very moving, but kind of sad to be in this volatile area -- especially since our return home now that tensions are even higher with not just one, but two crazy men with their finger on the button."
The Front Line,"Instead of the usual Seoul city tours, we chose to go to the DMZ to experience a bit of history, but also the current issues facing the Koreas. After the staging at Imingak, we were transported by bus to the DMZ. Passing thru a very extensive military checkpoint where our passports were inspected. Once there we were able to see the North, close up views of the checkpoint towers and see the actual fenced zones. It was well worth the time and effort."
Very interesting - but you have to get on the right tour,"It's a short trip from Seoul, and extremely interesting. Luckily, i was on a small tour (12people) and our guide was brilliant! Very knowledgeable, friendly and witty! Seen bigger groups and their guides that didn't seem that well informed and the groups were pushed around like cattle without time to enjoy the experience. Make sure you're on a good tour and you will find a trip to the most fortified boarder in the world a great and interesting experience!"
Half day tour before heading to the airport,"This was on the bucket list. Tours are well organized, and work to time. If you don't mind confined spaces (and I do mind) you can enjoy seeing the Third Tunnel - goes down about 400 meters at 11 degrees (doesn't sound much but when you are coming back up believe me it is steep incline and has you puffing and sweating - wouldn't recommend for anyone not half fit. At the end you walk about another 280 meters to reach the place where the tunnel is blocked about 70 meters or so from the North Korean side. Lot of interesting history."
Great tour!!,We visited in March 2017 and it was a great day full of information about North & South Korea. Why the war happened. Include the JSA. It's worth the $$!
"An interesting day with a positive lean towards peace, hope and the unification in the Peninsula ","So I booked this tour through trip advisor a week before I was set to travel, everything was made easy with an option of being picked up at any Seoul hotel. I was staying with a friends in guri so I got picked at a local hotel near by. Was picked up by a friendly driver early in the morning and was taken in a small minibus to the coach which would drive us to the dmz. Now I don't know if it was the jet lag or the one too many beers I had the night before but I clumsy me forgotten to bring my passport with me on the tour (PLEASE BRING YOUR PASSPORT). As I was travelling alone I was very nervous because of this. But when my tour guide. Jay song. Found out he made me very comfortable and reassure that it would be okay. He handed me some forms to fill out to show the army at the checkpoint. When we got to the check point jay made it clear to me and the soldier there was nothing to worry about and that it was okay I forgotten my passport. As I'll say again I was travelling alone and was very nervous because of this. I still had my u.k driving licence but like most of Korea. They will only really accept a passport. We stopped at a number of places. The freedom bridge. The 3rd tunnel and the observation deck. We were given plenty of time to view and look at the different areas and they were all steeped in information. Just a small disclaimer with regards to the 3rd tunnel. If you are of ill health of my find it hard with long steep walks. Maybe you should opt out of this and just take a look around the different types of scenery around it. As it is a very steep descent and ascend to the tunnel and is very small and would not be suitable if you are claustrophobic. As I'll say again I did have a few beers the night before and was suffering with a sore head. The tunnel was quiet air tight and didn't help the situation. But I was the make it perfectly clear. There was nothing wrong with the tour I'd probably just say do it on a clear head. We finally visited the train station where they plan to hopefully connect the north and south together when they unify hopefully one day. I was impressed with South Koreans sense of hope the train station was empty but was built for their acknowledgment that all they want is peace and an United Korea. Throughout the tour. Jay made himself very approachable. Coming up to me multiple times asking did I want him to take my picture as I was travelling alone. He was very knowledgable and made the trip memorable and it is a real must for anyone who is interested in the North Korean set up and the South Koreans plan for peace. I did the half tour and was back in the city centre for two pm. Giving me plenty of time to continue with other points of interests. There is an option for a full day tour and i was annoyed with myself I did not booked it by the end of the trip. Jay did say though if you did not have your passport for the full day tour you might as well of stayed in Seoul as the soldiers would defiantly not let you go any further P.S. The man united shirt was worn for a personal joke amongst friends. I did not wear it the whole trip. "
"Interesting experience, JSA visit can be canceled anytime","We booked our DMZ+JSA tour through thr agency Cosmojin online, the cost was originally 87.000 krw. on the very morning of the tour we were told that UN had canceled all tour for the coming week, so our tour was ""downgraded"". interesting experience overall. Dora observatory from where you can see North Korea and hear propaganda songs broadcasted towards the south. Went down tunnel excavated by NK a few decades ago and visited Dorasan train station that is supposed to carry passengers to Pyeongyang someday. Hope you get the full tour!"
Half Day Tour to DMZ,What a great experience! We were collected from our hotel and then onto a coach. Our tour guide Rebecca Kim was fantastic - spoke great English and was full of interesting facts. For every stop we had quite enough time to explore however if you do the tunnel have some level of fitness as it is a long slope back to the top! The Observation Post was great even including the Kpop music blasting across the border and we had a great view. All in all highly recommended!
Highlight of our Korean Trip,"I have read all about it, but to be there is a totally different experience! We took a bus tour (it's not possible to have individual tours) to the DMZ. Upon reaching the area, a checkpoint is a necessity -- so make sure you bring your passport with you. Thank God, the weather was permitting. It was very cold but the skies are clear, so we were able to see North Korea from a distance, even without the help of a telescope. We went to Dorasan Station, Dora Observatory and the Third Tunnel. All of these places are highly educational -- truly learned something from this tour. It is highly recommended that you book a tour to the DMZ!"
Great Tour but no need for Ginseng Outlet at the end!!,"Booked the tour as I have always been fascinated with the whole conflict and it did not disappoint! The weather was perfect and the tour guide David very knowledgeable and was able to answer all questions! We saw freedom bridge, peace park, the third infiltration tunnel and then Dora Observatory. My only negative feedback was it felt rushed, approximately 20 mins at each site apart from the third infiltration tunnel where it was about 45 mins, would have liked more time at each area to take in what you're actually experiencing. Also at the end not he way back to Seoul we were all taken to a Ginseng Outlet where pushy sales people tried to sell us Ginseng products, would have preferred the 40 mins that took at the DMZ to see what I had actually paid to see and experience."
The most exciting part of our trip,"We took a bus tour to the DMZ, which is, I believe obligatory. It is both exciting and eery, an ambivalent experience. They seem to pick extra fit south Korean soldiers through the passport check areas. We passed en route a site where South Korea and North Korea competed to raise the tallest flag tower. Year after year each side keep building a taller. North Korea crested the South Korean tower one year but the flag fell under its own weight! Until we made this tour I had not quite realized how close the DMZ is to Seoul. The infiltration tunnels the North Koreans dug, the 3rd is the most infamous, are scary. We were truly glad we made this tour. Historic, impossible to get bored, exciting if not even tense at times."
DMZee with your eye,"Good and calm here, surround with many space and clear weather :) feeling lonely between smell of war and peace. However,this place is good to visit with your eye. "
"It's not the Great Escape, but....","The 3rd Tunnel open to the public is a worthwhile visit especially if you appreciate history. It's one of four tunnels discovered as evidence of North Korea's attempts to attack Seoul. It's a long walk down, not easy for tall folks, at 5'4"", I found myself needing to walk with bent knees. Hard hats should be kept on. Apparently those wearing blue hard hats got to ride on a ""train"" (I use that term loosely) and back up, otherwise, it's a mile down and back up.We were also shown a scripted movie footage afterwards at the visitor center, giving background of the Korean war and the general state of things running up to it. Choose the language you understand on your personal player.Very enjoyable and meaningful way to spend $50USD, as an add-on to the original tour itinerary. Bring your passport, and if you're lucky to experience the area while it's dreary, cold and snowing, you can truly get the sense of the despair and hardship that must have been for the people who built/dug the tunnel all those years ago."
Worth to visit,"Freezing cold (-7deg) with biting wind, so be prepared with thick clothing. We could view North Korea clearly at Paju. Walked the underground Tunnel 3 to within 170m of the border. Do note the tunnel walk is NOT for the weak or children as it is physically exhausting. "
DMZ and tunnel! ,This tour doesn't actually take you in to DMZ but there is still a couple of fairly hard controls were you'll have to show your passport! I took a morningtour with pick up from hotel and drop off in Itaewon for about 45 dollars! Definetly worth the money! The stops a fairly short but the guide spoke great english and was very informative! Tunnel is quite demanding (not possible to take pictures down there) and be prepared for the fact that it might be fogy or cloudy by Dora observatory! 
The tunnel leads you right to the border of North Korea,"There's hardly another place on earth like this, the Berlin wall was down, Vietnam liberated...We used a private tour guy to take us there. Lucky that we asked to leave earlier on the day when our guide said to meet us later. Otherwise we'd missed the mid morning tour and would have to wait for hour and a half for a later tour (to the tunnel).Our guide took us to the DMZ and there, we purchased tickets to join the DMZ tour runs by the Government (?). Our tour guide basically join the tour with us. The coolest thing is go inside the tunnel which N. Korean dug and was discovered by the South and blocked and shut it down. There are two ways to explore the tunnel, one by train (small), and one by foot.We choose the foot, and it is about 20 minutes walk down and more walk up. Its cool inside the tunnel so you may need a shrug or something."
DMZ,Amazing trip. Is a must for any military member in Korea. There are a couple of good souvenir shops. The observation deck is really cool. I suffered at the 3rd tunnel cause is my height haha but pretty cool too. The famous blue room was incredible. You can feel the tension in the area. So many restrictions regarding taking pictures or being too close to the guardians. One of the best trips I've done while in Korea 
Interesting,"We chose to only do the DMZ tour costing 40,000 won, due to time restrictions. If you want to do the JSA, you need to book at least a week in advance usually due to popularity. The tour leader was very informative, amusing at times and it was great to get an insight into the Cold War. While I thoroughly enjoyed the whole trip (3rd infiltration tunnel, look out point, train station to Pyongyang) I would have loved to have done the JSA also. The JSA costs 87,000 alone, or combined with the DMZ something around 110,000. With the 3rd infiltration tunnel, you can walk down to the end of it, however if you struggle walking you may find this difficult as it's about 500-600m downhill, having to crouch, and then obviously uphill on the way back up"
informative trip,"Took a day trip with the family to DMZ and Joint Security Area with Korea Tourism Board (KTB). Was an informative trip but sort of propaganda-ish, as expected. The best is there is no extra sidetrip to unwanted shopping factories."
Simply Fantastic,"The DMZ, along with the JSA is definitely one of the highlights of my trip in Korea. It is very enlightening, and teaches you not to take peace for granted. Be sure to visit the 3rd infiltration tunnel as well."
Enlightening and really a must see place,Visiting this place will make you apreciate and enjoy the peace around us.. not having conflicts and war... will learn to respect the south koreans for their live for peace... visiting the 3rd tunnel and the view deck where you can see part of north korea are one of the higlights of our trip...
Truly amazing,"The tour itself was amazing. The itinerary is just a right mix of ""feeling the tension between the two countries"" and ""sympathizing with the separated korean families"".Soo Jin, our tour guide, is also great. She really knows a lot and is always willing to share all that information to her tour group. She also never missed to provide us what is expected from us for each of the places we visited — such as dress code, things to bring, behavior, etc.The lunch was also a welcome treat. It was abundant and very delicious.I would definitely recommend this tour to people."
"Must see, must do while in Korea!","Did the half day tour for the DMZ-JSA. Tour package includes pick up and drop off at your hotel. The tour starts early in the morning and from Seoul to the DMZ, its about 70 mins drive. The experience was surreal. And the threat of imminent danger and tension amongst the 2 countries are very real when seen first-hand. im not going into the details as this will spoil your experience but this is a must do and a must see. Don't get out of Korea without seeing this. Don't forget to carry your passports and dress up responsibly. (no shorts, skirts, that kind) I suggest carry some snacks because going from one tourist site to the next is a bit of drive. and don't carry those big lens cameras as it can be intimidating. I just carried my phone and a small sling bag. Your passports are checked my Korean military. there are areas that are restricted to only foreign tourists not unless you're a South Korean and have made pre-arrangements. Pictures are not allowed in the tunnel. It is such an eye opener and Im impressed at how everything is maintained despite not being used (ie, the train station, etc) ."
DMZ,"What a nice place! You'd never think that this was the DMZ if you went to it. It was very pleasant. There was a very nice park (reunification park?) that played North Korean music. When you go to this park there is a very nice man who tells you all about the history of the park and about the history of North and South Korean relations. He is super informative so you should listen to him. This statue of the world being put back together (as displayed in the main picture) was near the 3rd tunnel which was a lot of fun to walk down. The third tunnel is one of the many tunnels that North Korea has dug into South Korea. If you think you will meet some North Koreans at the end you'll be disappointed because the end of the cave is a door you can't enter and you are still on the South Korean side, far from the actual border from what I was told. They give you a helmet to wear in the tunnel but you don't really need to wear it unless you're tall. I'm 5'3"" and still had an inch or two above my head -- I could easily stand up straight but my friend was too tall and had to hunch over the whole time so I called him ""grandpa"" in Korean though he is younger than me. Part of the tour allows you to look into North Korea with binoculars but if the weather is overcast it is hard to see anything. The only thing I could see was the giant flag. "
"Half Day Trip to ""just"" the DMZ","My husband, friend, and I took the half day tour of the DMZ. It was a pretty quick 4 hour tour and honestly you don't get to see as much as your would like or spend enough time in each place. I would recommend trying the joint JSA tour as you get to go to the actual N.Korea/S. Korea boarder. It's a little more expensive but might be worth the money. If not, this half day tour was approx 35 USD and if you're looking for something to do, it's totally worth it. I will admit there was a little too much propaganda and it's a bit touristy, but looking past this I'm glad I went on this tour. It is interesting to learn about the history between the two. Also, just an FYI the climb down and up into the 3rd infiltration tunnel is pretty tough, be prepared for some physical activity...unless you are able to take the tram."
#1 MUST-SEE IN S KOREA,"This place was the most unique and memorable experience during our trip to South Korea. Both my husband and daughter rated it as the MOST WORTHWHILE AND MEMORABLE PLACE to visit during our 14-day stay in Seoul. Its historical relevance extends beyond the Korean peninsula: It was a moving reminder of the evil of Communism, the devastation of war, and the high price of freedom. After the demise of the Berlin wall, this is the last such reminder of freedom vs. tyranny so closely juxtaposed. If you only had a day in South Korea, I'd spend it here. (The other top tourist sites, such as the palaces and old neighborhoods in Seoul are less unique, with similar and much more spectacular versions in China and Japan, and the mountains, while pretty, do not compare to our US National Parks.)For security reasons, visits are only possible through tours, and you must carry your passport. Photography is limited in many sensitive areas. Since we were visiting family in Seoul, we drove to Paju City with our local hosts and did a tour from there. However, there are plenty of English-speaking tours that leave from Seoul, and I would recommend reading the various reviews about different tours. The drive out is interesting--that whole segment of ocean is double-triple barb-wired interspersed with watch towers, despite it being a pretty stretch of coast with geese, wetlands, and certainly a good amount of wildlife. Perhaps in a time of peace, it would be dotted with families and campers. Since our daughter is younger than 10, and we traveled with a South Korean national in our party, we could only do the limited DMZ tour, and could not do the Joint Security Area/ Panmujeon tour. Our tour included Dorasan station, driving past landmines up to the observation deck, and the third infiltration tunnel. Even this 3-hour experience was like no other in my life, and difficult to fully verbalize the feelings that it evoked. It is an amazing piece of history, past and present. The land mines, tunnels, Freedom Bridge, war exhibits, bullet-ridden train were all eerie reminders that the war was not that long ago…that the North Korean invasion and Korean War continue to live in vivid memory for those South Koreans aged 65+, and that the threat of a North Korean invasion is a palpable reality that South Korea continue to face…despite the glitzy idyllic cosmopolitan world that seemed to characterize nearby Seoul. And Seoul is quite close to the border! IT WAS ESPECIALLY WORTH IT FOR A FAMILY TRIP WITH AN ELEMENTARY-SCHOOL-AGED CHILD. We had a number of thoughtful conversations about world war II, the cold war, war in general, communism, and authoritarianism as a result of visiting the DMZ. The visit was more than any textbook could have taught her. When we return to Korea in the future, and our daughter is older, we hope to do the full USO tour and see the JSA. Note about the tunnel: The same tram that takes you down also takes you back up, so you do not have to climb back up. You do need to have a good back (or be very short) as the flat walking portion of the tunnel has a low ceiling so you must hunch over to avoid hitting your head. "
Interesting but limited time,"If you want to know more about the history of the separation of North and South Korea, then going on a DMZ tour is recommended. There are actually two types of tour, the first DMZ tour will take you to Imjingak (starting point of the DMZ tour), the 3rd tunnel (built by North Koreans so they can enter South Korea. This tunnel is the 3rd among the 4 tunnels discovered by South Koreans), the Dora Observatory (you need 500 won to use their big binoculars for a limited time to see North Korea, although view is not very near) and the Dorasan Station (future rail station to connect North to South in the future should they be reunited again). The other tour is the Panmunjom DMZ tour but it's more expensive since you'll actually get to experience to see the border where the South Korean and North Koreans guard their post.The DMZ tour is actually a nice experience although the half day tour is very minited due to time constraint. We're always in a hurry in there's no time anymore to explore and buy souvenirs. Most of the time was spent picking up tourists in their pick up stations. We were picked up at 7:20AM at the hostel but the actual travel from Seoul City to DMZ started at 9:00AM already. =( I guess there should be a more strategic way to organize pick up points so no time will be wasted."
A piece of history ,If you are in country and have the opportunity you must visit the DMZ. This trip should take an entire day if you want to do it right. There are plenty of tour groups to bring you here and you should do it as a tour. The history comes to life with a knowledgeable guide. 
Truly Unique Experience,"I went on the full day tour of the DMZ, JSA, and 3rd Tunnel. I booked through Viator and thoroughly enjoyed it. It really is like no place I've ever seen. My tour guide SooJin was really great. She was full of information and spoke English very well. She also highlighted how hopeful the South Koreans were that someday the country would be unified again. The restaurant we ate lunch at was tasty, with a choice of bulgogi or bibibap. I would highly recommend the full day tour and feel like it's a must-see while visiting Korea."
Day trip with Cosmojin Travel to DMZ and JSA,"Although it is well worth visiting the DMZ and JSA, I felt that they dragged the day out to ensure it being a full day trip. Easy to do all of this in half a day. It is expensive and I am not sure it is worth the money. But I suppose if you are in Seoul it is something that you want to go and see for yourself. Was relieved when we started making our way back to Seoul in good time, just to be told that we are first going to visit a tourist trap, factory gem store. Luckily we noticed the number 9 line a block from there and decided to leave the tour and make our own way back to our hotel. We booked 2 weeks in advance and only managed to get one company who could still help us as it was a Saturday. So word of advice - book well in advance."
"Interesting. Good, not great.","We did two tours with Viator when we were in Seoul. Both tours had hotel pick up, and both tours gave people different times to be ready for pick up. We sat in our hotel lobby waiting 20 minutes for another couple who thought that they were coming down 10 minutes early! The trip does involve quite a bit of time on the bus, But our guide, Jay, talked about sites, culture, etc, so the ride was interesting. At every stop, we felt rushed. There were quite a few other tour groups, so it wasn't always possible to see everything in the time allowed. I'm very glad that we did the trip. It ended with a trip through a Ginseng factory (complete with hard sell), and dropped us off near the city hall."
A very unique and surreal experience,"If you are visiting South Korea for the first time, then visiting the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) or the Joint Security Area (JSA) in Paju should be a must in your list. This will probably be one of your highlights during your time in South Korea, as it is simply a unique experience that cannot be easily found elsewhere.Do take note that because the DMZ and the JSA are restricted military areas, hence a group tour is required to go there as no individual tours are allowed. Regardless of which tour agency you take, it is highly advised to book your dates early, as limited slots for the very popular JSA tour often get snapped up fast. In our case, we choose Koridoor Tours, as it is one of the more well-known and better organized tour agencies that specialize more on DMZ / JSA tours. For a more in depth review on Koridoor tours, do check out my review on TripAdvisor here:https://www.tripadvisor.com.sg/ShowUserReviews-g294197-d2546636-r429266755-Koridoor_Day_Tours-Seoul.htmlDo remember to bring your passport on the day of the tour itself, as the tour guide and your military escort will check your passport upon reaching the DMZ area. Be sure to adhere to the dress code that is stated on most tour agencies doing this kind of tour. Do also take note that children under 10 are NOT allowed on the DMZ / JSA tour as well.Basically all the tour groups will convene at Camp Bonifas to listen to a brief presentation by a U.S. Army personnel, as well as to sign a waiver form acknowledging the risks etc. After that, we were transferred to another bus and we could not bring most of our belongings along except our camera and a few other items.The JSA is definitely the main highlight of the whole thing. It is here that you can still see the tensions of the two Koreas, and you can actually spot a North Korean soldier on the North Korean side of the JSA! It actually felt quite surreal sometimes. We also got close to the South Korean Military Police (MP) soldiers standing inside the blue rooms as well. You can technically step into North Korea itself as there is a concrete line showing the border outside the rooms itself. Do be sure to get some souvenirs at the gift shop at Camp Bonifas itself, as these souvenirs are rather unique and can't be found elsewhere in Korea.We also visited Dorasan Station, which is the last railway station in South Korea before entering North Korea. You can buy a ticket for only 1000 won to get into the railway platform and take some great shots there. Next was Dorasan Observatory, where you get to see some great views of North Korea, with long range fixed binoculars provided for a small fee. You can clearly see the North Korean flagpole near its ""village"", which is more likely empty rather than inhabited.Our last stop was the Third Tunnel of Aggression, which was one of four known tunnels that were discovered by South Korea. This tunnel walk is definitely not for those who have problems walking long distance or have back problems, as there is a steep incline down to the bottom and a long walk to the end, often having to bend your back as some parts of the tunnel are quite low. Make sure you wear the helmet that is provided, as you will likely hit your head at least once during the walk. It is a good walkout for those inclined though.Overall, I would say that this is one must-see place you have to go while in South Korea. It is only through here that you will understand more of modern day Korea better."
Worth going to DMZ?,"DMZ is about 3-4 hours drive from Seoul. Unless, you are with a guide to explain to you about the history else everything is in Korean. The view is beautiful especially the coastal area. The North Korean side is nothing but mountains and trees. You should not take more than an hour for the whole trip. There is a Korean War museum which is next to it. Should take another 15 minutes. Those who love about history and wars, I would advise you to visit. Else, DMZ is not a must visit. If you happen to be near by, you can consider."
"Worth it, worth it, worth it","Make sure you get a JSA tour .. you will get right up to the DMZ where the next stop is North Korea. It is so worth it! You only get 4 minutes in the buildings for photos, but you can step over the DMZ line and put your feet in North Korea. Security is mega tight, take your passport with you, it will be inspected multiple times!Its less than 50km from Seoul .. book your tour in advance to make sure you have a spot. I can't emphasize enough this awesome experience, one of the best things I've done this year!"
Provides deep appreciation of Korean history,"This tour is highly recommended. My only regret is not signing up for the JSA tour right away, which requires 2-3 days passport verification (I only booked the tour the day before my last day in Seoul). My tip is to book this tour online, because it's cheaper! :)"
MUST SEE WHEN IN KOREA,The DMZ tour is an absolute must see for visitors to Korea. It is a chilling reminder of the conflict that still exists and to how close the hostile forces are to us.
DMZ a rare tour not to be missed,"If you are in Seoul and it's not a Monday, joining the DMZ tour is extremely important!I used dmztours.com. Choi the manager was extremely attentive to all my countless questions (we had a big group coming from all parts of the world, so had to wait with travel confirmation, and separate hotels!)What's also important is to go on the JSA tour (going to the blue UN buildings - the closest you can go to be over the MDL ... to North Korea). We couldn't due to military exercises, which is understandable. The history and the explanation of the DMZ area by our tour guide Jenni was extremely clear and helpful. In short, there are many places that forms part of the DMZ tour, We did, Imjingak Park - The Bridge of Freedom - The 3rd Infiltration Tunnel - DMZ Theater & Exhibition Hall - Dora Observatory - Dorasan Station - Pass by the Unification Village - Ginseng Center - Drop off at Itaewon or City Hall area.We didn't include lunch in our package, since the tour finished at 2:30pm, those that had lunch in their package, had to eat later as well. Suggest that you bring a packed sandwich/lunch, as food from the stalls at some of these places are extremely limited. Due to traffic we returned to City Hall late, which meant most of the restaurants were closed and we were limited with lunch choices.Note, you need to book at least 3 business days or earlier, dress code applies and the tour company will provide this detail once you booked)."
Cultural visit,"Awesome tour to the DMZ with the Yongsan USO, Korridor Tours. Visited the 3rd Tunnel, Dorasan Station, DMZ Museaum. The whole prize was $36.00. Warning the 3rd Tunnel is really exhausting, not recommended for kids, claustrophobic people, people with any breathing condition, wheelchair or really tall folks. Once you descend like 300+ meters then you will start walking through this narrow and about 4 feet high tunnel for another 175 to 200 meters. The temperature is very cool in the tunnel. I went in October so imaging if you go during winter, it will be freezing down there. I also went to the observation post. You can see the ghost town that North Korea built to trick the tourist in thinking that they live better that it is been reported. Very interesting site. Lost os souvenirs shops. Great tour do recommend."
DMZ,"Visiting the demilitarized zone in South Korea is very exciting, especially the 3rd infiltration tunnel and the observatory give a very good impression of what went on in this area."
History Lesson Galore!,"Definitely the highlight of my trip to South Korea. I went on a full day DMZ/JSA tour with Korridor, a tour agency. Paid about 90USD, and it was well worth it. Over all I had a wonderful time both in learning and being in the midst where so much history took place; it was surreal.Started off the tour with the 3rd Infiltration Tunnel - no photos allowed down there. Basically you put on a hard hat, walk down a really steep slope and make your way through the tunnels. There are some parts with low head room even for me at 1.55m. Coming back out of the tunnel is bit of a work out.Next was the observatory and Dorasan train station. The Korean Military personnel at the observatory was very fluent in english and explained the horizon of North Korea beyond the border very clearly. The mist was thick that day though, so we couldn't see very far. The JSA was the best part! We had to be escorted by US military personnel who were also our guides. They were open to any questions from the group and answered to the best of their knowledge. Just being there and witnessing a separation of two countries with the same culture and language is a little heart breaking.Our tour guide, Dana, was very friendly and approachable. Not to mention she's knowledgeable as well. "
When what you see in news become a reality in front of your eyes here~,"This is the place where what you see in the news become a reality in front of your eyes here and believe it or not, it's so near and yet so far. It's only a brick walkway that separated the 2 sides of the Korea peninsula and though the Korean war had ended for more than 50 years, no peace treaty is signed.We came by here as part of our day tour and it took about an hour to reach here from our hotel.For us, its quite an educational and eye opening experience to be here, one of the world's most dangerous and highest tension places on earth. Soldiers from both sides stood and stared at one another a couple of meters away. The guide gave a very detailed and informative introduction about the place (DMZ the 38th parallel line), the Korean war between 1950-1953, history, political events that led to its formation.At some point of time, one will be ""stressful with a very tension atmosphere"", something you can only experience yourself when here personally. Not a movie scene and its so real though the South Korean side tried to market this place as a ""tourist attraction"". Recommended especially if you have a keen interest in history, war or politics!"
Surreal,"Took a full day tour with my mother. So much history and so much going on there even now. It is unreal that this is a ""tourist attraction"", but it is also educational in a way you can't get from books. Highly recommended."
educational tour,how can you not go to the DMZ if in South Korea? great tour and highly recommend it.we had a US army soldier take over the tour at the DMZ. Gave history accounts of events at the DMZ and realistic review of the dangers
A WORLD YOU WON'T BELIEVE,"Visiting Korea because of my daughter and son-in-law in the Air Force. We took the DMZ tour (a FULL day) with the 51st force support service on base. Everything about the tour was great except the lunch that was provided. I would highly suggest you buy a sub sandwich and skip paying for the lunch...the food seemed like it had been made days before. I ate the apples and rice and threw the rest away. The 3rd tunnel was amazing but, the walk back up was very strenous. They have a tram that can take you back up or both ways. Being the invincible guy that I am I walked back up but, about a third of the way I started to regret it. Just be aware and you decide when you see the descent. You MUST take this tour with all that's happening here with the N. Korean''s nutty dictator.."
DMZ,"Everyone should see this area. It is about history, and current issues, and hope, and fears. Be sure to see the tunnel and walk down it if you are up to it. Go to the Peace Talks area, look at North Korea, see the Bridge of No Return. See where people still live, divided from family who are across the border. I am unrelated to Korea, and I went with a woman from Seoul. It was stunning to both of us. There are age limits for the full day tour, which is what I recommend."
Great place; search for a good tour company. ,"The DMZ/ JSA tour is great (9am-5pm). The tunnel is a worthwhile experience and the JSA provides an opportunity to step into North Korea and observe the north/ south guards. It is a very unique experience to hear N. Korea propaganda and see towns from the observation points. Be aware that the tour companies often add on ""extra"" tours on your way home. Seoul city tours forces you to go through a ginseng museum (read: ginseng store) or a youth hostel to dress up in army clothes and buy photos. Other tour companies make you go to gem shops, etc. You may want to ask about the side trip you're going to be forced to go on while inquiring about your tour. "
"Do it for the ""been there"" experience","I did the tunnel walk and wished I hadn't once I got down there and had to climb back up. I'm in ok shape, but it was really too much work for little reward. It definitely had the creepy vibe and seemed too long like redsonya25 review, but it did create a ""feeling"" so it has its merits."
DMZ tips,Took a packaged tour up to the DMZ North of Seoul. The train ride is quite leisurely (slow) up to Paju and the first leg to the freedom park was of low value. Best parts were getting up to the observation hill and going down into one of the tunnels dug by the North Koreans. We were unable to see the joint check point since tensions were high with recent military exercises and rocket launch. 
"Creepy vibe, lots of propaganda and a bit too long","My husband was stationed at the DMZ back in 1994 and was eager to go and visit it as a civilian. We bookd our tour through the USO but many outiftters offer similar versions. The ride to the Dosan observation point was 45 mins but the tour guide gave us some history about Seoul/Korea and the various sights along the way. The observation point was the best part of the tour. You can look through binoculars over into North Korea and see a crazy large flag, a fake village and hear the music and propaganda music and announcements being played towards South Korea. After that, I felt like the tour took on a creepy vibe. The 3rd tunnel was weird and absolute waste of time. The video about the Korean War was absolute propaganda and was visually unnerving and made me antsy. We then visited an relatively abandonded train station that went to Pyongang and was adjacent to an unused Customs House, where we were fed a cafeteria style Korean lunch that was nearly inedible. This train station showed an absolute waste of money and resources. We then went to the Freedom Park which again had binoculars towards North Korea and more propaganda. Worth it for the sights and history but the overwhelming amount of propaganda ruined the experience."
Touristy,"I found this tour quite odd. Having been in north korea a few weeks before and visited the DMZ from that side, the south seemed very touristy and obsessed with trying to look in. Also a lot of what the tour guides were saying was over exaggerated which was frustrating. However i did enjoy the 3rd infiltration tunnel which was fasconating and the museum and would recommend those. Would also prpbably go when its cooler and not the height of summer!!! "
A scary place,"The Bridge of No Return, and the border to another world here at the DMZ where you see freedom and greta industrial individualism on one side, and then a scary state on the other. Just looking across the river is strange and scary. Though I visited in 1998, I'm sure it is still a place on edge."
this tour is an absolute must when visiting seoul,"We did a full day tour (8am - 5pm) with VIP travel which was enjoyable and informative. Passports are required, and we paid in cash on the morning of the tour. Note that there is a dress code. We had done a DMZ tour in North Korea the previous year and were really interested to compare the differences between the tours.Our guide was great and gave information throughout the day on the history of Korea. Our tour started at the DMZ Pavillion where there was a short film on the war and then a train ride to the infiltration tunnel.There are lockers where cameras and other personal items must be stored before doing this tour. It was an interesting ride 60 meters underground, so it can get quite chilly, and safety helmets must be worn as the ceiling is very low in places, particularly on the train ride. The tunnels are interesting, but there were so many persons that it was difficult to move around.Photos are not allowed, but a few persons still did with their camera phones. We then went to the Dora Observatory where guests could look through telescopes at North Korea. We found this really amusing as there was no observatory in the North. We then visited the Dorsan Station, and then unto Imjingak Park. There were quite a few monuments at the park, including the last train to run between north and south korea (it had quite a few bullet holes), stones of the peace wall (which had stones from battlefields all over the world), korean war veterans memorial, freedom bridge and peace memorial.Our last stop was Camp Bonafis for a briefing (and propaganda), then onto the JSA. We took a few photos, but were disappointed that we were not able to take a photo of the tree which was cut down after the axe murder incident (40th anniversary) or get a good photo of the bridge of no return. Soldiers are on the bus and will tell guests where photos may be taken.It was a good tour, but we did not get the photos that we really wanted, so were a little disappointed. It was interesting the differences in propaganda films and statements that the North/South presented. The museum in the North was better, but the memorials in the South are more prominent and better presented."
A trip worth taking,"We took the DMZ tour, seeing the underground tunnel, the lookouts, the museum and the train station. There is a lot of symbolism in much of the artifacts, and the country really makes a tourist site out of it, but it was very interesting and educational. The tunnel is steep, but we were in good shape and didn't find it too hard to manage. It's not a place to dawdle, though. The train station is a bit out of the way but a cool place to snap a pic. We got some excellent views of North Korea, and listened to a lot of propaganda, but the people working there are generous and polite and the crowds not too bad. This is my 4th DMZ, (don't believe them when they say theirs is the only one in the world. I have seen the one in Israel, Germany's when it was still active, and Cyprus) This was is the most organized."
Day tour of the DMZ,Wow. All I can say is wow. This tour lets you see the difference between the democratic South and the madman-controlled North. The tour is a bit tourist oriented but still worth it. The binoculars give you a little peek into the DMZ and the North. The tunnel that leads you right up to the demarcation is also quite an experience. It is good to do this tour once to understand the hostility and get a glimpse of history.
real history of korea,"Location itself was really fasnating though, actually this place is not easy to visit on weekends, I should have listen to my tour guide suggestion but I thought it was ok!If you have tour guide, listen to him/her, and try to avoid weekends! There were so many locals and tourists, which looked like chaos.But historically it's safe to say that you must visit DMZ, since this is the only place you can see N.Korea and S.Korea together and learn about Korean WarAh! Guys keep in mind that JSA and DMZ are different place!"
Great Infotainment,"We did the DMZ tour and got a plethora of information about the country, it's history and why everything is as it is like now, from a south korean perspective. As this was part of a tour package, overall it felt a bit rushed (1/2 half day tour). The JSA tour would be a full day, but equally jammed with stops, attractions, view points etc. This tour is defintely doable with a toddler amd highly recommended. "
"Unique experience, but very tourist-focused","Visiting the DMZ/JSA is a unique must-do when visiting South-Korea. I booked via Panmunjon Travel Center which was quite costly (about 100 euro's, transport from and back to Seoul and really mediocre lunch included) but our guide was amazing. Book in advance, as only a couple tour operators are admitted to the JSA, the part of the tour which is by far the most impressive. During the tour, you will visit several souvenir shops and 2 group pictures are taken which one's able to buy at the end. I would like to have seen more focus on the tour and history itself, but all in all it was a very impressive experience."
Mass-processing,"My boyfriend and I booked the JSA-Tour. I really looked forward to this tour because I'm interested in the history of Korea and the seperation. The tour started in the Koreana hotel and first we drove to a observation deck, where you can observe the borderline north korea. This was pretty cool. We saw north korean people working on a field. Then we went to a Imjingang-Bridge, which was quite impressive but the stop was too long.After that we had lunch, which was quite good.In the afternoon we finally get to the DMZ. They showed us a little Powerpoint-presentation and gave us some instructions. Then we were finally ready to go to the JSA. The JSA itself is very touristic and it was just a big mass processing! This was the end of the tour, which we spend about CHF 85.- or about USD 85.-Conclusion: It was a huge disappointment and a big rip-off! I would never do this again or recommend to my friends."
One of the best tours I've ever been on in my life.,"Alright so no doubt you've heard about the infamous DMZ, the border running between North and South Korea. But it's an entirely different thing to actually EXPERIENCE it. I booked the DMZ + JSA tour, and I'll be honest with you: it was worth every penny. The only downsides to this tour that I can think about is that it's fairly rushed. Primarily because the buses have to keep a very strict timetable and there's little room for dillydally. That and the propaganda is a little silly. Over the course of the tour I watched two videos that made me yawn and go, ""really?"" It was about how the DMZ was a place of peace and how it would live forever and how North Korea was in missile striking distance of Seoul. Complete with some scary music and weird animations. You kinda have to see it to believe it. The tour starts with them picking you up in a designated area of Seoul. They put you on a tour bus, and off you go. You ride for about an hour. We had an issue that the Japanese tour guide had a microphone so we had to wait for her to stop talking before our tour guide could speak. I think our tour guide was having an off day because he kept repeating himself a lot, but it was still very factual and interesting. You ride up to the DMZ, a Korean soldier will get on and check your passport. No reason to fear, they don't board with guns. We checked out the Third Tunnel, the last train station, the observatory, and then I went to the JSA. It's an all-day tour, so be prepared for that. I loved everything, and all of the guides speak English, so feel free to ask them any questions. The JSA part of the tour is when things get very interesting. You MUST abide by their dress code. Check it, double-check it, re-check it. The Korean soldier who boards the bus WILL check your outfit and you will be denied entry if it's deemed not up to code. I'm serious about this. Make sure your passport is up to date, too. If you're squeamish about guns, this is not the place for you. Most soldiers will be armed. Do not attempt to disobey them or step out of line. Bad things can and will happen to you. When you get to the infamous blue houses that line the border of North and South Korea, you're expected to file in in two lines. You get maybe 3-5 minutes in the house. Make the most of it, take selfies, take pics - anything you'd like. If the guards tell you not to do something, don't do it. We had a few people who did on my tour and there's nothing that gets your heart pounding so fast as a guard barking. Your number of pictures will be limited in the JSA. Don't try to sneak pics - the guards notice. They have hawk eyes and they're trained for that sort of thing. Just behave, do what they say, and you will be fine. Also, when you reach the JSA, they will have you de-board your tour bus and get onto a special JSA bus. You MUST leave everything behind. You are only allowed to carry a camera or a cellphone (there's a cellphone jamming tower there so no signal). You will leave your backpack, purse, passport, and everything on your tour bus. It's okay, though, they lock it. Everyone has to do this. If you're paranoid, carry as little valuables as possible. A passport is required, though. You have to leave that on the bus. But yeah! Definitely recommend to everybody - no young kids, though. I believe the JSA part of the tour has an age limit. The DMZ part is super relaxed in comparison."
Really interesting ! Best thing to do around Seoul,"We visit the place with koridoor tour, which was presented by a young and cultivated korean girl, she spoke slowly so we can all understand and had always a speaker. We went in the DMZ, dorasan station, observation deck above the DMZ and the third tunnel. We had the chance to go in the tunnel, which was a depth of about 73 m (240 ft) below ground.It was my best tour experience in South Korea, highly recommend it too everyone !"
Awesome experience,"Booked a full day tour DMZ + JSA. For the tunnel walk, our group was quite lucky that there was a South Korean military exercise ongoing!! I found myself being able to keep pace with them yay :) However, when i tried to sneak a photo, i got scolded and my phone covered by a soldier (oops :x). It was quite thrilling since it is heavily guarded and soldiers will come up the tour bus to check everyone's passport personally. Our guide also told stories of how we couldn't stare at the North Korean soldiers wrong or they are allowed to attack us. Scary! !! The only pity of my trip was that the sky was so hazy we didn't manage to see anything at the observatory."
Booked with JSA tour,"If you want to just do this then its only half a day, but if you combine with the JSA then it will be an all day tour. I was a solo traveler and quickly joined forces with other female solo travelers. BOOKING:I went with AllSeoulTours on a Thurs for the combined tour which saved me money because of their special. When talking to other passengers that booked with other tour agencies they ended up paying around 125,000-137,000 KRN as opposed to the 87,000 KRN (we were also all on the same bus). Just know that price is only for Thursdays, if you book for any other day its regular price. TOUR:Don't miss this tour, its a must. I got to see the Dorasan Station, Dora Observatory, walked through the 3rd tunnel (wear comfortable shoes and do cardio before arriving). The tunnel is no joke, they advise you not to enter if you are claustrophobic, asthmatic, because once you go in it's going to be work to get out again if you have an attack."
Must try,"I missed to take a full day tour as it s fully booked. I do recommend to book a tour in advance. I found out to get this tour in Seoul is cheaper than buying online with international your company. It s great to know more about Korea history. The half day your will cover imjingak park, the bridge of freedom, the 3rd infiltration tunnel, Dora observatory and Dorasan station. You need to bring your passport with you. A tour company always bring you to do tourist shopping at the end which is the waste of time."
Surreal to scary real,"Half day tour starts at 7am with a pick up at our hotel door. Collected additional tourists and then joined a big bus with an international mix. Grace was an awesome tour guide.Headed out along the guarded river Imjingak park where in the back ground you could hear artillery fire from a practice exercise. JSA tours are not available when miliary exercises are happening.Then off to the third tunnel. Not for those who are not fit or claustrophobic. And it is not 2m tall except in a couple of places, so those who are over 1.6 m be prepared for hunched walking. Wear the helmet! I would have brained myself 23 times if not for it.Dora observatory was next.Tour wrapped up at ginseng storeHalf day ended at 230 at City Hall"
North Korean Border Tour - Do it!,"Did a JSA/DMZ with www.Tourdmz.com. First, I think the content of the tours are pretty interesting and I guess most of them are pretty much the same. After some resarch we hooked up with tourdmz.com and they've been fast in respoponding and service was good. I believe the half day tours do the job and you dont need to do a fully day tour if in doubt or short on time ..."
Informative and Unique,I had a great time walking around and learning about the division between North and South Korea during this visit. You can somewhat feel the tension between the 2 countries. There were a lot of soldiers around. We even looked and went through 1 of the tunnels that the North Korean's dug. It's truly a unique experience. I would suggest a visit to this place when in Seoul.
A must do in SK,A surreal experience. You must go if you're in South Korea. There is no doubt you are at an war zone (there was never a true end to the war). Pay attention to the details of the tour. There are several things you need know. Dress conservatively. Listen to the guides. 
"Sadly, it is a unique experience. Heavily guarded.","Our trip to the DMZ was amazing. What you need to know is that you have to book a tour (you can't go in your own car). Some buses might get checked by the military because accessing the DMZ. This is an all day activity as well although maybe some tours are shorter?It is an area of war. I have never seen anything like it before. Road blocks, mines everywhere that isn't the road, military absolutely everywhere... It is something most of us don't see everyday....Just make sure you are respectful, etc...We didn't go to Joint Security Area as that is really expensive but we did get to see and go in the 3rd Tunnel (which bring you within a few metres of N Korea) and also I forgot the name of the place but high on a hill and had a great view of N Korea, its desolation, and a fake city.Worth it."
Awesome Experience - Thrilling,"I booked a full day guided tour through the DMZ and the JSA (Joint Security Area). The tunnels at the DMZ were awesome although very low level height and I am only 5""10 but the hard hat helped. Strongly suggest if you venture this far do the JSA as this is truly a non-forgettable experience. Literally peering into the eyes of North Korea soldiers and crossing the border if only by 15 feet in an enclosed structure under armed security by the South Koreans and US is thrilling."
Must see in South Korea,Take the time to visit the DMZ if you ever go to South Korea. Fascinating history and you have the opportunity to go into one of the tunnels the North Koreans tried to dig to be able to invade Seoul.Note: Not for the those out of shape. It is a 300 meter walk down a 10 degree slope. Down is easy but the up part is a killer.
Sobering place,"Very interesting and sobering place to visit. There is a lot of tension there, and you can see why when you realize just how close to Seoul is to the North Korean border. The buildup starts as you leave Seoul and the river that runs south from North Korea is surrounded by barbed wire fences, guard posts and I presume land minds. When you arrive near the DMZ the guide on the bus has to have a list of all the passengers, their nationalities and passport info, then the armed guards come on the bus and very seriously inspect all the passengers. There was an error on our list so we had to go back to the ""welcome"" center and have our list re-checked. The guards are very serious no nonsense guys, and they are the good guys who on our side! The plaza is interesting, with a number of displays including the statue of the ""Unifying Earth"", a small theater and access to the Third tunnel. You cannot go off the complex as there are minefields on the side of the hill!"
good for people interested in political history,"good for people interested in political history and politician impacts on people,, my hostel helped me find the tour ,, a lot of security check by the korean and the american military be sure you have your passport.. you will not be able to use your camera in many placesjust one thing made me upset the way the guide was talking about north korea the whole trip.. usually i don't like stereotyping but i understand that they brought up having a lot of problems with each other."
DMZ - Demilitarized Zone,"When you visit here you get a first-hand experience of life in the DMZ and realize the tension that exists between the 2 Korea's. There is so much to see, read and experience. The Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) is a region on the Korean peninsula that demarcates North Korea from South Korea. Roughly following the 38th parallel, the 150-mile-long DMZ incorporates territory on both sides of the cease-fire line as it existed at the end of the Korean War (1950–53). The Armistice Agreement was signed on July 27, 1953 ending the Korean War. The areas north and south of the demarcation are heavily fortified, though skirmishes between the two sides are rare. Located within the territory is the “truce village” of Panmunjom, but most of the rest of the land has reverted to nature, making it one of the most pristine undeveloped areas in Asia. To date 4 infiltration tunnels have been discovered (1st: Nov 15/74; 2nd: Mar 24/75; 3rd: Oct 17/78 and the 4th: Mar 3/90)."
Significant Visit,Visited this place via Kooridor (recommended by airport service counter). You can get your hotel reception to book this for you however remember to becareful as some hotels may use their own tour groups instead). I was fascinated by the guide's explanation. Tour was very thorough with important rules to abide and respect. We visited a few significant venues here. I'll recommend this to first-timers to Seoul. 
DMZ tour with koridoor,"You have to join a tour to go to the border, I did that with koridoor and was well organized. Got to go to the Dora observatory, Dora station, JSA, DMZ, was fun especially I've been there from the North also!"
Great Day Trip - Only go with the USO (US Military),"There are plenty of tour companies offering to take you to the DMZ. They will all show you the abandoned tunnel and drive you near the actual border between these countries. But if you want to see the Joint Security Area, visit the US military base on the border and actually walk into North Korea (briefly) through the infamous blue buildings, then definitely go with the US military. The tour is cheap ($60-$70 when I did it) and you get full access - you also get some great stories from actual military officers. Very interesting day."
Must do activity when you visit South Korea,"To go to the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), you must join a tour. I asked my hotel to make a reservation for me. You can pay about $46 USD for the half day tour or pay about $90 USD more for the JSA tour which lasts the entire day. I wasn't sure if the $90 extra was worth it so I did the half day tour. Our guide CK was very experienced and had us on a tight schedule so that we could avoid the crowds. His advice helped and our group didn't have to wait around too long. You get to see the third tunnel that the North Koreans dug and the train station that was supposed to link to Pyongyang, North Korea but never opened. It was a very good learning experience and consider it a must do activity in South Korea. CK took us to a great Korean BBQ restaurant afterwards which only cost $9 USD."
"Average Tour, wish we had done the JSA","We visited the DMZ through Viator's ""DMZ Past and Present"" tour. We'd wanted to book the tour with both the DMZ and JSA, but all of the tours were sold out. We chose the half-day, no lunch tour. They picked us up from our hotel and we stopped at a few other places in Seoul to gather passengers. We went to the Freedom bridge and park first, then went to the 3rd tunnel and exhibition hall (the tunnel is a long, narrow and low passage that ends literally at a dead end; luckily we got there before two huge class trips; on our way out it was packed with people and difficult to move; our tour guide took us through the exhibition hall chronologically backwards), then the observatory where you look through binoculars to see the border. Overall it was pretty average. Our guide's English was very good and he was entertaining. On our way back to the city we stopped at a tourist trap -- a ginseng museum and shop which claimed extraordinary health benefits that matched the price of the powdered and gels. This wasn't in the tour description and we would have preferred to go directly back to the city, as we hit traffic and got back later than expected. We were dropped off at City Hall around 3 pm. "
TOURIST TRAP - SAVE YOUR MONEY,"This is a situation in which they play on your perceived thoughts of danger and proximity to North Korea to charge for a tour of...land and buildings.You don't go into Korea, can barely even see North Korea (think of someone saying see that small dot 30 miles away? THAT'S the North Korea border) and you spend much of your time being shuffled on and off the tour bus from building to building. The tunnel feels pointless and has nothing to do with anything. You also have to be pretty fit to go down and come up, all for nothing. I am sorry to feel like this was a waste of time given the fact that it takes a whole day. I wouldn't recommend this tour unless you have an expectation of visiting nothing more than an outdoor museum and are truly interested in the history of this situation."
History to be grasped and tension to be felt,"It was intense. Asking yourself why you climbed into a dark cold tunnel to the border of northern korea....seeing the DMZ...feeling the tension. We had a guided tour the was obviously a little one sided. Yes, Kim is a freak but it went a little bit into the wrong direction. It was worth the travel though. I would recommend to go to panjunmon though. There you can see north and south korean soldiers still facing each other."
Don't waste your time and money!,"This was the only tour we took during our visit to Seoul where we spent 11 days visiting everywhere and everything. Believe me when I say this: DON'T DO IT! We took the full day tour to the DMZ and JSA and we lived to regret it. It is nothing more than a bunch of hurry up and wait and transfers of buses. OK, so you get to go down a tunnel: big deal! It's is dark and so crowded and you have to come back up by foot amongs hundreds of other out of breath tourists. In conclusion, all I can say about this tour is that it is a tourist trap but, of course, you can only get to visit it «fully» by buying a tour. Just don't!Although you are promessed to step into North Korea, all you get to do is stand for 2 minutes in a small building that is no longer in use where half of it is said to belong to North Korea (hardly an exciting event!). Worst thing is that one can only take pictures of very few things as the army forbids it. Boring!The great korean meal we had at lunch time had nothing to envy the great meals we've had the chance to eat in the streets of Seoul. My bibimbap was cold and the rice dried up! Worst thing is: hurry, hurry, hurry.... and wait! Do yourself a favor and visit the War Memorial of Korea instead (free of charge) where you'll spend a most wonderful day and you'll learn so much more! Anything else you want to see is accessible online with much greater access!"
Sad and haunting,"The DMZ Centre shows a good short film, giving you a small history of the tunnels. There is also a small display area next to the theatrette with models and maps, which I found interesting. At the Dora Observation Platform, we could see North Korea. The entire area was very eerie. I personally found the amusement park near the old rail engine quite disturbing. I admire the South Koreans and their hope that one day Korea will unify, but building train stations/cargo warehouses, etc. in ""hope"" seems a bit delusional, if not premature. The whole area really gave me the shivers."
Must do in Korea,"There is something deep about the DMZ tour. You feel safe the whole time but you cant help but have this eery feel, especially when upu reach the blue buildings in the DMZ and into the North Korea side. The tour was fantastic, five stars. From the observation centre to the actual DMZ where unfortunately photo taking was limited.A Bulgogi lunch hit the spot nicely.Must do trip."
"JSA was great, DMZ was tourist trap","We did the JSA/DMZ tour through the USO Koridoor group out of Seoul booked about a month in advance. The JSA part of the tour was great, and was the first stop of a long day. An hour-long bus ride from Seoul to US military Camp Bonifas. We were given a briefing by US soldier, then transferred to military bus and taken to the JSA blue buildings, a lookout point and drive-by of the ""bridge of no return"". This was a fascinating hour of the day.Then it was back on our original bus and into the tourist trap of the DMZ spots of Observation Point (gift shop and veranda with coin-operated binoculars), train station that was built as unification was more possible, but is now closed as of June 2016, and the Third Tunnel.While the Third a Tunnel could have been more interesting, there were 15 other tour buses and about 500 middle-schoolers there. We had a 13 year-old ourselves with us, but something about having a huge school group there made this seem like an oxymoronic experience. Serious military situation, but giggling and rambunctious kids was really odd.If there is a way (which we couldn't find one at the time) to only do the JSA and skip the rest, that would be a perfect experience. The JSA tours are limited but the DMZ tourist spots are come one, come all (on a tour bus of course, not in a private car)."
Worthwhile tour while visiting Seoul,"I booked a JSA-only tour with Cosmo Jin, but was taken on the entire DMZ tour anyway on the day of. The communication from the company beforehand was a little unorganized, as I had no clear idea what the tour itinerary was and they made some errors on my booking I had to call to sort out.However, the day of the tour was great. We were promptly picked up from our hotel at the designated time and driven to the bus where the rest of the group was. We drove through Seoul and up to the border while our tour guide, Han, explained some city landmarks, the DMZ, and Korean history. He was very clear and informative throughout the entire trip. We stopped at the Dorasan Observatory + train station, 3rd Infiltration Tunnel (quite a tiring walk down 350 meters and then crouching toward the barriers unground), and finally the JSA. The JSA was by far the most interesting part of the tour and seeing only the JSA would have sufficed for me. You switch busses once you reach Camp Bonifas and the tour is taken over by a US soldier. We were quite rushed inside the conference rooms so if you're taking photos, be quick. We were also lucky to see North Korea tourists on the other side, which apparently is rare as the tours on both sides are supposed to be staggered. The JSA tour ended by driving by the Bridge of No Return and Axe Murder Incident site.After leaving the DMZ, we headed back to Seoul where our bus took us to a Amethyst store. Complete waste of time, but part of Cosmo Jin's tour. Most other companies don't seem to have this tourist trap that nobody bites on. Overall, Cosmo Jin did a good job on the tour itself and would recommend visiting the DMZ, and specifically the JSA. This probably won't exist in the next couple decades, so it is definitely a rare and unique opportunity."
Must go,"Such a memorable place to go but this is a place you can't go by yourself (you have to join a local tour). And a place you must go to understand the history of N&S Korea. Not from the media and press but with your eyes and from the local Korean tour guides. We were in a tour with both Chinese and English speaking tour guides. The Chinese speaking tour guide gave more information and history of various places whereas the English speaking tour guide just keep giving instruction of how to visit the places in a ""safe"" way."
Most heavily guarded border in the world,"You could feel the tension at the DMZ even as we boarded the bus tour and the guide giving us strict warnings about pictures and telling us how to act and behave. I especially liked the section where you could look out into North Korea. After that though, it was pretty much it besides visiting the souvenir shops where one can buy North Korean products. While it wasn’t the most exciting tour, it is still a bucket list thing to do and I would recommend it to anyone except of course those with families of young children."
Tour JSA with tourdmz@tourdmz.com,"My daughter and I took Tourdmz to the JSA and really enjoyed the experience.We met at the Hotel President downtown Seoul at 11:30 and proceeded to the DMZ where we first stopped near Freedom Village and had an Authentic Korean lunch.Our tourguide Mr. Kim was informative on our trip to the JSA as well as when we got there.He laid out the ground rules. No shorts, no flip flops, no logos on shirts, pictures only when he said it was allowed and no pointing as the North Koreans will assume you are pointing a gun.The trip in you had to show your passport twice. The first time was a cursory review the 2nd time it was checked in more detail and the South Korean soldier who checked also stayed on the bus to accompany us to the JSA.We got to go into the North Korean side of blue house and take pictures. We also took pictures of the South Korean soldiers standing on their side of the JSA. You could also see a North Korean soldier standing near the door of the building on the North Korean side.The tour also included driving up to the Bridge of no return and to the Freedom Village.We got back to Seoul about 5:00pm.Great Experience!"
Real action missing,Visit to DMZ in Seoul is much hyped tourist event. We travelled the tunnel almost 600 metres at 2 levels seeing the barbed wire only. Everyone wearing helmet in low height steep tunnel. It's tiring. There wasn't charged atmosphere for an Indian who see India Pakistan border tension. South and North Korea border could be a flash point but emotions were not high to feel the tension at the border. Talks of unification was also made us feel it's not that dangerous.
Travel Adventure Korea,Tour includes the Conference Room where meetings between the South and North and UN Peacekeepers are held. Half the room is in North Korea. Also saw the Bridge of No Return and Unification Village. This is a very solemn place considering the high tension between democracy and free enterprise in South Korea and the extreemly heavy dictatorship of North Korea!
My tour highlight was this,"Growing up hearing about the Demilitarized Zone was something I didn't think much about. But seeing it firsthand is very interesting. If you like history and real life drama, this is it. Both North and South Korea man this base called the Joint Services Area. The tension is thick. The rhetoric is thicker. Both sides dispise each other politically, but there are still friends and family separated by this evil schizm. See the 3rd tunnel too. It was built by N Korea to funnel soldiers in an attack. Foiled, but interesting."
Highly Recommended,It is highly recommended to take this tour to see how the tour countries are torn apart by the war up till today.
Paranoia,"As a Brit who was born in London during WW2 (while bombs were still falling around the hospital) and is old enough to recall BBC tv news coverage of the Korean War (25th June 1950 – 27th July 1953); a visit to the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) was #1 on my list of things to do in South Korea. I went with the aim of observing the sad situation for myself while attempting to ignore any pre-conceived thoughts. My visit coincided with the 7th Congress of the Workers' Party being held a scant 100 miles away in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang - the seventh in 70 years.When my children were young I made a point of watching with them all the episodes of the American tv show M*A*S*H which depicted the lives of medical staff fighting to save casualties in the bloody conflict in the early 1950s. Yes there was quite a lot of humour in the programmes but there were also some tragic insights into the horrors of war. (God answers every prayer but sometimes the answer is no – Father Mulcahy in M*A*S*H.)The day long tour was laid on by the American USO (United Services Organisation) from their offices at Camp Kim in downtown Seoul (there are other providers) and on our route (along National Route 77) we soon passed evidence of heavy fortifications (shades of the former divide between East and West Germany) where the border with North Korea follows the Imjin River.The Battle of the Imjin River (22nd to 25th April 1951) was reportedly the bloodiest engagement fought by the British Army since WW2. It is also one of the most decisive defensive battles that Army had ever undertaken when for three days the very heavily outnumbered 29th British Independent Infantry Brigade Group thwarted the Chinese Spring Offensive. While the US provided by far the largest contingent of forces to the South Korean side there were a total of 21 nations which sent troops.A visit to the claimed “world's most heavily-fortified border”* is a weird experience which stays with the visitor long after leaving. According to reports on the internet tourists on the northern side face no dress code (not that the purported dress code in the south seemed to be enforced on my visit) and are actually encouraged to take pictures anywhere. Unfortunately in the South, with notable exceptions, photography is prohibited in much of the border area but, despite this rule, there are literally hundreds of “illicitly snapped” photos available on the internet. While I observed many instances where, for security reason, I would wholeheartedly support the “No Photography” rule there were many places where the rule seemed utterly pointless.*Having over flown (at night) the border between India and Pakistan and visited (in daylight) the wall around the Palestinian Authority areas in the middle-east I’m not certain this claim is entirely supportable.Continuing North Korean border violations provoke genuine security concerns in the South and, despite the rhetoric from Pyongyang, activity on the North Korean side of the border would seem (to this old man) to be more focused on a pre-emptive strike than defence.Our tour also included Tunnel of Agression #3 (one of a series of tunnels dug by the North Koreans aimed at an invasion of Seoul), Dorasan Railway station (Not the last station from the South, But the first station toward the North), the Dora Observatory and other points of interest within the “Civilian restricted access” area of the border zone. – in all of these areas there were assorted restrictions on photography.At Dorasan Station there is map which shows how, in happier times (post reunification) one might travel by train between London and Seoul – oh how I would love to be able to do that, not just for me but for all the people of Korea (both North and South).If you get the chance then please go and see for yourself."
Eye Opener,My visit to the DMZ was an eye opening one. It revealed a lot about the Korean War and provided a greater understanding about the relationship between North and South Korea. 
Walk the tunnel in Cherowin,This is not the USO tour. Sherwin is a small town a few miles east of the USO site. It was very interesting and authentic. We hired a Korean tour guide who picked us up in Seoul and drove us up to Sherwin for the tour. He arranged the tickets which need to be booked in advance. Our group of six occasionally ran into another group of about 10 Koreans. So it's not the really crowded commercial tour people talk about at the USO site. We saw the South Korean museum in Sherwin which was very 1950's. we saw the fake bridges going over the roads which were really defensive methods for the South Koreans to block the roads should North Korea invade their country. We saw the Sherwin Peace Observatory-saw a North Korean keeping guard less than 1 mile away from us. We saw the Labor Party Headquarters riddled with bullet holes. That was a real eye opener. We saw the abandoned train /tracks/station. We finished up with a lunch at the Korean barbecue. Which was excellent. People will tell you that you cannot go to this site-it's just not true. Our guide spoke English and the driver spoke some English. We had a very interesting discussion the entire day we spent with these guys.
"A must see in Seoul. BUt as the previous reviewer said, choose your tour operator wisely.","You cannot visit Seoul without visiting the DMV. We visited the third tunnel, the conference room, the bridge of no return, and actually stepped into North Korea. But our tour operator was horribly disorganized, the included lunch inedible, and a lot if time wasted. We did a full-day tour which was well worth the money. But, again, the tour operator was horrible. SO choose wisely."
Insight into the conflict,"This is a very unique attraction, more historical. Gives you a great insight into the conflict between the two Korea's. From the JSA, Dorasan station, Dora observatory to the Third Tunnel. What a full day of history. I hope one day there will be reunification."
Visit for the historical significance and the eeriness,"While stationed in Korea I visited the DMZ three times. The first was the most memorable. It was in January the sky was grey and it was incredibly cold. The weather fit the mood of the DMZ. The buildings are grey and they don't have heat so they are cold. There isn't really any furniture, artwork, or carpet. It very much felt like the personality of South Korea and the Korean people was stripped from the buildings in the DMZ. The Army does a GREAT job of providing the tours and all of the information. The second time I went was for a specific military mission so we got the more in depth briefing about the current communication (or lack there of) between the two Koreas and the US. The North Koreans also started to come out and stand a post of their side of the DMZ as we were leaving which was REALLY cool, I wish they had come out earlier so I could get some photos. The third time I went I spent most of my time talking with the Army guides and asking them questions about their experiences on the line. They have some intense stories about the petulant attitude and behavior of the North Koreans. This is a must do if you are going to SK; not only because there is NO other place on earth like it, but the historical significance."
Extremely informative,"We took the Tour DMZ tour. It was great. Our guide informed us about all the history as well as his family's history. The whole experience gives you a sense of how real the divide is between North and South Korea. I enjoyed the actual DMZ part the best. Looking at the soliders and the difference was great.,"
"Cramped, wet, exhausting and awesome. Here's what to expect.","The DMZ tunnel 3 tour in a nutshell: The North Koreans built tunnels to invade the south only about 20 years ago. The tour starts with lockers for your cell phones and bags, and yellow helmets. You're gonna want these helmets because the tunnel is only about 4' tall in many places, mostly about 5'. So if you're 6' tall like me you get to walk with a bow 90% of the time and bump your head at least half a dozen times. You start down a long tunnel with plenty of headroom. It's just steep enough that you think ""boy, this is going to suck on the way back"". It's cement lined, but when it levels out the walls become granite, get wet, the tunnel narrows and becomes crowded, dynamite holes mark the way. The air is fresh thanks to ventilation, but gas mask stands ( a scary reminder of possible outcomes) punctuate the journey. But it's worth it so don't chicken out! Coal seems to be smeared on some of the granite walls, the North Koreans put the coal marks there so they could later say they weren't infiltration tunnels they were building, just old coal mines. So why worry? At the end of the 200 meter (650 feet) tunnel is a cement wall with a hole in it through which you can see a room pooling with water, and another wall beyond. No, you can't get to Pyongyang through the tunnel (and more importantly, they can't get to you). Then you turn around and head back, in my case - bowing the whole time.Just after the bowing and walking part, but just before the long steep uphill climb back to the surface, is a cool looking underground tram that takes you up to the surface in comfort. But you can't take that tram because you're one of the sad losers without a blue helmet (yours is yellow, remember?). Blue helmet people get to take the tram. So, you get to hoof it back up the incline. But the tunnel is cool, the exercise invariably needed, and in the end quite refreshing. Go."
"Great experience, broaden of knowledge to Korean history!","We have went on a half day tour.The tour has brought us to the outlook point, where through the binocular, we were able to see the border of North and South Korea!During the tour, the tour guide has also explained to us a lot about the Korean history. We were able to go down to one of the tunnels which North Korean has constructed! Definitely recommended!One day tour is available also, where they will bring tourists to cross the border to North Korea!"
Really Satisfied,"I am happy to say that before we went on this DMZ tour back here in the States I read up on the different tours that were available for us. In my research here on the forum I saw mixed reviews on different tours given as well. What stood out for me was a majority of people saying if you don't take the JSA part tour of the DMZ it's a waist of time all your seeing is some trees mountains anyone can see those from where you live etc.. etc.... I have one policy I have lived by in my lifetime is first I will try something out myself no matter what people say about a place if this is what I would like to do and can only afford the DMZ tour without the JSA than so be it I""m going to take that tour no matter what anyone else has to say. Unless it is illegal or immoral in which case it would be a hands down NO I'm going!! And that is what we did all five of us in our family including my 3 teenagers. To say the least we had an interesting time and enlightening experience. Great tour. We left early and returned late with everything I could have expected. So I have to say to all you guys out there do not let the naysayers sway any views , stay positive and you will have a great vacation starting with this Great Day out at the DMZ next time your in Korea, even if there was no JSA. Enjoy Jacob"
Interesting tour !,We took the past and present at dmz -a half day tour arrenged by Viator.The quide Sunny was excelent.She spoke fluent english and was very knowledgeable and very interesting.It was a very interesting tour and we enjoyed it very much and learned a lot about Korea.
Didn't go by 'tour'...,"I was taken to this sight with the family of a Korean student that I had known in college. That's probably why i got more out of it, than tourists who paid a guide to take them there. It was interesting, freaky, and sad - all at once. One has to have sympathy for all the millions of starving slaves who are trapped on the other side of the Korean peninsula. This place has the feel of something form another time/place/dimension. It's just so jacked up that our species is as deprived as it is, given that the year is now 2016."
A great tour but choose your operator wisely,"Everything described by others is very accurate and a must do attraction if you are in Seoul. The tunnel is overwhelming, people here moaning about the long walk down and back up should consider the effort made in digging this and the counter effort made by South Korea in detecting it. Our half day trip was too rushed with insufficient time at each of the sites - the bridge, the tunnel and the observation tower. With 40 people on the bus and 20 minutes allocated at the bridge and the tower was just absurd, yet they found time to drop us off for 25 minutes at a ginseng shop on the way back which clearly nobody on the bus was interested in.Definitely visit but choose your operator carefully."
So Near yet So Far,"We took the DMZ half-day tour originally with lunch but was able to cancel the lunch, which was cheaper by 4000Won during the tour. The highlights of the tour were Freedom Bridge & railway, Dora observatory, Third Tunnel and Dorasan Station. Freedom Bridge & railway - We were given 15 minutes to take a look. You have to be quick to get to the part closest to bridge, which we were not able to do.Dora observatory- we were given 20 minutes. It is a window to North Korea. One can peek at North Korea side by side with South Korea. It was interesting to know that you can see N.K from afar and the closest you can get. You can even hear the national anthem of NK.Third tunnel- we watched an 8-minute clip, which was more of an ad. I was expecting something more interesting. Nevertheless, the tunnel itself was not a sight to behold. For me it was something that gives life to the tour yet the activity itself was boring to the point of being unnecessary- but had to do it for the experience.Dorasan Station- was like being transported to a scenario when North & South would unite. It was a sad sight but at the same a representation of optimism."
Lifetime experience,Once in a lifetime opportunity. Very interesting and informative. Definitely a must do for anyone visiting in south Korea
Independent DMZ tour by rail,"Although various types of DMZ tours from Seoul are widely advertised for tourists, it is possible to visit independently by rail, as I did on Sunday 9th May 2016 - although I did not apply for, or go to Panmunjom. You can buy return tickets to Dorasan at Seoul or other stations, and take the one daily brightly-coloured peace-themed train - with your passport! En route, you will be asked to fill in a duplicate form, and the train stops at Imjingang station (the last before Dorasan) where the occupants of the train will be counted and you will be issued with a green lanyard and badge (if you are coming on a pre-booked inclusive tour, you get a red one at this stage). You then get back on the train and go to Dorasan. On arrival there, you can go to a booth at the station and buy a tour from there to the Dora Observatory and the Third Infiltration Tunnel (I think you can buy one or the other, but most people would want both, as otherwise you would have to sit around at Dorasan waiting for the train back). You then add a black lanyard to your green one, and join a tour bus, which then takes you to Dora Observatory, where you watch a short somewhat propagandistic film in a theatre and get a talk (in Korean, on my visit) and see the views of North Korea. Have 500 won coins with you if you want to use the mounted binoculars (and you don't get much time for that money!). You then come back for a lunch break (where you can buy a Korean buffet lunch for about ₩8,000) and afterwards go off to the infiltration tunnel. Beware if you are tall - although you are given hard hats, the tunnel is low and irregular, and I bumped my head several times. The walk back along the access tunnel is long and steep. There is a shuttle train route, but I think that costs extra, and was not included in the basic tour price. After that, you go back to Dorasan and get shown around the Peace Park there before getting back on the return train and surrendering your lanyards. At all stages you are counted, to make sure that anyone on the bus is accounted for at each stage. There are lots of similar buses, so you need to make sure that you can recognise yours! My friend paid for me, but I think the train fare from Seoul plus tour were around ₩18,000 (from memory ₩8,600 for the train, and ₩9,100 for the tour), which compares favourably with inclusive tours. However note that the tours bought at Dorasan were in Korean, so it helps to have someone with you to translate! I've not described the sights in detail, as they are discussed in detail elsewhere - but I thought it would be useful to demonstrate how you can go without a prebooked tour. It is a fascinating day out!"
Sincere visit is a MUST as the ROKA and US soldiers under UN mandate...,"... defend our values right there and there is no lack of provocations, about two y ago a few landmines were burried on southern zone of dmz and 2 ROKA soldiers lost thier legs. I have been myself in alot of hot zones, like Armenia, Georgia, Moldavia or Ukraine but nothing compares to DMZ. Again, i am glad to live on this side and thank the military guides for their friendly explanations."
Some advices about DMZ Tour,"I did the DMZ tour only, not including JSC. If you have never seen something like this (perhaps the German wall) it is interesting but not a must from my point of view. A movie, an observation point, a tunnel and a modern train station – that’s it. First you should ask prior booking if your tour has a shopping stop at the end. I had a stop at a Ginseng shopping facility and was not informed about this when booking. You are not forced to buy but you have to invest another 30 mins. Further try to book online in advance, it seems to be much cheaper (mine would have been 30,000 than 40,000). And: For JSC you have to book at least 2 days in advance. Then you need good weather otherwise it is difficult to have a good view from the Dora observation point. If you are in a good sportive condition and if you don't have troubles with walking 250m not upright, then you can do the 3rd tunnel tour. For others think about that you have to do the 400m upwards at the end! The mini train is only for those wearing a blue helmet! So seniors and over weighted: attention! Ask prior booking if you can go by train down and up! Otherwise, especially if you are not a slim person you may have hard to work, to come back to the ground. This new train station has an emotional aspect but nothing important to see – it is just a modern style train station."
Meaningful trip,"If you happen to be in Seoul, a must visit place in Korea. It's will take your whole day however it's am experience you will never had to visit in the camp and nearly into another side.The process was a bit tense that you can't took photo anywhere you like, you are not allow to point your finger. "
Not to be missed,The Demilitarized Zone between North and South Korea is most important historically hence is a must-visit in Korea. There is a museum and it is possible to go down the third infiltration tunnel. There are warning signs on the fence because there are still land mines in the prohibited area.Nearby you can visit the Freedom Bridge at Imjingak Pyeonghoa-Nuri Park where North and South Korea exchanged prisoners.
A Must-Do when visiting Korea- useful Tour Tips!,"This is one of the highlights when you are visiting Korean and is highly recommended. You get a first-hand experience of palpable tension at the border between these two countries, which just under the surface seem to yearn for unification of the Korean peninsula- one day. The below review attempts to give you a time-wise itinerary of the half-day DMZ tour operated by Koridoor Tours in Seoul.If you are visiting DMZ, Koridoor is probably the only, or one of the very few tour operators that have a tie up with US Army. Here is a brief itinerary of the half-day trip you can book with them (costs USD 92. Better to pay in USD as the KRW equivalent amount works out to be ~10-15% higher). We 3 friends visited the tour in April 2016 and the outline is as under:1. Tour duration: 7:30 AM to 3:30 PM. Tour starts from Camp Kim near Namyeong Metro station in Seoul.2. Report to Camp Kim by 7-7:15 AM, the tour bus leaves at 7:30 AM sharp, and takes about 45 mins to reach Camp Bonifas, which the entrance to the DMZ area operated jointly by the UN, US and Korean forces. Along the way an English-speaking guide briefs you on the history of Korean War, why the peninsula got divided and what the DMZ is all about.3. At Camp Bonifas, a US Army officer checks your passport, and a ‘tour member’ badge is issued to you and you are expected to wear it at all times.4. After that the bus takes you inside the main JSA Block- Joint Security Area, where the US Army officers take you through a presentation on a brief history of the DMZ. There is a souvenir shop on this campus which you can visit thereafter or when the tour returns.5. Around 9:30 AM, you are transferred to a new bus with an US Army officer accompanying you to the first main stopover of the tour: Pan-Mun-Jom, the actual border between S & N Korea. He briefs further on the DMZ during this short 10-15 minute trip. We also learn that DMZ is actually a 4 km strip of land, 2 km on either side of the border.6. Panmunjom is a block of buildings on either side of the border. There is a blue building which falls on either side of the border, inside which you will enter and see a conference table (right on the border, with chairs falling on either side). You can click pictures in this area but ONLY facing the North Korea side- no photos/ videos are allowed for the S Korean sides- so don’t even try a selfie with S Korean buildings in the background; one person tried and was sternly asked to delete the picture from pics and delete folders.7. Around 10:45 AM you return to the bus and will be taken to a hill point which faces the Bridge of No return and from where you can see a large swathe of No Korean land including the famous “Propaganda Village” with eulogies on Kim Jong Un playing loudly, inviting people to come and stay in the ‘North Korean paradise’.8. We then got back into the bus and drive past the Bridge of No Return, returning to the JSA block. You can also spend some time at the souvenir shop at this stage, buying fridge magnets, t-shirts and the like. 9. Here you are transferred back to our original tour bus and US Army officers took our leave; and the tour proceeds onto the 2nd main stopover - Dorasan railway Station, which intends to join the two countries through the rail network. We reached there roughly around 11:30 AM.10. The station itself paints a tragic picture: excellent infrastructure and a nice platform with all tracks and signal systems working, but no trains, no journeys. You can enter the main station building and buy a KRW 1,000 (USD 1) ticket to visit the platform itself- which is highly recommended for a few good pictures.11. The tour operator then took us to the canteen area of the Kaesong Industrial Region around 12:30 PM, which was functional with many Korean companies offering employment to as many as 53,000 workers (mostly North Korean) on the border, as part of confidence building measures between the two countries. The project ran well for 12 years, and was discontinued in February 2016 after “additional provocation threatening peace” from North Korea. The tour stops here for lunch (not many options for vegan). Food costs around KRW 10,000 (~USD 10), which is NOT included in the tour cost and is payable on the spot. We preferred carrying our own breads and enjoyed them just outside the canteen/ restaurant building, basking in the lovely sun.12. Around 1:15 PM we started for the 3rd and last main stopover- the 3rd Infiltration Tunnel. Before that the tour stops briefly at a vantage point that has many high power binoculars where you can take a closer look at the North Korea side. And thereafter we reach the tunnel area around 1:45 PM. This is the 3rd of the 4 tunnels allegedly constructed by North Korea to breach S Korean area, but were discovered in various early stages of readiness over the years. The tunnel itself is ~1.6km long, but only about 265 meters is open to public.13. The tunnel itself is in a building where you go down for about 400 meters at a downward incline of 11 degrees, reaching the mouth of the tunnel. From here the tunnel (which is 1.6 k long but only ~.26 km is accessible to tourists) gets really narrow, and is about 180 cm high and 200 cm wide, which means a 6-footer will have to bend several times inside the tunnel. The total one way journey down is ~800 meters, so remember that it’s about 1.5 kms to & fro journey, the return leg being a steep uphill walk and is therefore not for everyone. Also keep in mind your height especially for the actual tunnel part. However if you can complete it- it’s worth it!14. So after the tunnel the bus starts back for Seoul around 2:30 PM, returning to Cam Kim at around 3:30 PM. An amazing, humbling and tragic experience. MUST try when you are in Seoul."
interesting,"This is an interesting place if you're interested in history, you can visit the museum and also go inside the 3rd infiltration tunnel which is quite an unique experience."
Amazing!,I went with my school and it was amazing. We had an amazing guide and went through the third tunnel.It was amazing getting that close to North Korea. I actually got to enter North Korea through one of the blue buildings. Definitely worth the trip.
A place of historical significance ,"This place is worth a visit, make sure to go through the tunnel experience. Spend a moment to lookout across the DMZ to North Korea, contemplating what if you are standing from the other side instead of from the side of South Korea."
Interesting and Informative,"Did the half day trip with VIPTRAVEL and they were great at explaining the history behind the area. We were lucky we went on a good day and could see past to North Korea, on a cloudy day it might not be as good. The third tunnel was my favourite part of the trip.Going to the DMZ is much cheaper and easier than going to Panmunjom. I unfortunately wasn't able to book a PMJ trip and have noticed a lot of comments have said that was their highlight. Nonetheless, if you don't have the money or if the military operations don't allow you to go to PMJ, the DMZ trip by itself was interesting. Only bad thing is they made us go to a Ginseng shop afterwards!"
"Quite surreal, but worth a visit","We visited here as part of our arranged tour, and weren't really sure what to expect. You have to go through quite a process to ensure entry, as they need your passport, take you on a separate, satellite tracked and timed bus (yes it's true!), and then you have a soldier meet you at the checkpoint into the zone. All a bit surreal.However, once you are in it gives you a glimpse of what life has been like for the South Koreans in the last century, which I will admit, I didn't know fully. The film show before is quite sobering, and puts everything into context, so when you go down the 325m tunnel to one of the secret passages dug by the North Koreans to invade the south, you can see how the hostility developed.One thing I'd say though is that if you are tall, I.e. 2m and above, the tunnel isn't for you. It's quite low and you have to wear a hard hat. I'm average height and found that by the end of it my back hurt by crouching so much, but it was still an experience I'm glad I did.The new train station that was built to connect the two nations was also a bit of an eye opener, it was modern, clean and eerily quiet. Maybe one day it will join the two nations again.The observatory which looks onto N Korea is worth seeing, although if the pollution from China happens to be blowing south, you won't see much.Overall, there is a lot to see and do, all,of which takes about 2-3 hrs, so if you have time, then definitely do it."
Great Experience,"I went with the VIPTRAVEL tour group. I really enjoyed my experience here. We were first shown a video about the history between N. & S Korea,then were led through a small museum. I got the opportunity to go to the 3rd tunnel which was pretty cool.I thought the tunnel would be more narrow and small but it wasn't that bad.The only issues I had were that after a certain point it got super crowded and limited time there. Other than that,I recommend it!"
Skip this; go to Panmunjom,"While it was interesting to be able to look into North Korea, the touristy, almost carnival-like atmosphere of the museum really took away from the dignity of the situation."
DO NOT BE CONFUSED!!,"THERE IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DMZ AND THE JSA! Please note this when doing your tour: the ONLY interesting thing to see here is the JSA which is like 9kms away from the DMZ... in the DMZ THERE IS NOTHING TO SEE!!! You just go into a senseless tunnel that shows nothing, and you cannot take pictures, before you have to see a super badly biased short movie and a poor exhibition about the war... there is one observatory from where you can see north korea at a distance, but you can only take pictures from behind a line where you can see nothing (to actually see something you can go after such line but pay 500won to rent a pair of binoculars)... on the JSA instead, you will see all the UN stuff and the real border... IF YOUR TOUR DOES NOT INCLUDE THE DMZ DO NOT GO!!!!!!"
An exciting journey ,"A trip to the DMZ is exciting and tiring. All the excitement builds up because it is an active war zone with mines laid on both sides of the road. On top of the little hill, you realise how near the opposing forces with their guns are pointing at you. I am surprise that hey do not make us sign disclaimer on any forms. The tiring portion is walking down and up the 3rd tunnel. 74 meters below ground does not sound at all tiring until you try walking it.It's worth a visit!"
Must see,"The DMZ-JSA tour is a must. We booked our tour through tourdmz. Dorasan Station- not much to see apart from a brand new train station, that one day they hope to link up with China, there is a gift shop here. From here we could hear propaganda messages from the North Korea side that they broadcast daily.Dora Observatory- From here you can see into North Korea, you are not allowed to take picture from in front of a certain point and this is quite strictly enforced by the South Korean Army guards. They have binoculars to see in North Korea. There is another gift shop here.Tour of 3rd Tunnel- The tunnels are low and quite crowded when you are down there. But still worth a visit. When you are at the bottom it takes about 5 minuets to the point when the tunnel have been blocked, they have a window where you can see the North Korea side. JSA (Panmunjom) tour- After a security briefing we were driven to the JSA area, with a military guide, when we were here there was about 10 South Korean army guards and only 1 North Korean guard. You are allowed in the Conference room for about 5 minutes, where you are allowed to take picture of the North Korean side only! You are not allowed to take any pictures of the South Korean side. They have a large gift shop here, where you can buy a number of North Korean gifts (bank notes, coins, Wine and certain foods)"
Except problems with the reservation it was good,"When i reserved for the first time, i didn't get any reply,so it was a bit worrying whether they will use the bank account to get the money. But no reply so i searched for another site and reserved there also,they didn't ask for any bank account and i got answer so i was happy. But later it revealed that they took the money from the previous reservation but they didn't contact me at all. So it revealed so we got back the cash, But actually the money they took from the account was more than we should have paid in cash. So be careful which site you will make a reservation. And at the Dorasan Station they offered us to buy North Korean win,which revealed to be quite weird: there are small dark flakes inside and the taste is not really good. But anyway the tour was great, i could learn about the relationship between North and South."
Book ahead from USO-Koridoor for this once of your lifetime bucket list visit at the DMZ,"There are many S. Korea tour operators offer DMZ tours. While trying to choose which one to take my son told me he had already booked the tour through USO/ DMZ/JSA, operated by Koridoor. I then searched USO DMZ Koridoor and found its website. By looking at its advance reservations/long waiting lists; it is obvious that tour by Koridoor is ranked on the top of preferred DMZ tour among the others. Although the website provides instructions for how to book the tour; it’s still taking a bit of effort to complete it. Unlike other online tour bookings, it only offers you the booking inquiries and doesn’t accept direct credit card payment via its website once your inquiries are accepted. So here is what you need to do once you are on its own website main page: look to the left of the main page, find “How To Make Reservation”-a black rectangular box, then click on it. A pop-up page shows and will give you how to book step by step instructions through its website. After you complete your online booking request someone from Koridoor will then contact you via e-mail if your inquiry is accepted. This e-mail will give you specific and detailed information regarding the tour costs, tour restrictions, payment options, cancellation policy, directions and map to the departure location Camp Kim USO office, transportation options and summary of your tour itineraries. Your booking is not secured until they receive your payment in full through one of three options they offer to you. I chose to pay with my credit card and did an international call to give them my credit card numbers. After you have made the payment they will then contact you again via second e-mail notifying your payment has been received. You will also receive more tour information and particularly the mentions of Dress Codes set by the United Nations Command (UNC) Military Armistice Commission Headquarters Area (MACHA). Also worthy of mention here are: ""Backpacks, purses and camera bags are permitted, but must remain in the vehicle transporting the individual into the UNC MACHA. Jackets and outerwear must be worn not carried."" Your Koridoor tour guide will emphasize these dress codes again while on board the bus. Visitors are required to arrive at Camp Kim USO at least 30 min. prior to the departure for staff to process your passport clearance. I booked the afternoon bus tour that departed at 12:30 from Camp Kim. My itineraries included: Dorasan Station site visit; DMZ Theater; The Third infiltration Tunnel tour; Dora observatory; An informative video at Camp Bonifas and a presentation by a member of the U.S. military; 20 Minute Briefing at JSA (Joint Security Area) Visitor Center; 15 min. self-guided tour of the museum collections; tour to the JSA include Freedom House and Conference room. These two buildings are where North and South Korea officers(Including U.S .Military) conduct their negotiations. The entire JSA is under very tight security and military controls. Worth of mention is several light blue A shape roofing military structures for joint meetings called Conference Row. These buildings built on both the north and the south side of the Military Demarcation Line (MDL); some were built on top of it. This line even cut through the conference rooms and down the middle of the conference tables where officers from both sides meet face to face. Facing the Conference Row buildings on the north is North Korean Panmungak (a concrete building) and on the south is the South Korean Freedom House. While tour in the area we had views of Bridge of No Return and Point of Ax Murder through the bus windows, no step out of bus visit was offered. The total time on the DMZ site visits offered by Koridoor is approx. 4 hr. At each site there are plenty of information posts/bulletin boards/detailed maps which provide you quick glimpse of the histories behind it. Our first stop was Dorasan Station which is the last stop of Korail train travel from Seoul, South Korea and the starting point of future trans-continental railroad. It is worth to pay 500 won entry ticket to the platform where you can have picture taken with a train departed from Seoul and the sign post of distance between Pyeongyang, Dorasan and Seoul. At the Dora Observatory you can see villages beyond the DMZ on North Korea side on a clear day. Unfortunately we had a rainy day and all I could see was smog; not worth of putting my money in the observatory binocular lens. Each site visit comes with specific instructions of “Do and Don’t”, especially in JSA. Your U. S. Military guide will tell you where you are allowed to take photos and where you are absolutely prohibited to do so, how to behave and areas not permitted to enter or cross. There are many tour groups come through here but time allowed to visit is precisely controlled by JSA. The atmosphere around the JSA is tensed; so be prepared to follow your military guide’s instructions to a T. The tour of Third Tunnel requires moderate physical strength, proper shoes, clothes and helmets as you will need to walk down slope to the underground narrow uneven path and low overhead clearance to reach the site. On your return you will be walking on steep uphill path to reach the ground level. This part was a bit challenged for me-being a senior! Visiting of JSA Freedom house, Conference room were the highlights of my tour as I observed rock soldiers guarding the north and south boundaries; was allowed to have quick pictures with the rock soldiers on duty; was able to come so close to the area under North Korean's control; and its frontier RPRK military headquarter Panmungak is only 80 meters from the JAS Freedom House. With the zoom-in lens I could even see the DPRK guards. At the end of the tour we were taken to the nearby restaurant around 5:40 for one hour dinner break and then return to Camp Kim. The bus ride from Camp Kim to Dorasan Station is 1 hr. 10 min. From the restaurant back to Camp Kim is 1 hr. So be prepared to spend at least 8 hours for this tour. My half day tour cost was 96,000 KRW(approx. $92), not include the dinner meal; you can either pay exact KRW 10,000 to eat at the restaurant or you can bring your own meal. Although this tour seems pricey for a half day but it is still cheaper than other DMZ tours offered. Be able to personally witness the world’s most highly guarded frontier between Korea’s two political regimes and U.S. military assistance fulfilled one of my bucket lists while visiting Seoul. DMZ tour is rated by TripAdvisor reviewers as the #1 of “things to do” in Paju. DMZ/JSA is only permitted through authorized tour operators with guides, and with present/approval of your passport; don’t attempt to do it yourself. I highly recommend you choose USO/ DMZ/JSA tour by Koridoor. If you are a member/family of the US military you get discount fare for this tour."
Very Informative Place to Visit,The most I knew about South Korea was watching MASH on TV but we came to South Korea for my son's wedding in Busan and this was a place I wanted to visit. Our tour was booked in Seoul and had 4 different stops during the 6 hour tour. Each stop was very interesting. Especially the walk down to the North Korean tunnel that was found in 1994.
DMZ tour with Cosminjin,"Booked a DMZ tour with Cosminjin which included a visit to the observatory and the third infiltration tunnel (did not realize the tour we'd booked didn't include the JSA but that was our fault so make sure it's included in the tour you pick). Our tour guide Sue was amazing - incredibly knowledgeable about the North/South divide and so sincere. As other people have said, the third infiltration tunnel is a bit of a trek but it's an underground tunnel, what do you expect. All in all, an unforgettable experience and would definitely recommend doing some kind of DMZ/JSA tour when visiting Korea."
Unique experience,"This tour was already included in our pre paid seven days tour, however, we didn't realised our tour refer to lots of slope instead of other tours that are slightly easier, referring to the ones that wear blue hats and can bypass the sloppy slope via shuttle, thus avoiding the strenuous hike. The 'end' destination pretty much looks like a prison cell, if one intention is to peep through the North Korea border. Photography is not allowed at the tunnel.All in all, interesting historical structure, not suitable for family or those with height or heart issues."
Under the ground but over the top?,"It's all a bit cloak and dagger, certainly as regards getting there - passport checks, road blocks, limited photographing etc. it's a border for heavens sake and the North Koreans are hardly likely to come sneaking up from behind...You have to admire whoever actually built Tunnel 3 (and presumably 1,2 and 4 etc). No doubt health and safety standards were different to those that would be imposed in the west. The end of the journey is inevitably rather an anti climax - no baddy North Korean Soldiers to be glimpsed beyond - and the surface tourist centre is maybe a bit self conscious but it's interesting and certainly unique. This and the observation area that is next on the tour show the stupidity of man clearly enough and the waste of manpower and resources that results. But at least the DMZ has unintentionally created an apparently wonderful nature reserve. It doesn't seem right to award marks to such a destination - in someways just one star would be better"
Worth seeing,"This was on my partners bucket list. It was worth seeing but I think you have the impression you will be seeing one of the bigger tunnels. We were in a group of about 32 so we were taken to the wee train. Hard hats on and squashed into the train which was not great for 3 people in seats for two. The tunnel was very narrow so if you were on the outside you were trying to lean in to avoid your head hitting the roof! We got off the train and walked down the rest of the narrow tunnel. We got to the end to see a blocked off wall with a wee looking hatch in it. Then told to turn around and go back as everyone had to see the blocked off wall. All this time we were continually told NO PHOTOS! Not that there was much to take pictures of. We saw a film after we got out of the tunnel which was quite interesting then taken up to the observation point. There was a yellow line 6ft from the binoculars and viewing point , again no photos beyond this line! By this time it was a blizzard so we were more than happy to get back in the bus . It may be that the experience was spoiled by being in a big group but I did think the tunnel was a disappointment . "
"Fascinating, Eerie and a Must Do","Accessible through a couple of tour companies and worth every penny. Book ahead as the tours book out very quickly. The guides were knowledgeable, interesting and happy to answer any questions. Our tour encompassed the DMZ, JSA (Joint Security Area) and the 3rd infiltration tunnel. Can be quite confronting at times however the entire tour is well organised, seamless and an interesting insight into a fairly fractious area. Wear comfortable shoes as the 3rd tunnel can be quite a hike, but well worth it."
Tension So Thick...,I was stationed in South Korea at Camp Casey and Camp Red Cloud when I did the tour. Hugely fascinating. The non stop propaganda spewing across the loud speakers from North Korea was constant 24/7. I also got to do a little off the books tour since I was a medic and went up in my ambulance. It was very unusual the way the GI's reacted because they almost never saw American women beyond Freedom Bridge. The tour was very enlightening. I understand now why the older Korean generation welcomed us off the street into there homes and why the younger generation didn't want us there. The younger generation only see what's in the history books. I doubt many of them have visited there because the impact would be much different. Even if you're not a history buff this is a must see. It really puts things in perspective.
Love the movie,"Watch the movie is the very first thing all visitors must do when visit DMZ, and the movie is very touched. Afterwards, if allowed, should try to walk down to the 3rd tunnel, instead of taking monorail. The tunnel is deep down under the sea level, however, is spacious enough to not feel any dizziness. "
Why history has a present day impact,"If you've ever wanted to experience ""opposite land,"" here's your chance - this is a trip/window into a historic conflict (the Korean War), but also into half a world that as a result is isolated and, in some seasons, literally frozen (North Korea). From a distance, you can see villages setup for propaganda purposes, and experience what it's like on a heavily guarded no-man's land that is now, ironically, become a wildlife preserve (because there are no people). This has to be one of the most unusual and fascinating day trips - especially because at the end of touring the vast bleak horizon that is the view into North Korea, you go back to the contrast of bustling, cosmopolitan Seoul. "
Make sure you pick a day with clear skies and good visibility,"We were unfortunate in that the day we chose the weather was very poor. Its rained constantly and visibility was zero. We were picked up at our hotel at 7.40am in a van. The van then went to another hotel to pick up three other passengers. One of the three came out after about 10 minutes. 10 minutes later the driver said the other couple had cancelled. We then went to meet up with the tour bus which took several attempts before they got the right location. Not a great start.We first stopped at Freedom bridge area while the tour guide bought tickets for the DMZ. We were allowed 20 minutes in this area, which really was not enough. We then went to the DMZ where there was a small museum and the third tunnel which we went down. We maybe spent too long here as most of the group were just hanging around waiting to set off again.Then we went to the train station which was in fact very errie and interesting. A bit like a ghost station. No passengers or trains.Finally we went to the Observatory. But we could not see the trees outside the building - never mind North Korea. There was a good museum in this place but we were rushed out and did not have enough time.So overall not a good experience for perhaps the most expensive tour in Seoul. The time allowed in each of the stops not good. Everything was rushed - yet of course on the way back we had time to stop at the place selling Gingsin. When are tours going to stop with this sort of unwanted activity."
Definitely see,"The DMZ is a highlight of Seoul. It helps you appreciate everything going on... struggles, worries, it brings things up close."
A must.,"The third tunnel is very interesting, but watch your head! The sealing is very low. The museum is also very informative, however you have to endure a ""comically"" narrated video first. The tunnel its self is we'll worth a visit."
A must for history buffs,I chose Seoul City Tours to take me from Seoul to the DMZ. The experience brought history from the 1950 through today to life. Entering the 3rd Infiltration Tunnel was an unforgettable experience. Be aware that you walk down a 400 meter steep incline to reach the tunnel and then have to walk back up.
Recommended,"I recommend going on this tour. It would be better if they allowed you into an actual city in North Korea, but you still technically go into North Korea when you're at the JSP. Really cool seeing what is on TV pretty often, with a North Korean solider or two standing on their side."
Excellent and insightful,"My partner and I did the morning tour last week, and we most enjoyed it. Vincent our Korean tour guide was both very engaging and clearly cared a lot about his tour group and his country. Kudos to him! I would definitely recommend this tour. As a foreigner, it provided so much insight into the relationship between the two Koreas. Worthwhile! Unfortunately, the day we went the DMZ became closed off to civilians part way through the tour, however this did not hinder our experience at all. Vincent went out of his way to find alternative activities to ensure his guests still enjoyed their tour. Thank you!"
DMZ Zone is amazing,"I went to DMZ tour through Koridoor tours. It was very cold day, but still intereseting to me. As a person who visited Korea hardly, I really recommend you to anyone especially for forienger visiting Korea for the first time. They should visit DMZ zone once in a life because you can learn and hear about current siutation of Korea where is seperated uniquely in this world. Sometimes I see many childrens and students, and it probably means that there are lots of things to learn for people. It was an amazing trip again."
Many information about the border situation,This stop was included in my trip to the JSA in Panmunjon. You can have a look through the spyglass to see a North Korean propaganda village. You can easily imagine all the artillery hidden in the forests and mountains. 
tour is worthwhile,"the bus tour to DMZ is a worthwhile trip. It's an early start and they pick up more tourists before they head to the DMZ. The tour guide tells you enough about Korea and the relationship between the South and North. I thought I booked a tour for a full day with Pamunjom but it appeared that I only booked the morning session but that was not clear when you booked it. so that's very disappointing. The guide told us in the bus, so way too late, that we couldn't pay extra for the afternoon tour as it was already fully booked. It seems they only allow a limited amount of people to Pamunjon. So make sure you book the right trip! For the rest it was ok."
"Interesting, Worth the trip","About an hour by bus from Seoul, we used an organised bus tour. I went to the underground infiltration tunnel 3 which involves a steep downhill walk below ground to get to and then a difficult uphill walk of over 350m to get back out, not for the elderly or people with any physical difficulty. The day we went it was very misty/foggy and the look from the Dora Observatory wasn't the best.Pictures were not allowed in some areas of the tour and you must carry your passport.Overall it was interesting, not sure if it is a must do though."
MUST DO!,"This was a day trip to the Demiltarized zone and it was great. I would say it was the highlight of my trip. The walk through the tunnel that north Korea made for bombing south Korea was fascinating I would NOT recommend this for anyone that has a hard time walking or bending. The tunnel trail is quite long and steep and you need to walk hunched over. (I am 5'11"" so that didnt help) Reallllly cool day trip."
Half Day Tour to DMZ,"Curious about North Korea, a closed protected country. We decided to change our itinerary from Everland Theme Park to the DMZ tour. Reservation a must through an authorized agent in South Korea. It is good to book online days ahead - cheaper & ensure you get a full day tour that covers Panmunjeom (which we missed ). The tour covers The 3rd Infiltration Tunnel, which we walked through the 358m tunnel with 11degree gradient. This is the 3rd tunnel found by the South Korean, evidence of the North trying to attack the South. We got a glimpse into North Korea from a viewing deck at Dora Observatory . Got into the Dorasan train station - Not the last station in South, but towards the first station in North Korea. This line will link the rail to Europe. Must carry passport, tied security check. Photography is not allowed in certain area."
Historical,"History at its best! My family and I learned a lot about the Korean war, how the super powers USA and USSR pitted the north and the South. My heart goes to those born in 1950, in Kaesong as this area was subjugated to North at that time."
Interesting..,"Signed up for the full day tour with USO and it cost about $92. Overall it was an interesting experience and a great thing to do to get away from all the shopping in the city.The first stop was the 3rd tunnel and even though it was packed, it moved smoothly. Wear the hard hat, wear the hard hat! I banged my head a few times and I was glad the hat was on. Walked back up the tunnel is a great work out!The 2nd stop was observatory and we went on a snowy morning so we couldn't see anything.The 3rd stop was a train station connecting N and S Korea. Not much to see here.The last stop was the JSA, which is the highlight of the trip. I wish this part was a bit longer, but it only lasted about 15 mins. It was quite eery standing on the steps and staring into North Korea. We were able to see a few of the soldiers there and it was just a staring contest. We did the 9am tour and we were back before 4pm. Overall the planning from the USO tour was great, they somehow manage to beat the crowds at all the stops."
Absolutely stunning,"Well thats a fast one: its the only dmz in the world, it is exceptionally fascinating the see. Also to hear the south korean version of everything that happend (since it differs quite a bit from more objective opinions of outside historians) but go there, visit the invadin tunnels and see something unique."
Interesting experience,"Stayed in Seoul for 3 days and booked the DMZ tour (in connection with the JSA tour) in order to get a feel of the border between North and South. When visiting the DMZ, you will actually not be taken to the border itself (JSA), ""just"" next to the DMZ. The tour comprises of the following:- Imjingak (with Freedom bridge and the blown up locomotive)- The 3rd Tunnel- Dora observatory (opportunity to see Gaesong and the 160m flagpost in the North)- Dorasan Station (last northern train station in the south. Has also a souvenir shop which is much cheaper than the duty free shop at Camp Bonifas in the JSA)The highlight of this tour was the 3rd Tunnel, which is open to the public. However going down and later comming up is quiet tricky as you have to walk a 11% steep tunnel for 350 meters. The tunnel itself is open to the public on a 265 meter length. It is accessible till the 3rd tunnel block, installed by the south, which is 170 meters away from the Military Demarcation Line (MDL).The DMZ tour (without JSA) lasts only for a half day and has no lunch included. If you have time I would recommend you to book the joint DMZ&JSA tour."
Very interesting. Captivating. An educational tour.,"Visiting this historical place is one of both a fascinating experience and an educational one. A sad story of human conflict that has no end to this day.The DMZ with the adjacent 3rd tunnel site exhibit is an eye opener. A visit to Korea's past violent history. Started the tour with an 8 minute video presentation and a short mini tour of its museum. After which followed by the arduous trip down to the earth's belly to discover the site where the North Koreans have dug one of many tunnels. A failed plan to invade Seoul, the capital city of South Korea. Must be warned though, not for the unfit....the way to go down to see the actual dug tunnel was a steep walk down, at least a 1km or so down. So imagine, the effort to go back up. Good exercise. Goodbye to some good kept calories! hahaha.An educational, insightful visit to a piece of history."
WOW...,i have never been to such an eerie feeling place...we did the tour into the dmz on a bus tour...and it was kinda like a haunted house feeling..go go go.. was amazing... 
Too rushed,"Note that we wanted to book the DMZ + JSA tour but learned that the JSA portion is often fully booked well in advance. If you are traveling to Seoul I suggest that you book this tour online before you arrive. We were only able to book the DMZ (morning tour only) on short notice. Liked all of the stops and found it very interesting, but felt way too rushed especially through the Exhibition Hall. Our guide was great but it appears that the ""system"" requires the guides to bring their groups through the various stops at very exact times limiting our time to look, take photos, etc. Still would say it is a ""must do"" for Seoul."
Interesting - Great History Research Tour Companies - I used seoulcitytours.net (see my review for comments on them),"The DMZ tour was very interesting. You can get a sense of the incredible South Korean security measures in place to this day. You also feel sadness that families have been torn apart while so geographically close. Tunnel number 3 was the most intriguing part of the tour; you see how close N.Korea got to invading Seoul. However, no photographs are allowed which is very disappointing. If you want to see the villages from Dora Observatory, choose a clear day.The rest of the review is about Seoul City Tours. The bus was in great condition and the guide was friendly. I took tour A. We spent 20 minutes at Imjingak Park, 60 minutes at Tunnel 3, 8 minutes in the DMZ theater, 20 minutes at Dorasan Station and ONE HOUR at a ginseng center. The ginseng center is a maze. If you try to get out, you're sent through another walkway and through another shopping area. I understand the quality may be outstanding but prices are more than $200 USD. This was a complete waste of time. You were rushed through an overview of Ginseng and then the hard selling started. I didn't buy anything and wish I would have left the tour at this point. I considered taking a cab but thought it would be too rude. Just keep this in mind if Ginseng is not your thing and you don't feel like waiting for 60 more minutes to get back. "
Experience must,"We booked a tour through the USO. You learn a great deal more than the general understanding of what has taken place and the way of life for Koreans. Very informative history as well as heart wrenching memorials. Everything from the barbed wire fenced river with armed foreces to the minefields, the tunnels, the train station in waiting for the hopeful reunification are worth the short drive from Seoul. My children were able to get a glimpse of what happened during the war and the ongoing struggle for both sides since the split. I would recommend to book through the USO. We shared a whole bus with one other group of five. Our guide informed us of what we were about to see before arriving at each site. Another advantage was her experience which provided us with arriving at sites prior to the influx of tourist buses so that we could enjoy the site without the hassel of crowds. This also gave us the perfect pictures without any other tourist in the shots. As we left each site we would see the bus loads and lines waiting to experience and this was soley due to our guide's knoweldge of how other tours run. She also took us to a traditional Korean lunch (cafeteria style) this was the only time that we felt among the tourist. We had heard other tour customers complaing that there was little explanation prior to arriving at sites. Tour took the good part of the day. Arriving at the USO around 745am. and arriving back a little bit before expected (3pm.) Traffic on weekends going in and out of Seoul is typical city traffic."
Must do for all ages,Great Korean history. I recommend doing a tour through the hotel. You get to learn a lot about why Korea is split and the efforts they have made to attempt to reunite and the hardships as well. The tunnels are so cool but be prepared to walk... No flip flops!! This is your only way to get a glimpse of North Korea!
DMZ SAD SIDE OF A WAR,"I visited this place with a mixed feeling. On one side it is a silent statement of South Korean (and Americans) resilience against oppression and autocracy, and on the other hand a vivid declaration of the cruelty and pain caused to so many soldiers and population, where a river of blood still flows dividing that nation. If you are a person who likes visiting war sites or memorial sites, by all means do so. It is quite sober and the air is filled with reverence.If you are not much into this kind of tour, you may skip it."
A very unique experience.,"We booked a tour to the DMZ. We started out around 7AM and a van picked us up. Then we were dropped at a main location and switched to a big bus. The tour was pretty full. It took about an hour to reach the DMZ. We were met with a lieutenant which was our tour guide inside the DMZ. There's a lot of strict rules here and you also had to sign your life away. I was rather scared, but signed it anyway. There was a bried video and we mainly went on a bus and stopped at various stops. There are certain areas where you can't take photos, etc. We went to the observatory where you can see N Korea from afar, the Propaganda Village, also the Bridge of No Return ... We went into the blue building where they hold peace meetings between South and North. Overall a very informative experience. "
