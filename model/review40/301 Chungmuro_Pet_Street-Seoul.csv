I little sad and depressing,There are so many cute dogs for sure.... but they are in very small glass boxes and some are way too young to be away from their mothers. Most shops wont let you in unless they think you are buying... they definitely dont like tourists.
Adorable puppies but felt depressed leaving the shops ,"If you’re an animal lover, feel prepared to be so sad and empty after visiting this street. You have about 8 shops of the cutest pups who are all so fragile and scared.. Every puppy I said hello too wanted to be saved- it really breaks your heart.I was able to take pictures and videos, but overall all the shop owners are cold. These dogs are just a price tag to them, they DO NOT take care of them. I wish I could save them all "
Never buy a pet there please,Hi . I bought a puppy there 2 weeks ago . He died yesterday for no reason . Heart failure the vet said .... he was so tiny ... probably sick .... I’m heartbroken. Apparently it happen often ... most of those poor puppies are too small and sick ... they take them way too early from there parents ... to be able to sell them super tiny . I’m devastated
Unfriendly and rude shopkeepers - stay away,They will ask you to get out if you don't speak Korean. They are thugs and gangsters so watch out. Dogs are cute though.
"Cute dogs to look at, but environment feels threatening ","My husband and I checked out this street as we really love dogs. Just to see though, and weren’t planning on buying as we live in Singapore. A shop keeper scolded someone beside who tried to take a photo of their dogs (so we didn’t dare to try taking any pics!) Walking down the street, we entered another shop where we were rudely told to get out if we weren’t buying anything. (We didn’t try to touch/ take pics of their dogs. Just walked in for 2 secs, and chased out immediately.) A random stranger started tailing us after that, standing near us and pretending to stare at the dogs. Frightened, I escaped into a nearby pet supplies shop. Soon after, he left. PHEW! For tourists who just like to look at super cute dogs, please take note of these things and be careful of your surroundings while visiting! "
"Diseases, birth defects, and bad business men","We went to chungmuro to buy a Pomeranian last month and not even 3 weeks later out of nowhere it started twitching and having seizures so we took it to the vet and they diagnosed it with distemper and it died a couple days later. My wife and I went back to the pet store and the owner wouldn’t give us a refund or another dog and told us it wasn’t his problem and that we missed the “2 week window” that he would of givin us another dog but only if we brought the body in. He also continued to lie about documents he claimed to give us and that he didn’t have to give us anything even though we had our receipt. Eventually after threatening to sue, he gave us another dog for 50% off but told us not to come back. We took that dog to the vet immediately to get checked out and all seemed good until about 1 week later it showed signs of kennel cough so we went back to the vet to get antibiotics but the puppy got worse very quickly and before we could take it to the vet again it died. :( Please do not shop here!these people only want your money and sell diseased dogs without their shots and you will lose money!"
