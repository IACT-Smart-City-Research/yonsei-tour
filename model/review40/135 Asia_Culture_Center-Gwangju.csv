"Asia Culture Centre, Gwangju.","This theatre complex is a state of the art facility that has played a huge part in revitalising the city. Most of it is located underground but the campus is huge with numerous locations both indoors and outdoors for galleries, exhibitions, concerts and theatre. Excellent facility and beautifully finished inside. It was a real pleasure to attend a concert of the Asian Traditional Orchestra there and tour the various exhibitions and events taking place."
Great place for kids,"We had horrible luck with the weather when we visited Gwangju. It was raining hard both days we were visiting. We had plans to do things outdoors, but had to change them. We were traveling with our 5 year old son and didn’t want to walk around too much in the rain. I saw that the Asia Culture Center had a large section for kids so we decided to check it out. It is conveniently located on the metro line at the Culture Complex stop. The Culture Center is closed on Mondays and Holidays. It is open from 10:00 to 18:00 or 19:00 depending on the day. There is a park and play area on the roof of the children’s building. We weren’t able to use the playground since it was raining so hard, but on a nice day it would be great. On the lower level there is a small free play area for kids. You have to get a ticket for about an hour of play, but it’s all for free. A much larger section had an admission fee of 10,000W. You will also need a ticket for the section. The tickets all have a designated entrance time. They won’t let you in a minute early, but you can stay as long as you like. Our son loved the large foam building blocks in this section. We spent hours there building a house out of the blocks. There are also craft and culture activities that kids can participate in. We didn’t sign up for any, but it was good to know that this was available if we wanted to do something extra. There is a café located in the building, but I think that it’s only open on the weekends. We were there during the weekday and it wasn’t open. There is also a children’s library that has a large selection of books. I didn’t see any in English, but I assume that there probably are some English books. Overall, it’s a nice and clean facility. I highly recommend a visit if you are traveling with young children."
Amazing for kids,"We ended spending almost all day here after only planning a couple of hours. Our 3 year old loved it and there were even fun things for our 11 month old. Kids playground on the roof, free kids cafe in the building (get a ticket in advance) and 3,000krw children’s activity/exploration/museum area inside. Our boy was a bit too small for many of these things (need to be 5 years old and/or 100cm) but there was still a lot for him to do. What an amazing place!"
Beautiful place to walk - or see a show - Closing Ceremonies - FINA Worlds were awesome,"Great space to see music and cultural shows. Stayed in Gwangju for the Closing Ceremonies of the FINA Aquatic World Championships in August. Excellent seating, view of stage and protected square. I was very impressed.Interesting architecture - nice public space and some great photo opportunities. Worth seeing."
"Huge, New, and Not Yet Finished","I visited the Asian Culture Center today in Gwang-ju, s. Korea. This huge complex of big building is brand new and modern looking. The library housed books, computers and displays of Asian culture. The ACC creation center was still unfinished inside, and had few displays. The ACC Theatre has a live band playing beautiful music. It was a brief walk upstairs to the May 18th, 1980 Democracy Plaza, the birthplace of this democratic city of “Lights”. At some point, this should be an awesome place to visit!"
Spectacular World Class Art Center,"This facility embraces many of the ideas of what a museum, gallery and cultural center should be like in the future. It contains libraries, archives, teaching rooms, creative areas for children and hosts many ongoing events an exhibits. Research ahead of time because there is too much to take in during one visit. In late August I saw the World Music Festival with numerous acts in several outdoor listening areas. Architecturally very fascinating. Easy to get to via Metro subway, just get off at stop 104. "
Must-go for anyone into art and culture,Visited the archive and library as well as Gwangju Biennale. Lots to see and definitely worth more than a day's visit. 
Very modern place with many events,"The ACC has many events during the year and the facilities are all new and nice. Definitely worth poking around if you are DT and the weather is nice. Not much to do unless there is an event taking place, but it does have a stage theatre where many high quality productions take place during the year. Check out their website for events."
The must-see place in Gwangju!,"Asia Culture Center is the must-see place in Gwangju. They have a good quality of performances and exhibitions with low cost, even with no money. The architecture itself is impressive and big enough to take your heart. One of my favorite place in ACC is Library Park. They collected videos, books, pictures about Asian culture and produced about ten spots with specific topics such as 'electronic shopping mall in Asia', 'History of performance in Asia'. They have many books and materials in English and other languages, so people who cannot speak Korean can also enjoy this place. Library Park is a free space, so feel free to use at any time. ACC is near to the downtown-Chungjangro, and the hipsters' place, Dongmyeongro-, so it is nice to use your free time."
