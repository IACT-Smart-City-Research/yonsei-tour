Cherry blossom and local vibes,There were cherry blossom in every corner of the city. The street was really beautiful with pink color. The weather was really nice too. The festival was so lively with Korean local vibes; street food and music.
Beautiful.,"This was a beautiful festival. I highly recommend a camera and good shoes. The ""festival"" is spread over different parts of Jinhae. There are many photographic opportunities with beautiful cherry blossoms everywhere. To see it all, you'd need to bus or taxi, plus walk a fair amount. There were some neat shops and street vendors as well. It was a bit hard to see everything since it wans't together in the same area, but still doable with enough time. Definitely recommend while the blossoms are out."
memorable spring at Jinhae,"it took 6 hours drive from Seoul to Jinhae, but the view are stunning and the cherry blossom are blooming all over the corner of the city, the best view to enjoy its at Korail train station and the romance bridge. A lot of food hall also surround the area to enjoy korean traditional food"
Chasing cherry blossom in Korea,It was a highly expected trip and this place didnt fail us. It was beautiful to see all these cherry blossom trees in the park!! Lots of crowds but you can still take good photos as areas are wide and weather is good. Shorter route to go from Busan( just 1 hr plus drive) than from Seoul ( around 3-4 hrs drive). 
Amazing festival highly recommended ,It should not be missed in you are in South Korea during Spring. I would recommend avoiding weekends as it will be very crowded and depart early from Seoul or Busan so you can maximise your time in Jinhae also wear comfortable shoes as this is a lot of walking around 
Great experience,"I never had been in a country which has cherry blossom festival thats why I feel so blessed that I should not missed this kind of festival. Though it was 4-5hours trip from seoul, its really worth it. Flowers are amazing..you even don’t mind if there are a lot of tourist and locals in the place. You just need to enjoy the moment."
Beautiful Festival,Spent 3-4 hours here. Could have spent all day here and definitely would love to check out the evening scenery! Didn't even make it to the monorail or the museum! For shame! Will have to do it next time!
1st day of Cherry Blossom festival ,We visited this place on 1 April which is the first day of the Cherry Blossom festival. Many tourists and locals were here though it was a Monday. We took nearly 2 hours and enjoyed taking many beautiful photos.
Visit between March 30 to April 9,The biggest Cherry Blossom festival in South Korea. Jinhae is beautiful and there are lots of cherry trees. It was worth a long drive from Seoul. 
Full of Cherry Blossom,You have to take bus ride from Busan. I suggest you purchase your return ticket right away when you get there because there will be so many people in the evening trying to get back to Busan. It will save you time to line up for tickets. You also have to line up for the bus ride but if you are willing to stand in the bus instead of getting a seat you can easily get in. Just ask the bus operator for it. 
Cherry Blossom All Over The Town!,"I was privileged to celebrate the Cherry Blossom Festival! The town was extremely beautiful. I stayed at Changwon, took a bus to Jinhae. Free buses available in Jinhae during the festival to ferry people to places of attractions. If you love Cherry Blossom, do plan your travel during the season."
Long journey but worth it,The journey is very long from Seoul. 5 hours to and 5 hours back. A total 10 hours but it is worth it. The full bloom of cherry blossom is breathtaking and enjoyable. Crowded during the festival. Occasional wind adds a different views with cherry blossom petals flying around. Great experience. 
Best experience of my South Korea trip,"I learned this festival last year and I had the chance to participate and see this last April 07, 2018.I joined a famous group tour from seoul to avoid any hassle coming here. Although travel time is 5 hours one way....it's definitely worth it First time to see those many cherry trees in full bloom. The stream area if very much worth it ,although there's too many tourist you can still have a nice picture unlike the one in the train station.This activity is very much recommended when you happen to be in Korea during the first week of April."
Great view of cherry blossoms during the festival,It's popular cherry blossoms festival in Korea. Thousands of tourists visit this place to view the well organised cherry blossoms alongside a foot bridge. There are also food stalls nearby to cater for the festival.
Best place to view blossoms,Honestly blossom trees lined the roads everywhere in Jinhae and Masan (heard it was the same in Changwon). Definitely worth a trip down if you're in time for the blooms.
Gorgeous and fantastic view! Must visit!,"I chose to go during the first week of April where I know it will be in full bloom and is just before the actual festival. In such a way I can enjoy the full bloom of the cherry blossom and yet avoid the crowd. True enough the cherry blossom on every street and in full bloom and it is not as crowded during the weekday. The view of the cherry blossom is breath taking and it leaves a wonderful memory in my mind. I will definitely find the opportunity to come again and stay longer so that I can spend more time walking around the town. It is just about 1 hour bus ride from Busan and it cost 5,100 won for one way coach ride. Recommend to stay in Busan and take a bus to Jinhae for the day and back. It was raining when I was there thus I did not have a very good opportunity to take as many photo as I want. And I also did not have the opportunity to go to the train station which has more cherry blossom blooming too. Stick around the stream area where there are many vendor setting up for the week long festival."
A must visit ,The Jinhae Gunhangje Cherry Blossom Festival is truly a great experience to be in every spring. It will be a great idea to have a simple lunch at one of the pochamacha along the 1.5m Yeojwacheon Stream over looking the stream and beautiful cherry blossoms. The highlight of the festival will be the military march parade put up by the Korean Navy Academy.
Not as expected,"Nothing really special to see apart from cherry trees. The festival itself is vertical crowded, a lot of traffic jams and common fries sellers... The Jinhae Station seem to be just regular and nothing extra ordinary "
Beautiful but Overcrowded,"This city is amazingly beautiful, yet, the famous tourist attractions are all crowded with locals.Tourist information provides helpful english support, but very limited. There are several Turkish Kebabs food stall for those who crave for Halal Food. Prepare cash in advance, almost difficult to find ATM here."

The Cherry Blossom of all Cherry Blossoms in Korea,"If you're coming from Seoul, it's probably a five-hour trip to Jinhae, but trust me, it's WORTH IT! Let my photos give justice to this post. Make sure to check the event dates to catch the cherry blossoms at its best! Enjoy!"
It worth the time,"Ok we planned to go there because on the date that we will be in korea - no cherry flower will be bloom in Seoul area yet( base on the forecast). So we took a day tour package to Jinhae, spend 5hours from Seoul and another 5 hours coming back. We only spend about 4 hours at the festival ground - but trust me it is worth it. Since this festival is only happen once a year (normally 1-10 April each year) so check your date if you want to go there. If you have a lot of days in korea, maybe you can go on your own. It is not near to Seoul but nearer to Busan. But if you don't really have time, maybe you can taken the tour package like us."
Beautiful! ,The Festival was worth the visit! The whole City is covered with Pink Cherry Blossoms and the whole town was full of life! The city of Jinhae is a 45minutes bus ride away from the nearest big city which is Busan. I will definitely comeback again! 
main highlight of my trip!,"Saw photos of jinhae gunhangje festival and I knew I had to come here! Went to jinhae by taking a bus from busan. breathtaking view of cherry trees everywhere! But super crowded and crazy atmosphere! way too crowded...You need GPS! We went on the second day of the festival and the crowd was crazy. Perhaps due to the rain on the first day of the festival. Food stalls, games, souvenir shops everywhere. There are 2 main spots - yeojwacheon stream and gyeonghwa station. They are located about 30-40min away from each other. Worth a visit if you go during the festival season and don't mind the crowd....but you won't be able to take photos without random people in the background....Scenery is amazing with cherry trees lining almost the entire city!From what we experienced, people are generally more friendly here too :)I might visit again but will go early in the morning"
Overcrowded,"Go here if you like the feeling of festive with LOTS of people, lots of tourist trap souvenirs, lots of street foods.I prefer go to Gyeongju where the cherry blossoms feels more natural and less crowded. "
Best and beautiful Cherry Blossom,"We arrived to the Jinhae Cherry Blossom Festival on April 9, 2017 and were still able to view the amazing cherry blossoms. The cherry blossoms are not just in one area but all over the city. However, the festival where the stream is, is the best place to view the cherry blossoms. Take a walk and enjoy the wonderful view, specially in the early morning to avoid the crowds. Truly speechless!!!"
The crowd is crazy!,"As this is a festival, do expect the crowd to be really huge. The only reason I rate it 5 star is for the Cherry blossom trees which is at every corner of this city. If you think you can have a cozy walk with the view of the pretty town then you come to the wrong place unless you go early in the morning.The english guide was not available at the bus station and left with only Korean guide, my guess is they are out of it, so I decided to follow the crowd and end up and Naval Port instead. Just a lesson learned that from one place to another is pretty far the the traffic is bad. A lot of peole decided to walk instead of taking buses.Alternatively, you can take tour to Jinhae which is recommended for people with kids or older folks. I took bus from Busan Sasang station to Jinhae took an hour and buy the return bus ticket as soon as you reach Jinhae station and you can't buy the return ticket at Sasang and you very much want to avoid the queue to just buy ticket at Jinhae station during the evening.In all, no regret visiting this great festival but may not return again."
Cherry blossoms,"It is a wonderful place to have some pictures with cherry blossoms. I believe it is better to check the times before going there. We went there in weekday noon but it was overcrowded. You can even enter the river bank and have more magnificent pictures there. It was absolutely amazing and we enjoyed it so much even though we were traveling with our luggage. Plus, it is free :)"
Best Cherry Blossoms of Korea admist lot of chinese tourists crowd,"This offers the best spectacle of cherry blossoms in South Korea. Understanding that blossoms are also quite auspicous for asian, expect to see large crowd of chinese tourists . It becomes really crowded . Its only there for 10 days and I recommend if you happen to be there during the time. Choose a tour group which can help manage logistics."
Cherry blossom,It was a little early for cherry blossom. The place will be very great during full bloom. Need to find the exact time
PERFECT SITE TO SEE IMPORTANT SOUTH KOREAN CULTURE,Cherry Blossom Festivals are a major part of South Korean culture. The Jinhae Gunhangje Festival is one of the best in Korea and certainly worth the time spent to see the beautiful scenery throughout the area.
Cherry blossom + Korean culture ,"Jinhae Gunhanje (Jinhae Naval Base Festival) holds around end of March and beginning of April every year which is exactly the period of world-class cherry blossom. If you are a cherry blossom fan in Asia and have already tired of those typical places, then I will highly recommend Jinhae of Busan in South Korea to you! Once arrival Jinhae, we entered a fantasy pinky world. It's so stunning. The city was covered by blossomy cherry trees magnificently. Since it was a weekday, we walked around the city without the crowd. In the falling of ""pink snowflakes"", visiting famous sights, eg. Romance bridge and Yeojwacheon Stream, became one of memorable parts in our trip. Without doubt, the 800m long cherry trees road along the railway of Gyeonghwa Station was remarkable too. Aside fm cherry blossom, the Festival was also a good chance for us to experience the Korean food and culture. In lunch, we enjoyed local foods, such as, stuffed squid, grilled pork and seafood pizza in Pojangmacha (local food stalls). After sight-seeing, sun went down. However, it wasn't the time to leave it yet, on the contrary, it's just a start. We, in luck, headed to the public stadium for the Ceremony performance. My favourite K-pop star showed up and performed special concert for army band! That's definitely a surprise for us and hence our trip was wrapped up perfectly. How to go?Get off fm metro Sasang Station (227 사상) and took 5mins walk fm exit 3 or exit 5 for coach to Jinhae at Busan West Bus Terminal (부산서부버스터미널). Buy tickets and get on coach, 1.5hrs later, a breathtaking view will be seen. Congrats! You've arrived Jinhae. It's very easy, right? Here is some tips and info for your reference.1. Please beware the exit of metro. It should be exits of number 2 line in green instead of the purple line for Busan Gimhae Light Rail Transit. 2. In order to buy tickets smoothly, please prepare following info in Korean in advance and show to the ticketing counter in Bus Terminal. Such as, (Destination: ) 진해 (Jinhae).(Number of passengers, adult or child:) xx 인반 .PBA Single way Normal ticket for an adult is 5100won now. 3. Departure Gate of the Terminal in SaSang: number 17 (remind unchanged for years ) .Coach operations hours: every 20mins fm 06:00 to 22:00 daily. 4. If you would like to take photos in daylight and enjoy sight-seeing without the crowd, you may consider to go on weekdays and stay one night in Sasang. There are many budget hotels around the Terminal, so that you could catch the earliest coach to Jinhae.5. Please buy return tickets once arrival Jinhae and spare time for the long queue in the peak of festival. "
lovely,"there is one thing about cherry blossom at korea, this is one of the best place to see the cherry blossom because the whole town is full with the flowers.. its like pink snow coming down when its windy. it was very romantic, beautiful and worth your time to come here despite the crowd.my tips is to come during the weekdays or spend a night in town, so u can see the cherry blossom even at night with all the lights. should come here at least once in a lifetime.. the train tracks which was called gyeonghwa station is a must see together with the bridges in town.. walk around the town and you can find plenty of places to take pictures.. if you have a baby is not advisable to bring a stroller because the pedestrian road is not stroller friendly, and wearing a carrier is more advisable. However, due to the unpredictable weather with a carrier and the temperature is low, make sure your baby is well protected."
Cherry blossoms everywhere,"The bus to Jinhae from Seoul takes about 4 hours. That being said, it's advisable that you leave Seoul early so that you can maximize your time at Jinhae since it's quite far. Expect the festival to be crowded with lots of people trying to take a bunch of pictures same as you! The area is quite spacious though, everywhere you go, you would definitely see cherry blossoms. It's like pink snow is falling everywhere—really beautiful. There are many street food vendors as well. When we came, it was rainy and it was quite troublesome because you bump umbrellas with others and you'd have to put your umbrellas down (and get rained on in the process) to take nice pictures. Try your best to come when it's sunny! Despite the expensive bus fare (around 10,000won I think), the 4 hour travel time, the rain, and the crowd, it was worth visiting!"
Walaiporn,"We plan go to Jinhae cherry blossoms festivals but we go too early, and too cool weather, So we saw flowers starting blooms and they preparing festivals. (I came on Mar,25. But Festival will start on Mar,28.)Jinhae is little city, very nice, peach. People's very kind. They not used English. But they try to told the right route. I came to Jinhae from Busan (by bus at Sasang station). One hour from there. So, I'm very impress and want to come back to Jinhae again. "
Day trip from Busan,"Took a whole day to make a day-trip to this festival who is one hour and 20 minutes away from Busan by bus and this place was AMAZING. There were cherry blossoms everywhere, as well as cultural shows, food stalls.. I have been living and travelling in Korea for a long time now but this toped it all ! But worth noting that going to Jinhae is only nice during the spring and particularly the festival, do not think the city has any value outside the period"
Cherry blossoms,The cherry blossom festival is beautiful. The trees line the entire city. Must see if in Korea. The stream and the train station are the best places to view. very crowded though
