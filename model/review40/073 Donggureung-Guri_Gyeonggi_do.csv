"Perfectly preserved tombs in a wonderfully landscaped, tranquil setting","Korean respect for their ancestors is impressive, well documented in the remarkable state of preservation of these Joseon dynasty tombs. There are apparently 119 burial sites for the 500 years of this dynasty, of which this site, ""East Nine Royal Tombs,"" is the largest cluster. Very impressive, wonderfully landscaped with stone paths connecting the nine sites."
Royal tombs in a quiet suburb area. Good to walk and learn.,"Donggureung means Royal Tombs of Joseon Dynasty specifically located together in Guri City, Gyeonggido Province maintained by Korean Cultural Heritage Administration.- This is a really good place to learn history and take a walk in a forest area.- This is in Guri City. Not easy to arrive for foreign tourists. From Dongdaemungu or Jungranggu, Bus #88, #202 and #202-1 get there. It takes 30~60 min depending on traffic. Cheongryangri seems to have a good connection from the other districts of Seoul.- Locating outside Seoul, this is not that crowded with few people.- The entrance fee is 1,000 won. And there are discount and free rules depending on conditions.- Staffs were really kind and friendly.- The guided route is counter-clockwise from the ticket office.- Built in a massive area, visitors have to walk a lot. There are benches and folk playgrounds in many points.- The stream passing in this area is really pure and clean. It's so refreshing to see fishes and frogs in the water.- There are 9 tomb zones and some of them have more than one tomb in a single zone.- The oldest tomb is for the first king of Joseon Dynasty and built in early 15th century.- They have wonderful ceremonies on memorial days. Those rituals will be interesting as well.- There is the only one tomb that visitors can access so close. Others are quarantined by fences."
Quiet and underrated - Enjoy this hidden treasure!,"A little hard to reach but is worth it to be in the company of such a historic UNESCO world heritage site - the tombs of many of the great kings and queens of the past Joseon dynasty ... Honestly it amazes me how quiet this place is, I had it almost to myself was a little creepy. The scale and sense of history here is just amazing and to share a quiet moment at the tomb of the founder of the dynasty with no one around is a unheard of experience in Asia. Please if you have any interest in history make the effort to come out here for a few hours -You will not be disappointed as even if you are bored of the history, the natural landscape is gorgeous! "
Just Breathe,Went to this place with a Meetup group and was stunned by the sheer magnificence and beauty!!!It so stunningly green and just...wow. The history and preservation of this place is by far one of the best I have seen so far.The people are so attentive to keeping and preserving these tombs.There is complete and open space of just fields of green surrounded by huge oak trees which from my understanding are the kings of trees.Our guide was very knowledgeable and you could tell he loves the history of the tombs.I was very glad to have made the trip although the humidity was a killer.
All Hail our King and Queen,This place is huge and worth to visit. We luckily went inside without paying but I felt bad for doing so; this place worth more than â‚©1000. The design of the tombs was similar to one another therefore you may skip it after seeing 2 or 3 tombs. To reach this place was a bit difficult; we got lost on the way there
Dong(East)gu(nine)reung(tomb)-East nine tomb,"CC(2013. 3)Donggureung means east nine tombs. The size of Donggureung was bigger than I thought. In Donggureung, six kings and ten queens are slept(Joseon's 1st king Taejo, 5th king Munjong, 14th king Seonjo, 18th king Hyeonjong, 21st king yeongjo, 24th king Heonjong). Maybe this royal tombs area will be the biggest Joseon royal tombs in Korea. If you want to know about Joseon's tomb form, we recommend to go there because there are nine tombs!!"
Best examples of Joseon Tombs,"This historic complex of tombs is wonderful to explore. King Taejo's tomb which dates back to 1408 is the oldest Joseon tomb, as he began the Joseon dynasty in 1392. Seventeen kings and queens of the Joseon dynasty are located here. The tombs reflect the ideals of the Joseon dynasty, and are infused with Confucian design and principles. Each tomb site was carefully chosen using feng shui, to locate the most auspicious place to build.Donggureung is perhaps the best place to see various examples of Joseon tomb design. There are tombs found here from the 15th - 19th centuries. The beauty of the location, as well as numerous hillsides make it an ideal location. The elegant, yet simple design of the tombs found here are pleasing in their intricate details and stone guardian statues. If you have only one opportunity to visit a cluster of Joseon tombs visit Donggureung."
