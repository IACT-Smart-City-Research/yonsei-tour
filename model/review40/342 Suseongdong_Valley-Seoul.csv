Beautiful place for a nature walk,I visited here two times because I enjoyed it so much. It is peaceful and has nice views and not many people come to visit. The trail is easy to hike if you are not in the mood for climbing steep slopes. You can also link up to Inwangsan if you want more of a challenge.
Place to chill. Better to visit after rain.,"This is the valley at the lower area of Inwangsan Mountain. It's a good place to relax having a stream and little pavilion surrounded by the forest.- The location is close from the residential area of Okindong. People who live nearby come and rest at the pavilion.- The water didn't flow much when I visited. The day after rain in summer will be the best time to visit.- On upper stream, there's the source of Cheonggyecheon Stream.- Since the location is a bit tricky, there are few visitors and it's not crowded."
