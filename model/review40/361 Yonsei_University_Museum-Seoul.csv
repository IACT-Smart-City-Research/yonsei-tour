Autumn must visit!,"The university area is very big, and the building the building that I went to is located far behind all of those modern campus buildings. It requires you to climb many stairs, but it'll be worth it. I went there on summer, and it was very pretty there, I can already imagine just how beautiful it would be on fall. A picture below to show what I mean."
First time walking around,I'm really appreciate their buildings and everything around university.The scenery is greatly peace.
