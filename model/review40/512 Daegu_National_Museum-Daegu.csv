Small but some interesting collections,"This is a small museum with only 3-5 exhibition rooms (one was closed when I was there) but it has some lovely things in it if you are interested in old Korean artifacts. There was also an exhibit on fashion and fabrics which had some great traditional fabrics in it. I was glad I visited, despite its slightly awkward location.It was very quiet at 10.00 on a Saturday.It is a little hard to reach if going by public transport - I got a taxi there (about KW9,000 from fairly central in town) - but to get back to town there are a couple of buses that leave from the station outside of the museum and go to the Children's Park monorail station which is about 10 minute drive away (I cant remember the numbers but it did come up on google maps) which may be the easiest route."
Very small museum,"Very small museum, no English audio guide, 9k won entry fee, off the center. Rather go to the one in Seoul - much bigger, free entry and free English guided tours."
"Good museum, just a bit harder to get to","The museum is in a former school. It is nice and offers a good overview of the history. It is just a bit away from the metro. There are surely some buses that drop you off nearby, but not the city tour bus for instance."
"Worth a visit, and you'll probably have the place to yourself!","I went here when a relative visited me from America. Like most museums in South Korea, it's very well laid out and welcoming. If anything, I was surprised at how few people were there. (It was a weekday.) It's obviously a lot smaller than the National Museum in Seoul, but there are plenty of interesting old things to see from clothing to jewelry to artwork. There are also a lot of nice souvenirs on sale in the gift shop. I'd plan on spending an hour to 90 minutes here."
Good trip for a rainy day,"Free entry. All signage in Korean. Difficult to know where to go once inside but it's not long before you are politely ushered to the correct start point then it's a matter of just going to the next open door. Magnificent history to be read and artefacts to be seen. Not the easiest place to access via public transport, bus only, or you can cab it from Hwanggeum monorail station for a reasonable price. Good to visit on a rainy day."
Rich in History,"There is a good amount to see, some English translations, but a good depiction of the richness of the Korean history. I visited over the Chuseok holiday and it was packed with families. Chuseok is all about getting the family together and spending time enjoying traditional and cultural Korean things. So being at this museum was one of those chance opportunities to passively observe Korean culture. Pretty cool."
Interesting--take about an hour,"If you have time, it's worth visiting. Only takes about an hour. There were hands on exhibits for children that had potential as well."
Many things to see,I visited this national museum with one of my Korean colleague. There are lot of things to see but if you are foreigner then you cant understand meaning of anything. So better if you take guide or take some Korean with you. otherwise korea is very cultured & disciplinant country.
Worth a Visit,This museum is great when there are exhibits and the park around it is gorgeous. Perhaps things have changed since I came here but a few more translations would have been helpful.
VISITED LAST CHUSEOK!,"A good museum but not like other museum at akl! Yet, I appreciate the parks outside and at tje back of the museum which has a small trailing stuff. It's good to visit in Chuseok cuz you'll enjoy the free games and free foods. "
Just average place,"As a national museum it is just an average place. We visited this place on weekends and bumped into some crazy Daegu people- being annoying. Visit here on week days as possible. I have never experienced so many bad mannered people at one place. An elderly lady even commented on the shoes I was wearing and it was none of her business. Noisy kids were running up and down the hall, a mentally challenged person even tried to scare us off the public area. And at the education center, a rude lady and her daughter crushed my daughter's clay sculpture made through an hour and never said sorry. Although you need to pay for your own clay they didn't even bothered to ask and just crushed ours."
Great lay-out,We managed to keep our daughter interested for the full two hours there. Though I would not recommend eating any of the food in the downstairs cafe! 
"Free, but small","The Daegu museum was a bit disappointing in how little it contained - as other reviewers have said, you can see the whole thing in half an hour. However, it was free, the artifacts are nice, and the signs are in both Korean and English."
"Not the best, but visit it if you have time.","On my very first day in Daegu, I made a trip to the Daegu National Museum. This museum is quick and easy to tour. A majority of the signs have English translation.The highlights include Buddhist relics and statues, jewelry, and traditional clothes. I especially liked the seventh century Buddha statues. How did they make those? They’re so detailed and well-preserved. There is also an extensive children’ area with interactive games and exhibits.Did I mention that it’s free? An easy stop in and out site – you can likely see all that you want to see in thirty minutes."
You can't beat the price - It's Free,If you have a few hours I would highly recommend this museum. Lots of local history under one roof and it's free. All displays are in Korean and English.
good size and informative,"Unlike the Seoul Museum, you don't need a whole month to get through this museum. 30 minutes is about the right amount of time, you could go more if you want of course. I liked this museum, because it has interesting history and it's just the right size for a museum visit."
