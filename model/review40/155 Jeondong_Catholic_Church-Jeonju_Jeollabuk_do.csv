Dominates the skyline,Inside the Cathedral is not very ornate however the best thing is the way it towers over the village. Some really lovely photographs.
Not as ornate as western Catholic Churches,An interesting church you can pop into but not walk around too much. It struck me as being very simple compared to the elaborate gold encrusted churches of the catholic faith in the West. 
Touched and moved.,"Small Catholic Church - yes, pretty architect and lovely stained glass windows but if you are Catholic you will be touched and moved by the powerful presence of the area. I found myself in tears sitting in the pews. This church sits on the site of the first Korean Catholic Martyrs and that spirituality is very clearly present. If you are comfortable with this - please go and allow yourself to be present and you might also find it to be very moving. There are beautiful and poignant statues around the grounds. This appears to be a very popular photo site for locals to dress up in traditional attire - who are totally respectful of the area. "
Church in Korea,This church is at the street end of Jeonju Hanok Village. Big carpark near the church. There are worshippers when my family visit the church. 
Its a church!,Jeondong Catholic Church is easily visible from several directions with its tall tower.We didn't go inside but from the outside is a standard Catholic church. Worth a passing visit.
Just an old church,An old church of Korean. Pretty small and almost all of the staffs only use Korean. Okay for being a photo-stop.
Beautiful Church,I came here during my visit to Jeonju Hanok Village. Can be reach by walking. Many people taking some pictures here in front of the church.
A site to see,"While I have not went inside of this beautiful building, it is something I am reviewing because everytime you see it, you always stare in aww at it. I've seen this building at least 15 to 20 times. This building is located right around the beginning of Hanok Village, and it is a significant landmark in Jeonju. A trip inside of the building would have to be amazing. Whenever I go to Korea again, I will be sure to go inside and leave another review!"
"Pretty church, awful staff","The staff are unfriendly as hell. We were trying to go for the 5pm mass, but unfortunately 4.50-ish pm is also when they're ushering the non-worshippers out as well. We were rudely shoved out the gate TWICE until I managed to get through to the staff in broken Korean that we were just trying to go for mass!! When I say shoved, I mean shoved - the guard took us by the arm and PUSHED us out. Not an experience I'd care to repeat. The church itself is beautiful, certainly worth a visit. Try to go before 4.30pm so you don't get manhandled."
Jeongdong Catholic Church,Part of the Jeonju Hanok Village. Taking photo is difficult as it’s crowded. Constructed in 1908 & completed in 1914. 
It's very rare in Korea like this but common in EU and USA. 한국이야 흔하지 않지만....,"I don't recommend this. To Koreans, it's a kind of unique to see the Catholic church in the center of the traditional city. So it's more interesting to see this for Koreans. It's one of few church buildings built early 19th century. I've seen one in Daegu. I've never seen any in Busan. 한국 사람들에게야 특이하니 가볼만함. 1900년대초에 지어진 몇안되는 가톨릭 교회니까!!!"
Quick stroll when you have time to burn,Nice looking facade on the outside for a few quick snaps. Access to the hall was prohibited which is where the intricate details of church architecture tends to be
Good looking architecture,"We didn't go inside, but took many photos from the exterior façade. It is a handsome architecture with unique history. Please stop by on your way to Hanok village."
Nice cathedral in the corner of the hanok village,The best thing of the cathedral is the location and view. The management team is also good to manage the facility. The cathedral has a really good old structure.
The oldest church in Jeonju,This place locate near Gyeongijeon. Many couples wear hanbok dress and take a photo here. No need to pay for enter.
Korean Historical site number 288,"Located on the edge of the Jeonju Hanok Village is this most impressive and distinctly different style of architecture, this Catholic church was built between 1908 and 1914. The architectural style is described as Roman-Byzantine, the rooftop has three Byzantine bell towers, it was particularly spectacular to see on dusk. The church was built to remember the Roman Catholic martyrs of the Joseon Dynasty who lost their lives on this very spot. It is listed as national treasure number 288."
Nice church but nothing on Europe ,"Right by the hanok village, it is actually the bus stop we got off at from the station. The church has a few statues outside and does have some charm however Jeonju is more famous for the Hanok village."
A church,"It is not as special as I expected it too be. Very average church, interesting background. You cannot go totally go inside anyway, free!"
Didn't know where to enter,"The door always seems to be closed. I wanted to go inside the church and pray, but everytime I passed by, the door is always closed. I guess I should have gone and looked. But outside, the structure us veey attractive. Next time, I'll definitely go around the small complex of this church."
Traditional European church building in Korea,"Among the many christian churches you see will travelling through Korea, this one is particular: a roman catholic church with a traditional European style architecture. I was there on a Sunday and Koreans queued up for photo taking. Inside the church it was quite and the building is beautiful. Outside the building you could listen to spiritual music. A very inviting atmosphere "
Beautifully Juxtaposed,"Amongst the traditional architecture in the area, sits this beautiful old church which is very popular with the locals as it's ""different"" with plenty of people, both young and old posing and taking photos.Because of the novelty factor of being so foreign resulting in the sheer number of people posing for photographs, it does get quite crowded and you need to exercise a degree of patience - still a worthwhile visit though!"
Beautiful church which contrasts the palace next door ,"There’s lots of Christian churches in Korea but this is one of the finest examples. Near to the palace it seems slightly out of place. Very European in style - not sure but maybe Eastern Europe, the interior is superb. One of the many attractions in Jeonju "
Ok,Well it is free to entrance. It is kind of landmark also for jeonju hanook village. Just in front of the entrance you will see it.
Ok. That’s it. ,It didn’t take long to look around. It’s quite ornate inside but the outside is a brick but church. It is located on the Mum entrance to Hanoi Village so you may as well pop in. 
Nice church but of more interest to non-Europeans who have not seen one,Very typical of a normal Catholic Church normally seen in Europe. There as a mass starting shortly after we arrived to little time to see the inside in detail.I would not go out of my way to visit unless your visiting the village itself.
Worth a visit ,"Lots of locals taking photos in traditional hanbok, quite a sight! Right next to the Jeonju Hanok Village. "
Not much more than a photo spot,It's one of the first structures you see as you enter the Hanok Village area. It is the oldest Catholic Church in Korea and a popular photo spot. One of the most impressive Christian buildings in Korea.
I Couldn't go inside. ,"Well, the outside, only for picture is nice. For acknowledge , nice to see actual church. But you can't go inside. You can't even pray if you are not from Jeonju. It was so bad. Compare other city church in abroad, bad experience ever. "
Definitely worth a quick look,Unlike the lavish European churches the plain interior decor is neat and attractive. The interesting exterior brick work pattern makes it quite a unique photo.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.
A European style cathedral,"While it is not possible to go inside, you can look through the doors, and inside it closely resembles the churches of Europe with stained glass windows and elaborate ceiling decorations."
Small Church,"I stopped by after seeing a lot of people in front of it taking pictures in traditional clothing. The side door was opened, so I took a look inside. It was nice, but nothing spectacular. I sat in the pews for a few minutes and was surprised they had pillows for kneeling. It's a good place to have a few minutes of silence."
A place to be!,"The catholic church in Jeonju attracts many visitors, often in traditional Korean clothes, boys and girls all dressed up taking pictures and try to make it look romantic. We were there on Sunday and the building was closed. "
... its a church,Nothing too special going on here. It's a church... not overly ornate... just a functional place of worship
Beautiful architecture ,"Took so many pictures of the cathedral. It's located at the entrance to the Hanok Village, you can't miss it!"
Stands out amidst the hanoks,This catholic church is in the hanok village. Different architecture that it is not Korean style in a slow city. Just take photos if you pass by. We saw a couple taking wedding photos there.. still very crowded but ok to just pop by
Passing by to pop in,We can only take photos from the outer building but not able to enter the hall.Standing in front of the hall give a peaceful feel despite the crowds out there trying to get a good shot of the cathedral.
slightly different feel in the midle of korean culture,"this unique church built in romanian style, but it is located in the middle of korean building so its really stands out. "
Historical place for Catholic !!!,"Over 100 years, it stands here and represents Korean Catholic history. Unfortunately, it does not permit tourists to go inside. Just visit here if you are in your way, not intentionally."
bonus attraction when visiting the hanok village in jeonju,"this attraction came in as a surprise to us when we visited jeonju's hanok village. we see large crowds coming and going this old church and so we sneak in as well, to our surprise it has its history to tell and an architecture to awe! if you're a foreign tourist, you will also enjoy the locals weaking their traditional dresses walking around... a feel of time travel while having fun."
Worth a visit here,Jeondong Catholic Church is located near the Hanok village (within walking distance). You will pass by here if you're walking to Nambu market from Hanok village. Lovely place to visit and take some photos even if you're not a catholic. 
Take your picture then move on...,"I've seen several Catholic Churches in non-catholic countries and this is just an average one... quite small, just three small stained glass windows which the tourists ""swooned"" over. We could not even enter and had to take pictures at the door. You can skip this one..."
Beautifully builded church ,Lots of couples are there to take photos. Not sure if it is not mass day . Not able to go into the church .but was allow to take photos from outside 
Beautiful,It's a beautiful and calming site at busy area. It's good to take a pew and see the whole architecture.
Nice place but try to go in the early morning,"I went there after 11.00 am there was no mass, the door is open but noone is allowed to enter , so i prefer that you go while there is a mass to can enter inside and as my friend told me there is a place or museun under the church where they keep the Saints corps The library is sooo nice but they don't sell the Saints photos and also they don't accept cards to pay with.the place of the church is very near from most places you want to visit in Jeonju so even if you are not religion ed or is you didn't like the place it's ok you are near from other places"
Beautiful building,"Lovely architecture and large crowds after 10am... If you want to get a good, people free, photo, get there in the morning. I went twice, once at 9am and once at 2pm. 2pm saw crowds of people crowding about trying to get selfies with the church. However, at 9am the doors aren't open and you can't see inside. So go twice."
 Nice cathedral with huge crowd,Nice place. A place where u can get lots of beautiful photo shot. Didn't manage to get into the cathedral but we are happy for the picture.
"Moving story, stunning architecture",Jeondong Catholic Cathedral (전주 전동성당) was built on the site of a massacre of Catholic martyrs; during a century of persecution nearly half of the believers in Korea were killed; the peaceful setting and beautiful architecture make a fitting memorial to those faithful who loved Jesus more than their own lives.
Nice church,Ok church but to be visited if doing other activities around town as it is close by walk from the main visiting spots ... From 15 to 5 min by walk ... Depending your planing road around .
You'll be in awe!,I'm a Catholic myself so to visit this Cathedral was a must. Very touristy. Thankfully they close it off during mass times to tourists for obvious reasons. Very beautiful architecture inside and out. 
"Pretty standard church, but stop by if you're nearby","You can't see the inside from, well, inside, since it's blocked off, but it's a nice sight nonetheless. Don't go out of your way to see it, though; it's nothing special. Stop by if you're coming from the nearby Gyeonggijeon Shrine, though!"
beautiful church!~,heard christmas eve mass here. ask around or visit the website for mass schedules. inside the church is off limits sometimes so you can only takes pictures by the door. 
Nothing Special,Because of its location many people stop by this cathedral to take pictures. It is a small cathedral compared to others but it is pretty. Takes about 10 minutes to stop by and see it~
Pretty church,"Really nice church which is in working order which means you cant go in, its easy enough to take pictures from the outside though. We saw many Korean girls with the traditional dress on taking pictures outside which was cute."
Jeondong Cathedral in Jeonju,This cathedral is located at the Korean-style house village in Jeonju and is very beautiful. This was built where martyrs were executed to the persecution of Christians in the era of Joseon Dynasty. This is a Romanesque-style building.
"한옥마을 입구, 영화 촬영지",it's located in 전주한옥마을. it's famous for korean movie '약속'. and this cathedral has been completed in 1906. so it's over than 100 hundred years old. there are always many people who are believer or traveler. 
Well kept Cathedral,"The Cathedral is located right beside the Hanok village. The cathedral could only viewed through the opened door, not something you are used to see of a catholic church. In other places they are happy to let you in when people visit their church.The cathedral looks nice from the distance."
Perfect For Short Visit,"The church was closed at the time that I came by. I think it was around 8 in the morning. The building looked so old and the architechture looked really foreign. You will never miss this place when you visit Jeonju. All you have to do to find it is look up. It is only a few minutes away from the Hanuk Village. Ironically, I found some friendly locals taking photos of the church on their way to work. "
Beautiful,"First and foremost, it's a beautiful church both inside and out. I actually made it inside on my visit, only to be told there was a wedding going on and had to leave, but I saw enough to appreciate it's beauty and as it's in the Hanok Village, you can kill 2 birds with one stone"
Western views of the Far East,Unexpected find just near the Hanok Village. Worth a look. Bathrooms and cool place to get out of the weather.
Beautifully preserved building,"You can only go inside on weekends, apparently, but can still see from the doorway. The stained glass was impressive, as was reading about the history of both the building and Catholics in this area over the last few centuries.Offers a nice opportunity to take photos juxtaposing traditional Korean buildings with this church."
Beautifully preserved,"This church used to be city's cathedral and is of considerable historic importance. Jeonju was an early stronghold of Catholicism in Korea and the scene of many martyrdoms in the 19th century. Consequently, the congregation here dug deep to build a large and impressive cathedral. It's very well preserved and is surrounded by related buildings, monuments and plaques. Unfortunately, we couldn't go inside at the time we visited, but we were able to peer in from the doorway."
Beautiful Church in Korea,"The church was made of gray and red bricks and it was considered tall amongst the Hanok village, so it was very noticeable and it worth a look if you are travelling the Hanok Village."
Beautiful Church,"C1 ( 2015.05.21 ) This church was located beside Gyeonggijeon Shrine, and many people visited there just looking. This church's inside was very charming and beautiful, and outside was good. But if there was apart from main attration, I would not visited there for looking just this one church. It was certain that this structure was charming."
Beautiful architecture,"This old catholic church have a beautiful architecture that remind me of Notre Dame in Sai Gon, Viet Nam, which is same ages (a few years different)"
Gothic,"An unexpected sight in Jeonju, the architecture suggests that this building is older than it actually is. Take it in as part of your tour of Gyeonggijeon Hall and Hanok village."
"When you visit Jeonju Hanok Village, visit here. ","When you visit Jeonju Hanok Village, visit here. Just scenery. Many times it is clise for visitors. Famous for Korean photographers. Ordinary cathedral. But, one point of view is why missionaries took their life for infiltrate catholicity to Korea(Choseon dynasty), eventhough Choseon banned it. "
Weekday don't get to go in?,"I was here during weekday so I don't get to go inside the church. I can only take picture on the external part, the entrance door is open for you to at the interior but couldn't get in was a miss for me."
Catholic Church,"The church was quite a sight to behold as we had never seen a church in the Gothic style. It was however close and we could only roam on the outside. There were a lot of Koreans and Chinese tourists partly cause we went there on a weekend, so we had to contend with the crowd when taking pictures. There were a few statues that were unique to the building (i.e. sculpture of Korean martyrs during the Josean dynasty). There was a large park (doubles as extended sitting) for you to roam about and some large Victorian style buildings which we suspected were the living quarters for the nuns. Its v near the Hanok Village and the Gyeonggi Palace so you could look at this few places when you visit the Church."
Not worth the wait.,"We had to wait around 10~15 minutes to get into the entrance because there was a lot of people. When we got there, we realized we were not allowed to go inside the Church. The line was there because everyone was trying to take pictures from the entrance."
Jeondong Catholic Church,It's a lovely place for every one and the area around it (Hanok village) is also great and there is a palace near by as well.Strongly recommend especially during holidays and weekends till the afternoon time just try to be there before sunset at least.
Beautiful Historical Cathedral,"Having lived in Jeonju, and being ex-Catholic, I have visited here many times-- from Christmas mass to ""new pope"" and just because I was there! During festival times, they often host a bazaar (I got my mom a carved wooden ""Holy Family"" and other fun local handicrafts), and if you're lucky, you'll meet the Spanish nun who's been around about 20 years!"
Stunning ground,I would have loved to play in this ground but I was at a exhibition & could not do so. The place is well kept & is a part of Korean history. I watched the matches played here but never thought I will be able to visit this place. Fantastic grounds. Great memories. 
Fantastic organ music,"When I visited, there was a pop concert outside, with a crowd -- I assume it was an evangelical concert. Inside was a world of difference. Some very solemn people praying on the pews while overhead, the organ was being played -- with heart-stopping virtuoso classical music."
Downright ok,"As far as churches in Korea go, this may be the most charming and lovely. As far as churches go in the world, it's pretty bland. The overall design is kind of interesting, but it's quite a small church. Anyone who has visited the grand cathedrals of Europe, or even the older churches in North and South America will probably not be overly awed.Korea does some amazing things - delicious food, generous hospitality, and incredible adaptation to change, but architecture is not it's strong suit. Spend your time on some of the other sites instead."
One of the More Interesting Churches in Korea,"Jeondong Church is located just across from Jeonju Hanok Village. The church has pleasant features inside and out. If you are visiting Jeonju, I would recommend taking the time to visit this church as the main attraction for most visitors is just across the street. The church is about 100 years old and the design is beautiful. Nevertheless, there are countless churches in the world, many far more historic than this one. Jeondong Church is certainly one of the more historic Christian sites in the country, but I suspect most visitors are not heading to Jeonju for its Catholic Church. Visiting alongside Jeonju's Hanok Village, Jeondong Church is a pleasant additional stop. Jeonju is a beautiful city, and there is alot to see. Enjoy your time here!"
