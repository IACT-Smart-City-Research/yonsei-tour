Perfect Lake for Water Sports,"Cheongpyeong Lake was the result of constructing a dam. While the area is pleasant enough, visitors to the lake are usually not there for the scenery alone. This area of Korea is well-known for watersports. At Cheongpyeong Lake you can water-ski, jet-ski, banana boat, knee-board, and more.Spending half a day here in Summer was great. The water was cold, but refreshing. I tended to get wet a lot because of my lack of skill on anything being pulled by a boat The area is easily accessed from Seoul and may be a great trip for adults who enjoys being in the water. I stayed overnight in the many nearby ""pensions"" by the lake. Great time with friends."
