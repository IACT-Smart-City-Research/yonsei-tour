Nature scenery ,"Came here during sunset time. The view is very beautiful and natural. Many tourist took photo over here. During your walking distance to Yongduam Rock, don’t buy any fruit from the first stores! Very rude and not friendly. Make sure those of you beware of them. "
Don't go here just for the rock,"Situated downtown close to the airport, this is a quick visit spot. Don't go here just for the rock, but for the overall sea view and the park adjoining the spot."
A quick visit will do,Just a quick visit to tick off the must do in Jeju. We came early in the morning hence not many people yet. I presume there there will be huge crowd later in the day as this is popular place to see rock formation without much walking to reach the site
Nice rock and view,The place was accessible by bus from the Jeju city!I arrived the rock before 12pm and going around the rock to take photos!The color and shape of rock is some how unique!If you have time you may want to come and take a look!
Overhyped,Can walk to the bottom where you will see some Jeju ladies with their catch. Took some photos with these rocks and that's it.
Foggy,Can do a little sightseeing of the sea. A little foggy when we visited at 9.30am.The photo didn't turn out as good.
Scenic Rock,"Easy visit - gps to car park, down steps and the rock's there. Its pretty enough for a quick visit. Some shops, snack places in the area. Parking was free for a short stay"
Nice area to see sunset,Small area but you can see clear waters around the rocks formed from the volcano. Do visit if you have time. I imagine it would be amazing to catch the sunset here but am unable to do so because of time constraints.Easily accessible by bus no. 462 from Jeju Bus Terminal.
Beautiful rock formation & sunset view,I went close to sunset time and I was able to catch a pretty good sunset. Plus since it's close to the airport the view of airplanes flying by the sunset was quite amazing.
Nice walk,Nice place to walk and then eat at the Antoinette or seafood while enjoying the view. There is also a nice hang bridge.
Dragon’s head,"It is a volcanic rock formation in the form of a dragon’s head, created by strong winds and waves over thousands of years. However, legend has it that a dragon stealing precious jade from Mt. Halla was shot down by an arrow from the mountain deity. When he fell down on Yongduam, his body immediately sank into the ocean and his head rapidly froze looking at the sky. Another legend has it that a white horse dreamt of being a dragon and ascending to the sky. On his ascent, he was caught by a soldier and froze into the rock. While admiring the dragon’s head, one can see how the black rocks contrast with the emerald blue ocean."
Dragon Head,"The rock look alike dragon head. Yes it is. Nothing much here, just another tourist attraction by the beach. It is near the airport so you can see flights at the sky about to land closely. So if you like to take a nice aircraft shot, this place might be a good one for you. "
The Easiest Rock Formation To See,"This is by far the easiest rock formation to see on the island. It’s within a stroll from the carpark and very accessible, no Long trials or multiple flights of stairs to climb. Expect bus loads of tourist though. Good views of the coast from the viewing deck."
Didn't look like a dragon to us. Easy to miss,"Very underwhelmed. Arrived by ship & took free port shuttle into Jeju-si (capital) & dropped by the Jungang underground shopping street & Guandeokjeong. Walked past Yongyeon Bridge & past park to Dongduam rock. Pleasant walk. Then back to find Black Pork St, but didn't try it as we had heard it was nothing special. Enough to fill in a day (about 6 hours ashore.) Friends who went on a trip round the island said it wasn't terribly interesting & worth the cost. Do pick up a map from the tourist info kiosk, not far from where you arrive, then you can walk round sights described"
Nice but not amazing..,Its nice..but not amazing. U can eat abalone from those ajuma also there. ( However its very expensive).Transport is near from airport..but difficult to find taxi on way back.
Maybe it was...,...but it didn’t appear to me as a dragon’s head. Perhaps i lack the imagination to visualise it. It was a short visit anyway. 
It’s not Blackpool ,"Listen to the folk stories and go and have a look yourself, then make up your mind if you believe it or not. Whatever the result it’s interesting and picturesque."
During dark,"My own experience was during dark, and I loved it. There was a spotlight highlighting the rock. Relax listening to the waves coming from the sea to the shore. On the way here I recommend walking through Yongyeon bridge."
Dragon head by night. You can also see the stone mermaid. Enjoy the sea breeze and open view of the sea. ,Nice rock formation. Lighting at night brings out the features of the dragon head. Enjoy the cold breeze from the sea. Mermaid stone statue fronts the entrance 
Nice views and easy stroll around ,"Visited Yongduam Rock as a part of my Olle walk. Pretty views, peacefull sea, a place to sit and contemplate, but be wary of mass tourism as busses pull in all day long bringing hords of people. Follow the Olle Trail to see more scenic views around. "
Nature Beauty!,It is a beautiful sightseeing scene. A good spot for photo taking. There is a hanging bridge before walk up to the spot. It is not far from hotel Ramada. 
Dragon Rock,"It is very nearby the airport, you can stop by once you have your rental car picked up. We did a quick stop for some photos only, we did paid for the parking. There is not much to see. "
"Nice, if you take the time to explore a little","Some of the reviews say it's a quick photo spot and that's all, but if you walk up the street just a little way, there's another path down where you can get some great pictures. The main photo spot is kind of small and crowded, but this other area isn't, and you can still see the rock and more surrounding formations.I didn't really see the dragon, but it depends on your impression of what a dragon should look like. This is definitely an Asian dragon, not a European one. :-)"
Beautiful ,The view is breathtaking and it is a picturesque view .The weather was hot and I wished they had some sort of shades .It is a must Sea place .
Sunset Splendour,"Definitely recommend coming here to catch the sunset. It makes for beautiful pictures. The calm and serenity of this place is perfect to watch the sky turn from day to night, while watching the airplanes fly by to the airport."
Is that it??? ,"We were so underwhelmed when we saw the rock, we had to laugh. It was quite small so not an imposing structure like we were expecting and only very loosely resembled a dragon. We were quite flummoxed and amused as it seems to be billed as a must see destination on promotional material when there are more interesting things to see in Jeju. Go if you're near but don't make a special effort to go see it unless you want a huh? moment! "
Dragon rock,"Easy to find by driving. Good scenery. Not far from the airport. If you are waiting for hotel check in like me, it's good idea to visit and have a good time. We had seafood with abalone lunch nearby. "
Dragon head rock,Nothing really much to do here except to stop and take a photo before heading off for your days sightseeing.
It’s amazing ,We went here today for first time and love it’s it’s so beautiful and fun to walk around have good restaurants and coffee shop and good shop to buy thing make from jeju !! You can take bus or taxi too 
Great views ,Great view clean air and blue water. The climb is pretty steep but the view is totally worth the effort.
Interesting Sightseeing Location ,We truly enjoyed the Yongduam Rock. Very rich in history and interesting to see how it was transformed over the years. Very popular location. 
Can be crossed out from itinerary,"It was a so-so attraction, mainly because it was merely to see the rock from afar. No interesting mythological background to it either besides knowing that it was formed by volcanic activity. Also the place has way too many people than it can handle."
왜 용머리인지는 완벽히는 모르지만 산책하기에 좋습니다,Close to the airport. Don’t understand why the name of this place includes ‘Dragon’s head’. 공항에서 가까워서 제일 먼저 들렸습니다. 바위가 용의 머리모양으로 있다고 하지만 그건 잘 모르겠네요. 그래도 다른 해변가의 현무암과는 다르게 뭔가 모양이 잡히긴 했어요..! 공항과 가까워 가볍게 산책하기 좋을 것 같습니다
You be the judge,"No high expectation. I’d come after 6:30 because of free parking. Many shops and restaurants are around this attraction, but I would go Hamdeok beach instead ;) "
Rocks that look at Dragon Head,"Parking is charged. I think we were there for about 1hr? They charged my SUV for 1,000 won, which is still pretty cheap in my opinion.The place is near Jeju International Airport, so this could be your first place in your itinerary or last.So there are two staircases down to see the Dragon Head rocks. One of them is closer to the rocks, which can be hard to see the Dragon Head formation. The place can be quite windy.There are stores selling Hallabong products as well. According to my friend, the souvenirs are priced almost the same everywhere.So rocks.. yea. Im not that keen actually. But if you like nature, you might probably like this."
🐉,"It is cool for a quick stop, the rock itself looks like a dragon but is full of bird droppings ;) nice view anyway!"
Just a rock,The rock does look like dragon but hard to capture the same through camera. There is walking path for people to enjoy the sea view with windy feel
Looks like a dragon alright,This was just down the road from the Mir guesthouse where we stayed. I thought it looked more dramatic at night (in lights). Interesting rock formation.
Quick Pitstop,Nice location with great scenic view. Nothing much you can do there other than taking some beautiful pictures. Probably 30 minutes would be sufficient for this location.
Nice sunset,Great view with sunset and mythical legend. Definitely a must visit for all. Plenty of restaurant nearby as well! Live the ocean view and rock is just cherry on to of icing. Highly recommend!!
Nothing special,accessible and you can stop anytime and take pictures but it's quite difficult to get closer as the rocks are quite sharp 
One of tourism place to visit,"Just courious about this place so we went there, Not much to do, Not much activity but the rock really look like dragon head shape. "
Dragon head rock with quick view,"The rock with dragon head shape. Is a quite short time view and to feel the sea breeze. We took the staircase down to see the rock with dragon head shape. Other than that, nothing special here."
Not worth a visit,There is nothing to see in this site except a stone that looks like a dragon head. Not worth a visit. 
Great walking track,"Get some fresh air and enjoy the walk here. The suspension bridge is just aroud the corner, cute little bar over looks it for when you have earnt a sit down"
Nothing special,"Nothing special. For me, it wasted our time. Its a rock with a shape of dragon. The ice-cream shop nearby is nice. "
nice,rock formation. nothing particularly special about it. visit if along the way or have time to do so. 
Dragon Head Rock,The rock shaped as a Dragon Head from all angles.. And it was very nice scene. There were a lot of people in Jeju Island. 
Amazing Rock Formations,"The rock formations will amazed you, you cant say that this rock images are made from lava which is from volcanoes."
Natural attraction,A small rock formed around many rocks. It is near the city and black pork street. Good time to visit is sunset or sunrise time.
Disappointed ,Tourists are not allowed to descend to the beach for a close up of the rock. So we only took photos from the top of the platform. Would be a nice place to view the sunset but we arrived right after and therefore missed the window opportunity to do so. 
Quick photo stop,Good spot for a quick photo very close to downtown jeju . You can walk from the middle of town very easily over the bridge and then round . Walk down do the photo and from the viewing area also a car park with toilet close by . 
Just a rock formation near the sea,This is one of the stops on the Jeju City tour bus route. We arrived here in the evening and this was our last stop before returning to Jeju main bus terminal via the airport. There were plenty of tourists at this small tourist site. The rock resembled a dragon head. It is just a photo stop but you can also stroll around and relax here as it is beside the sea and is breezy.
Go to watch sunset,"The rock by the coastline is not really spectacular, but it is closed to the city and the hotel we stayed, we went there for watching sunset and had a good view. I suggest you spend one evening there if you stay in Jeju city."
Nice viewing deck,"We went to Yongduam Rock and the weather was nice, not too sunny but not too dark.On the side where we viewed the rock, you can't really appreciate the ""dragon-form"" of the rock. I suggest you go to the other side and see how it looks from there.The view was nice too. It was calming."
Good to visit shortly near airport.,It is a bit dangerous to watch the rock but good to visit shortly if you have no time before your flight bacause it is near airport.
Chillax,"Wifi so fast here, I can video call with my mother in Indonesia. Many snacks sellers here. Sunset is best time to going yongduam rock. The air is very cool"
It's just a rock but can be alternative spot,"If you are out of plan and around jeju city, yongduam rock can be good alternative. There's also a beautiful bridge close to this place."
Chilled and relaxed ,"The dragon head rock is a good place to visit, if your wanting to stay close to jeju si. It doesnt take long to look at the rock and there are many tourists but the costal road is a nice relaxing walk. "
Unusual rock formation on edge of the city,"This is an easy walk from the centre of Jeju city. It'a one of the main attractions along the seafront walkway which goes all the way from the port to the airport. You often see the famous Jeju ladies, dressed in their black wetsuits, diving for pearls without breathing equipment."
it's just there,"they say it's a dragon head rock, but it's take minutes for me to finally agreed that it was looks like a dragon head.lot of locals and tourist takin picture and also place for plane-spotting. but overall for me its not that interesting"
Jagged rocks for your imagination,"Just a minute's drive from our Ramada Plaza hotel, this ""Dragon Head Rock"" landscape attracts a fair number of visitors. I find the nearby Dol Hareubangs and mermaid statue more interesting!!"
Just an attraction of Jeju Island,"It's a place where you will stop for 30 mins max? Everyone will be queuing to take with the ""dragon head"". From time to time, you will be able to catch planes flying across the as it's near the airportYou may also find Dol Hareubang means literally “stone grandfather” in Jeju’s dialect. They can be found anywhere in Jeju island. They are usually place at the entrance of the house/gate protection and fertility and were placed outside of gates for protection against demons travelling between realities.If you touch Dol Hareubang’s nose (left hand) to conceive and have a boy. If you touch the ear, for a girl. Touch the tummy for wealth. And we can only do it again after 1 year grace period."
Very relax please for enjoying a cup of coffee with sunset after a whole day meeting.,"This place is great for enjoying a sunset with coffee, so relaxing. The place around 700 m from the Ramada plaza, make its perfect place to release your stress after meeting and enjoy the beautiful panorama. Its also many seafood restaurants there. Just perfect!!! "
YES ITS DEFINITELY A 5 MINS STOP AND GO PLACE,"I am not sure I will tell others that this is a MUST GO place. We spent 5 mins taking few photos of the rock, enjoyed the breeze before going back into the car."
Windy visit,"This place of interest is beside the beach and not far from the airport. It is a volcanic stone due to many years under the sun, water and wind which erode the stone and form this dragon head. It is also up to individuals to creatively imagine the head.There are also many tales about this dragon head - one about the Dragon king is sick and young son went up the high mountain to seek the eternal medicine for the father. After getting the medicine, he was discovered by the protection god who was angry of his act and use lighting to strike him resulting in this burnt head."
Dragon's Head Rock,"Nothing much here, just a rock which is shaped like a dragons head due to the waves eroding the rocks for thousands of years. Great phototaking shoot."
5 minuet stop,Don't go out of your way to stop here. Takes less than 5 minutes to take a picture of the Dragon's Head Rick.
Nature Formed Dragon Head,"Created by winds and waves over thousands of years, the rock is formed resembling a dragon's head. Close by is the dragon pond Yongyeon, where the sea meets fresh water. The pond is flanked by 8 rock walls that resemble folding screens and has a stunning view."
Dragon Rock,"just go and have a look, snap some photo and leave. Dont need to spend too much time on this. If your schedule are tight, just forget about it"
Sea the Rock!,A place can stopover to visit where not far from the airport. We rent a car and took us few minutes to here. We spent around 30 minutes to look around and photos. A place for discoverer and those who love nature.
can take a look if you have time,"i feel i am lucky cos my hotel just nearby Yongduam Rock.the story behind is very attractive but won't give you a surprise when you really at there.The scale of Yongduam Rock is smaller than you think, but if you love to take picture with infinity sea or amazing sea wave, this place is a good place to go.finally, there are lot of restaurants around there, can have a good time after visit there."
Interesting dragon rock,"Perhaps it was the time of day we were here. We got here really early around 8am to start our road trip down the east side of Jeju Island. So nothing was open yet. We saw the dragon rock and even walked down the side of the small cliff to see the rock from a different angle. It was raining quite a bit on the morning we visited so the walk down was a little slippery. It was interesting to see the dragon rock formation and read about it's significance in Korean folklore. We had a photo with the mermaid there too. Unfortunately due to the time of day we visited nothing else was open, but from what we could tell there were mainly souvenir, fruit and convenient stores and stalls. Worth a visit if you have time, but essentially a nice looking rock"
Served on the rocks,"The rock itself isn't very impressive. Yes, it looks like a dragon and you can take pictures but that isn't the only thing you can do there. If you go down the steps and cross a quite rocky and unstable path (be careful), there are some fishermen who sell fresh seafood like octopus, oysters, and sea cucumber. You can eat them fresh and raw. Food adventurers will definitely love the place. There's a stall near the toilets where they grill the catch too. "
Dragon Head rock,"There is a few food street stalls. 15-20 minutes should be able to cover this place, Beautify during sunset. Great for picture taking."
Dragon Head Rock,It depends on your perspective to see the dragons head. You can also walk down nearer to the sea to have a closer look. If you are in jeju you can consider this.
Dragon Head Rock,"One needs to have some imagination to be able to visualise the dragon head, body and tail. Approximately 15 min (less toilet and street food break) will be good enough for this site."
Crashing waves and killer views ,"We took a walk along the Shores of the rock.. It sure beats jux standing at the top of the observertory and takin pictures! The views are once again spectacular, no complaints.. The walk was not terrible although but I'd warn you to be careful and pick proper shoes coz they can get slippery from the crashing waves! Along the walk you'll see ahjummas selling fresh seafood catches. Try it if you have time! "
Raining days,The view and scenery is good.The stairs are slippery so better watch your steps.Some stalls located at the entrance.I tried their famous Jeju fruit...taste like Mandarin orange (costs5000won-for about10pcs)
Seaside visit,Must see at certain angle in order to see the so called dragon head rock. Just enjoy the sea breeze will do
It's....a rock. That's it.,"I have no idea why Chinese and Korean tourists flock here by the busload. I just don't get it. And personally, I don't see a dragon.However, the surrounding areas are truly beautiful. I love the little park and the coastline is spectacular. Just don't go hoping to be wowed by....a rock."
Just a rock,It is just a rock that looks like a dragon's head but only if you are looking at it from up close. I wouldn't recommend spending lots of time here.
Amaze,"The story of this Dragon Head is nice and interest, the street food nearby is good too hahahah... this area for tourist in common and convenient of the stairs to go down more closely of the dragon head. "
Good for photo-taking,"Nothing really special, just a rock that looks like a dragon head due to years of erosion. We went at night so the view was spectacular. There were lots of souvenirs to buy at nearby shops and stalls."
A viewpoint for check-in,"It is an attraction for people to take photos of the special ‘Dragon’ like stone with the endless sea. That stone is 100% organic and experience years of erosions to form today’s ‘Dragon’ appearance. You can spend a couple of minutes with that ‘Dragon’ and spend another few minutes buying and enjoying the traditional outdoor cuisines. If you are interested in buying souvenirs like key chains or the ‘Dragon’ like badges, there is a shop for you to go shopping. Even though the viewpoint just for people to take a photo, there would always be many tourists standing in front of the best position for taking photos, so if there are many tour groups at the moment, you really have to spend time on waiting for just a photo. So, if you don’t mind the feel of crowded or if you get plenty of time, you are recommended as it is a special attraction in Jeju. It is nearby the international airport of Jeju so you can go there at the time you arrived or before you leave Jeju."
a Rock is a Rock,"This is just another roadside attraction that many people visiting Jeju stop by to see only because it is in the city proper. It is just a rock that could appear to look like any number of different animals.If your tour guide takes you out of your way to see this then you need a new tour guide because this rock is typical of any of the millions of rocks you run into along the seashore in Jeju.There are a lot of interesting things to see and fun places to go in Jeju but, this isn't one of them."
Watch out for the high tide,"It was a rainy and windy day when we went there, we were told the spot does not open daily and not all the time due to the weather and tidal timeWhen we went it was low tide, but super slippery and windy due to the rain. But amazing walk. There are some people selling fresh seafood, abalone sashimi from raw/ fresh, serving Korean alcohol. Another type of experience. We walked half way, we had our umbrella but I almost got ""flew away"" since it is too windy. But totally worth the walk, since you can catch the wave so closely, and the view is awesome."
A rock at the sea side border of the city,"Well, at the shore, practically still in the city, you can find this rock which probably originates from a lava eruptions, as everything on this island. With some imagination, I could identify a dragon's head. Nothing particular. It's like one tour guide said: everything on Jeju island is small and cute."
Don't Waste Time ,Stopped there for half an hour. Just a stone head that looks like a dragon head. Not worth the time. Skip if the guide allows.
Haha. Why? Just.... why? Not worth the time and energy.,"I just don't get this place. The rock doesn't look like a dragon head.... does it?Maybe cos I went there on my own... but I just don't see the significance of this place. Why? It's a waste of time and effort. Not that it requires that much walking... But I'd conserve my energy and also my time on something other than this.So not worth the time and energy. To me, that is. Maybe there is more to this place... but I just don't see/get it."
What is this,For me this tourism object is not worth to visit. You just come and see a rock that have a dragon head shape ( you must use your imagination so hard) not good at all. Do not come here.
Dragon Head but not really.,"The view of the so-called Dragon Head Rock will be impressive for some and disappointing for other. My friends and I definitely felt the latter. After a whole day of exploring Jeju, we decided to stop by this attraction to look at the sunset.However, we were greatly disappointed by the attraction as all 4 of us felt that the rock wasn't as impressive as the other attractions we have seen around Jeju. Not to mention the amount of tour buses at this particular attraction was ridiculous. The price of the items and food around the area was also very expensive. I would not recommend this place unless you have a lot of extra time at Jeju. I rather you spend that time on the Olle Trails which provides better view of the coast."
It's a rock that may or may not look like a dragon,This spot looks like it exists purely for the 15-20 tour buses that were there when we visited as its pretty much a rock with a different shape that you can see in the picture. Save your time and your parking fee and check out the world heritage listed rocks formations around the island otherwise you will need just 1 min here to take a photo and be off again
Dragon Head walk,We walked down to the water for a better view. Parts of the trek were without steps or handrails and are not for the weak or unsteady. Saw several women with heels fall when attempting to traverse the rocks. The best part was the old women divers selling their fresh seafood! 
This is not a sight,I felt like Jeju tried so hard to actually make sights out of nothing and this rock was a very good example of that... Along with Yongyeon pond this was one of the worst places I payed bus tickets for to see on Jeju. It's just a rock with a dirty water sea view and its in the middle of nowhere part of Jeju city where you can only go by taxi. Awful
Quick Stop Only,"One of Jeju Island attraction, the rock formations that looks more like a horse head to me. Well, legendary it was a head of a dragon. We stop by for a photo stop on our way to airport.A good nice photographing platform for visitor to take picture. There is a stairway leading down to the rocky beach, down there you can see many locals selling fresh seafood. It is not a wheelchair friendly place. Be there before sunset otherwise you will not able to take a clear photo."
Coastal walk,Walk around the mountain and you can see different rock formations. The water is very clear (look at the picture as if there is no water) that you can see sea urchins. I advise you wear rubber shoes to be more comfortable walking through sharp rock formations.
Passed by only,We only passed by here during our west course trip. But the view is breathtaking. The rock formations are awesome.
An interesting rock formation ,"Just a rock formation that may be interpreted as the head of a dragon. It is very subjective and other people may see it as something else. Maybe an alligator, or an elephant, depending on the beholder. Just a tourist attraction. Nothing spectacular."
Very Nice View,"Me and my family went to this place on a rainy day but it is still a good place to go. the nature in the area is very nice and during that time, it was quite windy yet cool at the same time. The only disadvantage is that this place is a bit far so you definitely need a car to get there."
Just ordinary,"Nothing special. Just a rock jutting out at sea. However, lots of visitors here. Many souvenir shops & food stalls. There's a mermaid statue nearby. This mermaid happens to be more popular than the rock."
Nice Photo Op,"If you have time to visit while you are in Jeju City, Yongdu-am offers a nice walk and photo op. Yong pond is also within walking distance and had some very picturesque views."
Great experience ,Very nice view and relaxing environment for families. I recommend this site for families with small and youth kids. Dunkin Donuts is great. 
Nice View Even on a Rainy Day,"Our trip was on a very rainy weekend. However, we were able to find the place easily. I bought a poncho at the place for less than $2 (2,000 won). Got many pictures and finished with a warm Donkin' Donuts coffee. "
"Have Time, Worth a Visit","Dragon Head Rock (Yongdu-am) is worth a look just to say ""been there, done that""!It's nothing fantastic but does live up to its name.As it is within walking distance of downtown make the effort if you have the time.Tour groups, especially in the morning, arrive by the coach load. So walking makes good sense!"
Nice windy location,Went there in the morning. Was windy but filled with tourists. They have some photo locations that will look good on a photo graph.not a place you can stay for long but a good place to drop by if u have some spare time. 
Dragon head rock,Tourist instractor said that many years ago the rock really look like dragon head. Know honestly this not much look like dragon head. But if you like natural beauty you should came to.
Rocks ,Went in the evening hoping it is not so crowded. Another rock structure with many people in the small area. The coastal area is nice nearby. 
Interesting rocks,There are quite a number of volcanic rocks but this 'dragon head' rock stands tall among the rest. It's kinda far out and out of reach. The sea view is just beautiful! Blue and captivating!
Come in the evening ...,There are planes fly very frequently towards this direction as the airport is near to this area. I will suggest you to come in the evening so that you would be able to witness the sunset of the day and definitely take a photo here.
"Too little rock, too many people ","The dragon head lava rock was indeed a sight to behold, jutting out of the cliffs. That is if you could catch a glimpse of it amongst hordes of tourists jostling for a vantage point to capture it on their phones, with selfie sticks flailing about.Being only the dragon head, it was quite a pint size cliff, and there was only a tiny area /platform from which to view it.To make the most of our drive there, we walked several meters down a stepped path quite close to the waters and enjoyed our moments there on the rocks."
The art of mother nature,"To some it may just look like a stack up rocks. However, once you carefully look at it, you will appreciate what mother nature had created. Dragon Head! That will be decided how wild your imagination run"
Nice place,Nice place to visit but must be extra careful with your steps. Not a huge rock but worth a look. Loved the wind on my face and the plane landings every 7-8 minutes. The walk along the coast to Ramada Plaza was great. 
It's at seaside,"It's very near to Jeju city, within walking distance. It's nice walk strolling along the seaside to dragon head rock and even walk further from there. However this place is always full of tourist, and not easy to get a good picture of this attraction. Nevertheless the environment and surrounding is beautiful and relaxing and I was here during sunset and foggy evening, absolutely beautiful. "
Good place for sunset,"You must came when sunset time. Its really nice timing when we came there. The plane came to landing in jeju airport, it'll increase the beautiful scenery."
Nice vista but short visit,"The dragonhead really isn't anything spectacular. You can imagine why they say it's a dragon but nevertheless it's a tiny rock. The vista however, in a sunny afternoon over the ocean and harbour was indeed something. If I'd revisit it'd be because of the vista, not the rock."
Are you serious? ,"Lol make this visit a very very quick visit. Tiny rock, I looked around to see something awesome. My parents had seen this when they were in high school and were disappointed to see how small it was. Almost missed it."
Nice visit at night ,"Worth night visit , natural view ,night time with spotlight can spot ""dragon head"" easily compare to day time , wildly & peacefully "
Another stone formation,Nothing much to see just another stone formation but they have given this stone a story to it. This is how tourism is built. 
Good for a quick view,"Yongduam is popular with the locals, particularly high school students on school trips. There's not much to do in the area, apart from viewing the rock which does resemble a dragon's head. Other than that it's pretty unimpressive, and even half an hour at the site is more than enough time to view the rock and enjoy the view."
Dropped by,"Just a rock but if ur imagination is working overtime , you can see the ""dragon head"". Many group of tourists see the place. Its near the seaside restaurants of which we find very expensive food."
Its just a neat looking rock,"It takes 10 min tops to actually enjoy the rock. Its unique and pretty but that's all folks! You have to pay for parking (500 won every 30 min) and believe me, it doesn't even take that long to see all there is to see. We had extra time before rental car needed to be returned so we stopped. But I wouldn't have otherwise gone out of my way to see this rock formation."
Couldn't get excited,"Was it worth the view? It was windy and a bit of a walk ...but was it worth the view? Nope! Our tour coach took us there. One has to use a lot of imagination to ""see"" a dragon's head! "
Dragon Head- Falcor?!,"Went today - very clear day. Reminded me of Falcor from the Never Ending Story. Hahahha! We took the southern trail to the lookout. Was a great place to stop and see the local female divers gather fresh mussels, clams, abalone, squid and sea cucumbers. They quickly set up shop with a few kids stools and rock formations (ready made table top). They brought out a few bottles of soju (I think they hid it in the ocean to keep it cool. Luv the grapefruit flava) and they were ready for customers. Freshest seafood I've ever tasted- Anthony Bordain would've been proud. "
"Rock formation along shore, go if in the area","This Dragon head shaped rock formation is near the airport, and hence favourite of many bus group tours. Can take pictures with the frequent airplanes flying pass by at low altitudes. "
It's Just A Rock Formation,A rock formation at the sea. Not anything more. A photo op for those interested in this sort of thing.
another rock,my husband's comment was 'another rock?' but we walked to the YongYuan pool afterwards which is more beautiful so he's happy
Dragon Head Rock,"This Rock is believe as a Snake want to be a Dragon, so according to the local story there are God who live a the Sea. And the Snake should have the Jade from the God and Snake steal the jade while the God is sleeping but before the snake escape the God Woke up and put an Arrow to the snake. Half Body (Upper Part) already come out from the sea at it's become a dragon but the lower part is still below the sea and become the rock. That's why the upper part that we can see looks like Dragon Head Rock. This area is very near from the Parking area, here we can find Orange Seller, Snack seller, restaurant also, souvenir shop. Nice place to see and near from Jeju Airport.. 10 Minutes from the airport."
"Nice scenery, good place to visit when nothing to do","Forget what it's called because I can't see a dragon head even when I tried to go around the different angles of the rock formation. However, this is a cool place to visit, to have a stroll on a lazy day since it's near the airport side of jeju. Probably around 5000 won (4 USD) to take a cab from the airport. There are small food stalls nearby, and dunkin donut too for some coffee. There is a nearby tourist center where you can ask if they can call a cab for you on your way back to your hotel or anywhere. They don't have booking fee which is excellent. "
Near airport ,If you take the steps down to the rocks you will see some ladies peddling fresh sashimi seafood with soju. Location is very popular with tour buses so be prepared for crowds
Brief Stop Attraction,"The Dragon Head Rock was rather disappointing since the shape was difficult to visualize as a dragon head no matter which ever way we looked at it. However for a brief stop, it is worthwhile for first time visitors."
Interesting rock formation,"Since there is not much to see in Jeju City, I liked this the most. The rock itself looks nice, so if you happen to be in Jeju City and have free time, it worth to check and enjoy the view on the rocky seaside. easy to get here from Jeju Intercity Bus terminal, just take local bus #17, and tell the driver ""Yongduam"" he will show the right bus stop. From there only 5 mins walk. It is just a rock, so don't expect much, but it's good trip for 20-30mins. Before going to the rock, you should definitely check the bus schedule back to the city center (bus timetable is displayed not on the bus stop, but on the shopwindow just nearby where no one would ever search), as there's 1-2 bus in every hour."
Nothing special,"Seriously, this rock simply had a good marketing team that created a story and a good image of this rock.. Bus visually you can find so much more interesting rocks in any other place of the Jeju island"
Beautiful formation of rocks!,"Great to visit on a nice day. Beware of the high tide! My tour guide rang before hand to check and lucky he did because in the AM the tide was high, so we re-schedule the site for the PM. Much better!"
Interesting view of the rock,"It is interesting and special when you view it, but it is actually like any rock formation, which can take many different form. If you are nearby, then go ahead, if not, don't have to drive there specially for it."
Not sure about the dragon...,Tour guide told us the best to see the dragon head rock was at night. Its because the spotlight will give you an image of a dragon head just use your imagination. Though does not work for me.. not really sure if thats a dragon head or just an abstract rock on the cliff.
Do not spent to much time here.,"Nice to visit...but do not spent too much time in this area. There are a lot of nice places in Jeju. Please note, Dragon Head Rock near sea with strong wind."
"Nothing Fantastic, can give a missed.","Just a piece if rock that looks like the head of a dragon. Not worth making a trip there unless you have nothing on, or around that area. "
Fantastic view,Experience⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Time worth⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐Good for photos⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐The Dragon Head rock was formed through volcanic activity and the surrounding beach is covered in a thick layer of volcanic ash and rock. The whole area is beautiful and great for taking photos though not worth visiting again as it's more of a love at first sight thing 
"Rock formation, sea front","This is within old Jeju city. Very windy condition during visit, definitely not for raining weather. Just 30 min will suffice. "
Strong Wind! ,"Was there last Friday morning before back to Seoul! The wind was so strong and I love the cold freeze! The wave and sound makes you feel relax and you can visit diver women sheltering under the small wooden house and they are selling the live seafood that caught from the sea such as abalone, sea cucumber, oyster etc. You can also see non stop airplane landing towards Gimpo airport. "
A rock that with a lot of imagination could be anything.,"I did not see the point of this activity, was just in the area and decided to go have a look, was rather disappointing. The south side offers way cooler things like the waterfalls and the hexagonal rock formations. Difficult to get a decent picture as you can not get too close either."
Just a dragonhead shaped rock,People usually come here as it's near the airport. Just take little time here only to take pictures and nothing else.
Visit if you have time,"For me it's not a very special sight, though it's adventurous and interesting to walk down the stairs to the coast and see the ""diving women"" serving octopus, shells and abalone on the rock"
Unique cliff,"Took a taxi to go here was the only option i had, was exciting, but then did not as great as i thought it was. Many seafood snack. That freshly grilled and eat to go. "
Hard to shape the dragon,People say the shape of the rock is changing a lot and now it is a bit hard to see as a dragonhead. But we can walk around the shore and scene was nice.
Only slight resembelance,"The rock has only slight resemblance to the Chinese Dragon. You can only view at a platform and not go down to the rock to take the picture.Take note, if you are travelling in the morning, the sun will be in your eyes when you take a picture if you use the East platform and the sun will be backlighting you if you use the West platform. It is very crowded as there are lots of Chinese tourists there.However, the view around the area is worth the travel. Basically you can spend less than 30mins there"
Hard to find a parking space,It's quite difficult to find a parking space. Quite a few people at sunset struggling for pictures. It's not that beautiful in my opinion. There are many restaurants after walking across the suspension bridge.
Nothing spectacular,I more amazed by the crystal clear water than the rock formation. Suggest to give it a pass and head on to other attractions.
Made of stone,This tourist attraction has good view for photo. You can see the Jeju city landscape from here and the dragon head rock itself only the minor thing to see.
Skip it ,"Skip this and head for Dodubong Peak, especially if you're on the Jeju Golden Bus day tour. This place is unremarkable and is honestly one of the dirtiest parts of the area; I attempted to have my photo taken and a rat scurried out from between the rocks. If you walk up the road (away from the site) about a half mile, maybe less, the photo ops are much nicer. The area near Dodubong Peak is also nicer and you can see great views of of Jeju from the summit. "
Nothing much,Not so spectecular after you have seen all the beautiful scenery in Jeju. A quick visit is alright if you have the time. Just a rock formation. 
One of unique Lava Rock in Jeju,Well is rather a unique Lava rock by the sea shore but to me it looks more like a Horse head. You may find people selling seafood by the side of the rock under simple canopy. Just be careful as you walk down to the sea because the rocks are hard .
Bit of a disappointment.," There is walk along the nice promenade to get to this rock. It is hard to make out the dragon in the rock but Asians love strangely shaped rocks. In my opinion it was not so spectacular but the walk along the promenade is very nice, over nice bridge and coffee shops along the way."
Nice View and interesting sashimi!,"Special rock structure that looks like a dragon head and nice view. We also tried some fresh seafood that the local women sliced it in to pieces, serve with chilli and garlic. We haven't seen those seafood in Singapore! Very interesting!"
Natural and scenic seaview,"Jeju is a volcanic island and the black lava that erupted from Mount Hallasan few thousands years ago are found almost every where. When we visited this attraction at Yongdam which is about 20 minutes drive from the Jeju airport, we could see the sea rocks and soils were black in color. The Yongdam rock was probably a volcanic rock that erupted and eroded down Mount Hallasan and over the years sculptured by natural forces of strong wind and rain and powerful sea waves into a structure of a `dragon head' . But the invisible hands of nature did not leave a distinctively well carved aesthetic product that deserved our admiration and appreciation. I really could not figure out the `dragon head' from the rock until my guide pointed out it to me. But black dragon in traditional Chinese folklore was supposed to symbolize bravery and auspicious luck and good fortunes to the people and visiting this attraction assumingly bring good luck and prosperity.Nevertheless, Jeju is exceptionally natural beauty and boasts of so many awesome and stunning natural scenic attractions which are so fascinating so lovely so magnificent that make me wondered if this was paradise on Earth. The air is fresh and you hardly find heavy machineries and factories with thick polluted smoke emitting out from the chimneys or the methane smell of diesel and petrol from vehicular emissions that is so typical in crowded cities. Jeju impressed me what nature is all about. From Yongmeori seashore, manjanggul caves, cheongjiyeon waterfalls to Hallasan National Park and Oedolgae Cliffs and this Yongdu-am dragon head rock, the physical geographical lessons appear no ending and I found intense pleasure in enjoying nature's silent whispers."
Dragon Head Rock,"well, the special about this place is the rock structure look like the dragon head, that's why they name the place as Dragon Head Rock. also the rock are in ""black"" colour, which i think it is quite unique. "
"Naming rocks is an intersting local tourism trend in Jeju, and this is where it all started.","To be blunt, I couldn't see the dragon's head in the Dragon Head Rock, and I'm not alone. Apparently a portion of the formation fell off during a heavy storm long ago, so perhaps it was once more impressive. Currently, it has become iconic for a rather tired trend in Korean tourism. Pointing at the sky and finding clouds that look like other things is childlike. Officially naming rocks and then designating them as ""important cultural artifacts"" in order to manufacturer tourism is crass. In much the same way that the Korean government has become intimately involved in generating the so-called ""Korean Wave"" of K-pop and Korean television dramas, there is a constant rush to capitalize on landmarks, events, and experiences that will help distinguish Korea in general and Jeju specifically in the competitive marketplace of global cultural value. This push to invent cultural significance is monopolized by a predominately male class of older Korean bureaucrats who have capitalized on Confucian values in order to override younger, better ideas, fueling their own, often tedious marketing concepts despite the existence of far better and substantive materials from which to draw inspiration. Take for instance Jeju's rich history of folklore and deities. Sure, you can dawdle about with stories of a dragon stealing jade or herbs of immortality from Halla Mountain and being shot by a celestial arrow as punishment, turning it to stone; but the fact is there are literally hundreds of far better stories that have some basis in local lore rather than the distinctly artificial details surrounding the Dragon's Head Rock. If you're interested, look for books on the subject, some of which were written by expatriates in an attempt to save this rich heritage from being slowly whitewashed away by modern fabrications. A book called ""Spirits: Jeju Island's Shamanic Shrines"" by Joey Rositano comes immediately to mind. Or you can go to any number of local beaches and walk along paths where every 20 yards or so you can read a plaque that tells you what a large stone vaguely resembles if you squint hard and suspend your disbelief. That said, there's nothing wrong with taking a nice stroll along the seaside in this part of town if you only have a short amount of time to spend and you need to get to the airport soon. There are some passable restaurants along the way, a couple of good cafés, and some great views of the ocean. However, make no mistake - this is an authorized conduit for tourists and as such you will be subject to a conveyor belt of people on the same walk, as well as an abundance of stores whose sole purpose is to extract money from you by selling tawdry bits of plastic."
Quick View near Jeju airport,"To get the best view you have to walk down steps to water level, then across a ""flattened"" stone area to a tent where a local vendor sells things. Go just past the tent for the best view. Best on a clear day with blue sky and water in the background. Plan 30 minutes max."
Just a rock with some sort of story,"Literally, Just a piece of rock with some 'fantastic' story to 'sell' as another landmark, but nahhhh. Also, very crowded."
attraction near jeju city,place is 20 mins drive from airport but nothing much to see except for some rocks which don't even look like dragon head....
"Only another piece of Rock, Great Seaview though","I ran along the coast line and the park a couple of times, and thoroughly enjoy the view and surroundings. Had a hard time finding the ""dragon"" rock. Finally found it only when I saw some people taking photos. You have to stretch your imagination quite a bit to visualize the ""dragon"" leaping into the sky."
If you're anyway around,Nice magma formations but not realy a dragon head.Many tourists are around the rock so easy to find.If you're anyway around there worth a look but you don't have to come extra for this rock...
Interesting Rock Formation,"The surrounding precinct was probably more attractive than the actual Yongduam Rock, and certainly the local stalls selling street food took more of my attention.However, take it all in and the visit is quite enjoyable."
Great seaview but nothing fantastic about the rock,"There's basically nothing here except for the black rock that is sculpted by nature to look like a dragon head. However, the sea view is pretty. Doesn't need to spend a lot of time here. Maybe about 10 mins max. There's also a souvenir soup nearby which sells Korean gifts. The shop is not huge but you can find stuffs that typical souvenir shops will sell. eg. keychain, pen, towels, mugs, socks (yes, for some reasons, Koreans are really fond of cute socks with cartoons)..etc.Saw the Roll Hotto snack. In Singapore, we call this flakey flour pastry as prata. In this case, they rolled the prata with egg and ham complete with vege. Kindda cool.The ice cream they are selling at this attraction is interesting. I chose 2 flavors: Vanilla and Strawberry. Price is KRW3,000 or RMB20. It's kind of interesting to note that RMB is accepted in Korea as a form of payment. Nonetheless, the ice cream is yummy!More photos available onhttp://i-wanna-travel.blogspot.sg/2015/03/korea-jeju-17-mar-2014.html."
Just a rock,Free entry. Just a rock that doesn't seem to resemble a dragon as claimed. Nice view of the sea though. Not very worth to go out of the way to visit. Spent maybe 5 minutes there in total. 
A mystery ,This rock formation was spotted on the eastern side of Jeju island. I was lucky enough to see this attraction having not spotted one a long time ago.The water present in these area is crystal clear where you can see different fishes swimming in the ocean breeze.
"Beautiful sapphire blue water, awesome rock formation","Enjoyed the breeze, beautiful views and overall natural beauty of the place. Some of my favorite Jeju pictures were taken here."
Nice view..love the sea breeze and the sunset,We went there before the large crowd came. The place is relatively small and nothing much to see. You have got to use your imagination and eyesight to view the dragon head rock. Some people say it doesn't resemble dragon at all..hahaha
Nothing much,"Just a rock formation that looks more like a bunny than a dragon. Nothing much. FOC entry but if you're driving, parking is paid when you exit the carpark. Payment is to an attendant. Highly touristy area and can be quite packed when the tour buses arrive. This attraction is open 24hrs."
Nice walk,"Nice walk along the shore and take a few photos near the airport, tourist information, gift shops and casino."
Thing to do before I went to the airport,"this attractions is quite near the airport so we came here to take a few pictures and watch the stones.there are many tourists. if you have some extra time, come and take a few pictures. compare with other attractiion with amazing landscape, you will not feel excited by this."
Nothing more than a piece of rock,"Whatever they called it is immaterial, you have to imagine it looks like dragon head. Quite meaningless. There are some ""old time lady diver"" selling freshly catched octopus, and u eat it raw with the wasabi. "
Okay.. Not wow,"You can see it from a deck, and it does require imagination to see it as a dragon head. Nothing else here, but there are some snack shops.. Worth roughly 15minutes."
Dragon Head Rock,This 'Dragon Head Rock' was formed by the formation of basalt rock situated along the coastal sea. This area is very windy.
Well...not a must visit place but it is famous,"We went as group of 25 people (friends) but it only took us 10 mins for photo taking and we left.Overall, the view was nice but i would say, worth viewing once only since it is not far away from the airport."
Need some imagination,It was a piece of rock that is on the edge of cliff. The scenery is nice but I'm not really an imaginative person hence took me awhile to get it. But it is still a beautiful view.
Dragon Head?,"I did not find it interesting. Well if clouds could form human faces, then I guess rocks could form dragon head. Not that it is related.Anyway, I really could not see a dragon and while it does look like a head, well, it's just that. A head.The only thing I find interesting is the selling of sea-shell foods and being able to eat by the sea on the rocks.For me, if I were to miss this, I guess I won't be miss anything?!"
Beautiful volcano stones,Worth to visit can view the formation of eruptefvolcano soil formed different types of shapes.Its amazing the stone formed looks like a dragon head. Go by Taxi from hotel easily accesible.
no longer look like drsgon head,"part of the rock was eroded. it appeared more like a rabbit instead of dragon head. Suggest to go to Heopjae beach which is 5 minutes walk or next to Halim Park. It is overwhelming with crystal clear sea water fine sandy beach, and unique volcanic rock formation within your reach. It is free and really worth going. The intercity bus will stop right in front of the seaside."
Natural,"A volcanic rock that looks like a dragon head looking up the sky, NATURAL surrounding with lots of volcanic rocks formed by molten lava creating a scenic and spectacular view. You can walk carefully along the volcanic rock to go as close to the dragon formation as you can for better photography. Different time of the day, different view against the Sky. This place is beautiful , windy and cold even in spring. No entrance fee! There is a man made mermaid, and 2 man made stone guardians of the land There are 2 souvenir shops, grilled cuttlefish shop , ice cream and fruit stalls depending very much on tourists. The Jeju airport is nearby and if you have the time, can count the planes landing and taking off at a busy airport. Further away, there are motel and seafood restaurants. We like the tasty green abalone porridge and the fresh and tasty seafood soup.All in all , I like this tourist place very much, I like earth natural formation very much."
rocks.....,"i think this place is over rated, other than the volcanic rocks formation, you can see planes landing to jeju airport. the view is nice though. "
A volcanic rock formation that looks like a dragon head,"This dragon head rock is actually a volcanic rock formation happened years back. The molten magma touches the freezing cold sea water forming a unique shape. It looks like a dragon head from certain angle. I will suggest to visit it during the night as there will be lightings on it. The surrounding are filled with alot of seafood eateries. Will suggest to try out any of them. Seafood pot, abolone porridge and their sea produce are very tasty. For aviation lovers, this site is very near to the airport, you may find some strategic spot to view airplanes take of and landing."
Over-rated place for tourisum,"This place is very near to airport so you can just visit this place. The rock looks like a dragon faced but it is small. However, the place is scenic and you can see the plane landing or take-off less distance from here. "
Dragon Head Rock!!,If you have chance to travel here. Please careful about strong wind and rain. I ran to the bus because of wind and cold!! You can have seafood for dinner there too.
Rock,This was our last station before we heading to airport to catch our flight to Busan. You will be able to see the rock that look like a dragon head. Overall this place what you see was the rock. It was near to the sea and lots of people too. 
Nice view!,"It was a nice view of ocean with rocks especially during sunset... It has safe path with stairs to go down and see better view of the dragin rock... It has also a small markets there, where they sell tangerines which is a famous fruit there (felt regret that i didnt bought them)... Also there were also souvenir shops and seafood resto... "
Can give it a miss if you dont have time,The ocean view is splendid but the rock doesnt live up to its name possibly due to erosion just like the 12 apostles in the Great Ocean road. And its very crowded ...
Too crowded by tourist,Very cold and windy too crowded and packed by tourist however the view of the dragon head rock is splendid.
Dragon Head Rock; view it with your Imagination,"I was very excited to visit Jeju; and this probably one of the most accessible place by Bus. There's actually public transport to this place (Yongduam Rock) from my accommodation. However, when I reached this place , i was busy looking for this legendary dragon head rock. Much to my disappointment, the rock doesn't seem to look like dragon head, you must really view it from the other side with your imagination.However, in order to reach to the other side, you need to climb all the way down the stairs, Not recommended for elderly. And if you notice carefully, you will spot alot of cockroach crawling around the rock, that totally freak me out!! Very big turn off if you spot the cockroach.the period I went was very crowded, probably around 5-6pm, This timing was quite a good timing for me, as I manage to catch a sunset. The sunset there was relatively awesome with the endless view of sea. If you can walk all the way down to those seafood stores, whereby you can enjoy fresh seafood hot pot + splendid view of sunset & sea!"
Not too impressive and way too many tourists,This natural attraction isn't that remarkable (rock that looks like a dragon) but it would have been nice except it is PACKED with tourists. It is way too crowded for my liking and most photos taken will include a bunch of other random tourists in it as well. My boyfriend and I were far more interested in the little food stalls set up around this tourist attraction - as you can try some local snacks. We came here as a part of a tour from Hong Kong.
Same as it's name.,Visited this place 4 years ago. This is a iconic place in jeju Island. This place is known for its rocks formation which looks like dragon head. The ocean is also beautiful here A place for photography as a memo. Not to be missed when in jeju. 
Very good ocean view,"yongduam rock is near to the airport. You can visit here the day before you depart from Jeju island. It has beautiful walk alone the sea. The place is good for seeing the ocean from the peak. There is a dead rock here. Those who like to take pictures of the plane can take pictures of the plane which is on the way to airport. This place is one of the icons of Jeju city. So, must see it."
"like the name it, it really looks dragon head rock.","When you land in Jeju Island, You can start your tour at Dragon Head Rock called ""Yongduam"". It takes only 3 minutes by car to get there. Like the name, it really looks drag on head rock and it seems the dragon is ready to go up to the sky.In front of photo zone, if you take a picture, you will realize your trip in Jeju Island started."
Great View of the Sea and some Rocks,"Great view of the coastline. Some uniquely formed rocks. Lots of people. Great spots for photography. Stalls for local snacks. I guess the above summed up what to expect at this place.For me, the ""Dragon Head Rock"" wasn't the main attraction, it is just something to label this place for tourists to drop by for photography. However, if he rocks weren't there, the authorities may lack a tagline to draw crowds. The view of the coastline here was amazing, facing a beautiful and rough seas with nature to your left and modern residential buildings to your far right."
Dragon shape rock. ,Dragon shape rock. The rock will bring you good fortune. It is also famous for fishing site. The lighted rock is also beautiful at night. Make a wish and the rock help you. Regardless of the legend you can enjoy the beautiful scenery. Omegi ddeok (cake) is also good food to try. 
Notting interesting,"This small rock which located next to beach is famous maybe because of many chines visitors , Highly recommended to not waste your precious time to going there , if u want to eat local food nearby there maybe is not bad idea to visit here otherwise don't . "
"Nice, but Nothing Much","The place is nice, overlooking the sea. But it's nothing to shout about. When my guide pointed out the dragon head rock, I was trying to figure out where's the head and in which way it was facing."
Very beautiful,"Astonishing view of the sea, you can also eat seafood by the ""stones"", the ajummas can speak minimum Chinese but don't ever expect anyone to help you with English. Steep steps there though. "
don't even bother...,This place isn't worth the visit. There isn't much to see except for the rock & beach. There are better beaches out there. More of a tourist trap with all the souvenir shops along the stretch.
Nice photo location but not much else,"The dragon head rock makes for an interesting photo souvenir. It is a nice place to visit, but probably would not count as one of the must-see places in Korea. Shops selling grilled octopus and other snacks line the route to the attraction, but the food is nothing spectacular as well. Allocate 30 minutes for the place."
Nice but there is better,"The dragon head rock is in North part of Jeju, close to the airport. It is a rock that looks like a dragon head on the coast. The Seogwipo coast line like the Jusanjeolli Cliff or the Odelgae Rock are much more interesting than this. However, if you do not have time to visit the Jungmun/Seogwipo area, this is an alternative to see the rocky coastline. The sunset here is nice, but the place is packed with tourists fighting to get photos, so it's not all that romantic. I think a beach sunset at a more remote beach on the West side would be nicer and a calmer experience."
What a drag!,"What's there to see here? There's the rocks, the sea, and a few souvenir shops, but really, the place is, quite frankly, overrated. The rock doesn't even resemble a dragon's head!This may be one of my shortest reviews ever, but it's only because the place is not very interesting. Yes, there's a great sea view (the reason why I didn't give this attraction a ""terrible"" rating), but other than that, there's really no reason to visit this place.Only give this attraction a go if you really fancy posing with the rock, or if you really love the sea. My humble opinion is that Jeju definitely has more places worthy of your precious time."
Well just a rock....,"Well, it was just a rock, nothing special as we come from a place full of strangely-shaped rocks and mountains (Guilin)! We tried the alive octopus at the restaurant near the rock, it was FUN!!! The shop owner caught and cut the octopus into small pieces. The poor thing was still stuck on the plate while we tried to get it into our mouth. Tasted great with some mustard and soybean sauce!"
Nice lookout,You can make-out the dragon head once you reach the shoreline. A short walk which gets a little difficult during the peak tourist season. 
Nice to see but not that import! ,"The sorroundings are definitely better than the rock itself: nice little Korean hut, beautiful bridge. But the place is bigger than we thought and because of so many tourists and buses easy to find! To watch the waves and the ocean was also nice to see. Good to see if you are close by or want to walk around the coast! We walked there from the city centre, although it was raining, and enjoyed the view from the ocean!"
Good,"Just came here for taking picture. I can see the dragon head. Nothing to lose if you didn't visit here, but it is so famous that you need at least single picture of you with the head. No entrance fee "
Rock the Dragon!,"It's created by the natural force. It's just another myth and wrapped in folkore to tell the story about the dragon head rock. When we arrived it was a heavy windy rain afternoon, so we cannot look to close to the rock."
Come here not for the rock formation but for the experience of being disappointed!,"If we had known that the rock formation was disappointing, we wouldn't have taken the effort to get lost on our way there! We went there at night, and all we saw were a few spotlights shining upon a small piece of rock jutting out of the land mass - there are other wayyyy better ways to spend your limited time in Jeju. Seriously! Don't bother please."
Nature at work,Visited this place near to sunset for about 30 minutes. Very breezy and cool area to take a rest and reflect on the natural forces in creating this Dragon Head Rock. Good lesson for children studying Geography. Maybe boring for the tourists. Seems the Dragon Head looks more distinctive during sunset.
mehh!!,"it was pretty fun trying to find this spot,but its really just some rocks.nice coastal views though.was so many tourists there taking photos!!"
Long Way!,"I lost so much time trying to find that place! The GPS wouldn´t find it !Went there.. and didn´t liked... there are better place to go in Jeju... If you are not sure... go to other places, seriously"
Rocks and cool breeze,"You can enjoy a cool breeze and a walk around the yongduam area. The dragon head is not that interesting but since it's free admission, why not? We spent about 20 minutes walking around the area. "
"very disappoint. nothing to see, nothing to do","oh my God. came to this place and only saw a little rock that shape like dragon head. beside that, you cannot get anything else. the view is just so ordinary. nothing special. I'm sorry jeju but this is quite disappointed"
Accessible Attraction *Thumbs Up*,"Decided to skip driving for the day, and took a taxi to Yongduam Rock. It is really cheap if you flag one from Nohyeong-dong area, the fare will only cost around 5000 korean won. There is a little community near the attraction selling food, fruits and all sorts of beverages to shield you from the chilly winter gale. Heading back to the city (Nohyeong-dong area) is a breeze as well, just take a bus back and it will only cost you 1000 korean won. Explore the neighbourhood around Yongduam and explore local sights and sounds. *Thumbs up*"
natural rock with dragon head look,great place to visit during winter. It's windy and cold. You can taste some raw seafood selling by some aunties. Aunties caught the fish nearby the area.
Stopover to the Airport,"As part of the tour, we had a short stop at dragon head rock, where you can see the head of a dragon naturally carved on a big rock. There is also a small mermaid sculptured on a rock for photo opportunity. This is more of a photo stop. Jeju as an island attraction have plenty of rock formation, volcanic rocks, and shoreline with plenty of rock. Again like all part of Jeju, the place has good breeze and quite comfortable."
Visit at Night,"Before we arrive, the tour guide told us the story of the dragon and how the mark of the dragon landed create all the cracks on ground. At night with spot lights, it added some mysteries of the legend and when we climb all the way down hill at the dragon head,. it complete the story itself. A good trip full of imagination "
Nearby Airport!!,"this place is free and located nearby airport. it won't take too much time also, spend around 1hrs here.Sometimes u can see the airplanes landed as the background..kinda cool..the dragon-shaped rock is visible if u take picture with the right angle, otherwise it's just an ordinary rock."
Go... If you're in the area!,"This is a neat little place to enjoy the ocean breeze and see a rocky area.You don't need much time here; about 15 minutes is adequate. Wear comfortable shoes as the surface is uneven. I'm sure you will enjoy he scenery here... You can combine it with a walk along the coast into town. I stumbled across a nice bridge and gazebo area along the way, as I headed towards the downtown market."
Just tourists location,"As coaching parking and no admission fee needed.You could plan to visit within 30 minutes. Don't try the seafood stall down there as not worth to do so. Indeed, there is not much to see except popular place for group tourists guide."
the rockin' breezy weather,average place for just a quick pit stop. lovin' the cold n breezy weather. a good place to visit for sight seeing and taking pictures. hassle with many tourists.
It's a rock.,"It's an unusual formation, I'll give it that, but really I don't see why it's a tourist attraction. It's something I planned on missing, but stumbled upon anyway. "
it's a rock,"it looks like a dragon, I guess. good views of the ocean. It's more of a tour bus place where people come, take pictures and go. But if you walk a bit up the hill from here, you come to a nice Buddhist temple. "
Not a must,"Like other traveller's review, this is not a place that worth the effort to purposely come by to visit. As it is really just a peace of rock that stood by the sea... It seems more attractive when the spot light is on at night.We dropby this place when we are on the way back to Yeha Guesthouse, surprisingly lots of tour buses stopping by! And you need to walk all the way down the staircase to have a better view of the rock, so old folks with knee problem would suggest to skip this sight seeing point.We couldn't identify which portion is the 'dragon head' until we over heard a tour guide's explanation to their guests @@"
Nice view.,There isn't much there but it is a beautiful view and a nice walk along the coast. Some of the fancier hotels with casinos are nearby. It wasn't very busy when we went but I think during the summer peak season it would be a bit crowded.
Nice place to enjoy the breeze,It's my first stop after touching down in Jeju. It's quite an interesting place to enjoy the nice breeze and occasionally catching the view of the plane touching down at the nearby airport.. Steps are a bit uneven at some places where you can get a great photo of the rock
"If you're in the area, it's worth a look!","Nothing too spectacular, but it's a nice walk along the coast. Restaurants nearby for dinner and a drink. If you're in the area, check it out!"
not need much time,"the destination is built by legend about dragon who fall from the earth, as tourist object not much to see. it's nature rock, beach and on autum the weather is nice. no need much time"
Can be avoided,"Too much travel for very little. Infact you can stand where this rock & enjoy the view of ""about-to-land"" flights. Its very close to airport.PHEWWWW"
>> Why not? <<,"This would just take you 5 minutes of your time. Get out of the taxi and snap some pictures. No, it did not look like a dragon's head to me no matter how I pictured it. But oh well, I have been told I could do with more imagination. One of those things that you do to strike off another ""to-go"" in your itinerary. If you are keen, walk down the stairs - you will see vendors selling fresh octopus sashimi - worth a try!"
A doggy dragon,"It is the year of the golden dragon. So it was great excitement for us to be on our way to visit this dragon head rock, which the guide said could be discerned by going further down the vantage point.On arrival, we did just that, but we have to put our imagination to the test. But then again who has seen a dragon before. So we took pictures and we moved off in less than 15 minutes!Comparing pictures, I thought the dragon head looks better at night."
rocks..,It's just some rocks along the beach. Luckily i saw the nice view during sunset time. Please go for something else in Jeju.
2012 - Year of the Dragon,"Was terribly rainy on the day we visited, but managed to get our picture with the dragon rock formation in the background. Was a fun trek to get to the location. "
Easy access from Jeju city,Many tourists visit this place. It is in 30 minutes walk from downtown. There are many fish restaurants near Dragon Head Rock.
Small rock on a small beach,Maybe be worth it at sunset if you are nearby otherwise hardly worth getting out of the car. 
Nice coastal rock formation,Is a park close to shore where you can see a rock formation that has the look of a dragon head. Also has some history associated with the area.
wonder which one the head,one of Main tourist object. You must use your image to get the head. A lot shop on the way which attract tourist to spend more time than the main object. 
Just some rocks..,It was crowded with some tour groups and there was really not special about this. It is just some rocks with one of them looking like a dragon head. Give this a miss unless you have too much time.
use your imagination and it will looj like a dragon head,"what made this place interesting besides the dragon head was the locals selling their wares. We also bought our first hallabong here. I can tell you prices are pretty much the same all over for those hallabongs. If you walk down there are a lot of ajjumas selling I think sea food, I did not walk all the way down since I did not have the right foot wear but it seemed like fresh sea food.It is a very touristy place, we just took a look few pictures and left. Its one of those places we dont have to go see again once you seen it thats good enough. But were are glad we did see it. Again I would have walked down to the ocean side but opted not to might have been interesting, so make sure you have the right footwear, it is rocky and maybe a little wet."
Imagination Required,"I read a lot about this rock before I saw it, and I tried hard to see the dragon-like figure. To be honest, it wasn't easy, but it is an interesting rock on a little piece of beach that I was happy to visit. That said, in order not to be disappointed, remember, it's just a funny shaped rock."
Quick stop off,"For us - it was a last 'must see' on Jeju Island. Our tour books featured it as a top site, so we went. We didn't have much time, and it worked (since it's near the airport) for a quick stop off. I didn't hate it - it was crowded though. Lots of tour groups, teens, etc. There were several shops nearby that were handy for our last bit of shopping. You don't need to spend a lot of time here, but the rock formation is neat and the myth behind it is interesting."
It's a rock...,It's a rock that kind of likes a dragon head. There really wasn't much else. Skip it if you you don't have time. Not worth battling the crowds to take a picture.
Your Intepretation,Cannot figure out which is the head and which direction is the dragon facing even though the local guide told us our view is the best. 
Even with the use of your imagination is it really worth making it an attraction?,"We walked past Yongdu-am rock when we were trying to find the jimjilbang that we were staying at for the night. If we had made any effort to go and see it I would have been bummed but since it was in passing it was interesting in its own manner. I can understand how it looks like a dragon and you don't need TOO much of an imagination to be able to see it but unless your interested in folklore/'the dragon' means anything to you, you won't be overly excited/impressed.If it didn't have reams of tourists and tour buses or the tourist shops all around it Im not sure I would have even stopped to take a picture.(the ladies working in the tour information centre right outside of this area speak good english and are very kind and helpful if you need directions)"
Use your imagination,"One has to use a bit more imagination to see the rock as a head of a dragon, but it is still interesting to visit, as the surrounding is charming, although is bait crowded with tourists. On a fine day, you may spot a few ""Hae-ryo"" the lady divers. The place is on every itinerary of any group tours."
What's the fuss?,"We heard about the dragon head rock and we were brought there by our tour guide. Our guide warned us to use ""a lot of imagination"" when we see the rock otherwise we will not be able to see the ""dragon"". Well she was right about that. Lots of tour agencies bring their groups there to see the rock and there are lots of little restaurants all the way along the walkway to entice the tourists. After a short walk from the carpark, there is a steep staircase you have to walk down to, in order to get to the spot to see the dragon head from the side. Even so, you're pretty far from the dragon head rock. And to me, it's clearly just a natural process where the rock gets eroded into a certain shape and in this case it's going there for this one rock only... which I wouldn't have if I were on a free and easy route."
Overrated but still a must-see,All Koreans go crazy here with photoshoots etc.  All non-Korean tourist are looking around were the excitement is all about; it is about this dragonheadshaped rock. It's located just outside the citycenter at the leftside of the big Ramada Hotel. We walked over as part of a citywalk. It's OK but not worth a separate visit but if it's included in your route it's fine.
So so,We went to visit this Dragon Rock and it put a bleak end to our Jeju trip. The rock is a beautiful artwork of nature but people seem to be taking too much advantages of it. The town nearby is full of hotel and other shops for travelers just down the street from the rock. We just couldn’t walk very near to it because the way down there is dangerous and blocked with the fence.
unique shape,they tell us very interesting stories about this dragon head rock. all the legend and believes from the local people is nice to hear. also the view from the sea is awesome
Hexagonal rocks...,"This is a spot on Jeju island that celebrates its volcanic origins. The whole place is built using wood on a cliff edge with lots of steps going up and down. The viewpoints from here show the hexagonal rocks that were formed a long, long time ago. It is a pretty place to spend some time in - you could look out into the sea and meditate, but with the constant stream of visitors, you'd rather move on."
Nice view especially during sunset,Other than the rock formation nothing much else to see or do. Can do this fairly quick in 15 mins to snap some photos and the go.
"Easy to get to, doesn't look like a dragon, though","Easy to get to, doesn't look like a dragon, though. The volcanic rock is pretty to look at, but there were a lot of people."
