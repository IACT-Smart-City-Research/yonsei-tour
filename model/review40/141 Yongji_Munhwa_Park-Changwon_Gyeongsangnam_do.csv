"Definitely worth a visit, especially at night","It’s a lovely and lively place if you wish to take a stroll, have a picnic or do some serious walking. The moving boat rides are very popular and musical dancing fountain during the night is a pretty site."
A nice little break from the hustle and bustle of Korea.,"Yongji Park is just a few blocks away from ""cafe street."" Go to Todos and get the 4 taco combo. Then bring it to Yongji park and eat it while watching the giant carp, lily-pad hopping birds, and domestic geese. "
Beautiful Yongji,"Beautiful, nice walk with park benches. Cafe only has few snacks but nice drinks. Lovely to watch the water fountain and boats at night"

Let's go for a run!,Yongji lake is beautiful. The paved path around the lake is perfect for running. The park surrounding the lake is great for a picnic. The light show is also a nice treat.
