"Great for kids of all ages, not so sure about adults.","Could barely cover half of the main exposition with our toddler. Most of the exhibits are targeted at school-age kids, but we still had lots to play with. All the information is in Korean, which was a bit of a problem, but half the time we could figure it out one way or another. Most of the exhibits are interactive and fun! Would surely come back for more if had more time... Could spend the whole day here, especially if also visiting the separate space exhibit, and planetarium, plus there's a park around all that."
One of the best science museums we have been to,"We absolutely love this science centre as it's filled with interesting exhibitions and hands-on activities for kids. Though 95% of the information was in Korean, we still had a great time and learned new things. Our children (5 and 10) especially liked the Natural History Centre and Advanced Technology exhibition hall. Too bad we were there on a rainy day so we didn't get to enjoy the outdoor area where there are spaceship, trains, playgrounds, etc. Anyhow, it's a great place to visit if you're travelling with kids and looking for something educational to do in Seoul."
Calling Dino lovers,We travelled all the way here for my 4 year old dino-obsessed son. We thought it was totally worth it! Word of warning - taxis are hard to come by so you are probably better off prebooking your ride. The main exhibit hall was great - lots of informative stuff in English. They also have separate buildings for an Insectarium (which we didn’t go to) and a Space Centre (which we did but left quickly as it was all in korean and we understood nothing). There’s a Dino park outside as well with Dino statues which my son loved taking photos of. 
Good place to go if you understand Korean,"The place was big and there were lots of exhibits, but almost all in Korean and very little English, which was a waste because the whole place looked very interesting but we couldn't really understand. My six year old boy enjoyed himself though, since he doesn't read much yet. Koreans really put alot of effort into educating their young as evident in the huge Science Museum. We also sat in for the entire Planetarium show in korean (which again, we understood nothing) but the show was nice. We didn't know there was a large foodcourt on level 2, and went to the cafe in the train outside the building for some sandwiches. We went on a public holiday (Korean Election Day) but the place wasn't really crowded. It's a nice place to visit if the weather was hot or raining, but you'll have some trouble understanding since almost everything is in korean."
Interesting museum and lots to learn,"This is my first time in my adult life to go to a national science museum, the place is large with many different sections. However it is best to go with a Korean Translator or someone who understand Korean, because most of the information is in Korean. It was fun to look around, but it will be even more wonderful to understand what is going on"
Great value,If you have young kids they will love this place. Lots to do and look at. And great value! Even though most of the displays did not have English translation we still enjoyed our day out ( was a rainy yucky day) and was very easy to get to. 
Another kids Kingdom,"Seoul, Koreans understand a lot about Kids education. this is an amazing place to experience with your people. How is life in Mars? Wanna be an astronaut? 3 to 5 hours would do."
Awesome place,"I almost skipped this place but Im so glad I didn't. It is amazing, most of the exhibits are in Korea but it doesn't matter - there is a massive Sci-Fi and Space section. You should allow atleast half a day out here"
National Gwacheon Science Museum Seoul,"We went there already twice and for children is a nice place. Many things to learn and to do and especially during spring and autumn good place to be (if fine dust in Seoul is not higher then yellow). Just recently went during the winter days and it is not recommendable because nothing you can do outside. Outside area you have huge trains, rockets, dinosaurs and many other things. Inside quite a lot about human history, space and universe and all the planets around us. Many things are also kept interactive and kids running from one to the other to try and see. Unfortunately most of explanations are in Korean only (Will check that out next time being home how is that done in our country). However newly installed electronic ticket booth does not offer English. That's poor. So try and error. At least the lady at the food court was speaking English quite well. Parking place available. Car entrance 5000 Won per car and entry fee for adult 4000/child above 7 for 2000 Won. From our point of view price performance ratio is excellent."
Good science musium,Good place to spend time with kids.Many things to learn and play.But dont expect specialize and expertized things. Good for kids.
Not great if you don't speak Korean,"My son and I were there recently and were frustrated that we couldn't really engage with the exhibits and all the hands-on activities due to 90% of the signs and instructions only being in Korean. However, if you have young kids, and they just want to run around and push buttons, I could see how it would be fun. Also many of the ""rides/simulators"" were not running the day we were there which was disappointing. On the plus side, the museum is easy to get to on subway live 4, there are lots of things to discover, there's outside space to play, climb and explore, etc. The sculpture garden is along a pretty walk, but the sculptures are nothing special.The Insectarium was okay if you want to see big insects and spiders in tiny enclosures, but a bit cheesy with the fake plants. If you like to feel bugs, it's cool. We only saw one butterfly in the tiny butterfly enclosure.And yes, it's cheap! Only 4,000 won for an adult and 2,000 for kids ($4 and $2). We didn't explore the planetarium or Space World because we don't speak Korean.My overall impression is that if you can't read Korean, don't bother...unless it's pouring rain and you can explain the science behind all the gadgets."
Worth the price but some small problems,"We spent the day there with our young kids and they absolutely loved it. They have a great children's section and the other exhibitions are high budget and interactive. However there was very little information in English. Also we arrived half an hour after opening and already the tickets for the special exhibitions and activities were all sold out. However tickets are cheap, so it was well worth it overall."
Kids heaven,"The museum is gigantic, it contains display from Spacecraft tech to natural history. I didnt make it to explore the whole display in one day, Almost half of the display info is written in korean only. Although, Wifi is available, so you can use your translator. Ticket price is really cheap, food on 2nd floor are in reasonable price and tasty too.I found subway is the most convenient way to get there, by line 1 from Seoul Station. However bus and parking area are also available. For sure, I will go back there... "
National Gwacheon Science Museum,"The museum is a wonderful place for families. There are many interactive displays and exhibits for kids to learn and play. As an adult I can say it's interesting but I wouldn't go again...it's not THAT interesting. It's about 30 minutes south of Sadang station in Seoul and located across the road from the rest of Seoul Grand Park including Seoulland, the Zoo and other sites. Taking the subway is the most convenient on weekends as everyone with a car is fighting for parking space. Exit the Seoul grand park station (line 4) exit 5 and you're right in front of the museum. Next to the ticket booth there's a basketball court. and a convenience store. Inside the museum there is a large cafeteria on the second floor...don't expect much...in fact pack a lunch. Surrounding the museum there is a lot of green space where visitors can rest or walk around.Behind the museum is the planetarium, insectarium, space world (totally not worth your time) and other outdoor exhibits. FYI, on the right wing behind the childrens playroom, there are conference halls...outside there is a smoking booth...also the bathrooms by the conference halls are exceptionally clean compared to the rest of the museum ...most likely because not too many kids go back there."
"Large indoor playground, planetarium, and a freaking rocket!","If you're looking for a free place to bring your child with an playing indoor playground and a very inexpensive planetarium, this is the place! This museum is a great place to spend your weekend afternoon, and allow your child to burn off an absorbent amount of energy.Come on down to this area just south of Seoul; parking is available and museum is accessible from the subway."
Amazing science museum,Hands down the most extensive science museum. So much to do and so much interactions with everything science.
Reserve at least Full Day,"If you bring kids (of all ages) there, prepare to spend one full day there (even if you skip the Seoul Grand Park just next to the museum). Outdoor exhibit area and the playground are worth visiting too."
So many hands on games,"Our 10, 14, and 16-year old children and I really enjoyed our time at Gwacheon. Because of MERS, it was nearly empty so we had many opportunities to try all of the hands on things that were offered. If it was much more crowded, I imagine it might not be as fun. Less than half of the displays had English translations but my kids were able to figure out most of what they were trying to teach. We only went through 2 of the 5-6 displays, not including the Planetarium. The outside has a beautiful huge playground area as well as a nicely structured outside area. I would definitely go there again especially for the reasonable price!"
"Great open space, something for everyone!",We really enjoyed our visit and the playground outside was amazing. The day we went the weather was cooled off and the kids really had a blast! *** note: planetarium has English version of shows - no one else was there so they played it in English which was helpful!Subway exit for museum leads right to eat. Easy ride on the blue line!
A Huge One-Stop To Learn About Science and History,"I went to Gwacheon Science Museum on a week day and was surprised at how lively the museum was. Because, yes, it was a weekday. Getting there was easy; I stopped at Seoul Grand Park Station, and the museum was literally just outside Exit 5. The entrance fee was very cheap for a museum with impressive and interactive exhibits. Spent 3-hours there and I only managed to visit the galleries in the main building. Personally, I enjoyed my time there and I would highly recommend solo travellers even to go to this place - I kind of lost track of time visiting each and every gallery. I wish there were more signage/exhibits in English though. But other than that, it's clean, very well maintained, has at least four kiosks/cafes, a souvenir shop, very friendly and helpful staffs, very much accessible from anywhere in Seoul - a heaven for visitors indeed."
Must come back!!!,"Love this place and will come back. However please note that it closes at about 5pm and i do not have enough time as i reaches about 2-3pm. If you are someone who loves to take photo, suggest you set as one whole day in your itinerary."
great attraction for the kids,"Despite the flurry, my kids had a great time at the Gwacheon Science Museum... The museum is so gigantic that a day tour is not enough to visit all the attractions.Great learning experience, great display, a one of a kind museum.Our only comment though was the Planetarium show, no English translation during our visit... The kids just watched and enjoyed the show :)"
"Impressive interactive exhibits, little English","The museum is very large and we'll organized. Quite an impressive expanse of interactive exhibits ranging from health/human body, to computing, to natural sciences, to ""traditional"" Korean science. By far the most impressive was the flight/space exhibits which also benefited from the most English translation. Most of the exhibits were only available in Korean, but for only $4 entry it's very good. "
Interesting,"My family of four spent half a day exploring this spacious science museum. They have quite a variety of exhibits in this museum, we have fun and enjoyed it! "
"If you have kid(7yrs~16yrs), you have to go there~!!","I have two kids (7 and 9 years old) and they like to stay there longer. It is located outskirt of Seoul and very eay to go by subway and there are many things to explore. The entry fee is around $6 and all science experiemnts are free, but you need to take tickets. My son love science and he does not wanna leave."
Interesting and amusing,"It's one of my favorite places in Seoul. I've been there twice and will probably go again.It's convenient to get there by subway, line 4, station Seoul Grand Park (the same station if you wanna see the biggest Zoo in Seoul), exit 5. Working hours 9:30-17:30, but entrance to exhibition halls until 16:30. Entrance fee 4000KRW. Many interesting exhibitions. My favorite ones are ""space and earth"" and dinosaurs, fossils, forest corner with stuffed animals and small aquarium. Try typhoon room and brain car races, it's fun. Food court and souvenirs shop are there too. The main drawback is that very little information is available in english. And though many things are understandable from pictures and videos the museum will be much more attractive for tourists if the administration gives some efforts to provide english descriptions for exhibitions and demonstrations like it is made in similar Science Museum in Singapore."
Average,"There are only two floors of exhibits, some with English translation, some without. Many exhibits are interactive but not very exciting. Give it a miss ...."
