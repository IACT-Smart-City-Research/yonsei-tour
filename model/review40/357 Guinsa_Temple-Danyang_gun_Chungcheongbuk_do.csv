Worth the trip,"Took a bus from Danyang bus terminal that went straight to the bottom of the temple. (3,500 won) there's a slope that leads you up to the temple. The main temple hall is the last one, behind a modern looking temple hall with an air conditioned 1st floor. There's also a trail that leads you up to the grave of a famous monk. The trail has plenty of steps and took me about 30min. The lunch service starts at 11.30am, pretty decent vegetarian food. Do take note you have to finish the food on your plate as to prevent food wastage."
Bring your walking/hiking shoes!,One of the best views from the main plaza (at the top) in all of Korea. But you will work for it! Our guide told us that it's one of the newer temples because they are adding on all the time. Beautiful architecture. At the bottom of the hill there are shops and places to eat. Don't forget to visit the Buddhist museum as well. A must see.
Hike but worth it,"I was lucky enough to have a friend drive me up to the temple. We parked and took a shuttle part way up. You will have a hike the rest of the way to the temple and up through the grounds. It is all on an incline. The grounds are beautiful and of you made it up you should go all the way to the top. You will have to hike back down. There is a shuttle bus from Danyang. If you go to the tourist office in Danyang, the gentleman is very helpful and speaks English. He will give you a bus schedule. "
Not your average Korean temple ,"I’ve been to many temples in Korea. Most of them start to look the same. However this one felt like it was in another country. It felt like a scene from a movie set in Nepal or India. I drove there, and parking was 3,000won. But I saw there was a bus terminal which would cut out most of the walking which is not too different but it is straight up with few flat parts. It was a good trip. I’d recommend going at lunch or dinner time as meals I heard were free. All vegetarian. Lunch is 11:30- 14:00 if I remember correctly and dinner starts at 17:30 If you do visit here try to make sure to add other attractions in the town to visit as this will be maybe 1 or 2 hours at most.

Hard Climb to Reach the Top Temple - But Worth It,"We took the express bus from Danyang (3000 Won - buy the ticket in the bus station next to the bridge- get the timetable from the tourist office on the Gosu cave side of the bridge). The ride to the temple was good - following and crossing the river. The express bus stops at the bottom of the temple slope (closer to the temple than the main car park). Its quite a steep climb but there's plenty of interest to look at while you catch your breath - just keep going up the slope. You can pick up a small brochure on the different buildings on the way up. The Daejosajeon (at the top) is fantastic with a very high roof interior and sitting in a large square with a view down to the other buildings.We walked back down to the main car park (where the temple museum is) and walked on about 3km downhill to visit Ondal tourist park (through Guinsa carpark, downhill towards Yeongchun at a turn-off to the left you can see a green arch which is the entrance to the park). The park is a film set which is good fun - you can sit on the emperors throne and go in some of the houses, but the main attraction is the cave - less spectacular than Gosu, but with some small passages and (when we went) lots of water dripping down - they give you a hard hat. You can get the local bus back by going out of the entrance and crossing the road. The timetable is up in the bus stop."
Fantastic setting for the temple,"Before we came to Korea we planned on visiting this marvelous temple complex that is situated in a valley between two mountain ranges. The bus leaves regularly from Danyang bus terminal and takes about 30 minutes. From the car park the road/path winds its way uphill and believe me it is quite a climb to the top of the complex. There are probably about 50 buildings including the Temple Homestay, the Great Teachers Hall, the four Heavenly Kings Gate with the statues of the four kings. We enjoyed a free lunch which tasted surprisingly good. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are served to all visitors and two nuns were standing by the path ushering everyone in. There is a donation box to drop a few notes in. The religion here is a branch of Buddhism that disappeared for 500 years. In the mid 20th century a Korean monk called Taegakkuksu Euicheon built a three room native temple and ten years later work started on the buildings you see today. It is an enormous complex and you must not miss this during your travels.The famous monk died some years ago and his grave is at the top of the mountain and from the Great Teachers hall there is a trail on the right that lads to this wonderful spot. It takes about 45 minutes and there are over 800 steps in the way up.The kitchen can serve up to 40,000 meals a day."
Beautiful; zen and sportive ,Do not forget to reach the top to see the main plaza and temple This place is a must see and certainly the only temple I would consider of I wanted to stay overnight 
amazing!,"amazing temple located up in the hills which were constructed such that nature is preserved without causing much disruption as possible. Amazing view at the top of most highest situated building. feel at aw-ed at the beauty of the place, both the temple building as well as the nature surrounding it. need to walk up to the temple for about 20 minutes. some with steeper slopes but the road is easy to walk for a fit and healthy individual. the view in autumn was just breathtaking!"
Glad to see the genuine temple in the forest,"This is the headquarters of Cheontaejong(one branch of Korean Buddhism) having huge buildings in the forest. Great place to visit if you're looking for a peace.- 20~30 km away from the center of Danyang. Probably further than most other sites to visit.- Quiet and peaceful. I saw almost no tourists when I visited.- The buildings are huge. But, not that many. The area didn't feel not so large because buildings are incredibly big.- The most beautiful hall is the main hall on top of the hill.- It's a continuous hill from the entrance to the main hall. But, really easy comparing to other experiences in Danyang.- The harmony with autumn foliage is so scenic in October.- They provide free meals for visitors. And a temple stay is also available.- At the bus stop which is almost like a bus terminal, there's a bus to Seoul. Travelers may set this site as the last destination in Danyang."
"Best Temple in Korea, Hands Down!",Guinsa Temple was an absolutely amazing and unforgettable experience. I have traveled all throughout Korea over the last two years and this temple is by far the most unique one I have seen. The multi-level complex is overwhelming intricate and stunningly beautiful. Just look at my photos and you'll see for yourself!
Unique temple that is easy to get to,"While most Korean temple structures are not multi-levels, many of the structures here were three or four floors high which looked cool from a distance but looked just like any modern building up close. It was a very steep uphill walk for about two kilometers to get to the main structure, Daejo-sajeon (which houses the golden image of Guinsa’s patriarchical figure Sangwol Wongak) but there are couple of gates and numerous structures and pagodas on the way to check out. While a unique complex, it was not one of the more scenic Korean temples."
Guinsa Temple,"Awesome temple! Be prepared to hike up the hill to see it though. It's not that far, but is a bit steep and it takes a good thirty minutes to walk up to the temple from the lower parking area. This place is, amazingly, built nestled into a very steep mountain valley. If you're in the Danyang area it'd be a shame not to go and see this temple."
stunning ,"I'll start with the drive to get it: it is scenic and really beautiful. The temple is far from everything but easily accessible by car.To get to the top temple, you will be walking uphill amd climbing steps for the better part of 15/20 minutes. The buildings are stunning and the view breathtaking. I got told off by a monk so in case you can't read the korean signposts: when you get to the temple use the side steps to enter (not the middle) and have socks on. Then yiu shouldn't get told off :).Really worth you time if you are in this part of Korea."
Unforgettable!,"I start my review with a warning: This is a STEEP climb. So steep, in fact, that I ended up with a mild calf strain on the way down the hill. With that in mind, this might not be the ideal attraction for families with small children, babies in prams, or people in stiletto heels. That being said, the view was so worth the climb! The temple is breathtaking, and the view down into the valley was just incredible. I highly, highly recommend this tour for anyone who feels up to the climb!"
"Takes your breath away, literally!","Very easy,to locate and ample parking for a modest 3,000 Korean Won. There is a huge building in the car park, but the nest is yet to come. Be prepared for a hard climb, the Korean pensioners can do it, then so can you!!! 800m of stiff walking up a road with an average incline of I guess 40%. As you round the corner, you get a peek of a building, then another and another and finally you top out at the golden building! All I can say is those monks must be fit!!! Well worth the visit and you can also arrange to do a templestay, I may even go for one and ditch the iphone for a few days!!!!"
beautiful temple,"I spend nice time in the temple, the are is big. It is worth to see. Got there with the bus. I brought with me lots of amazing photos, probably spring is good time to go there..."
Beautiful temple - hard walking,"구인사 or Guinsa temple is a very unique experience for you who wants to discover the way of living side by side with Mother Nature. The temple are is huge and have many different temples to visit. I was lucky to have a tempelstay for 2 nights and we made our own bibimbab (비빔밥) in silence as the monks does it, we did the 108 bows, we woke up early to join the morning ceremony at 4 am, we had a tea ceremony with the head monk and we walked for many hours for meditation - it's a great experience to empty your mind and get away from the daily stress. I love it! But you need to be in good health, because you're gonna walk a lot and it feels like hiking! ^^"
"Nice place, hard walking","We got to Guinsa Temple on our way from Seoul to Busan. No problems to find it if you have good Navigator (we took one from car rental office).The parking spot (3000 KRW) is 1,4km from the gates to Temple. The staff at parking told us ""to walk"". I guess that there is a shuttle as we've seen some minivans going there and back. Anywhere you'd better be prepared to go up and up and up. The place itself is very calm, not touristy, birds singing around. Nice architecture and photospots. You can spend there a couple of hours (if not planning to stay overnight or to have a lunch which is provided for free twice a day).We found an easy way to get to the highest building - 1) you can walk up on the hill or 2) use an elevator to 7th floor in the main and modern building (you will not miss it). Very good views to mountains and valley from that point.We are glad that we've visited this place. Especially for the fact that there were no crowds and tourist groups."
"Huge, amazing temple","We spent a good half day at this temple complex, which is huge (huge!) and tranquil at the same time. The location is amazing, in a narrow valley in Sobaek Mountains. We took a bus in Danyang (for 3.300 Won) that took us to the entrance directly (you could even take a small shuttle bus to take you further in the complex, but that really isn't necessary). The temple complex consists of many buildings, most of which you are quite free to explore. By following narrow lanes and stairs, you gradually climb up to the topmost temple building (or even further to the founder's tomb). Although the buildings are all quite new, we had an awesome day, including a free (vegetarian) lunch!"
Remarkable temple complex,"N37°02.060' E128°28.918' Wedged into a tranquil valley northeast of Danyang with steep, forested slopes on either side, Guinsa is one of Korea's more remarkable temple complexes. The gold-roofed buildings are as elaborate and hard to find anywhere else, replacing the usual elegant restraint by a desire to show off. We understood that this was the strategy of a monk in 1945 to revive the almost extinct Buddhist Cheontae sect, once the most powerful in the country with nowadays 2 million members. Well over one thousand monks may reside here at any one time. The buildings swarm up the valley and connect in unlikely ways, with alleys and bridges crisscrossing like the dragons depicted around the complex. Sometimes it is very steep. The communal kitchen serves free vegetarian meals for more than two thousand people any day. This meal was delicious and we donated voluntarily for it. Outside are masses of gimchi pots for making dinner. During our visit in August 2014, almost all monks were old-age women. In their living quarters the wooden floor resembles a parking lot with each space assigned a unique number. Each monk sleeps, lives and prays in his/her parking space or attends pray service in another hall. We did not continuing on the uphill path to the well-tended gravesite of the monk, but descended down to absorb a completely different view of the temple buildings."
"Nice, for two houres","Nice temple, not very special (the buildings are nice, but you're only allowed to visit a few) free entrance and lunch (you have to finish your meal). Maby it's more fun if you're able to do a temple stay but that's only twich a month. "
"The Biggest and The Most Interesting Temple in South Korea""","I came here with a friend of mine and we were both amazed of the size and the environment at the temple complex. We still regret we didn't have enough time to do a temple stay. But, we will definitely return and do it one day."
One of the biggest traditional Temples,It is a must see place. It is a huge building complex with a very spiritual ambience. You have to walk if you miss the bus going up to the mountain. It is not an easy task but it worths the effort. Buildings are beautifully painted and the bells on the corners of the roofs sometimes rings when the wind blows. You cannot take a picture inside the temples which has mindblowing details. 
Temple stay experience was fantastic,"So we stayed here for one night as part of the temple stay programme. You actually follow a similar schedule to the monks which includes getting up at 3am for the morning ceremony. It was an incredibly worthwhile experience. The monks that accompanied us where chatty, friendly and very open and happy to share. The temple itself is a stunning complex and should not be missed. Being there with the autumn leaves made it an especially memorable trip. I would encourage everyone to visit Guinsa! :-)"
Most impressive temple ever seen in Korea,"It is like a city, you go up and up and will find so many beautiful spots. The buildings are bigger (2-,3- or 4-storey) than in other temples but perfect arranged in the landscape. Best season in Spring or Autumn."
Temple suspended in sapce and time,Danyang is a very famous place around Korea because of the beautiful mountain landscape. Suspended on the top a valley you will find the Guinsa temple (regular bus from Danyang). Enjoy the calm and feel the serenity. Meet monks for small discussion. Walk around all the buildings.
Lovely and interesting temple to visit,"Set in an ascending valley, the temple building wind up back and forth (or side to side) in the valley connected with walkways and bridges. Go right to the top for the best views and most dramatic temples. Free meals for visitors, but it's simple vege temple foods. Very interesting however as many visit and it's busy most of the time. Much more visually dramatic than many Korean temples, but it is very popular because of it's location and it's importance as the head temple of this Buddhist sect. Can book a templestay via internet or phone: W40,000 for 1 person/1 night and they have this twice a month. "
