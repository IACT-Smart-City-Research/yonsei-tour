Beautiful buildings,A bit far from the city center. Nice view during spring season. This place is less crowded compared to Ewha University but might also because of we went there in the morning. Suggested to go early morning to avoid crowd.
"Not worth the visit, except for cherry-blossom season","The buildings in the campus are beautiful but in terms of architecture, they are only mocking renaissance-style, like those you would see at the amusement parks. But this campus is packed with visitors during the cherry blossom season. Located a little far from the center. If you are in a tight schedule, I do not see why you must visit this place."
Kyunghee University Hall,"It is an European church style building outside but inside more of a theatre hall. There are two floors, first floor bigger with a stage in the front middle, second floor half size the first floor. Toilets are in each side of hall....left for ladys and right for gents. Parking space outside quit big enough for tens of buses."
Good scenery on spring and autum,"The campus has a really nice view on spring and autumn. Not only the students, everyone can come here to enjoy the scenery, take photos (even the pre wedding photos), or picnic with friends. The only disappointment is that there were too many people on spring and autumn so I couldn’t enjoy the scenery. "
"Worth of visit, especially when semester is started","Campus is stunningly beautiful at cherry blossom time! Apart of that buildings itself and area are nice to explore. Main adventure is definitely Korean students, how they live their university life:)"
Great cherry blossom scenery among nice archetecture,"It's a great place to see tons of cherry blossom among many nice architecture buildings around the campus. You should come around early of April (may be early of 2nd week) to see the full bloom. PS. It's a university campus, so please keep quiet while walking around."
What planet is this place on?,"This campus has a weird, eclectic mix of architectural styles. There is almost every style of large classical, university-style Western building all jammed into one space. Walk past all of these places and BOOM there is a replica of Notre Dame. Sacre bleu!"
Better to visit here during Spring,"One of my friends attended school here so I decided to come here for a look. The campus was surrounded by trees and I had a nice walk around the campus. The architecture for two of the buildings were impressive. Overall, the campus is ok. I think visiting during Spring will be better since you can look at cherry blossoms as well."
Good architecture,"At first i thought I just touchdown the Whitehouse of USA. But it was just a main building of this university. I was really amazed bcs the modern and classic architecture really catch my camera eye. Lol. Surrounded by many of pretty trees, and yeah who doesnt know Kyuhyun? He graduated from this university lol"
Impressive European style campus buildings,"Kyung Hee University is not a hot tourist spot but is known for its European style buildings and cherry blossoms. I went there in early April, 2017. Unfortunately the flowering time was some 2 weeks late due to cold weather. However I had a good time looking at the nice buildings and a chance to meet some students for photos. It is quite easy to go there. Just take Line 1 subway to station #123 (Hoegi) and there is a shuttle bus going directly to the University campus (4 stops). It was late afternoon so I had some nice pictures taken. Missed the cherry blossoms but the trip was worthwhile. (Just not sure why the University is listed as a restaurant on Tripadvisor.)"
One of the best place to see Cherry Blossom,"Kyunghee University is famous for viewing Cherry Blossom. We went on a weekday, already seen tour group and local grade students tour chinning for the Cherry blossom viewing. Nice campus. Cherry blossom is nice too. Another place for cherry blossom is Nami island and park near Gimpo airport too. "
굿,Amazingly beautiful university campus for all four seasons! Worth to visit this university although littlebit far from the center of Seoul.
Superb atmosphere ,It's like some tourist place. We went in spring. Place looks so great. Trees are awesome. We don't how it is in other season. Architecture is also too good.
Kyunghee University ,"I wet to this university on weekend ,there were not many people here just some pre-college students like me.I walked around in the campus and took a look with the sight.As a famous university in South Korea,Kyunghee University is not good like it's reputation.Bulidings are little old and the campus is little dirty too.With a normal library,this kyunghee such like a normal school,the biggest difference may be is Kyunghee university has it's own kindergarten and middle school.Anyway you can study here but without much excellent things."
Looks like a park,The university Architecture impresses by its architecture and scale. It is nice place not just for study but also for walk or picnic. 
nice place to study,beautiful grounds for the university - including some great landmarks to take pics with. The students and professors here were very welcoming and friendly
Stunning Building,"Travel to Seoul this year April, simply pass by this University and impressed with 3 main huge buildings. Very Europe style and very beautiful with the flowers (Spring Season). Transport - MRT to Hoegi station (123 / K118) exit 1, took Green bus Number 01 to the last station Kyung Hee University (bus fee is free)."
Beautiful in April!,Kynghee University is famous for its beautiful buildings and trees!Definetly go there in the spring around 13-20th of April and hopefully you can see the beautiful cherry blossoms. The campus is sprawling with tons of affordable restaurants and other things for students to enjoy!
Curious about Korean uni life?,I've visited KyungHee Uni located Hoegi Station in Seoul. Campus was beautiful and you can have best PAJEON near there. You can see korean uni life style it was quiet nice experience. 
my current university!,i love studying here on this campus as it reminds me of a big park with hideaways and european style statues... especially worth seeing in the summer! can't wait to experience it through winter when everything will be covered in white...
Auslandssemester,I spend the spring semester 2014 at the Kyung hee university. Really beautiful Campus especially during the cherry blossom! 
Great University,I was studying there as an exchange student and I am really happy that I have ever studied there.. The university is really big and awesome especially when the cherry blossom season is coming. Pink color is everywhere as Kyung Hee is one of the best places to go when cherry blossom season comes.
Wished I was studying here...,"Looking at the universities grounds, I wished I was a student there. The university was made up of several buildings that were gorgeous in their own right. The main attraction took some effort getting to, as it involves ""hiking"" up a almost 45* degree slope, but when u get to the top, the view is all worth it . ^^"
