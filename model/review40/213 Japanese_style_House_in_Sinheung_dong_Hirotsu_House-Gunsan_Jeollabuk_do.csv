Interesting old Japanese style house,It's just old Japanese style house with many visitors. I stop to think why this place is so popular. Maybe this house has sad history of Japanese colonial era in Korea.
Something a little different ,It is something a little different right in the center of the city. Seems to be very well preserved. It's winter through probably very beautiful in summer with everything in bloom and such. Still a lot of people wandering around.
Not much to see,It's kind of small and there isn't much to see but it's interesting to see the architecture. It only took about 20 mins to see the whole thing. 
so...so,"It looked exactly same as the photos. Although it was possible to see the details, the whole experience was not fascinating. "
Japanese-Style House Village in Kunsan,"There are many japanese-style houses in this area which have been well-preserved. Many travellers, young couples very often, come to see to feel and see the era of Japanese-ruled era when their parents lived. It is very good to take pictures here."
Miraculous survivor in the modern era,"This house is absolutely beautiful and well worth seeing, especially since so little residential architecture in the Japanese style that was built between 1910 and 1945 has survived into the modern era. For a short time you can imagine that you are in Japan. Unfortunately, there is very little explanatory information in English, and there don't seem to be any guided tours (although I could be wrong). If you could go inside, I would give it five stars, but you can't."
It feels like you are in Japan,"It was a nice experience to visit this old Japanese house. Take a look at the structure! Even though it is a Japanese styled house, it has ondol system ( Korean heating system ) too on it! I would love to visit this place again"
calm,quiet nice experience. you get a feeling of calmness and quiet which is nice to the busy city of gunsan
Take your shoes off and wander around,This well-built spacious house is worth a visit. Take a look at the structure and the artistic design of the garden. A special place. 
Hirotsu House - Legacy of Japanese Colonialism,"Gunsan is not really on anyone's tourist map. Frankly, there is not much to see here. However, it should be noted that Gunsan above else provides the inquisitive visitor with a plethora of historical sites related to the Japanese colonial period (1910-1945). The Old Gunsan Customs House and Donguksa Temple both in addition to Hirotsu House, are perhaps some of the best preserved buildings from that period. To provide clarity, I am not celebrating the Japanese colonial period, but it is without question a significant era of Korean history. Gunsan became a key port for Japan during the early 20th century. Gunsan today is rather sleepy compared to the role it played during Japanese control of Korea.Hirotsu House is an excellent example of a Japanese merchant home built during this period. The structure and compound are well-preserved. I commend the caretakers for preserving the structure despite ambivalent attitudes throughout Korea toward the preservation of ANY Japanese buildings. The garden is pleasant, and the woodwork is of high quality. Taken together with several other Japanese built properties in Gunsan, one begins to get a real sense of this port city under Japanese rule."
