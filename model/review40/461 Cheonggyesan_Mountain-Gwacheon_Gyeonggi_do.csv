Steep climb,"Quite a steep climb, although all good paths or steps. Very little to see apart from trees until you get to the very top - you'll know when you get there! It is a tough climb!"
Lovely Nature Near the City,"We access the trails from the Gwacheon side and it's fairly quiet without large crowds. The trails up the mountain are easy to follow (but still leave me huffing and puffing) and for those looking for a leisurely outing or picnic, the boardwalks along the base of the mountain are handy. My kids love going and it's a great family outing."
One of the best views of Seoul city,"Easy hike that you can reach from the subway, and superb view if you go on a relatively light fog/smog day. Not excessively steep but is tiresome for those not in hiking shape. Only requires sport shoes or hiking boots ... no other special equipment required, though you will see some Koreans outfitted looking like they are preparing for an Everest climb!"
Most convenient hike within Seoul,"This is one of several hiking trails within Seoul and I really enjoyed it as it wasn't too difficult but still more than just a stroll in the park so it does get your heart rate up if you are looking for some exercise.The hike to the top doesn't take all that long (less than 2 hours) but I went on a weekend and the trail was very crowded. I'd suggest trying a weekday hike if possible to avoid the crowds.There are numbers hiking apparel stores at the base of the mountain ranging from mid to high end and they carry any kind of clothing one would need for hiking. Actually I found the prices in the store a bit cheaper than the ones in downtown Seoul.Overall a nice energetic walk up a mountain if you are into hiking and are not that experienced. Again, very convenient and is reachable by public subway."
"If you live in Gangnam, best choice.","Maybe you are not that good in Korean yet, (if you are good in Korean, you don't need to use a tripadvisor.)so I'll give you some tips.First Chunggae Mt is the best one in Gangnam and Bundang.Maebong is fabulous and Mangyungdae is wonderful too. And there is s Us army troop in this Mt, so you can meet some Amercian who can help you.After you finish your trekking, you may go to the Hansoban, which id a Korean restaurant that you can eat a delicious course menu in a reasonable price.Cheap and yummy, I reccomend it strongly, but if you can eat some spicy food It will be a terrible choice for you."
