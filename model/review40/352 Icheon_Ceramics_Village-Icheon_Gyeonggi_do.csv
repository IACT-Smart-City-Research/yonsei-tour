A ceramic Mecca!,"I visited the village as part of an18 day Pottery tour for potters. The village has over a hundred ceramic shops. Some are kitchy low end pottery but many are of a high level of quality. There are Master Potters with permanent studios located on the village site and their work is something to behold even if the price is out of your budget. That said, all the pottery for sale is easily worth the price listed. Sadly many might think some prices to be overpriced but if you ever produced hand thrown pottery you will know the number of hours put into each piece and the many years to acquire the degree of skill to pull off such beautiful work. Icheon by the way is the original location where Celedon Pottery began and due to the unique clay in the region it is the only place where you can find true Celedon."
Visit Baek Cheon Ceramic and ask for a demonstration,"Baek Cheon Ceramic was our first stop. We didnâ€™t find anything in the store front, but when Baek Cheon gave us a demonstration, our eyes suddenly opened to a world of wonder and beauty. Also, if you find a piece that is not yet glazed, he will ship it to you. Such a great host. Thank for giving us your time and artistry. After that, we went to the Icheon Ceramics Village. Be prepared for pay a little cash if you like shopping. Great experience! Will go there again. A must-visit!!!"
Good Pottery Class for Ladies Day Out,"My teenage sister and I decided to try and learn a little bit of Korean pottery so we tried out the pottery class here. It's all very basic. There's a small demonstration with the pottery wheel and a brief talk on the history of Korean pottery and their kilns. Then we get some mounds of clay and were free to play around and make our own ""pottery"" crafts.I wanted to try out the wheel but there wasn't anything but the demo. So we sat at our tables and made whatever we wanted. My sister and I made small jewelry boxes and we saw a lot of other women enjoy making mini sculptures and molds too. Afterwards, they take whatever you made and fire it up in the kiln and have delivery services available that you prepay if interested. But I wasn't about to pay over 50+ bucks of international delivery charges for something I made on a whim.But the experience itself wasn't half bad. I think this class would be great for family of younger teens but not so much on children younger than that. But the more I think about it, this class and trip itself may be good for ladies day out half trips. Also, the gift shop carries ceramics that are indeed beautiful pieces but they are pricey. So watch out before purchasing. Overall, it was pretty okay. But if you have other places to be, you can skip."
Icheon Ceramic Village ,Icheon Ceramic Village is a hour away from Seoul downtown. The place is nice for a half day or day trip. Not recommended with very small children. However many shops with quite some ceramic stuff. Big small cheap expensice. One beautiful vase hit our eyes but the prices.was a bit excessive LOL Just 20 Mill Won is not our budget. The girls may like this place for look around. But be informed that you will probably not find white porcelain espacially plates. Thats the wrong place. 
Incheon Pottery Class (Han Cheon Pottery),"Han Cheon Pottey is owned by a pottery Master Craft, who was being awarded ""Master Hand"" by the President in 2013. [if this was what I understand correctly..]My mother, my 10-year old son and myself booked a 1 day tour to this Incheon Pottery Village, where we get to make our own simple item n get to draw on pre-made cups as well..For people who like crafts, this is quite an interesting experience. Most importantly, our English guide - Mr Brian Kim is a polite n kind soul. My mother could not bend her knees to eat with traditional Korean sitting (on ground) thus Brian tried his best to make quite a few phone calls for queries n brought us to else where with tables n chairs. "
Great for a ladies trip. ,"This is a beautiful place to make, learn about, buy, or look at korean ceramics. If you book ahead, you can make them. Seeing the traditional kiln was hot., making art was great. There are several shops and a coffeeshop. Lots of ceramic statuary for photos. Outside in the parking lot there is a traditional eatery. To the right of the entrance there is a park with a Buddhist temple, walking paths, river boat rides, etc. mid October and late spring is a beautiful time to go here. "
Ceramic Lovers' Village!,"We stopped at Icheon Ceramic Village to shop and look at ceramics. Many of the shops had similar items for sale. Yet, each had their own styles and different things for sale. I wasn't that impressed, but, perhaps, we didn't see enough as it was late in the day. Shopping in Insadong, we saw similar tea sets for sale for slightly less than in Icheon, so, I'm guessing that you need to be careful while shopping.  Several days later, my husband and I went to a Tea Exhibit at COEX Mall that had top rated Korean ceramic artisans and displays of their art and ceramic. Now, those ceramics impressed me! Some displays were from private art galleries. The ceramics were truly art pieces and some were made by Korea's Living Treasures.  "
Celadon Master Hand at work,"Took standard tour to Icheon Ceramic Village to see how they make celadon ceramics. Guide spoke excellent English; 1 hr from COEX to the village. Which is quite substantial. We visited two master hands, one of whom demonstrated throwing a large pot. The beautiful creamy light green is a favorite of mine; the process of making it fascinating. Total 4 hours. included ransport for guide, 2 tourists and driver. Was able to return to the hotel and catch a 5pm flight out of Incheon. Worked beautifully in my tight schedule."
A trip highlight!,"While the pottery village may not be for everyone, it did provide my husband and I with a deeper understanding of Korean culture! We were there on a snowy afternoon in January. My husband and I do not speak or understand Korean, and we know only what we read on the internet on the way to the village about pottery. We arrived late in the afternoon, visiting about ten shops surrounding a central circle drive. To the naive, the display of pottery was amazing! We were kindly greeted by all the artisans and merchants! After looking at many pieces of pottery (yes, most, but not all, were mass produced), we purchased a beautiful handmade pot/vase as a memento of our experience in Korea. The artist offered us tea, took us to the back of his studio to watch his wife carving on a vase, and showed us the fire shooting put of his blazing hot kiln! Even though we did not speak the same language, we sat around their little stove with lively animation sipping tart plum tea on a blustery day! What a treat!One other artist offered us tea as well, and another ALSO took us to her studio and showed us her process of making cedalon--- and gave is a ""cash"" discount on a vase!What I experienced here was about much more than pottery! While I suspect my husband came at the ""right"" time, I would encourage any curious travelers to stop and see the magic! This was a trip highlight for us both."
In search of celedon,"Having experienced the high price of Korean celedon in Seoul, we boarded the bus for Icheon in search of quality and reasonable prices. Of the many store fronts in the village only one fit our particular celedon search we were looking for. The store had exactly what we were looking for and at a very reasonable price. The village was a charming place with many things to look at and experience. The kilns were not operating on the day of the visit but it would be worthwhile to make an appointment with a master potter to experience the ceramic process. After the visit we walked across the busy highway to have lunch in one of Icheon's famous ""rice restaurants."" The prices were reasonable and the meal was huge. We stopped counting the side dishes at 27 and gave up counting to attempt to finish the meal."
Skip it.,"Although I love tripadvisor and always use it when traveling, this is where it falls short--in reaching specialized communities. I am a designer and know a fair amount about furniture and ceramics. Icheon has mass-produced ceramics that will not appeal to you if you are a designer or have some design knowledge or are in other creative fields. "
Wander and wonder,"We spent almost five hours wandering around looking at all the different ceramics shops and the kilns and the different work on display. A beautiful sunny day helped and you can stop and have a coffee and explore all the different outlets. If you buy anything, they will ship it back for you and it is not really that expensive (compared to British postal charges.....)"
Great Attraction for Children,"Icheon's Ceramics Village offers visitors a chance to explore the diverse and unique items made using ceramics. Seeing how the ceramics are made with the numerous kilns within the village is certainly a highlight. For those who love to do hands-on activities you will be happy to make your own pottery creation. The facility will even mail it to you after its been baked in the kiln. Offcourse there is a charge to this, but the option of mailing it overseas is a plus for families who like soveniers.I visited Icheon Ceramic Village on a free field trip organized by Yonsei University during my studies in Korea. This is not my ""type"" of attraction, but I did have a very nice time trying my hand at pottery."
