Sorae Fish Market in Incheon,"Ther is a famous traditional fish market and a wharf connected to the sea. You can see several anglers catching fish around there. You can enjoy fresh raw fish there. If you want to eat it, just buy fresh fish from a fishmonger, get it to the fish center, then a lady working there prepares it as sashimi with a little side dishes."
Great market,"Definitely worth the visit. Busy market full of fresh, dried and cooked seafood. Just don't ask what I ate... as there is absolutely no English in signs, your best bet is to point."
Must Visit,"If your going to south Korea you have to stop in Incheon for a day or 2 and experience the Sorae pogu fish market. It's a must see and must eat place. See the pics I posted to get a taste of this seafood carnival.While visiting Incheon check out the Polo Tourist Hotel, excellent hotel top quality, highly recommended"
lively local fish market!,"We had about half day at Incheon for transit so we decided to visit this local fish market. It was GOOD choice!You find many fish shops and restaurants. You pick fish at shop, ask them to make it sashimi ( raw fish) and bring it to restaurant and eat. Such fun!! Not only sashimi but you can enjoy full of fish... start from raw, then to hot kimchi soup! Many people were enjoying picnic... they eat outside what they buy at market. We saw many cyclists eating here, it seems an hour or so ride fom city centre of Seoul so many seem to come here by bike and enjoy good fresh seafood lunch. Such a good idea!!The thing is... it's not that simple to come here from Incheon AP. We took bus to a certain train station and then reached Soraepogu station, where the market is. Kindly a clerk at Incheon AP tourist office advised us how to get here so you can ask them, too."
