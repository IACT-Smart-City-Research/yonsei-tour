How to get from Seoul to the Royal Tombs of Joseon,"This is not a usual spot frequented by foreign tourists. Get on to the green subway line 2, stop at Gang-Byeon, there is a bus station cross the street, take the bus depart for Yeong-Mol, it should be at platform 19 or 20. The 2 hours journey will bring you to the sleepy town, once there take the local bus outside the station for a 2 km ride to the site Jangneung. Suggest to walk, it's pleasant, and the signage is easy enough to understand anyway."

He became King only 12 years old, and he was expelled to Yeongwol by his uncle at 14 years old. He have live in Yeongwol Cheongnyeongpo in 3 years, and at the age of 17, he was killed by his uncle. Jangneung was Danjong's tomb with misfortune. There was small than ohter King's tomb. Overall, because the size of tomb was small, there was good for walking with scenery. There was a museum of Danjong and Sayuksin( 6 people have loyalty for Danjong )."
