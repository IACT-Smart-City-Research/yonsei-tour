Beautiful walk on a beautiful day ,Loved the greeneries and the mountain far away. Clean air and perfect for long walks. The restaurants outside the parks are great too. 
A beautiful park,"A beautiful grand park,where Is possible to visit a nice zoo for childrens,a great arboretum,to read books in a free library, and long walking in the green.In spring there are amazing cherry blossom,an unique event."
인천이라면 인천대공원,봄에는 꽃이 피니까 꼭 돗자리를 들고 가세요~! 돗자리에 누워서 가지고 온 음식을 먹고 쉬면 됩니다. 뒤에 소래산 관모산 등 크고 작은 산들이 있어요. 만약 당신이 인천에 왔다면 여기야말로 꼭 들려야 할 공원입니다 여기 안가면 인천 안가본거임 you can't say i've been to incheon if you never been to this park. 
Best park of the area,"Incheon grand park, a free park, is huge and have A LOT to offers!You have some botanical area, lakes, greenhouses, mountains...I recommend you to go almost at the end of the park, and on the right, a bit hidden you have a path going to the top of the mountain and you reach a charming pavilion. You can see it from almost anywhere in the park."
"Vivid Colors in Spring, Summer, and Fall!",Been here on 3 seasons and they are amazingly beautiful in different ways. Pink on Spring because of the cherry blossoms but it only lasts for few weeks. Vibrant on Summer but too hot for me to stroll on unshaded areas. Sunset colors on Fall! I dislike winter so we haven't tried it. We were able to set-up our tent in an area with other families. We read while kids take a nap.
Incheon Grand Park,"This is a beautiful park established by the city of Incheon. There are both bike paths and pedestrian walkways. Families are able to camp there in tents already set up. There are wonderful panoramic views of the skyline and hills. A cooling steam full of fish runs through the park that make for a tranquil walk. The larger pond is a place where one can sit and rest overlooking the vast landscape of many varied plants, tree, and flowers. There is a book nook on the plaza where books can be had for free."
Great park for the whole family!,"We have experienced this park in Summer and now Winter. We look forward to visiting during the Spring and Fall this year for cherry blossoms and fall colors.This is a large park with a beautiful rose garden in full bloom when we visited early Summer. The lake (artificial?) was wonderful to work along with tall trees lining the way. In Winter, we discovered snow sledding in the park which our young boys loved! The slopes were gentle enough for young thrill seekers and attendants were kind and warm.The one negative is the so called zoo. Don't expect much especially if you compare that to the one in Seoul Grand Park. However as someone living just 30 minutes away, this is a must go for kids to run wild and have fun."
High ground view of invasion landing sites.,We took a shuttle up the hill to have a high ground overview of the various invasion landing sights. It has completely changed from the time of the invasion.
a memorable place for Incheoners,"추억의 장소 인천 대공원, 인천에서 태어나고 자란 분들은 다 알죠. I've lived in Incheon since I was born, so for me and other Incheoners around my age, this place is definitely a memorable and unforgettable place. when I was in kindergarten, elementary school and even in high school, we used to have a picnic at this park. oh, and also with my family too. still you might be able to see many children having a picnic here."
Must See When in Incheon,It was spring when we visited the Grand Incheon park. It was a little late but our Korean friends insisted on visiting this park so we could at least see some sites in Incheon as opposed to just staying overnight in hotel. There were cherry blossoms all over the park. It was chilly that evening but I could imagine the place is a a beauty to see day time. There was a man made lagoon and I am sure this is a picture perfect place. 
To visit ad perfect for a run,"Brilliant park just between modern and traditional. You have plenty of modern sculptures around the park. Perfect for some yoga sessions or having a run. Bare in mind that winters in Incheon are quite cold and rough, plan a good protective clothing if you are planning to have a run."
Ideal for photo moments,Such wonderful scenery. I had multiple shots taken with a pleasant smile from locals. Fresh air breeze with an authenic ambience worth relaxing at for a moment or so.
cherry blossom,"i went there for cherry blossom because this year the cherry blossom in seoul ended earlier than usual. i went there from seoul. first by metro and then by bus. if you are having a big group of people with elderly and children, and if you dont speak korean, you really need to get well prepared with a lot of information because Korean do not speak english well. it is not easy to ask for help."
