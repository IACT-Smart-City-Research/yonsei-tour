Average,"The area is strictly for shopping and you could bargain at the retail stores. The crowd was not as heavy since our last visit four years ago; due to on line shopping and less Chinese tourists. We visited couple of complexes, which on certain levels the numbers of shop employees outnumbered the shoppers. "
"More like tour, not shopping","Dongdaemun shopping mall has really various shops and restaurants. But in my point of view, Dongdaemun Shopping mall is not that great place for shopping, cuz there are many low qualty products. Even though products are pretty cheap, there are not many nice souvenir products. I think better go to Gwanghui Pharmacy near Dongdaemun. There are more souvenir skincare dietary products in Gwanghui Pharmacy. There are 3 interpreter who can speak Englsih, Chinese, Indonesian, and Malaysian."
Must to visit at least one of the shopping centers,Must to visit at least one of the shopping centers and mostly the night ones that are unique experience! Try the most popular depending on your interests
Pretty clothes but prices on the high side,"Most of the ladies clothes ranges 20000won to as high as 75000won in gd morn city, dongdaemun , apm place. Don’t expect to have big bargains thou. Discounts mostly 5-10k won. Some nicer seller might allow alittle more discount. Orelse a blouse is 40-48k won. Skirts 20k to 58k depending if it’s on sale.Gotten some cheap buys but some expensive ones that I gave it a miss. Sellers are quite firm with their last price. Quality is good for some but with that prices, we cAn easily shop in SG malls. So if ya looking for some pretty clothes yes it’s a nice place. Basically just be prepared that each clothes is estimated at sgd30-50.Hope this gives a latest update on the clothes price here^^"
Small shopping center,"End up here after visiting DDP in Seoul easy to reach by subway, multiple floors that make it feel like a macys but all are little independent shops, top floors plenty of restaurants and cafeterias, another floor with bowling and srcade the looked fun, and a complete new concept for me was a comic book store were you can be on a bumper bed laying with you couple reading comics, the rest were clothes shops that didn't seems to have the best quality but they do have interesting stuff."
Fifth floor for beads,"I finally had a free day in Seoul and was able to conclude my search for beads. The fifth floor of the main shopping building is the place to go, as a number of older posts report. The variety and quality of products is great, from good quality to crafting quality. A number of shops also have findings for jewelry making. My first trip was on a Saturday - much too crowded. Go on a weekday to avoid the crush."
A lot of different complexes and a lot of stories,A nice area to buy a lot of clothing for your wife or girlfriend. A lot of different street food. Overall I spent about five hours there and the street food are fairly priced!
Several floors of shops selling fabrics and related accessories,"This is one place where there are several floors of shops selling fabrics and related accessories. Unless you have in mind cloth or buttons, zippers, etc, you may want to give this place a miss or just pop in for a feel and quickly move on. "
Fabric heaven,"I could happily have spent all day in the mall which sells fabrics. There is a fantastic range of all types of material, as well as haberdashery, bedding, soft furnishings, even rugs. If you love to sew this is the place to go."
Shopping galore ,One of the numerous shopping areas in Seoul. It was fun to explore Korean shops as well as the expected type of clothing stores. You could spend a long time exploring.
Nice shopping place for Ladies!,"You will find lots of Malls in Dongdaemun, price would vary from very expensive to affordable. I saw lots of Sales Item as well. We went to watch Jurassic Movie in one of the Cinema as it is only coming to our Island this end of month. "
Several shopping centers,"Dongdaemun is a popular shopping and tourist destination where people go to because of the traditional markets and shopping centers. It has around 26 shopping malls over ten blocks, 30,000 specialty shops, and 50,000 manufacturers. The area is open for almost the whole day (10:30am -5:00am) and some stores are open 24hours but most shops close on Mondays and Holidays . Another place to go to is the DDP complex which has a fantastic architecture composed of undulating surfaces that resemble the flow of liquid and allow the flexibility in space."
Just another market,I did not find anything great at this market but can be explored. The Hyundai city outlet and doota duty free near to the complex are also good options.
Several Shopping malls in Dongdaemun ,"Been here in year 2000 , this is my 2nd time , things have change so much since then . Hyundai shopping complex was new,Doota opens till 5am , Dongdaemun design plaza was futuristic, you need at least 1 whole day to shop . "
very large shopping area,find your everything here ha3... a huge shopping area. lots of mall. spend whole day to enjoy each mallin upper floor of dotta mall theres a souvenir shops.at basement floor of dotta mall theres a reasonable price of food court
Good Shopping Complexes,"Dongdaemun is a haven for shoppers! There are 4 shopping complexes - Doota, Migliore, AM/PM, Good Morning Complex. Doota is 8 floors of mid range stores. The other 3 shopping complexes comprises of numerous tiny stalls offering great bargains for clothes, shores and accessories. Some days, these complexes open till 3-4am. Easy access by subway. Get off at Dongdaemun station."
A crafter/sewist's heaven,"My ultimate favourite place for buying all sorts of beautiful fabric, charms and notions other than Nippori Fabric Town in Tokyo.Most shops are open by 10+am and take orders for collection at 1pm or 5pm. Many shops accept minimal orders of 1 yard though others don't. You can find knits, fur, crepe, cotton, chiffon, broderie anglaise, lace organza... anything under the sun!Charms and jewellery parts are everywhere. Many shops stock similar designs and prices may differ by 100₩. Best place to buy earrings here as well as they are as cheap as 400₩ where at Apm Place/normal shops they are 16,000₩.Most stall keepers are friendly and helpful and understand simple English/Japanese/Chinese."
Many choices With Cheap and quality clothes and stores,"Complex contains many shopping centres or malls which have cheap goods as well as authentic goods made in Korea. It is a shopping haven for those on a budget as you can get many good clothes , bags , whatever you need by bargaining the prices . Definitely a must go if you plan on getting souvenirs or trendy clothes at a cheap price !"
I love markets,"this place is huge. if you love open markets go here. we did not spend time inside, we walked all around outside. there is some good food and great people watching."
ideal for shopping clothes if you know where to look,"this is a big area consisted of buildings and shops. i came here without doing much research beforehand so i didn't know where was the best place to shop for what i need. however, i can tell this whole area will have everything you would need in the fashion business if you know where to look. There are indoor areas with products in all price ranges, so shop smart. bargain is possible but i didn't bother."
best area for shopping.,"located in the central. many shops, markets, malls, and whole sale market. very big area with all types of products specially clothes. there is also a night market. you need 1 full day to cover the area.must visit place for shopaholic."
Shopping haven!,We went to Dongdaemun to shop (as always) and we found out a lot of great deals in these place. most especially in clothing. great deal! very kind people also.
Bargain hunting,This place is for shopaholics who love bargain sales. We were able to buy a lot from this place and good quality products especially if it's made in Korea. We will visit this place when we go to Seoul again 
Ok if you want to spend a few quid,Another shopping mall with luxury brands that will cost you an arm and a leg. If your wife wants another expensive bag or you want an expensive bag then come here.
Another tourist spot.,Another overrated with tourists shopping place in Seoul. Not much of a big deal but you'll be more convenient to get all the skincare/cosmetic brands around. Good for shoppers. 
Tourist spot!,"Similar to the orchard road in Singapore, this one however opens till late at night and you are able to bargain for clothes. Some clothes are cheap. Many malls close to each other so you can go from cheap to expensive shops, then take the cab back if its too late"
Must for Tourist Shopping,I would suggest to tourist to come here for shopping. You can get everything at reasonable price (Korea costly than China). Make sure you do some negotiation here. This complex is open for late night. Also if you need branded things than Lotte store is just beside this complex.
Good night markets ,"I interested in night shopping there the place are full of tourist, the prices are not very cheap but you can find some bargains on clothes and accessories. Doota is luxury shopping center but there are multi stories shopping centers are cheaper. If you are shopaholic don't miss it al least once to experience the trendy Korean fashion. "
Not A Night Market,"First time go to South Korea - Seoul, i search first about Dongdaemun market and i expected it will be street market but the reality is not street market and just open until 09:00 PM (South Korea - Seoul Time). Maybe Should go there from morning or around 10:00 AM (South Korea - Seoul Time)."
Shopping paradise,"This is the world's largest fabric and clothing material market. You can buy the latest fabrics in Korea. They also sell accessories, bedding and hanboks here. Many vendors selling similar products... so shop around and compare the price."
Good bargain at Dongdaemun Shopping Complex,Good bargain at Dongdaemun Shopping Complex. The shops sells mostly clothing and accessories. Variety of goods with cheap price.
Dongdaemun,Huge shopping complex. People selling all kinds of things. Got a nice jacket for a good price. Would come back
Shopping ,It a place filled shop selling materials for making clothes. It seems like it has all kinds of accessories too beside the cloth. You can find various types of bedding too
Korean Designer Show,"I go to Doota Shopping complex, it's luxury shopping mall. You may check their latest Korean designer and also international brand inside that building, food court at basement and some small restaurant at 3rd and 4th floor, Don't worry, watches and cosmetics available at 4th and 5th floor. "
Just another shopping mall in Korea,"Nothing special about this place that sells winter clothings, sports accessories and street eatery. can found on other parts of Korea"
"Great prices, just not a lot of variety","There are a lot of shops that look similar or sell the same products:-- winter jackets (what else when you go in November)- winter fashion (a little mumsy fashion wise)- winter accessories- bags and luggagePrices are good, and bargain-able."
More shopping ,"My wife headed straight for this shopping centre as advised be one of her friends.Lots of shops selling what most trendy young women want. A must for the ladies and The Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf on the second floor is a great place for the husbands to sit, relax, enjoy a drink and watch the birds go by."
24/7 shopping area for shopaholic,It's so big awesome area to go shopping with many branches from worldwide branches to original Korean branches.Special that you can shopping over night too :) 
Great Place to Shop,This whole area is full with shopping malls that open until 3am. I must place for those who wants to shop. You can get local products as well all new k-pop style fashion.
Place to shop,"For you all who like to shop, this is one of the best place to do shopping. You can shop till midnight. You can also find store to buy souvenir and other korean things as gifts to bring home. You can also find so many many restaurants and street food in this area with reasonable price. Most of the things in Dongdaemun Shopping Complex is clothes and accessories."
Not worth it,"I found most of the shops in dongdaemun shopping area to be very disappointing. They were either very expensive, severe lack of choice for men's clothing and very cold reception from staff. Overall experience has been pretty piss poor really. Only saving grace is it's close to the dongdaemun design Plaza which is a cool place to have a walk around. "
Overpriced Stores and Rude Sellers,"There are many places to shop in Seoul, coming to the shopping malls at Dongdaemun is the worst because everything is double or triple the price of other shops outside and the sellers are generally rude and always trying to rip their customers off as much as possible.Your time and money is better spent elsewhere."
24/7 shopping tho pricey,Definitely would be a shopaholics' heaven where you can go shopping whenever you feel like. However only for people who has a bit more in their piggy bank.
Korean Fashion ,"If you love Korean fashion, this is the place for you. However clothes can be slightly overpriced and at the wholesale market you may have to buy more than 2 pieces depending on what you're buying. "
Sigh- another mall with expensive clothes,"Yes, it is huge and yes it is clean BUT...the stuff here are expensive. If you want to buy something cheap in Seoul - never shop in Dongdaemun- go elsewhere."
Expensive and rude people,"Even coming from NYC, I consider the prices of the clothing to be ridiculously expensive. Even the most simplest shirts would cost $40. I could tell the fabric is not even high quality. And in the small shops, some of the people are just straight up rude. Some of them glared at us when we touched their clothing just to take a quick glance. And as a foreigner, I couldn't help notice that they tend to prioritize the Koreans first. There were several occasions where we were ignored because the owner would rather help someone who is Korean.On the bright side, some of the clothes were gorgeous. The malls were simply huge which is great for an entire day of shopping. It's only a shame the ridiculous prices and rude people ruined the experience."
Cool multi story shopping mall. ,"Finally a mall that has a floor for men..and is cool! I'm moving to Guam, so the clothes here wouldn't do me any help. Although I wish I could buy some..for its awesome. I suggest to make sure to find something else to do around the area as well. It's cool and all but not that exciting alone "
Very good for 24 hours. ,"Very good for 24 hours shopping. Its specialty is clothings. It has many tall buildings for shopping. Night market also popular here. DDP also providing good view of design. Near by, there is Gwangjang Market. Which is famous for Hanbok, beef tartare, food of Gimbap, pork, sea food. :) "
Late night shopping for the true shopaholics,"There are so many things to do in Seoul : exploring the historical relics like palaces, temples , enjoying the various Korean cuisines, food marts , kimchi museum,.. Therefore,a typical efficient time-starved traveller would like to allocate the late nights to shopping. Dongdaemun is a budget shoppers' paradise with many malls owning from late afternoons to early hours of the morning. Serving the local distributors, the malls sell clothings and accessories items, has 4-5 floors with occasional late night cafes as well. However these strict rules apply: Purchase of at least 2-3 pieces of the same design, no trying allowed, paying by cash only. The prices of the fashion items vary depending on the quality and varies from 8000 to 50,000 won a piece. Overall a great place for women shoppers."
wholesale market for apparels,"we can buy all types apparels for all ages, innerwear, socks, speacial dresses etc., in whoesale price."
A love hate shopping experience,"Its a shopholic paradise where there are more than 10 blocks of shopping complex, small shops, outlets including discount department store. The only problem is its spread over a wide area. Its advisable to bring a trolley bag if you plan to shop. Items are cheaper than Myeongdong but you need to walk, look and check prices for what you want to buy. Very much a love hate experience. Suggest to start the day shopping and end with evening admiring the LED lights display at Dongdaemun Design Plaza, a stunning visual piece of architecture."
Cheap Cheap Cheap!,"Dongdaemun shopping district is a bomb! (according to my wife) I had to drag her outta there in the end because if I didn't she was gonna buy the whole shopping center... she said their prices are unbelievably cheap compare to other shopping centers. If you like to be bumped into by strangers, then this is place for you.. You'll run into a lot of Chinese tourists here... they have so much moola they will buy the whole darn shopping centers. I do NOT like shopping, nor crowded places but I was being a nice husband this night and endure the pain of shopping with my wife... she thanked me afterwards and earned a nice round of golf for being a nice hubby~~ yes!"
wholesalers paradise,"This differentiate from all the other underground shopping alleys we have been.If you can't find anything you fancy underground, there is a building with many floors and endless aisles where only fabrics are sold, not the finished products. The choices would fill the spectrum of rainbow and beyond!Opposite this block, there is another monstrous building with rows of clothes--kids, adults and Korean costumes, men and women fashion boutiques filled out every floor to the nth degree.Do bargain if you intend to buy in bulk. It is hard to contemplate these hard working Koreans sitting in their little enclosure, competing with everyone else selling similar products. This is where some will stand out with their special attractive collections in this maze, the problem is having time and orientation to discover them because they are hidden in the labyrinth. My advice is buy it immediately if you like it, for it would be impossible to compare prices and you might not be able to find your way back!Do have a break and enjoy the little food stalls just outside"
Always Great Bargains in Dongdaemun,"When I lived in Korea, we shopped in Dongdaemun often. It has changed quite a lot since the 70's & 80's, but still a great place to shop."
Souvenir shop,You can buy some souvenir in dongdaemun..there is alot of choice for souvenir and clothing also. The price is cheap.
Got what we came to find after hours of searching,"Too much of a labyrinth and a crowded one at that. Came to buy luggage. Took a long time to find any.. hours actually. Instead found a house of buttons, a house of ahjumma clothes and a house with about 5 floors of fabric.. If you know the area or are visiting with a korean friend it might be a better experience but for us it was pure agony.. Only good part was finding a modern underground shopping area nearby by accident."
Stop and Shop,"After training, our group went to Dongdaemun Shopping Complex to check what it has to offer. Well, it is just an average mall where you can find local and international brands of clothing, footwear, etc. It is just an ordinary shopping mall, for me, where you can buy anything you are looking for."
Haggling is allowed!,"I visited Dongdaemun with hopes of finding cheap clothes and souvenirs. While I was not able to find clothes that suit my taste, I was able to buy souvenir items for as low as 3000 won with a bit of haggling involved. If you're looking for hanboks, you'll find a lot of those here. "
Bargain-hunters Dream,"This is a bargain-hunters dream. You need stamina, cash, and a large shopping bag because almost anything you can imagine is sold in these markets. Brush up on your Korean for 'how much' and 'thank you' and enjoy the whole experience. Traders are not pushy and they are always willing to help. All of the sellers of particular items are in one section: hats, scarves and gloves are all in one area, socks are in another, jackets are in another, furs in yet another. Check opening and closing times - some areas do not open until midnight. Be prepared to walk a lot because the complex is huge. One building had several floors of Christmas decorations - so amazing to walk through."
It is a clothing mall mainly for wholesale,"Some of the shops in Dongdaemun Shopping Complex are for wholesale (or in bulk), it might be cheaper to buy from stalks in the street because if you buy only little from Dongdaemun Shopping Complex, the shop keeper might not even want to sell little and they don't necessarily give cheap prices."
Disappointed!,"I have visited Myeongdong, Dongdaemum & Namdaemun for my shopping in this trip & found Dongdaemum to be the most disappointing. Maybe it's because I visited the place on a Sunday evening. Most of the shops are closed. Same goes to Pyeonghwa Market as well as the Dongdaemum Wholesale market in the area.The livelier part on a Sunday evening is located at Dongdaemum History & Culture Park station (Exit 13 or 14) rather than Dongdaemun station itself. The malls here are somewhat like Platinum Mall in Bangkok. But shopping here lacks the fun of street shopping available in Namdaemun or the variety of mask and cosmetic shops in Myeongdong. Its target market seems to be the low-mid range customers and bargaining is a must.So drop by if it is on the way and you have available free time to kill. Otherwise, visiting Myeongdong and Namdaemun would be sufficient for all your shopping needs."
Inexpensive Shopping Fun,I really enjoyed looking around this larger than ever fashion market area. Picked up some great shoes and boots for little cost. You have to find the treasures though. I found that there were very few tourists. Surprising because there is something there for everybody.
Massive shopping on a scale hard to imagine,"This is a key complex inside the huge Dongdaemun shopping region, which is block after block of every kind of product. The small stores (often with actual raw goods to create products) are typically clustered together within a geography - such as lighting, plumbing, clothing, furniture, etc. This complex is one of the most modern with retail stores as well as restaurants. "
"Shops, shops and more shops",I personally don't really like this place as I find it abit too messy. But if you are looking for clothings and accessories can visit here. But for me I'll give it a skip if I'm back again.
Shop. SHOP. Shop,"Yeah this place is nuts. Perfect for ladies who need to get their shopping fix in. First time we visited, we were walking around and I was listening to their public announcement, 'Open until 5am.'5am. Usually I'm on my way to work by then! Doota seems to be the more fashionable building while the rest seem more like the apparel you see at night markets. The prices are not as cheap as we thought at first and it seems to be catered towards the China tourists."
"Skip this place, visit Myeongdong instead.","DDM is really overhype. We should have read TripAdvisor reviews first before spending our night at this place.There are a lot of shopping complex around DDM, but most of them sell similar things and is more expensive than Myeongdong, I wonder how they got their reputation of ""budget/ wholesale"" outlet... I also have no idea how these shops can open until midnight or 5am because most of the malls has no crowd at all and is very very quiet! I bought a bag at Myeongdong for 10000won, and a similar one is selling at 25000won at DDM.Since the malls are a huge disappointment, we proceed to look for the famous yellow tents to source for better deals and make the trip worth it. However, yellow tents sells mostly counterfeit goods and a small men's bag can cost 60000won!Save your time and visit other places instead!"
Totally Disappointed,"We first visited the Pyoung Hwa Clothing Market but most of the stalls were closed. From those still opening for business, we knew that it was just a local low end shopping mall. We thus turned to another side where there were many department stores. Again, no surprises."
Numerous departmental stores in one big area,"There are a number of departmental stores in this area, e.g. Lotte Fitin, Dooda, Migliore, Hello APM, Good Morning City, etc. It will be quite impossible to cover all of them within a short period of time, unless you have a lot of time in hand. We would normally choose 2 to 3 departmental stores and spent about 2 to 3 hours looking for good bargains. We arrived in the late afternoon and visited Lotte Fitin and Hello APM specifically for ladies clothings. We managed to buy some cloths ranging from KRW10,000 to KRW30,000. Don't be afraid to bargain as this is normal in some of the departmental stores."
Just another shopping mall strip. Total disappointment!,"First of all, we had this misconception that Dongdaemun is another street market. The area is very confusing. After several rounds of asking different people, and being told different timing of the business opening hours, we finally realised that Dongdaemun area is mainly made up of a street that is lines with a few major shopping malls!!!We went to a few of the malls and were quite disappointed that they do not have much to offer. Doota is totally over rated! There are not much to see or buy. And the prices are not cheap at all. We even went to the whole sale complex just round the corner, mistaking it for Dongdaemun market. And they sell all winter scarves, hats and older women clothes!!. Anyway, I will not recommend this place at all. It's a waste of time."
Big letdown,"Don't get confused, Quantity does not mean either Quality or a good price. Lots of things to buy, in fact an enormous amount of goods in a smallish area but at a largish price. Comparing Thailand, Malaysia, Shenzen, Vietnam, this place is the most expensive by far. "
Doota,"Products in Doota are not cheap at all, but the quality is good.Some salespeople are rude and not friendly to foreign tourists."
insane shopping,"Dongdaemun is a street in Seoul you must visit if you're planning on some crazy shopping. I read somewhere that after 10PM would be the best time to visit so that was the time I went. It was really overwhelming (especially since I just landed in Seoul at 6PM that day) and very crowded! Stick close to your buddies as some of the shopping areas can be confusing to a newbie. If you survive though, you can find some good stuff at affordable prices! :)"
This is beyond insanity - Hypershopping in Dongdaemun,"Tons of clothing goods for being delivered to China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and other places. This is the shopping paradise for Korean cheap clothing shoppers! Open from 10am to 6am next day... There is always people here. Not recommend for family trips, it's crowded and it is not easy walk inside."
"""Shop Til You Drop"" Redefined!","I went to this Dongdaemun Shopping Complex during my tour of Seoul, Korea and was faced with this three 6-storied buildings of mainly clothes shopping. Each building caters to a different shopping class with the building to the far right (facing the buildings) the highest class, designer's fashion to the building on the far left selling the lowest class garments. The lowest class by no means an indication of it's grade as they are just more common everyday wear compared to the highest class where you would find more dressy styles. And all the buildings are opened from 10;00 a.m. until 4:30 A.M. (That's right, it's not a typo, it is A.M.) This truly redefines ""shop til you drop"" in my mind..."
All Shops the same,"Talk about mall overload. Malls as the eye can see. Its just ridonkulous. But if you are into shopping, this is a cant miss place. But after a few hours, everything seems to melt together and each shop seems to sell the same items. "
Crazy Shopping!!!,"Like its mentioned by other reviewers, I have same opinion, its not cheap at all.Size is another issue everything is UK size6/8/10. People from other parts of the world are not as lucky as locals here. They need to keep the up sizes as well for tourists.It’s like the whole building corner has something or the other to sell.Its fun!"
One of the great shopping paradise in Seoul!,"it is one of the main shopping mall in Dongdaemun area which offers a lot of women clothing, although not cheap but offer big varieties and it is open til the morning so you can shop all night ! Girls - you will love it . There is a nice cafe and restaurants inside the complex too so you can shop and eat all in one place !The location is great as it is just a few minutes walk from Dongdae mun train station"
"One of many over-rated shopper's paradise within Seoul, crowded & busy, just OK","We had lunch in one of the many indoor mall's food court upstairs & then allocated time to do some (windows) shoppping - we picked the mall with ""least expensive"" goods and realized that we can find better quality goods in the US for 50% less, even after haggling the prices down using calculators, as many of the sole store/counter sales people do NOT speak little, if any ,English at all - some are just rude & not friendly to tourists, no smiles or thank you. Many of the same indoor stalls selling basically the same generic products, souvenir items and shoes/sneakers & luggage sets, etc. - if they won't accept for your counter-offered prices, keep walking & buy elsewhere. It's a neat & safe place to hangout on a rainy day and one can spend 2 or 3 days going from block to block, checking out different places & there are places to sit, clean restrooms & food with prices to match all budgets - plan ahead & have a local map. It's just one of those - been there, done it and had one's pictures taken for memories.And, the indoor malls don't have free WiFi that we can readily sign into - fine for the locals but for visitors, NOT good for business & we didn't come across any McD's or Starbucks, plenty of local equivalents - of course."
Not cheap,A little disappointed. We didn't buy anything inside the mall. But manage to grab some stuff outside the mall. Skip this if u don't have a lot of time in Seoul.
Shopping heaven,"A lot of street stores and shopping complexes. If you are Ana vid shopper, you can spend most of your day here. There are also a lot of street food that you can try over here do try out their j cone ice cream and Oden. "
Too many shops for a whole week straight!,Thousands of shops from simple market stalls to boutique fashion brands available. The place almost never closes. Put aside a lot of time and don't forget to haggle in the market style shops.
Several malls but pointless,"There is Doota, Lotte Fitin, 3 cheap malls (Miglori, Hello APM, and Good Morning City), and across the street, there is Maxtyle, and plenty of wholesale malls. I only enjoyed visiting Doota and Lotte Fitin. These two provided nice quality clothing with affordable prices. In Doota, there is a food court with several dining options for a quick bite. The other malls were horrible. Poor quality with rude service.When visiting Migliore, in the men's section on floor B1, across from hair accessories, look out for a rude young Korean guy. I don't know why he even has stalls. When I asked him if he worked there when they opened, he said no and continued to run off. Later during the day, I asked him again and he said yes rudely as he was accompanied by his girlfriend. He was acting like I was bothering him. Please close down your stall if you're not willing to sell your items. However, upstairs, there is a souvenir shop across on the right side as you come up the escalators. Sweet and helpful older guy with affordable souvenirs. The wholesale malls across the street were pointless. Bags and bags on the floor with obstructed pathway. Many purchasing were other retailers from other cities. I pictured Dongdaemun shopping area differently before I visited. It didn't meet my expectations. Not even comparable to Thailand shopping experience."
Overpriced and lots of haggling required,"If you do not like to haggle over overpriced clothes, AVOID this area at all cost. Not worth going at all. You get better prices for the same clothes without haggling at other shopping areas. More for wholesale suppliers."
not place for tourist,the building was huge and so many stuff and narrow.need nego every purchase.with small kids hard to travel.but for sure atractive place for young shopper!
Shop til you Drop,"There are several buildings in this area. Each building consists of several levels with various goods to buy. If you have much time to spend here you can check up those buildings one by one, but if your time is just short then you can choose one and explore it. You can try Migliore or Good Morning. There you can find Korean made goods with good price, of course if you have a good bargaining skill, which is a must for a real spender :)You can find clothes, accessories, souvenirs, shoes, and many more. But if you are African or European or to put it simply if you have a bigger posture then normally Asian has then don't put your expectation too high. It is very difficult to find big size here. I have a little bigger shoe size then Korean. My size is like 245-250 (Korean size in mm) and they consider it as a big size. My African friends and some Asian-European friends can't find anything with size here. So just be prepared if your size is a big size.If you are staying for a long time here, you can even order shoes or clothes that you want when the sellers run out of your size. Please check the standard price for everything with some Korean you know before you go, so you can make a good deal here. Happy shopping! ^.^"
Fashionable,"Clothes are very fashionable. I will go back just to buy the cool (however, a little expensive) clothes.There's a souvenir shop at the 6th floor. The sales guy is cute and knows how to speak Filipino. The souvenirs are reasonable! "
Insanely big,"This place is so big it's easy to get confused. I found it very good if you are looking for clothes but not so great for souvenirs. It can become a madhouse with crowds but if you are into fashion, etc, this is a MUST DO"
Huge place,"We live walkin distance from Dondaemun so thought it was appropriate to write a quick review.Pretty easy to get around, just a lot of nooks and crannies to venture off into. Night time the place comes alive as a true multi-cultural experiance. Foriengners from all over the globe appear when the lights come on. We love to go down at night to see the lights but if you really want to shop go during the day, starting about 10 AM. Plan to kill a full day here. If you are shopping get off the subway at Dongdaemun History and Culture Center.........if you want to see the Gate and Seoul Fortress Wall go on to the next subway stop at Dongdamun Station."
LIke a big Chinese market...,"You can find some cool Korean fashion here if you look, but 90% of this is cheap clothing shipped from Chinese factories, just like you will find in many of the markets in China that look like this. Everywhere you can bargain, even if they say you can't bargain you can. Tell them you want to buy 2-3 items and then tell them the new price for all 3, then change say you only want 1 item and tell them lower price. All places will give you discount for cash as well so that they don't have to pay taxes. There are a few different buildings all selling clothes, some are very cheap with everything around 10-20k others have most things like dresses going for 30-60k (after bargaining)."
"The place for walking, looking and buying !","One more very important place for tourists and residents as well, is surely the Dongdaemun Shopping Complex.It is located along the one, rather, long portion of the Jongno Street (due to its width, it might be called the Jongno Boulevard or Avenue).Here we loved to go forth and back along these commercial large buildings, purposed for trading with the completely different goods. There are here the traditional markets and very modern and popular shopping centers as well. And since it shortly became a popular shopping and tourist destination, it is properly indicated as Special Tourism Zone. The masses of people are going here in all directions, making the impression of some human hives, gazing at the products and purchasing them. And those products range from silks and fabric ,over the clothes and shoes, leather goods, sporting goods, then plumbing and electronics, toys, luxury watches, and food areas, specialising in Korean cuisine. The choice is really abundant one.We, in the group, had been in this paradise for buyers, several times and every time enjoyed."
