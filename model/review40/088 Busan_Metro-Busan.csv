Good and punctual subway system,"Trains are punctual and well operated. Trip or day fares are available at ticket machines. Look out for direction that you are heading before entering the station gate. Train transfers are relatively convenient but do look out for signage on train directions to your desired destination.Clean and stable with minimal rocking during travelling, special sections for seniors too."
Clean and fast,"We loved the metro as it avoided the horrendous traffic!Once you get used to realising you also need to know the stop after the one you board at, the metro is easy! At least you know for sure which direction the train's travelling in!"
Great!! ,"The easiest and beat way to get around Busan, the one thing is Busan is huge so it can take some time to get across town "
Efficient metro but a bit confusing to find dirextion,"This is a very modern subways with efficiently fast and precise departure. But I find it hard, for a stranger like me, to find the direction on a particular line. While most subways in the world including Tokyo Paris NewYork to name a few, indicate the direction on a particular line by naming its end station, metro in Korea indicate this by naming a few intermediate station ahead of where you are. To us this is very confusing."
Busan has an extensive metro system,"We used the Busan metro to access our hotel from the airport. The system is safe, clean, user friendly and cheap. As a bonus the T card you bought for Seoul transport works just as well here. I prefer the subway to the buses as you avoid traffic delays. Announcements and displays include English. "
A to B,"Gets you from one place to another, via an underground train. Hard to complain. Each station also has shops and toilets, a lovely touch for those with a weak bladder. Reasonably priced too. "
Does What it’s Meant to Do,"I’ve been on many subways/metros in many cities in the world. The Busan metro does not compare favorably to many of them in terms of ease of purchasing tickets, finding your destination stop, knowing when a train is coming, and just plain general aesthetics of both trains and stations.Nevertheless it transports you to your destination quickly and efficiently, and that’s the reason for its existence."
Metro ,"Very easy to use this Metro, the signs are in both Korean and English and easy to follow. Just remember to take small notes when buying the tickets from the machines. "
"More simple than the Seoul one, but ....","We used lines 1 and two for all major landmarks - Gamcheon cultural village - Jagalchi (line 1) . In G25 shops buy a t-money card and load it with 30000 won for 5 days - appr. consumption is 5000 w per day. Valid in Seoul, Busan , Gyeongju. We assume in whole Korea - with public transport, but check it please. In busan metro there is a confusion in final stops of the line 2 - Jangsan and Yangsan - two completely different stations. Load an app Busan metro.."
Very good,Very good and clean metro. With Korean and English language wrote on metro lines it with little common sense is very easy to navigate through city.
Difficult ,The metro is kind of convenient depending on where you’re going. Buying a ticket is relatively easy though the machines do not give change if you’re recharging a card. 
Use the map to get around!,"Know where you are heading or need to switch train. Only isdue is lack of English in Busan. However, get someone to tell you which station or platform and which station to get off. There is a number on that station. Onde we tried,mit was easy,1400 won one way compared to 27,000won on taxi."
Best metro in the World!!!,"These mutts were not surprised at the technology advancement that South Korea is know for world wide, and boy, now we know why they are awesome in many ways! You don't have to read or speak Korean at all! If you go up to the ticket self service booths equipped with 'touch screens', and one of two things are going to happen: (1) You'll see the ""English"" and proceed. (2) a metro 'volunteer' will come over and ask you what language you speak, and will enthusiastically help you! We quickly learned to say in Korean, ""Thank you, but we're familiar with the process! Look, someone needs your help!"" These mutts love to learn on their own, and that way it ""sticks"" to our furry brains! Nevertheless, Humero Metro in Busan is #1!!! WiFi is available, and the 'announcement voice' states each stops in Korean, Chinese, and English! A ticket from Seomyeon station to Nampo station was about $1.40 (14000W). Next time we'll invest in the ""Money Bee"" card that's accepted at the metro, and many other business!!! At the stations that we visited during our metro excursions there were tons of shops, cafés, eateries, and places to sit! No panhandling, nor any negative encounters. Security personnel made us feel more so safer! Humero Metro #1 :o)"
Great way to get around ,Metro system is great in South Korea. Really convenient easy way to get around. It’s easy to understand and pretty cheap. 
Good way of getting around,"The one day ticket is great value if you want to go from central Busan to places like Haunde Beach. Frequent, clean trains."
Great way to travel,"We got a card from our home country before we arrived (Taiwan) and it was super-easy to load up once we were in Busan. All the machines are in English and easy to understand as are the metro maps. That being said for short to medium trips of 3-4 people, taxi is easily as affordable and faster."
"Clean, safe, convenient","From the airport you can easily get to Seomyeon in less than 25 minutes, and connect to the rest of the subway system easily. If you have been to Seoul and already have a metro card, just charge it and it can be used in Busan as well. It does stop running before midnight."
Easy to Navigate,"Efficient and economical. Best way to travel in Busan. Easy to scan our cards and go. Using in conjunction with a map was easy to get from the bus terminal to Haeundae beach. Skips car traffic and bus hassles. Very busy, but still doable. Well-placed signs made it easy to follow the directions to make connections and find where to go. We'd never used a large metro before at all, and managed to get where we wanted to go without issue. Fast, cheap, and fairly hassle free. Best way to go."
Only way to travel!,"Can’t recommend this highly enough; very easy to use, inexpensive and if you can get the recharge pass - very convenient for travel across the city. You can use this in the bus as well.Hot tip; use google maps to work out your travel route - it will make things easier to navigate around."
"Frequencies not always fantastic, but still a good Metro network","I like Asian metros due to their efficiency.Busan's Metro is no exception with the T Money card offering convenience and economical fares at roughly KRW1300 a triop, as well as convenient access to Busan railway station, shopping districts such as Nampo and beaches such as Haeundae and the better Songdo - the latter is by bus routes such as 6,7, 30 or 71 ex Namp station, taking 13 minutes by bus.Trains are clean and comfortable.Stations do not have escalators or lifts at every exit so check this carefully.No staff visible."
Busan Station,"There are a lot of hotels and hostels near Busan Station, the station itself is at a convenient location, but it is a commercial district, and no KTS train at night, so it's very quiet and empty but with lots of homeless people staying in the station as shelter at night."
Excellent way of getting bu,"Get a transportation card at 7-11 and you are all set to roam around Busan. The metro is very convenient. All stops are numbered. The first number represents the line number. They have English broadcast on the train too. So it is quite easy to follow. There are English signs available. So as long as you know where you are, which stop you are heading and which direction you are heading, you are all set. The only down side is, there aren’t a lot of stops with elevator. People who hates climbing stairs need to pay attention. Google map also shows the exact bus number to take from point to point. The transportation card can be used on the bus also. "
I like it,Busan metro is really easy to understand. In Busan is working same card that for Seoul Metro so nothing problematic. Really comfortable.
Very convenient and user friendly metro system,We use the system on two different days going to about 4 different destinations. Very convenient central station across the street from the main train station. Helpful staff on navigating the system and the pay machines. Stops clearly announced and mapped. Very good way to get around.
Easy to Navigage and Cheap to Use,"For 5000 won, we bought all day passes that gave us unlimited use of the Busan metro system. This was a great deal for efficiently getting around the heart of Busan and making as many stops as we wanted to. Tickets were easily purchased from the ticketing machines though we had to make sure we had small 1000 won bills or coins. It would not take larger bills. The tickets dispensed were small, rectangular and made of paper and could be easy to misplaced if not careful. Tickets were inserted into each gate and removed after entering. Our daughters were able to use their T cards from Seoul and still able to take advantage of the discounted teens rate with just a tap of their card.Signage inside the stations and on the trains were good (included English) which helped with our navigation. Line 1 ran north to south to Jagalchi Market and close to the Gamcheon Village while Line 2 ran east west getting us to Haeundae beach and Centum Mall. All stations were very clean."
Less complicated than Seoul Metro system,"Much lesser lines than Seoul metro system. You can use your t-money card for Busan metro system. The 2 mains line are Line 1 and Line 2 which you will need to take to visit Hauendae Beach, Jalgalgi Fish Market, Nampo underground Street etc."
So user friendly,We used the metro daily and found it so easy to get to every part of Busan we wanted to see. We liked Nampo best of all and went back a second time. Something for everyone here and the best shops.
Excellent,Very organized. Convenient n great way to get around. Taxis are expensive. Trains are reasonable & easy. Small change machines located next to ticket vending machine 
Easy to us,The metro is very easy to use. It brings you to many places in Busan. We didn’t have to use the bus for many of the things we went to see. It was also not expensive. 
The best way to travel around,"Busan Metro, like Seoul, is efficient and clean. It was easy to travel around. Information is given also in English - so not too difficult to go around."
As expected of Asian Efficiency.,"The best way to travel i.e. underground. Everything ran on time as expected and quick. Although always packed it is still comfortable.. However it can be VERY confusing going from one platform to another and I thankfully had my son, a resident, with us."
World class subway system in Busan!,"Used metro several times while visiting Busan. Although the lines are not as extensive as Seoul metro, it is super clean, efficient and punctual. I also found the fares were fairly cheaper than North America. Really impressed!!"
Super metro,"Anywhere you want to go. You can use your Seoul metro pass.Nice underground shopping centres. Keep walking, and you’ll reach the next station haha."
nice and clean,nice and clean but really a long walk with limited elevators making travel with bags a little difficult specially around the ktx stations
Good Subway system,Easy to use and navigate. Wheelchair and elders have elevators at every station. Good fast connection and also serves the entire Busan well. 
Excellent,"This is one of the best metros I’ve ever seen. It’s spotlessly clean, there were platform doors on all the stations I saw ( Haeundae to Busan), very cheap (I paid 1,600 won), and it was easy to navigate."
Busan Metro,Nice subway. Efficient. Wish there were more elevators. Sometimes you had to walk up stairs with luggage.
Busan,We were very impressed with the metro in Busan most convenient. The metro system in South Korea was very good and relatively easy to use and reasonably priced great way to get around very efficient.
I love Busan metro!,"Clean, high speed internet, lockers, 24/7 convenience stores everywhere.And it connects you pretty much everywhere to the city, I stayed at Kyungsung-de for a month and it couldn't be any better.BEWARE: if you're 190cm or taller get used to bow prior boarding, I'm 195 and constantly smashing my forehead while getting on the metro."
Good metro.,"Metro service of Busan. It's clean, convenient and comfortable.Not much different from Seoul Metro."
Cheap and convenient,This place is so easy to use even the ajisans and oppas can commute without breaking a sweat. It's cheap and efficient too
Very easy to use!,"Very user friendly. All ticket machines can be switched to English. Very easy to purchase tickets, and use the subway."
Comfortable Ride,"Very impressed with the standards of the subways especially it's Cleaniness and Punctuality.The commuters are very orderly and courteous, no pushing or rushing experienced.The fares are priced reasonable too."
Airport to hotel ,It was easy to travel from airport to my hotel (queen hotel by seomyeon station). And cheap .very clean underground and if u have heavy suitcase they do have lifts (I had x4) . Good and easy experience to travel there undergrond
Busan Subway: So easy to get around,"Certainly easy to make reference to at the station map. You can also download the Busan Subway app & Naver app (coz Google app does not work in Korea) to plan ahead of time. Unlike Switzerland, they don’t have boards or apps to inform you of the real time of arrival of the trains. "
Efficient and clean,"We are a group of 10 comprising the very young and the elderly. We relied on the Busan subway very often and found it to be efficient and clean, once you are used to the system and signage.However, it can be a little challenging or the elderly as there are many steps and the escalators or elevators may not be easily located if you are not familiar with the station."
Can't understand 'Metro only for woman',"Actually they are well organized and convenient metro. But from 2017, they started system called 'Metro only for woman' They designated particular passanger car only for woman and they kick away evey male. I felt humiliated by that. As a former pusan resident, i beg mayor to abolish this bloody rule."
Convenient & Fast,"As is every public transport option in Korea, Busan metro was also quick, efficient & very convenient. T-money card works on Busan metro as well. "
Busan Metro,"We used the metro lots while staying in Busan. It's pretty essential, as lots of the sights are spread out & far apart. We didn't have any major problems, but did find some of the signage confusing."
Efficient,"I found the subway system to be efficient and relatively easy to use. Dependant upon the time of day and destination determined how packed the train was. I experienced crowded trains with no room to move to trains with empty seats galore. Make sure that you don't sit on the seats reserved for seniors (it appears everyone who sits on these seats are at least 70+) even when the train is packed these seats are left vacant. My biggest issue was finding a place to buy the cashbee card or the T-card. I tried at several stations to no avail as well as at several convenience stores. All to no avail. In desperation, I travelled to Busan Station where I had read that these cards were available at tourist information. They weren't though they did point me to a store in the station that sold the card. Well worth having as it makes travel in Busan nice and easy. My other concern that directions are not easily discernable when you get off the train. In my case finding exit 8 at Seymeon. The stations are extremely busy and many of them have a shopping mall attached so it can be difficult to navigate. "
Long Walks and Poor Signage,If you can find your way in the metro with the signage that there is then this is a fairly good systemFor tourists the signage is extremely poor and the locals there do not speak English without ‘google translate’ on their phoneThere are very long walks between stations/exits so beware of this 
Reliable and easy for Tourists!,"I was a tourist for a few days in Busan and relied heavily on the metro. The subway entrances and exits were easy to locate around town. The stations themselves were pretty clean and easy to navigate, same with the trains. Busan is spread out, so distances were pretty far to get from point A to point B. Overall, for a cheap and efficient way to explore Busan, the metro is the way to go!"
Could be better,"The trains and stations are clean and safe. But as others have noted, signage is poor. Even those who read Korean will be a bit perplexed. The lack of fare topping off machines at exits is unfortunate. You would be well advised to buy a day pass. Staff are few and far between at night. With a little work, this could be great, but as it is it is a bit weak, particularly when compared to other metro systems in the region."
"Crowded, but efficient","This is by far the best way to get around the metropolis of Busan. Taxis are generally expensive and buses are slower and less comfortable. Granted, the metro can be packed, especially during rush hour, but riders aren't subject to the vagaries of surface traffic backups. The stations are modern and clean. If you are going to be in Busan for a while, I recommend purchase of a pass card to avoid having to go to a ticket machine every time you ride."
Efficient and good value,"The Metro offers a good, efficient, clean and reasonably priced way to travel round Busan! You can use the T-money card (as for Seoul) and others to travel"
Good clean metro ,"Fast, clean, quiet. Easily accessible to many parts of busan. Heard that its more convenient than driving a car"
Clean and efficient,"The Busan metro is not as user friendly as some metros are, even Koreans walk around looking confused. That said, if you take a few moments you can figure it out and it is a very good way to get around."
Get the app,"The Busan metro is very easy to navigate, 100% download the app it makes it all so easy. I travelled in Busan alone, with no Korean language skills and it was so easy I wasn't stressed at all about using the subway. "
Convenient to travel around the city,"The best way to travel around Busan city that T-Money can be used conveniently, from Haeundae beach, Yongdusan Park, Yonggungsa Temple to Nopo station where I could take bus to Gyeongju. Highly recommend!"
Great system of subway trains.,"Trains were fast and plenty of them. Good signs for English speakers. Some trains had electronic signs to show next stops and which doors to use, others did not. Trains seemed to come very often. Rush hour was INSANE...so crowded. Even at 8 pm the trains were crowded, but nothing like 5 PM. My recommendation is to stay away from them anywhere near 5 pm. Super efficient and inexpensive. Taking two trains for two of us was 63000 KRW versus a cab at 18000 KRW back to our apartment."
"Fast, Efficient, Reliable, and Cost Effective","This is the best way to get around the city. The metro system is fast and efficient, it runs on time, is clean, and it is a lot cheaper than taking a taxi everywhere. Most of the major areas of the city are located near a metro station. One way ride is as low as 1,400 won for 1 section. They also have unlimited day passes for 5,000, unlimited 7 day pass for 21,000 won, or monthly unlimited for 60,000 won. Definitely not bad considering a single 20 minute taxi ride will be around 10-15,000 won."
Fast clean and cheap,"See my review on Seoul metro for prices and how to get a T money card and refunds. Used the Busan metro many times to get around. Signage good, English used."
Another great metro system in urban South Korea.,"I've never encountered a bad subway system in South Korea, and Busan is no exception. For such a large, sprawling city, the Busan metro does a nice job of getting you almost anywhere you need to go. One note: I was confused when buying a single-trip ticket. If you travel over a certain distance, you need to pay an extra 200 won. It was kind of embarrassing to have to buzz over an attendant to do this, so make sure to buy the appropriate ""one zone"" or ""two zones"" ticket."
Fast,2 min between station ...crowded at rush hour ...smell isn’t that good ....pick a place fast or it’s gone and you’ll be standing 
Only stairs on most exits,The Metro covers most of the city but can be inconvenient for someone to climb lot of stairs. The staff are quite helpful.
Most convenient ,"Busan metro is extremely convenient to get around. Only two price structure, it is easy enough to understand. Most of the stops on line 1 and 2 will bring you to most of the tourist must do areas in Busan. The other lines probably will cater more to locals to get to work etc. Didnt get to try the other lines though."
Excellent and punctual,Easiest way to tour Busan. Efficient system with punctuality. The money changing machine is a plus as all ticket machine takes on 1000W note.
Easy enuf!,"Getting around on the metro was easy enough, and convenient. Best to get a hotel close to a station, which is also relatively easy. "
Convenient to use,The metro system is very convenient to use. Recommend to purchase a one day pass if you want to do sightseeing. The ticket machines accept only 1000 Won notes but exchange machines are also available if you want to get these notes. Most stations do not have escalators and so be ready to climb a fleet of stairs at most stations.
Mediocre metro,Nothing special as far as metros go. Trains aren't terribly fast or frequent. Platforms not being linked at all stations is a pain if you misread the signs. Has a RFID card system but doesnt allow credit card top ups or paying with contactless. Good signage on the trains though.
Very easy to understand,"I took the metro super conveniently from the airport to Haeundae beach upon arrival to Busan and also again when I left Busan to take a train to Seoul. I bought a prepaid card so that I can just top it up and use it whenever needed. Same card can be used in Seoul as well. Otherwise you can buy the ticket for each trip, this is also easy and you can buy the tickets directly from a machine. "
We decided to purchase a day pass.,"We purchased day passes because this is a distance-based fare system. Cash only, no large currency bills.It was a bit confusing at first but most people were very friendly and helpful.Saturday was busy. Seats are a valuable commodity on long rides. The sections at the ends of each car are for the elderly or physically challenged people. It was entertaining to watch some people shove themselves into spaces that are obviously too small to comfortably accommodate their rear ends. Free public restrooms are available at many of the more popular stations. Look for the kid-size urinals, sinks and toilets - so cute!"
"Comfortable, fast, safe and cheap to go around",It is not a huge subway network but works very well. Absolutely safe and comfortable. Trains are very clean and new. Highly recommended especially to escape from the traffic jams.
Excellent,Great way to get around in Busan metro area. The areas were well connected by the metro lines. It was recommended to use an electronic transit card as there was additional discount. I used T Money card which was also accepted in Seoul.
Very efficient and handicap friendly,The whole network of different lines were well maintained and punctual. I saw a self-motorised wheelchair in the train on one of the rides in the morning.
Metro system,"The metro in Busan is efficient and fast. The only setback that the the wording in English is a teeny weeny tiny for people. During the trip, we made a few errors in deciphering the words and landed on the wrong station. And to add on to our misery, we realised that one needed to get out of the train station and go through the gantry again to move to the opposite side of the station. However in Seoul, we noticed that the platform for the to and fro stations co exist on the same platform. Something to take note of."
"Brilliant, everything works and is easy tom understand","Everything in the metro works well and is easy to understand, despite the relative lack of English explanations around. There are enough signs to understand where to go. The ticket system is efficient and cheap. This is the best way to get around Busan"
Awfully crowded ,"I’m going to write the same review as I the one about Seoul Metro. Too many people there. How come it’s so crowded? Alright, I understand that Seoul had around 25 million people living there, but Busan? I wish I took a taxi."
Revisiting Busan,"Coming from a country where we constantly read of our MRT breaking down, the subway in Busan [and also in Seoul] was exellent by comparison. Journey starts from about Won1,400 and hence more worthwhile if for longer journeys. Ride was smooth and efficient. Announcement was timely and appropriate. Certainly something that our Singapore MRT can learn from rather than 'helicopting' Army Generals with no relevant experience to run and ruin our transportation system after such hefty investment. Piss a lot of us off."
Works well enough ,"Covers most (but not all) of the major attractions in Busan. Easy to use since most travelers will be using just Line 1 and 2. A minor inconvenience is that display in some trains is not clearly visible in all parts of the carriage so one needs to be a bit vigilant. As in Japan, talking over the cell phone is frowned upon and the seats for the elderly are what they are: lots of young people do stand and leave the seats for the more needy which is nice."
"All good and convenient, but","I visited Busan for the firt time and planned to get to my hotel from the international airport, and i hoped that at the tickets machine I will pay by credit card, but unfortunately there was no that option. And, all the atms around couldnt give me any cash for some reasons. so it was a journey))) For my luck one korean girl helped me and purchased a ticket)) The amount of money was small, so i was pleased of that kindness.Thanks korean girls! On the whole metro is great, as all Korea)"
Efficient. Adequate English signage.,"You will need exact change (change machines) to purchase your Metro card, step 1, then load it with value, step 2. We took a number of buses as well as the #1 and #2 Metro lines. You have up to 30 minutes to transfer to your next ride. You have to swipe your Metro card to exist the Metro station. If you are going to transfer, you need to be sure to swipe your card when you exist the bus. The only slight problem we had was at one Metro station, trying to get to the correct side for the direction we wanted to travel."
Nice!,"They hire friendly retired people to answer your questions, recommending you the best route to and from the place. Speaking wonderful English. That is grateful! As there are not many lines running, the travel is quite enjoyable! "
Easy to use,"The Busan subway system is easy to use. It is affordable and clean. It doesn't go to all of the top attractions, however, so be prepared for transfers via bus as well. "
So great,"Easy, cheap and fast. English menu option and simple to use. I doubt that there is a better way to travel. "
Easy and convenient ,"Four metro lines. Primarily used lines 1 & 2 to access most sites. One zone one way 1,400 KRW & two zone one way 1,600 KRW. Day pass 5,000 KRW. Flat rate regardless of distance. Frankly, if you are more than two people travelling short distance taxis also good option. "
"Busan Station is the central station for Busan, the station is located in front of the KTX station in Busan.","Large station and conveniently located at the front of the KTX station next to the bus stops. The subway metro system in Busan is sufficient and can get you anywhere in town. Most of it is also in English. Once you get used to the stops and the direction the trains go, you can navigate and travel Busan easily. You can also take the bus which is very affordable, or a taxi for convenience and the rates are pretty good in Korea. We took the metro from Busan Station to Suyeong where we stayed to Kyungsan University and Haeundae. While we took the bus to Oryukdo and taxis to Songdo Beach Skywalk and Busan Air Cruise as well as Gamcheon Village for about $6 each time. "
Incredibly easy way to see the city on your own from a cruise--day passes let you go all over,"The city has lots of places to see, including beautiful parks and lots of shopping and the huge Beomeosa Temple. Get a map at the visitor's info desk at the pier. It shows many main roads and sites along with a basic metro route map, but a real metro route map is better.See the Tripadvisor pictures for a route map, and print a copy to take with you for reference.The ship docks at a port in the city near the back entrance of the rail station, but the walk out of the port to the rail station is more than 1km. The metro system is accessible in front of the rail station (Busan Station stop). A complimentary shuttle was provided that drops passengers near the front of the rail station, where the entry to the metro system exists. (NOTE: Starting in 2018, cruise ships dock at a NEW International Cruise/Passenger Terminal in Busan more than 3km away from the old International Cruise/Passenger Terminal. Not all city taxi drivers are aware of this change, so it is important to carry the terminal/port address with you if you are getting a taxi back to the ship or they might take you to the wrong place).The easiest self-guided transportation is via the metro that runs throughout town at regular intervals along several routes. A map of the city and metro system routes are available at the terminal, however, the numbering of the stops on that map did not match the actual station numbers, so pay close attention to the names of the stops. We downloaded/printed a basic route map before we left. It turned out to be correct and very helpful for two reasons:1) we could track our stations more accurately and, more importantly2) this system required you to know, as is typical, the station at the end of the line you wanted in order to go to the correct platform, but unlike other metro systems, once you got to your platform, the only information available to double check your choice was your current station name, along with the previous station and next station on that route (so a good, and accurate, route map was very helpful). Once on the metro, station names are pronounced in Korean, then English, but can be hard to hear.You should also note that several seats in the cars are designated for handicapped or elderly passengers. If you sit in those seats, you are expected to offer your seat to anyone older that boards. The cars get crowded, so standing is common.Busan has numerous large parks throughout the city, and interesting shopping lots of places, but the most convenient shopping was 2 stops west of the Busan Station metro stop (at the Nampo metro stop), where the metro stops at a large mall that is several stories tall and next to an underground shopping flea market type area with wares ranging from trinkets to beautiful solid wood furniture.We went north to the Beomeosa Temple, accessible from the metro near the end of the orange line, but getting to the ENTRANCE to the temple grounds requires an uphill climb 3 km away from the metro stop, so walking should not be taken lightly. A bus (currently route 90) runs from town to the temple entrance, but I don’t know the cost or where to board the bus. The metro route takes about 45 min each way from Busan Station to the Beomeosa metro stop, so travel time should be taken into account.The temple is another 1 km from its entrance on the road, but the walk is beautiful as you wander up the hillside past carved stone markers, flowering trees and a nice stream. The temple is one of the largest I have seen. Restrooms and a cafe are available on-site. The grounds alone were worth the stop. We enjoyed our time there before walking back to the metro for our return to the city.Both the metro stations and the Beomeosa Temple had restrooms, but I always suggest you take toilet paper and hand wipes with you in case they are out. We wanted to go to several of the nice parks all over the city, but we ran out of time.We walked back to the ship (through the rail station, out the back exit which was marked on signs after getting into the center of the station) because the shuttle lines were way too long (3 busloads to wait). It was easy to see and track the ship from the train station exit, but it was more than a 1km walk once you exited the rail station."
"Quick, easy to navigate","Easy to find tickets, destinations. Great way to get around with and relatively cheap. Lots of shops down by subway too."
"Good Metro, Not enough english","After visitng the Seoul metro, the Busan metro is a step down. Even though its a good transportation means, with good lines and great frequency, it lacks the English support and ease of use you can find in Seoul."
Easy and efficient like Seoul metro ,It’s abit more expensive than Seoul metro but very minute. A good way to travel around busan to main sites for holiday. And very easy to navigate with clear English signs and announcements on board. The people here are generally more warm than Seoul. 
Very handy,"Don’t bother trying to use your “google translate skills” on taxis. Just take metro and you are safe, fast and furious!"
Long long underground corridor,Keep on walking and watching the stores along the mile+ underground corridor especially in poor weather.
Very cool,"I really enjoyed walking throught the busan Metro, seeing all the shops and being able to keep out of the cold, what a great idea. I wish other cities caught on to this idea, it's simply fantastic"
Convenient,"The Busan Metro was very convenient and affordable. My friends and I took the metro quite often, and it is very well connected. Though there are too many steps and there's a lot of walking inside the station, time can be killed by window shopping, or actually shopping in the million shops underground."
Convenient,The station is convenient for the visitors. The Busan Metro is also situated closed to KTX station. We used this station as our base to visit Busan.
Convenient To Use,"Our cruise ship shuttle bus dropped us off at the Busan Station and we took the subway train to the Shinsagae Centum City department store which requires us to transfer to another line. It was not difficult to navigate as station names are both in Korean and English (some signs are even in Japanese & Chinese). The stations are also numbered so you could just follow the numbers and decide where you need to get on or off. However, one confusing aspect is at the station, some directional signs are only in Korean hence it may get a little confusing in determining the direction of each train. The overhead readings at the train entrance door provides the next station the train will stop so you could better understand the direction the train is going. Easy to navigate once you get used to the system..."
Mode of transportation,For ease of movement in Seoul.. Take a train.. Either subway or inter state operates by Korail. Just buy T Money the form of payment and top up when the balance go low... Do it at any convenience store... 
Easy to navigate,Very easy to get around. Very clean. very reliable. Best way to get around Busan. Highly recommend. Very safe.
Super easy,We used the Tmoney cards and it was all such a breeze. We took the subway Everyday of the 5 days we were there.
Easy peasy,Good fast and easy to use announcements are also in English .Very busy at times but a great way to get around.
Easy way to move around ,"The Busan metro is easy, reliable and good way to move around in Busan. It covers most of the city and doesn’t cost much. Everything is in English and every station and metro has maps for your information."
"Efficient, but you have to be awake","The metro in Busan is efficient, but there are no digital signs to follow in the metro so you have to follow where you are in order to get off at the right stop."
"Convenient, clean and big enough ","Convenient, clean and big enough. The metro are so lively. There are many shops and convenient stores around the station. "
Thumbs up,"I used it on daily basis for my 3-day conference at BEXCO, from Heundae beach. Efficient, clean, punctual.....Perfect!"
A great way to get around Busan!,"The Busan Metro is one of the highlights of a visit to Busan as it takes you to most points of interest around the city, quickly and efficiently. It is always anthropologically interesting to ride public transport with the locals and this was fun! "
Convenient ,"It is pretty convenient, just make sure to study the routes (number/colour lines). The exits may be confusing for first timers. Trains interval is pretty timely. Get a Tmoney card for cheaper rides and convenient "
Reliable,"Clean, fast, safe & easy to navigate between stations.For tourists, make sure to take the 1-day all access pass."
Very efficient,"A very efficient and clean metro service with easy access to. The train tickets are easy to get as there is an English option, then buy by pushing the line you want and click on your station."
Busan Metro,The busan metro is very efficient. A terrific network of lines that intertwine to get you across the city. Taxis are also very cheap so between the Metro and a taxi you can get anywhere relatively cheaply. The trains also come very regularly so I never worry about checking a schedule. Always one arrives within 10 mins at the most. 
Public transportation,"For busan subway, you can download from google play , ""subway"". Or you can download busan subway map with english version. Easy for you to refer. Still the easy way compare with Seoul subway. "
Easy to use and efficient,"Busan's Metro system is fast, clean, efficient and easy to navigate. For me, this was by far the best way to get around and explore the city."
Whole underground world,"Busan metro, as a rail network is really easy to use. They have a card system but the ticket machines are easy to use once you select English. What is fascinating is that you can actually walk from station to station virtually underground whilst shopping. As there are underground shops, market style where you can buy virtually anything! I saw a lot of wig shops? Very clean and very efficient."
Clean and easy,Super easy to get around. Very safe and clean. You must use cash; you can't buy a metro pass with a credit card.
Good system like Seoul but less comprehensive...... ,"Busan Metro is much smaller than Seoul Metro. Often, to go to an attraction , we had to take the buses ( or taxi, which is rather expensive).But as with Seoul Metro, it is an efficient & clean system. Similarly be prepared for long walks & climb upstairs. But stations here are smaller, thereby it helps.And the station here seems to have more escalators as well.The T-Money card can be used here as well for both Metro & buses. Get one to save the hassles, uncertainty & ticket machine queues."
Great for public transportation,"We used the Metro to get around Busan for four days and ended up taking only one taxi when we had to schlep our suitcases to the bus station to travel to Gyeongju on the express bus. The Metro trains run frequently and are clean, and the locals were very friendly and helpful in Busan. S Korean metros (Busan, Daegu, and Seoul, all of which we used extensively) unfortunately have alot of stairs and only a few escalators. It helped us stay in shape, so we didn't mind. I think it must be difficult for the elderly though, though there is usually an elevator available."
Really easy,"Busan has 4 lines, ORANGE LINE 1 : Dadaepo Beach - Nopo GREEN LINE 2 : Yangsan - Jangsan BROWN LINE. 3 : Daejeo - Suyeong BLUE LINE. 4 : Minam - AnpyeongAnd have 2 other lines.BUSAN GIMBAE LIGHT RAIL TRANSIT : Kaya Univ. - SasangThat line show in purple color.DONGHAE LINE : Bujeon - Ilgwang. This line show in a light blue color.You can see the name of the previous station, the name of the current station were you are and the name of the next station were the train is goin. Names are show in Korean And English, the train annunce every station were is stoping in Koren,English,Japanes and Chinese. And let you know if the door that is going to open is on the right side or the left side."
Great Humetro!,"The trains speak in Korean, English, Chinese and Japanese! The signs are largely in at least Korean and English! It is clean, nice and efficient. I love it! I got the Humetro card: Won2000, exact change only. If you go where the subway (what they call it) goes, you are golden. If you have to transfer to a bus, you will often find no signs and no obvious clues. I never actually got lost in the subway/bus translations but it certainly took time and was frustrating. Lack of signs is a real problem all over Busan. On the whole, a super public transportation system."
Busan Train from Seoul,Taking KTX from Seoul to Busan was very easy. People at the information desk (which is location right in the middle of the waiting area) were very friendly and very helpful. 
tourist friendly,The public transit in Korea is very good and tourist friendly. The subway schedule starts at 5 in the morning and ends at 11:30 in the evening.
Use your Seoul subway card,"Not many know that you can use your Seoul subway card here. No top up cash credit facility, so be sure to top up in Seoul becoming using in Busan. Subway is convenient and easy to use. It is the best way to get around in Busan."
Little more you could want,"Given that the purpose of a train is to transport people from A to B, should said device achieve this result, then it has proved its worth. However, there are many differences between subway/metro/MRT etc systems. The Busan Metro, just like that in Seoul, does exactly what it is supposed to do whilst providing excellent comfort, ease of use, it is inexpensive, there are multitudes of entrances (actually this can be a little disorientating for the newbie), and if you miss a train, there's another within a few short minutes.Finally, in most cases the Metro or Subway stations are veritable miniature cities offering a myriad of shops.So it ticks all the boxes."
English friendly and can use our T-Money,"Koreans have great public transit, including their subway system. A T-money card will work on all buses and subways nationwide, so what you bought in Seoul works here too. The signs have English as do the announcements. Very user friendly."
Quickest way to travel around Busan,"We stayed 1 week in Busan, travelling by private car, bus, taxi, feet, and the metro. On one occasion the taxi cost was very high due to traffic, whereas the metro would have cost one-tenth of the taxi fare. Small notes and loose change is required but there is no shortage of that in Korea (just buy some chocolate or something at a small shop in order to get the notes/coins). Might be a multi-travel pass available but we didn't look into this. Very clean and efficient metro system."
Efficient and quite capillar,"Good, efficient and goes to most places, many stations have few step free access if you have suitcases, so worth checking before you get there"
"Great Location, Great Staff /Service","The hotel provides a free shuttle service to/from Hongkong Station.Most of the staff are very helpful and diligent and very pleasant ,from the Concierge to Check in to the restaurant Playt ( Ken , Kim and Marissa were very efficient and pleasant )"
A Grade Metro System,"Well nearly A grade, if it could go to a few more places that would be nice. Get yourself a Travel card which is so much easier that trying to workout the cost each time. You will soon work out that the metro is one of the easiest ways around Busan, and after just one Taxi trip you realise the distances mean that Taxi's can be reserved for those end bits where the train doesn't go."
Only way to travel,"The subway is exceptionally clean! It's quiet. Me and a couple buddies were loud and someone politely asked us to keep it down. I actually appreciated it. People were friendly. Occasionally, someone will come on and sell stuff. Or guy wad selling band aids. It only cosy $5 for the day. "
An excellent mode of transport for the tourist,"We travelled extensively on the Busan Metro visiting many places and sights. We bought a day pass for KRW 4,500/pax, which allowed us unlimited travel on any metro train for the day. The pass is not valid on the Busan-Gimhae LRT to the airport. We also purchased a T-Money card with preloaded value for use on buses and at times when we do not have an all day pass for the train. There were very few occasions when we had to take the bus to visit some tourist attraction as most places are reachable by using the trains coupled with a short walk. There are only 4 lines on the metro and with the help of a map or google, it is very simple to navigate our way around. The metro is regular, prompt and efficient and we saved a lot with our unlimited travel day pass."
Effecient travelling,Fast and effecient travelling. Easy to navigate between station and easy to purchase tickets to go about. 
Very affordable & dependable way to get around,"I hound the trains to be very timely, clean and efficient. They were also not terribly crowded when I used them. Definitely cheaper than a taxi and much faster than busses."
Busan Metro,"on time clean as all metro around south korea , only 4 lines so it is to navigate around it even from the first time"
Good,It is not crowded as what I experienced in Seoul. The waiting place with ample of spaces. You don't need to walk a long way from interchange 
Very good system ,The metro system is very good and easy to navigate with each line colour coded and names on English as well as Korean. Each station has a number also making it easier. Main issue is to make sure you are headed in right direction there is a red arrow on the station list above the doors on each line indicating the direction of travel. The rate is calculated by station travelled to unlike buses which is a basic fare of 1300 w no matter how far you travel. The ticket machines are in English just select English then the line number and then station required and how many tickets you need. The amount to pay is indicated. The machinesdon't take large notes you can change these in the note changer also located at same place. If travelling to airport on purple line being the light rail you will need a separate ticket being a blue disk. The same ticket machine process applies. 
Nice & clean metro,It was a fast public transportation in Busan. I will try again when I visit there in the future. Nice & clean metro.
Very convenient!,"A good metro system running through the whole town. It is a fast way of getting around. It is well maintained, but the subway in Seoul is far more advanced. "
Surprised! Not Crowd!,"Been to Busan for three days, and rode on Busan Metro every day. To my surprise, it was not as crowd as other cities' public transportation systems. No matter it was a Saturday morning, a Sunday evening or a Monday morning, I could easily find a seat and travel comfortably everywhere.Buy a Day Pass for just 5000 won, and you can have unlimited rides in Busan.If the day pass could be used on other vehicles, eg bus, would be the BEST ever."
Excellent Metro,"The Metro is modern, efficient and very clean. Also caters to the needs of special people, senior people and people carrying luggage.Platforms have screen doors for safety.Very easy to use the automatic ticket vending machines. "
Easy to use and get around,Average trips W1200 and you either buy a pass or single journeys. Clean and well signed.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.
Easy system,"Easy system, automatic ticket machines and metro plans are in English. Most of the stations are really clean and have convenient stores inside."
Simple to take Metro,Metro is easily understood. U only need to be able to rad and understand maps. Travelling can be a bit expensive
Trip to Busan,"If you have been to Seoul, There is not much to see in Busan. It was quite an experience taking the bullet train though. Maybe if you are a big spender, then it's enjoyable"
Nice & accessible ,"Comparing to Seoul, Busan metro is much newer and cleaner. Their stations are neater than Seoul too. Very accessible to many places "
Nice Metro System,"Nice and well-connected metro system, it was really easy to get around the city. If you have traveled by metro in other large cities in Asia (Tokyo, Taipei, etc) it's very easy to figure out. Just make sure you know which direction you're going on the line and which exit you want to use when you get off (it can screw you up a bit if you pick the wrong exit). There are maps to help you figure out the right way to go, or you can try asking an attendant if one is available."
We rode to and from Busan and Haeundae,Nice and clean plus a speedy line very good for going Busan to Haeundae and return. Trains were nice and clean with easy signage for the Engliah
great way to travel anywhere in busan,easily accessible to touriststhere is underground malls everywhereyou can transfer to line 1 to 4 and get to gimhae airport
"Extremely well organized, practical, safe and clean.","~> No problem to find the subway stations. They are well indicated.~> All destinations are written in Korean as well as in English. ~> Each subway line has a specific colour and also a specific number. You shouldn't get lost. Also - inside each car - you have maps showing the names of all the stops on your line. They are written in Korean and in English.~> Make sure you get the right name/right spelling of your destination because Korean can be confusing as a destination may appear to have different names. They are different. Ex.: Jangsan and Yangsan.~> Just in case, make sure you have your destination written down in English AND in Korean as few Koreans read/speak/understand English. ~> If you need info, ask someone from the younger generation. Young people tend to understand some English and, if needed, will look it up for you on Internet.~> The subway is very clean, well lit, safe and spacious.~> You can either buy a card or a ticket from a machine. Be aware that at smaller stations some distributors accept only certain notes or coins.~> Once you get off, it's interesting to know that a station has different exits. All exits are numbered. If you have to be somewhere specific, ask at which exit of a particular station you have to get out. Some stations have only 2 exits whilst others can have up to 18 or more.~> A lot of subway stations interconnect underground. You can walk from one station to the other. Some are kilometers long; some are like shopping malls with food stalls and shops. This is very practical on rainy days ... even if you don't need to take the subway. ~> All stations have clean toilets. Make sure you have toilet paper or tissues with you at all times because sometimes they run out of toilet paper. ~> At the exits of all subway stations you'll find connecting busses.Taking the subway can be an experience in itself. It can also be a fun experience when you realise that you are the only one in your car not looking either at your phone or in a mirror . As the subway stations are interconnected so are the Koreans.Enjoy the ride !"
Confusing at first ride,"U need to know where the end stop of metro and get into the correct gantry. It's different from those at Seoul whereby u can just walk to the opposite side to hop on metro to your destination. Before you enter any gantry, lookout for overhead signs telling u direction the metro heading to."
best way to transport in Busan,I live in busan and i can assure its one of the finest mode of transportation in Busan.. I think if you looking for travel around busan it cover most of the place.. even Gimahe city as well. with busan metro card you can also avail connecting buses all around the city. 
Not so easy to use,"Be careful with the entrances and directions. You should choose the direction before you enter, otherwise you will have to buy a new ticket to use another entrance. But it is easy to operate if you read the signs attentively."
Clean Fast and Passenger Friendly ,"Next to Seoul's Metro this is the best subway system I have ridden. It is very large with multiple lines. It has well marked route maps, signs that are informative on platforms and speaking and visual signs on the cars themselves. Employees are friendly and a few have a good command of English. It is an extremely clean system, and appears to be safe for riders at all hours. The T-Money Card makes things so much easier especially if you plan to be in Korea for more than a few days. Adding additional funds to the card is extremely easy. "
Great metro system.,Used this for a couple of days and it was really good. Your Seoul metro card will work here and its worth buying one. Unlike any other metro I've been on you cant change platform (change direction on the line) without going through barriers and they will charge you. So make sure you pick the right direction! 
Great Metro System!!,Cannot fault this metro system. The metros arrive often and get you all over Busan. Majority of stations are spotless with toilet facilities! 
Croud of people,But u know when u exit the metro so beautoful outside! Wonderful. But till 9pm we arrived at 8pm so it was amazing. The station is big enough. If u wish to rent a car in closed places u will not find such offices after 8pm. Also there we found one office but we couldn't get becoz there u can rent only with reservation. So just for ur info
Great transport,"Really easy to use, clean and efficient and used it to travel around Busan between my hotel, eating locations and sights."
Convenient and cheap,We bought the all day pass with the help of a Korean volunteer who helped us through the process we then just hopped on and off the metro's using a pocket size metro guide. The trains were clean and frequent. Great way to get about.
Touring Cyclists ,"The Busan Metro is the best and easiest way to get to all the attractions in the city of Busan and other districts. The connections are flawless, and should you need help, we found the locals are very friendly and willing to help when approached."
Appreciate!,"Great subway system here, take you to almost all the major tourist attractions! Easy to ride and great value. They even have some older folks helping out puzzled visitors like us. Friendly and helpful and so kind:) "
Access all sightseeing spots with metro!,The metro network in Busan covers nearly all sightseeing spots of Busan. Try the 1-day pass at only 4500 won with unlimited ride per day with the metro.
Always full,"If you are used to Seoul metro this is not like it. I guess it is samller and when it is full of turists you will always get in completely full trains. Other than that, it is very clean and with good directions."
Convenient and Affordable!,"Was happy to see that the T-money card we purchased for Seoul was able to be used here in Busan as well. Maps and announcements are in English as well, making it easy to travel."
Easy to use,Even if you don't speak Korean it is very easy to use.Affordable and clean this is the best way to travel around the city. Day passes are a good option
Hints on this place,"1) In most cases people trevel to Busan after Seoul or Incheon. If you are going to use metro more than once use T-money card — it's universal transportation card in Korea. You can get it in a vending machine in the Incheon airport. Put money on a card and pay for metro on entrance.2) Generally you can return any ticket and get refund! Don't drop even used single ride ticket. Use deposit refund machines that are usually situated near vending machines. But in Busan I haven't seen them (but I think they exist). In any cases, you can drop your T-card on your way back to Incheon.3) Sometimes using metro is not the quickest way to get to. Prepare for 1-1,5 hour trips in Busan metro and don't be late to your train!4) Platforms and tunnels are often very long. You may walk 150 m just to interchange from line to line on one station.5) Watch for special stickers on seats for pregnant women. )6) WC in a stations.7) Elevators."
Best and cheapest way to travel!,"The Metro is a very convenient way to travel around Busan. It gets you to the chic-est and most hip places in Busan like Pus. Nat. University and Dongnae. Most Metro stations are connected to the subway lines which take you to an even wider range of places. The intervals of each train were 2-3 minutes which is super convenient for Busan citizens and travellers alike. If you plan to travel around Busan by the Metro and subway, you can find the map of the routes at any Tourist Information counter."
Not Tokyo or Singapore,"Easy to get around, on time, mostly clean, and affordable. There aren't as many trains as I'd like, but it gets you around."
Super Efficient,Busan Metro has an app for those who want to be super organized while traveling. Busan Station has a tourist center with people who went out of their way to help me find my guesthouse.
Metro experience,The metro is very helpful in commuting and convenient. All the station names being in English is a big plus along with the easy for buying ticket. The day pass is very affordable and announcements are very and no confusion arises during alighting at any particular stop.
Easy to use and inexpensive.,"As resident of Busan I use time to time the subway as there is no hassle for searching car park, especially in downtown area. The ticketing machine is easy and self explained with English option. In general, the subway is clean and easy to use. Signing in some station for switch to other line could be better."
Mordern Metro,Very modern station with clear signages makes it easy for travellers. The ticketing counter personel also speaks and communicates in english. Retail shops and F&B outlets available. 
Easy as! ,"Easy to use, same as the Seoul Metro download the app and you can see where to go and how many stops till you get off.Much cheaper then taxis. "
Small change needed! ,"We took the metro from Nampo to Beomeosa and back. Very easy to navigate and tourist-friendly. The trains looked new. Very clean and comfortable. The ticket machines at Nampo only took 1000 won notes or coins, so be sure to carry change. No cards. "
Great way to get around Busan,I was based very near Seomyeon where Metro lines 1 and 2 intersect so it was a good place from which to explore the city. Seomyeon has a large underground market place and exit bring you up to part of the city that offers plenty of places to eat and shop. I found the Metro to be quick and efficient. For female safety be aware there are designated carriages for females only that are used during peak rush hour times.
Bad subway.,"Maybe is the factor Ive in japan for a long time. I get used to a subway with stable and comfort trip. The only bad thing here is the driver will try to brake several times to make the train stop. Doesn't like in japan which driver can make a comfort stop for the train. This make the train will swing and swing when the driver trying to stop the train, this can be dangerous when standing."
Winter holiday,It's easy to travel around with the metro. Especially if you travelled on metro in Seoul which is more complicated. Most stations are connected to places of interest.
Excellent ,"The UK has a lot to learn! Free access to wifi! Clean, regular and cheap, easy to use as the ticket buying can also be done in English!Best to do your homework first on your location and destination Highly recommend just going down onto the subway as there's plenty of little shops to enjoy and browse through"
Good subway,Subway service of Busan very effective. There are also places to walk around Busan. Maps English mini subway route that would allow us to travel around Busan. Good subway
Decent but antiquated,"Very convenient for most of the places you would want to visit in Busan, and although somewhat antiquated, still far better than anything Australia has to offer ! Note that your Seoul metro tickets also work in Busan (Myki card doesn't work in Sydney, and often not even in Melbourne...)"
Tourist Unfriendly,"Limited info in English on the Transport Cards - so paid for individual trips by cash, which is fine, but the ticket machines time-out quickly if you don't have change ready, and only accept 1,000 won notes and no bigger. Many stations don't have change machines nor an info booth. The trains are very safe, which is great, but the older folk tend to shove their way in and out. "
"Well marked, easy to use","Busan Subway is easy to use - be sure to download the app to help you with times. Plenty of places to change lines, all the stops are announced in English, Chinese, Japanese and Korean (I believe that is correct). And the signs all follow those languages as well. Places to eat and shop are part of the underground metro experience as well of course. "
Very good metro service,"Busan's metro service is very efficient. Also, have many information locations throughout Busan to help foreigners needs. Provided an English metro mini map of the routes to help us get around Busan."
Day Pass in 4400 won,"If you think more than 4 times per day, I suggest you can buy the day pass. Each time for subway is 1100won, day pass only 4400 won. the best famous station is 111. "
Bring you to attractions quickly,It is clean and quiet. The heat is just right. You won't feel very hot even if you don't take off your coat. 
Great metro with many connecting buses and trains to other cities,"It can be a bit confusing at first upon arriving but the helpful train station staff and signs (some in English) will enable you to find your way around. Lots of eateries for you to grab a bite before heading to your next destination. Taxis are abundant just outside the station. One negative thing is that there are no lifts though if you arrive via Busan Metro and you have to climb a long flight of stairs up! So far during my many trips during the last two years, no lifts were added yet. However, if you arrived via Busan Station which is next to Busan Metro, then there are lifts there for your convenience."
"Clean, fast and extremely convenient",The metro is the cheapest and fastest way of getting around in Busan. It is extremely convenient and close to many tourist attractions. It is simple to use and I would recommend getting a T-money card as it is cheaper and saves on the hassle compared to buying tickets.
Convenient,You can using your T card or buy single way ticket. Of course T card is more easy as can use for Bus as well. Can get from GS 25 with KRW 3000 without any credit inside. Can top up in GS 25 or any metro station. Metro Station require minimum KRW 1000 for top up.
"Convenient Metro in Busan, South Korea","We took a couple of trains to go to and from Gwangalli beach and see the fireworks festival it was easy to get around. There are signs everywhere and during the ride, announcements are also in English. To buy tickets at the machine make sure you have the 1000 Won notes only. In case you don't have them, you can break your 10000 bills at another machine nearby. In case the machine runs out of bills and gives an error, like it happened to us, you can talk to an attendant in the office nearby and he can change your big bills in smaller ones. In any station and underground paths, there are several shops and vendors selling any kind of stuff. Overall it seemed to us very efficient and organized."
Efficient ways to reach Tourist Attractions,"Busan Metro is very easy to use, efficient and less complex than Seoul Metro. Many tourists attractions can be reached by metro, as for me I used it to visit Gamcheon Culture Village (additional bus trip from the nearby bus stop), BIFF, Jagalchi, Yongdusan Park, Haeundae Beach and Dongbaek Island."
Covinient,We used the metro on the first day and then used the tour bus to look at the entire city. The subway is easy use and you can save money instead of using the cab. Highly recommend using the subway. 
Convenient transportation for travel,The subway linked with most of the tourist attractions. The subway transfers are clearly directed and you will not easily get lost.
An attraction?,"Well, not really, but it is an excellent, cheap and perfectly clean way of getting around this city, even with absolutely no Korean. The map is really easy to use and the trains are large with lots of seating."
Best way to get around Busan,"The Busan metro is by far the easiest way to get around, For tourists, the cheapest and easiest option is to buy the 1 day ticket for W4500 which allows unlimited use for the day of purchase and is good value if making mote than 2 trips a day. Ticket machines only take W1000 notes."
Simple and efficient Metro System,"The Busan Metro is very efficient, and simple to use. If you have a T-Money card from Seoul, you can use it in Busan, but remember to top up in Seoul, as Seoul issued cards cannot be topped up in Busan, as far as I am aware..."
Excellent for transport,"The Busan Metro is less complex than the Seoul Metro hence it is easier to go around The station signs are large and clear, easily seen from inside the train and are much better than those in Seoul. It is also quite economical to travel by the metro. One should get a T-money card to save the hassle of buying individual tickets.Some websites recommended the Cashbee card, but at the Gimhae airport the Cashbee card was not available, so I ended up with the T-money card. The latter is usable in Seoul as well and is practically the same as the Cashbee for travelling on the metro."
Efficient and convenient,"it's very good and cheap ( around $1,20 ) and you can connect your trip with the buses, if you board within 30 min; with many lines, you can get to almost every attraction in Busan"
Efficient and Trustworthy,"Busan Metro impressed me in the sense its frequency is pretty decent (every 4-5 minutes), there are English/Mandarin words read out when nearing each station. The signboards are also in English and show the more visited stations, which is definitely helpful with tourists."
Save of the day,"The metro in Busan is very good, takes you close to many places, we used the bus only once.Moreover, I would like to mention it's clean, not overpopulated, comes every few minutes and generally taken care of."
Busan Metro,"Easy, convenient & economical transportation choice! Clear Metro line maps, English sign board you can never missed the location you wish to go."
An excellent and cheap way to travel accross the city of Busan -,"Arriving at the City Bus terminal, the number 1 line takes you right into the center of Busan in about 1/2 hour. It is a very convenient and cheap way to get to and through the city!"
More touristy friendly with English/ Chinese wordings,"Personally, I find the busan metro more user friendly than the trains in seoul as there are English/Chinese wordings illustrated in the metro station but in very small font and above the ground with lightly bright neon lights of the exit at night. Just that certain stations are not clearly illustrated in the direction as the fonts are too small and you might miss it. And if you missed the stop and need to change train to another direction, you may need to re-entry again which have to pay. "
Subways from the 70's,"The Busan subway system is very poor in comparison to the Seoul metro. You must be a ticket every time you want to ride the subway since the stations don't accept cards. The inside of the trains are clean but you feel like you're traveling back in time, to the 1960's/70's. The Busan metro is not developed and has not kept up with all of the tourism it's been getting for the past 10 years. There are only 2 or 3 lines and no express train, which means it can take over one hour to get from one part of the city to the other. Come on Busan!!!"
Easy way to move around in Busan,"Busan metro is similar to Seoul metro but less complicated. You can use T money card which is also usable at Seoul metro. Most of the Busan highlights can be reached through Busan metro. Just get a map or download Busan metro apps for easy navigation. Signboard or announcement are available in both Korean and English and for some famous destination, Chinese are available as well."
Totally Convenience,I love to visit country that has subway/public transport. As backpacker this transportation totally 100% useful. Many attraction place near subway station. But be carefull as elders are 90% population in Busan (in my opinion) and they seem harsh when talking but actually not. I did seat at specific area (for elders/pregnant woman/disable) accidentally and being asked to get up. At first I was shocked and bit sad (the elders scold me (T^T) ) after a few minutes the elders before ask me to seat at different area (I didnt seat even tho there is many seat as I didnt know where I can seat) and show me the seat and he talk in Korean (of course I couldnt understand it ahaha) and finally I understand what that seat means.
A unique modern transportation,"Busan Metro is a copy of complex Seoul MRT system with less complexity. It covers also most of Busan places of interest for both locals and visitors. Even though it is a modern transportation system Busan MRT is somewhat unique arrangement of each destination platform. Between platform of destination direction is separated by its real means, ticketing system and entry gate. For visitors especially who purchase single trip MRT ticket please carefully look at which direction or platform you are going to, even in single line station. Once you enter the wrong platform toward direction where you are going to you have to go out from the platform and purchase another single trip ticket. Help desk is very rare in the station, but it is fine. The stations mostly have more modern facilities compared to Seoul Metro where in average equipped with escalators."
Efficient modern system,We found the Metro accessible and easy to use - even with no Korean. It is modern and airconditioned - a blessing in the heat of Summer.
So easy to navigate.,"Each stop has it's on jingle so remember your hotel station's one so you know when to get off.I have to write 100 characters here but what more can you say about a train system?It's clean, safe and cheap.OK trip advisor? Are you happy now?"
A good way to get around,"It a very cheap way of getting around,especially if one is staying near one of the stations.Be prepared for walking and climbing steps,Signs are in korean,but people are friendly,not much of escalators around.People tend to help,get a map which can help navigate"
Good Transport System To Visit Most of The Tourists Attractions,"I normally travel by taxi or metro to get to the many tourists attractions in Busan city. Busan Metro stations are clean and user friendly, buying tickets at the vending machines is easy and the metro ride is smooth. I would recommend a T-Money Card if you use the metro frequently as it is very convenient.Most of the major metro stations have underground retail shops/restaurants and this is a good rainy day activity."
Very Clean Metro,"Clean, smooth and very easy to use, we used the one day 'Metro Ticket' which can be purchased from most if not all metro stations"
Just metro,I took the metro in busan. I don't really know what else to say. It was clean and the traim was punctual....great 
Convenient Metro,I used the Busan Subway when i visited the first time. Right from the Bus Terminal you can catch the subway all the way down to the beach like Haeundae and Gwangali. Very convenient.
The metro,Clean healthy speedGreat metro in BusanI advise you to take a several day fare much cheaper than individual fareCan acces to every nice place of busan
Easy,"This is a easy subway and can take you to the tourist attraction. Are four lines and you can go to Haeundae Beach, temples, the Jagalchi Market and others. "
Take T-money card and use it,"Great! Train go every few minutes. T-money card cost 2-4 euros and each ride 1 euro irregardless of the distance. Clean, fast and cheap - no reason not to use it."
Safe and reliable,We took train half the time (cab the other half since it's really cheap). The train is clean and safe. And it's easy to navigate.
It plays a song when the train is coming!,"Like Seoul, trains are infrequent so you might have to wait. But they alert you with a lovely tune when the train is arriving and it is super easy to navigate. Just make sure you get a travel card as it makes everything easier! "
Wonderful,"Such a fantastic underground system. Very cheap and easy to use. Clean, simple and English friendly for foreign visitors"
Good service ,Busan metro seems a good way of transportation while someone is travelling to busan. Station names both in English and Chinese languages are announed which helps traveller to go to the right destination. 
Good way to travel around Busan with cheap budget,"Train are spacious with friendly staff.There are plenty of shops to choose from. Signage are everywhere with multiligual to guide you from one place to the other.Announcements at stations for arriving trains are in Korean, followed by English, then Japanese and Mandarin. We can used T-money that we buy at Seoul. Really convenient."
Standard Subway Station,"The excitement is not found in the station but rather just outside of it. Welcome to what used to be known as Texas Street. You are sure to see some interesting characters around here any hour of the day. This is also the location of what is supposed to be Chinatown but I usually just see Russians and Filipinos serving Cock tails or grilling up street food. Check it out if you are waiting for a train and have some time to wander, you may find something you like!"
Great Inexpensive Way to Travel All Around Town,"All directional signs on the Busan Metro are written in both Korean and English, and the voice announcement in the trains indicating the upcoming station, possible line transfer and exiting side are all spoken in Korean, followed by English. Announcements at stations for arriving trains are in Korean, followed by English, then Japanese and Mandarin. All stations are numbered and the first numeral of the number is the same as the line number, e.g. station 123 is on line 1.The machines only take local currency, however, ATM machines are in the stations or convenience stores outside on the streets.Very clean, efficent and reliable. Stations underground extend below the streets and are good way to get away from the hot weather.A good tip is to look at the vicinity map when you exit the gates. Look at where you are and where you want to go and identify the corresponding exit (i.e. A1,A2). Then follow the signs to that exit."
World class metro station,Very spacious.Friendly staff.Plenty of shops to choose from.Signages everywhere to guide you from one place to the other.
Very good way to travel around Busan,"Very convenient service in a very complex web of trains. Information is easy to find and there are even phone apps you can download to get more information. There is enough English information and directions for the non-Korean speaking traveler. Easy to use T-money cards are used for rides, and can be easily topped up at each station. Just a caution for those who have difficulties climbing stairs to seek out lifts/elevators as some underground stations do not have escalators and stairs can be very high. Some stations have many shops. "
Convenience,The Metro coverage is good that make travel easy. The ticket price is reasonable and day pass is available for visitor with good price. One area for improvement is the sign board in foreign languages is not common. Workers there are helpful but majority do not speak English.
Convenient and Easy to use ,Been using the metro when travelling in Busan.Most of the location can reach using it. Except those like Gamcheon Village you can get a bus.
"Safe, fast and easy to use! ",This was my 3rd trip to Busan and I use the metro to commute to our schools as well as all over the city. The ticket stations have menus in English and all the stations have romanized Korean names if you don't read Hangul. Super easy and I prefer it to sitting in traffic in a taxi. 
Cheap and efficient,Absolutely spotless cheap and fast ticket machines have English option and the shops there are really good
Similar to Other City But Very Poor Area Coverage,The metro is similar to the other cities in the world but they are just cleaner than average. The only disadvantage about the metro system in Busan is that the coverage is very poor. There are lots of tourist attraction which is not covered by the Metro.
Very good,take metro. cheap & convenient. clean. Water dispenser located near every subway station for your convenience. Can refill drinking water anytime.
"Efficient and clean, people mover","This subway system is well worth considering when moving around Busan. Its inexpensive and efficient. I paid krw20,000 for a 7-days or 20 trips pass plus another krw2,000 for the Humetro card to load this fare for my week's visit here. If there is any suggestions, I would recommend to have more visible and better english signages in the stations."
"Efficient, safe, clean , what more could you want?","The metro covers a huge part of the city, is easy to understand, is clean and safe and there are often volunteers in the bigger stations like the one near the Busan train station, who will give you a map and help you in directions. There is an online site also. The city is big but the 2 minute per station timing estimate has always worked for me. You can use your bus/metro pass from Daegu in other cities so that was great for me. "
Easy and inexpensive!,Public transportation in Busan is amazing and seriously inexpensive. Get a T money card for easy payment and discounts on transfers. 
Easy and organized,"It is easy to understand the different lines and connections, so I never went the wrong direction. Some lines are busy during peak time of the day, and it is hard to get a seat. Be polite to the older. The metro trains are fast and often, so not much waiting for the next train. Very clean! Very safe!"
Great metro,Excellent way to get to all areas of busan and surrounds.. quick way to travel avoid traffic good English signage cheap travel use T card also can use in Seoul.
Busan Metro,"Easy to ride. There are announcements in English. The people on the metro were very friendly: We were often directed to the ""senior citizen"" seats where the older folks often ""talked"" with us using hand motions. Once I tried to use the wrong ticket to leave the subway and a band of teenagers gathered to rescue me. Very clean and well lit. Be sure to get a metro ticket."
Convenient way to move around,"It is the convenient way to move around the city centre. Make sure to get the Busan's metro map when you arrived at the airport. As long as you know where you are heading to and follow the metro map, you wont get lost. The system is very easy to understand and there are English signboard available for non-Korean.The service available until 11pm so you can maximize your activities until night time. There are subway's shopping area around Nampo (if I remember correctly) and it was fun for window shopping (when it's raining and we cant go outside)"
Excellent way to go around.,"The Busan Metro I would say is the best way to travel within Busan. It is very easy to understand and navigate specially for non-locals and covers most parts of the city. They're clean, fast, convenient, efficient, and rather cheap too."
Use it for everything,Busan's metro system can be used to get virtually everywhere you need to go in Busan. Which is convenient for going from one end to the other while avoiding traffic and staying on budget. There are 3 lines and there is an International information desk at most stations.
Convenient,Korean metro was one of the best in the world. So we tried to experience the metro ride. Convenient and a cheaper way to move around Busan 
Central station in front of Chinatown,"If you would like to stop and or walk around Chinatown you can drop off at this station. Station is quite big. You need to look around little (perhaps ask) to find lift, if you have a heavy luggage with you. As the stair is high and stiff. "
Elevators at every stop!,"Makes traveling with luggage so much easier! The system is efficient, we'll marked and bonus: uses the same transit card as the metro in Seoul. "
A great way to avoid traffic,"As a fan of all forms of rail transport I always explore networks when ever I find one and Busan's Metro definitely ticked all boxes. Signs in both Korean and English, plenty of consideration for the disabled traveller and very clean and speedy modern trains."
Efficient metro system,"The network is well expanded, works efficiently. However, we had some minor difficilties...one type of T-money card we bought in Seoul did not work on Busan Metro, we had to buy another one, just for here. The other, if the platforms are on the two sides of rails, you cannot go cannot change platforms only if you exit and enter on the other side. But this way, at the gates your t-money will be charged with the base amount, despite not travelling. So make sure, which platform you need use for boarding."
"Efficient, very easy to use","The Busan Metro is very efficient and easy to use. It has 4 lines (orange, green, blue and brown) and it's also connected to the Busan-Gimhae LRT (purple), which you use to get to and from the airport. It starts operation daily around 5:15am and ends around midnight. You can use your T-money card here."
Its just a subway?!,I kind of dont get why its an attraction.Its not special at all. It brings you from point a to point b just as its supposed to do!
Easy to travel within Busan, The day pass which costs KRW4500 made it easier to go places and there can be so much saving if one likes to move around a lot.
Perfect means of transportation in Busan,I found the Metro a perfect means of transportation in Busan.Single tickets are between 1300 and 1500 W.A day card at 4500 W
easy to maenouver but odd ticket purchase,"This subway requires that you have 1000won bills in order to buy a ticket. There is a change machine next to the ticket window. The system is well laid out, and easy to follow."
They even have a apps for the metro!,"Very informative, friendly to tourist. With ""T Money "" you can go anywhere.Plus they have a apps for iOS Ang also android that tell you very accurate info like where to switch train, what is the time table and even when to get down. AND most of the train is equip with wifi!"
Easy just like seoul,Not much but its so easy just like a normal subway. Just be like the local and try to access the public transport
Easy rides and convenient for travelling around,It's was easy to understand how the various line workWe used this many time during our 4 days stay.its beings us to many places and it's convenient located. We bought the T money in seoul and topping up is not an issue. 
Easy to use metro,Clean cars and very easy to use. Crowded in the mornings and afternoons but aren't they always. Still safe to use
Accurate time,"Easy to get around, bought one day pass as it more save than use t money or cashbee. English, chinese and japanese words are everywhere so chances to get lost are pretty much none"
Fantastic transport service!,"It may look intricate but try it, it is quite easy actually. Some tips, the machine is multi lingual so change it to English. Next press the line you want, ie Line 1, Line 2, Line 3 and the stations would appear in boxes. If you are in Line 2 station but wants to go to a Line 1 station, then you should press Line 1 to get your end destination. Then press the number of tickets you need and the amount would appear on the screen. Tip: machine takes coins and 1,000 notes only, but no worries, they have a note changer machine at the side so if you have 10,000 krw, it can be changed. This is called a single trip ticket. If you plan to travel extensively for the day, press for the 1 day ticket which is at 4,500 krw. Each zone is either 1,300 or 1,500 Krw so it can be cheaper if you buy the 1 day ticket. However, a huge tip is: If you have 4 pax, take a taxi, it is really cheaper and more comfortable."
Took a look but chose taxi,The Metro here looks as good the one in Seoul. The map is straight forward and prices very reasonable. I would not suggest this with luggage as there are stairs.
Busan metro is easy to follow,"We went to Busan on Mar 27 to 30 on our own. The subway metro is easy to follow. Just follow the map, know the start point and your destination. Follow the tracks, may have to change line depending on where you are going.If in doubt, ask for assistance, the locals especially the senior ones we have met, are very helpful.Happy travelling! "
Busan Metro,It was after my trip in Tokyo. So feels like fewer people and most signs are in English. It was very convenient to take this Metro to me. Not complicated.
Unbelievably crowded yet everyone was so POLITE,Easy to understand for foreigners and very economical but very VERY CROWDED. Everyone was so polite and helpful tonight that we used the subway more than we did the inexpensive cabs as the subway GOES EVERYWHERE and is so FAST
Easy to use,Easy to understand and gets one every place in the city. Only 1.300 for one way. English menu can be chosen.
Locals & Tourist can reach almost everywhere in Busan with Metro Lines,"Highly efficient Metro Lines will take you almost everywhere wherever your destination is in Busan. The trains are on time, safe and reliable.You can reach further destinations via buses and taxis."
Full coverage,"The Busan metro is easy to understand if you have down the basics of a metro system. The signage is frequent and is in English as well as Korean. You find your direction by the next station as well as the end point. The cars are wide and clean with an average amount of seating. From what I have observed,people do get up and give their seat to those with children or the elderly. Being South Korea, everyone is on their cell phone! The cost is moderate. As opposed to other countries, your bus/metro pass from Busan will work in other Korean cities such as Daegu or Seoul provided you buy the right kind. Check before purchasing. Then they can be recharged at 7-11 or CVS. "
Ease of transit,We took the Metro every where. It is the most efficient way to get around the city especially around rush hour. 
Convenient as Seoul Metro!,"As a budget traveller, metro station will be our best way to explore. Busan tourist attraction basically can reach by Metro. "
"A very clean, efficient, roomy metro.","I found the Busan metro mirrors the Seoul metro in cleanliness, efficiency and convenience. We were able to use the T-money cards acquired in Seoul on the Busan metro. Since were staying in the Haeundae area, the subway was the most practical way to get to the other areas of Busan. Like Seoul, many of the subway stations are also large underground shopping complexes. One of the stops (center city) is right under Shinsegae, the largest department store in the world. Especially at high traffic periods, the subway cars can be quite full. However, people are generally very polite rather than pushy in these crowded conditions. And, my observation is that the Korean subway cars in general seem wider, bigger and the trains longer than those in Europe, for example. I recommend the traveler download an app for the Busan metro to their cellphone. It makes understanding the system and getting on/off at the right places a lot easier."
Easy and convinient,"We used the Metro for the whole of our stay in Busan.Much better than the crazy taxi drivers, and certainly much safer and cheaper.It is possible to purchase the pre-paid card and it does save you a lot of time doing so.."
I ride it to work everyday,"I have ridden metros all over the world and this one is probably my favorite. The ticket purchase is straightforward and there is an attendant nearby if you need help. The trains are clean and in fact, I ride one line to the end of the line and there are always cleaning personnel waiting to get on and clean them. They can get really crowded on Saturday afternoon but there is always room for one more. Station announcements are always repeated in English and there is a subway map over each door in the train. So easy, I can even do it."
trip on metro,"very dirty at some stations.No modern equipment, quiet noisyNo ambient and poor in indications.English announcement's not well understandable.Need urgent upgrading and better security at the waiting platform like Seoul Metro."
Better than Sydney's.,"I love the busan metro. The trains are clean, cheap, frequent, and you could set your clock to the train arrivals. The signs are in Korean and English, both on the platform and in the train itself, so you always know where you are. Just be beware, that you may find that the people boarding the train, won't wait for people to exit the train first , so you may find yourself pushing through people get out at your stop. It's a really convenient and cheap way to get around Busan. I wish the train system was like this in Australia. "
One of the local stations in Busan,"Given the name of the station being Busan Metro Station you would assume it is the central hub of Busan but in fact we found that it was quite out of the way to everything else around Busan. If you wanted something more central, I would suggest staying closer to Seomyang Station instead. However, the KTX does pull into the Busan KTX Station which is about 5minutes walk from Busan Metro Station."
Efficient Metro,"Our experience of the Metro was from Seoul to Busan and vice versa. The metro was extremely neat and tidy and public wifi is available all over the metro station. Variety of restaurants, fast food, coffee shops, currency exchange and ATM are available too. At the metro, there is also tours available and person in charge are very accommodating"
Easy to Commute,"The Busan Metro is easy to use and understand after a couple of tries.It links well to most of the attractions and airport in Busan, making it an affordable mean to travel."
