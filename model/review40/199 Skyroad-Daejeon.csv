Not much to see especially the video on the sky road,I was really disappointed as the video didn’t show much animation or special effects. So my sister find it’s boring and gone off shopping instead. If you are nearby for shopping then just look see will be fine. Otherwise don’t waste effort to the go there.
Sky Road!,"Shopping is amazing. Visited a pet store and almost brought two friends home. Food was amazing. Was in town to visit friends and to see the nightlife. This city did not disappoint. Went to a coffee shop, had a discussion over who is better: the Eagles or the Heroes. Korea takes its baseball VERY SERIOUSLY haha. I enjoyed my time here very much. Can't wait to do it again. "
Interesting,Feels a bit dirty and smell of sewerage was everywhere. Shops around the area does make it interesting. 
Daejeon by night!,"Breathtaking in the night, when the huge display is turn on. Good for group pictures, marking events, surprises, marriage asking :))"
Do not go during the day. You'll miss all the fun,"During daytime the beautiful ceiling of Skyroad is off, which is utterly disappointing. Hence, during the day it's just another a regular, loud, market street, with music blasting into the allies from the loudspeakers of all the shops. The main attraction -- the gorgeous ceiling -- is only visible in the evening."
A Lively Weekend in Daejeon,"There is a light show in the weekend, and sometimes there is your face recorded and showed in the LED screen of Skyroad. You can find so many cosmetic stores, food stores, and others. The interesting places that I recommend are:- Sung Sim Dang (성심당) bakery (from 1956) that has authentic fried bread named Soboro (소보로) filled with red bean paste in yellow paper bag and with butter paste in purple paper bag,- Yoogane (유가네) a Korean food restaurant (semi fast food)- Farm's Chicken Buffet beside Yoogane in the 2nd floor, where you can eat fried chicken as many as you can, with 8 flavour (from the sweet to spicy), plus rice and soda for only KRW 7,400 (2019). You can replace soda with beer and add KRW 1,500 only. Cheap and delicious!- the Artbox with many cute things you can find.You can reach this place by getting off the train at Jun-gang-no station in Daejeon."
"In Daylight, Skyroad unlit.","It was a decent shopping area. In the daytime, however, they do not light the ""Skyroad"", the primary reason I decided to visit in the first place. The shopping is decent, though."
Something for Everyone,"This is really a shopping experience, peppered by eating opportunities. In fact, from the moment you arrive at Jungangno station on the Metro - leave from Exit 2 - you find yourself in an underground shopping mall, fanning out in three directions from a large seating area around a fountain. Mainly clothes and accessories but also a good clutch of the Korean cosmetic / beauty stores - Etude House, Tony Moly, Innisfree, Olive Young etc.Progressing up to street level and into the warren of streets that feed into the Sky Road you are beset by the sights and smells of fried chicken, street food and shops and restaurants vying for your attention.The previous couple of times we have been in Daejeon, it has been summer and so the streets have been lined with stalls but, in February, things are quieter, which also means that access is easier.The Sky Road itself is, in essence, the spine of the shopping centre with all the other streets branching off it (like ribs I suppose). The shops are pretty standard and there are all the usual cafe outlets. You will probably come across an Ajuma trying to hand you a leaflet or someone attempting to entice you into their shop.If you cross the Sky Road and keep heading towards the river, cross it via either the foot or road bridge, you will come to the market, a much more authentic experience.That said, if retail therapy with frequent refuelling stops is for you, you won’t be disappointed."
Once is enough,"Nothing spectacular except for the LED screen used as ceiling. Haven't seen anything like it, and having seen it once, wasnt enamored enough with it to do a special trip to visit again. But if you're in Daejeon, and haven't seen anything like it yet, drop by. "
One of the places to go for retail therapy in Daejeon,"Just to put things into perspective, Daejeon is not as bustling as Seoul. For those who are familiar with Australia, Daejeon is to Seoul what Canberra is to Sydney.It is a welcome break to see a modern city like Daejeon that has a delicate balance between the usual amenities as well as urban landscape in a modern city with rural pockets. Skyroad is an area to get your retail and food fix given the concentration of small shopfronts boasting a variety of F&B outlets, famous Korean cosmetic brands and other retail concepts. Ideal time to visit is at night where you get a chance to see the huge 200m ceiling TV screen. It has a young vibe and it’s quite obvious given the hoards of teenagers in school uniforms hanging out there after school. You will be able to cover the whole area, including exploring side streets etc in a leisurely 5-6 hours"
Must to go,I went there at noon time and spent 5 hours in that area. A lot of shops and the street is amazing. If you like simple nice places please visit it
like a downtown,Many restaurants and cosmetic shops here and also Karaoke (노래방) too. Near underground market (Jungangno station). I recommend to go there.Everything you want you can buy from here.
OK for a quick visit,I admit that I have only seen something like this one time and not as long. For a couple of minutes it is interesting to look up and see the pictures on the TV screens above you. There are a lot of places to get snacks and go shopping for those that are into these activities. It is very popular with the younger crowd (15-25 by my guess).
Rather boring,"I stayed at a hotel near Skyroad for 4 nights, and I went there during the days and nights...by day this was a quiet street with mainly restaurants on both sides, by night there were some people walking around but no real crowds...it's just not a ""happening"" place. The locals seem to prefer going to the main city downtown area."
Centrally located in the heart of the old city center.,The Skyroad lights up several times each evening. the times are posted.There are plenty of shops and restaurants in the area as it is considered the old city center of Daejeon. Subway runs close by as well as major bus lines.
So much to see,"The skyroad itself is located in Eunhaengdong- one of my favorite areas of town. The skyroad is fun at night; you can see your image projected above you! But the entire area is worth it at any time of day. Shopping, singing rooms, cat cafes, eclectic dining- it really has it all. Don't forget the underground mall, perfect for a hot day. I suggest exploring across the main street west, south, and east to the bridge and riverwalk. The old center market is there by the train station- that's another great place to eat, shop (for cheap), and people watch. I recommend Mango Plate for a great food app. It'll help you navigate the huge area. Have fun!"
Night Life,"Located at the heart of Daejeon, there are a lot of shops for cosmetics and other personal items where you can choose from. Also a nice place to spend with friends to dine and have coffee "
Great place to stroll through solo or with a friends,"Plenty of restaurants, shopping, dessert cafes, and fun. You can eat Korean or western food, fast or casual dining.Take the bus or subway and spend a day hanging out. There is a nail shop for mani/pedis. The skyroad is very close to the river, where there are often performers when the weather is nice. You can catch a glimpse of yourself on the road, especially at night (so be photo ready). There are several CCTV cameras that will show all the patrons strolling through. There are cute accessory and clothing shops - including the underground shopping near the subway and above ground shopping around the skyroad. Shoppers beware of underground shopping. I ALWAYS blow my budget, because there are so many cosmetics, sunglasses, skincare products, earrings and dresses on sale! (Not a good place for shoe sizes larger than a US womens 8 or 9.) Many couples frequent this area. There is a ""fair ride"" too! I strongly suggest a visit if you are in town and flexible with time."
Skyroad,I knew about this place when visiting Daejeon but came by accident. So cool! I was exciting when i saw myself at the sky cam haha! Some shopping and restaurants around
One of the things that only Koreans could think of,"Amazing show of lights and music. You have to remember that you should visit this place after 8 pm (if I recall correctly) because that is the time they start the show. It makes a huge impression. You can stare at it, make pictures, movies, gifs, for half an hour straight and you don't get bored. Definitely worth the time!"
We were there,Crowd of people visits this place! so many shows with the foam! and the view! Recommend to visit there:)
Sky Road , I and my children Love skyroad this is a wonderful Street.. If you come to dejoun You must visit it. ✌
See the virtual sky and get lost in space,"Despite the street does not have an extraordinary selection of shops to offer, it is interesting to have the ceiling covered with such a long and big screen. Sometimes you can see planets and sky, sometimes you can see yourself as there are many webcams all around. It is interesting experience, might even be considered as a sneak peak to a possible future. There are many shops in the street and sub alleys too. Delicious food, some small shops and fast food too."
The flashy hub of Daejeon,"The skyroad is impressive, loud, and a little bit over the top. There are a lot of restaurants and shops in the area as well. It is best visited when the sun has set tp get the best viewing of the TV ceiling."
Entertaining and advertising point,"Skyroad is located in Euneng - dong which very famous as ""Daejeon Myeongdong"". Once the night started The Skyroad will start to entertain you. It is totally modern technology for entertaining and advertising. If you already pass the sky road, i suggest you to have coffee at Ediya Coffee or eat Steak in Daejeon Steak house,which is you choose the seat nearby the window, so you can enjoy your meal while watching Skyroad. Nice try."
LED screen on the roof and good cloth stores around!,"Go there after the sunset so that you can enjoy the lights and sounds and the visuals on the LED screen over your head. Also, you can watch some local performers showing their talent. There are a lot of clothing stores around and good restaurants if you feel hungry."
Amazing,"It's amazing.. basically, a 200m length TV. You need to go there around 6PM when the show begins. Around, you will find very nice places to eat."
