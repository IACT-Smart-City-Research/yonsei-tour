Nice experience.,"My friend and i got to this activity via trazy tour (strongly recommend to check their tours out)It was pretty short for my taste, but it was still enjoyable.Not suitable for elderly as paddling might be tiring at times.There were many families with kids.A picture is taken while you are on a ride and then is printed out on a magnet and is sold for about 6,000 korean won."
