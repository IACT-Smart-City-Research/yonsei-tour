Nice bamboo forest,"Whan we were in Damyang my friends bring us here.Nice place, nice breeze, after lunch good for walking.My friends said this place use for movies and dramas.My guess, when sun set time has so nice views also can take nice photos."
Such a unique place to explore!,We stopped by to explore this park during our road trip and what a beautiful and peaceful place it is! Would definitely recommend this! My littler kids enjoyed the playground while older ones enjoyed the scenery and art most!
A beautiful bamboo forest and Korean style gardens,"A beautiful bamboo forest with Korean traditional buildings. There were some special events (e.g., tea ceremony) and activity zones when I visited. I'll say it's a family friendly place but it will be still excellent to couples or friends. It's calming atmosphere will definitely help you ease your stress. It will take 2-3 hours if you walk slowly, taking some photos at times."
A very calming place!,"The right place to visit if you seek for tranquility and just release stress! Many people come here for sort of mental healing, the place is huge with many paths to take in the forest, and some museum and cafe (spare at least 1 hour to explore). It's also a popular place for couples to visit since it's a really calm and romantic atmosphere. This place is worth visit ANYTIME, because in all 4 seasons, the color of the bamboo won't change (always green). However, check the weather before coming there. Although it's also beautiful in the rain, if you come there to take pics of yourself, it's much better when it's sunny."
Perfect getaway from a busy city- Damyang Bamboo forest,"A beautiful day at the Damyang Bamboo forest! While strolling down the bamboo forest, I felt so at peace and relaxed! It’s a perfect getaway from a busy city life Also, you can take great photos as it’s green all year around! Totally recommend it ✅ P. S: make sure to try their Bamboo ice cream! It’s SO YUMMY!!"
So peaceful and beautiful - great shopping!,"I went to stay with my daughters in South Korea for two weeks and this is what we did on our last day together. We held hands and strolled through the beautiful bamboo-lined paths, shopped in some of the lovely shops, drank bamboo tea, ate bamboo ice cream, and one of my daughters and I even split a bamboo beer. It’s a lovely place. Feels so good to be surrounded by greenery, so calming. My daughters are adults but it didn’t give me the option ha ha"
It is basically a tourist trap but its still a pleasant walk,"This is basically a tourist trap. Someone planted a bunch of bamboo to make a mini-forest and make a pseudo-attraction. This is not a historical site and has no real significance. That said, it is still a pleasant walk and where else can you get and eat bamboo ice cream (which tastes suspiciously like green tea ice cream)?"
Bamboo Garden (Juknokweon) in Damyang. ,Just stroll around in here under the bamboo shade in a state of ignorance to busy city life. You can see lots of families or lovers walking along bamboo forest trails. Try bamboo sprout ice cream. 
Nice walk in bamboo forest,"Had never seen a bamboo forest so it was nice. We walk through the whole park maybe in about 1 hour or a bit more. There's a cafe quite near the entrance where we had really nice ice cream. At the other end of the park there was another cafe and we had bamboo leaf tea, which was surprisingly nice. We went in march and it wasn't crowded at all, we had a very nice time. I expect in the summer it must be a very busy area with lot's of activities just outside the park. We parked easily and for free but maybe that's due to the time of year, i think there is a bigger car park for the Bamboo forest around the back entrance."
Bamboo plantation,"The effort to make this place a tourist attraction is marvellous using bamboo plantation.I did not make it to the other gate as it was quite a distance with the uneven steps.Basically, it is quite the same view walking through the park with bamboos surrounding you."
Nice place but I visited wrong season (winter) ,"Actually, it's quite nice to visit. Good to walk around. But I visited in December so some of shops are closed and there is no event or activities since it's low season. I recommend to avoid winter. "
Bamboo Bamboo!,"Best to visit it in the morning, when the groups of tourists have not arrived. A nice quiet place to stroll, and furniture made of bamboo. Super popular with local and foreign tourists. Also the restaurants outside the Junokwon are almost fully booked by the tourists in groups, so it's best to leave for lunch at 11.30am, to find the restaurant with spaces for walk-ins. I managed to find 1 such resturant after reject by 2 previous ones with full bookings. The bamboo rice smells nice, with red bean n some other beans. I ordered the most basic Bamboo Rice set, only 10,000won. The number of side dishes are just awsome! For 3000won more, u can have 1 more meat dish. But really the side dishes are more than enough.How to go: Take Bus 311 from Gwangju, outside Gwangju U-Square. Took 50min to reach Junokwon directly. Fare is 2900won. Or you can buy a direct bus ticket to Damyang Terminal (30min), then change to bus 311."
Lovely Peek into Nature,"Go in the morning when it is not busy--my group arrived at the opening time, and were told it is typically so full we would not have been able to easily stroll through the park. The bamboo is lovely--I recommend trying the bamboo teas in the coffee shop. There is also a mini-info area about bamboo the level below the coffee shop where the bathrooms are. When quiet and alone, the forest feels a bit like entering a different world. My only complaint would be the frequent graffiti etched in the lower levels of the bamboo--but this is more a criticism of the individuals who would scratch into nature, and not those who maintain the park."
Maybe it was just too humid,"I had an image that it would be grander, more beautiful. Maybe because it was midday and by the time we walked from the carpark to the front gate, my back was drenched and I'd started to get a heat headache. I tried to enjoy it, but every step was an uneven slope up or down, every bench full. A short walk through, we were done.I would like to visit again in a cooler month to give it a second chance."
Damyang Juknokwon Bamboo Forest,We went recently to Gwangju south in Korea and spend also few hours in this lovely bamboo forest. It is easy to find if you can prepare your navigation system. Parking is challenge if you are coming late. The early bird catches the best places. And be prepared that especially on the weekends like everywhere else in Korea the area will be crowded. Anyway we spend 3 hours in the forest and we liked it very much. It was a very sunny day but the forest spend us enough shadow to enjoy. Many walking paths are available and the highest point gives you a nice view over the area. Probably it is not a convenient place to push and move wheel chair and stroller. After the forest we visited some souvenirs shops (we like bamboo but not so much bamboo souvenirs) and eat our lunch at local restaurant near the river. Expect waiting time. Food was good. It is a must visit place if you are in Gwangju.
A lovely bamboo park,This a great place to take a stroll through the bamboo forest. The paths are well kept and there is a beautiful park in back. Prepare a picnic if you want to spend some more time relaxing within the park. The bamboo keeps things cooler so its a nice place to visit even in warmer weather.
Great Place To Spend a Day,"We loved the few hours we spent walking through the bamboo forest. Lovely views, superb fresh air and even with large crowds on the day we visited, we were still able to find a few places for quite solitary meditation and contemplation. This was the high point of our visit to Gwangju. "
Beautiful and enjoyable walk,"Springtime is a good time for a walk through the bamboo forest. The weather was cooling and not too cold and not too hot. And I loved the rustles of the leaves as we walk through the bamboo gardens.The garden has various trails and routes to explore but do be prepared for lots of walking, some uphill. So be well geared and have sufficient time to explore the gardens. We went with our 3-year-old and we couldn't make it to the other side as it was way past lunch time and we couldn't find any proper dining place within the gardens. There was a small cafe that serves coffee and tea and drinks and the famous bamboo ice cream though. Only snacks like hot dogs were served,"
Beautiful & serene forest,"This is an outdoor activity so best visited in good weather. It is essentially a bamboo forest with lots of trails to walk along and large gardens surrounding it. There is also a small building in the centre hosting art exhibitions from local artists and a nice café in the basement. There were also weaving classes and other activities which were closed when I visited but are open during peak season. I spent around an hour and a half here and really enjoyed it, it was a highlight of my trip - beautiful scenery and very serene.The trails/paths were pretty flat but many were steep inclines and there were some steps involved so if you have mobility issues you might not be able to access everywhere. A pushchair would be fine but I saw someone in a wheelchair struggling."
Bamboo Forest Beauty,"This place is awesome! I stayed at one of their houses for a night, lovely buildings with all the above standard amenities. The Forest was very nice, great scenery, apparently the forest is naturally forming, with a great layout of walking paths and spots to stop and enjoy along the way! The surrounding area is also pretty great for food and touring around....I do hear it gets busy sometimes, so I suggest calling ahead and asking them yourself."
Awesome bamboo trees,",I went on a Saturday, by bus (311) to the bamboo park it was a bit busy but not crowded. I never saw bamboo trees before, so this experience was nice. It is nice to go there have a picknick (bring your own food!) in the park and leave after few hours. In the park there are different pathways, places to sit and enjoy the tall bamboo trees"
"Beautiful Place , Lovely Walking.","We went in January, in the snow and it was absolutely beautiful. The pathways are well maintained, plenty of places to sit and enjoy the peace. Unfortunately the Hanok (traditional houses) were all closed but I would love the opportunity to stay in one. Entry fee is very reasonable and it takes a couple of hours to stroll round in comfort. Very pleasant tea rooms and friendly staff. If you are in the area, dont think twice....go!"
Maybe it was a mistake to go on a Sunday,"It was busier than I expected, maybe because I made the mistake of going on a Sunday. The Bamboo Forest is not exactly a wild forest, but a maintained one, with well-defined paths. It is quite large and even though the first 300 - 400 metres from the gate had lots of people, further beyond, it was possible to be alone and enjoying the peaceful atmosphere.There's not much shelter, so if the weather forecast is rain, be prepared. Couldn't see any food or drink available inside the park.To get there, take local bus #311 from the rear of the Gwangju Railway Station. It's about an hour by bus, but the bus calls in to the Damyang bus station before going forward 600- 700m more to the gate of the Bamboo Forest. Entry was 3,000 won.There's a plaza in front of the gate and (perhaps because it was a Sunday) there was a folk dance performance going on. The crowd was made up for domestic tourists freshly disgorged from their huge tour coaches."
Kung-Fu Panda home,Quite an exotic place for those who doesn't have bamboo at their home country. A small bamboo park with several routes and museum in it. Better be visited during sunny day due to lack of sunlight beneath a thick bamboo forest. If there's a wind bamboos start knocking each other which sounds a bit creepy. Good place for telling children ancient asian fairytales.
Peace and Quiet,This place is for people who enjoys walking/hiking at the same time looking for a some peace and quiet out of the hustle and bustle of the city. The bamboo trees and the hanok (traditional houses) at the back make a great combination. A good 2 to 3 hours will be enough to go around it. Plus there are great restaurants near the vicinity.
Nice place to have a walk,It's my first time seeing bamboos...so i think it was worth going there..hahaI enjoyed it even though i think the entrance fee is kinda high...if you consider that it was free in the past...and after all it's just a forest.So there is just bamboo to see nothing else.
It is on,"Will rate it 3.5 out of 5. Somehow, I feel that the bamboo forest in Kyoto, arashiyama is more spectacular. It's quite big and to really finish walking the whole place may take couple of hours i guess. Nevertheless, a place to take nice pics.Not very suitable for elderly or people who are not so fit as there is an up slope right at the start. Nearby, there are people selling bamboo ice-cream which is worth trying. "
Peaceful place to walk and relax,"The place has a nice walking trails which is suitable for weekend getaway to enjoy some greenery. However, do come prepared with good walking shoes as some areas can be rather steep."
Take a walk with your loved one,"I went there in mid may, after the damyang bamboo forest festival. Went slightly later because my mom doesn't like crowds and it so happened we just missed it by a few days. It was raining when we went, so there weren't a lot of people, it felt as though we had the park to ourselves. There are a few trails you can take, like the lovers road, and the road of thinking. I especially enjoyed it so much because it was drizzling. "
Great place with fresh air,"Great to walk, breath fresh air. Perfect to go with kids. They have also playground for kids and they sell many products made with bamboo. You can take bamboo ice crea and jelly. DeliciouS There is also an art museum that its worthy to visit. All in all a great visit for the weekend"
Quaint bamboo forest with plenty of photo opportunities,"Really nice stop to make for only 3.000 won! Bus 311 from the U-Square Bus Terminal (aka the Gwangcheon Terminal) in Gwangju charges 2.200 won one way and takes 45 minutes to bring you just in front of the entrance to the Bamboo Forest, and inside there are plenty of photo opportunities and mini attractions such as the small art museum full of digital artwork, chairs and hammocks made out of bamboo, a waterfall surrounded by posing panda statues, and a little cafe that sells bamboo leaf tea, which was pretty good even though I don't normally like tea. And to top it off, we even found a friendly cat wanting to be petted by all the people passing by it as we were leaving! You can take bus 311 from the entrance back to U-Square afterward. Good experience and definitely recommended for the low price."
Pleasant small bamboo grove in a nice locale,"The bamboo grove itself is very small - you can easily look beyond the grove and see the buildings outside the grove - that's how small it is. However, it is located at a very pleasant and arty town. We missed out on the bamboo cuisine 'cos our driver took us to a home restaurant which did not serve the rice out of a bamboo. No matter, we proceeded to a dessert café housed in a gallery called Tedam (Dedam) and we were delighted. They call themselves an art space and there was a full poster of Jeong Dongha's upcoming performance. Truly, if one had all the time in the world and craving for a nice lazy break, Damyang would be it. Anyway, there was an excellent bamboo craft shop in Junokwan which stocked exquisite items both bamboo and non bamboo. At a regular shop outside Junokwan, I bought a nice soy candle in a bamboo (what else) and the fragrance is bamboo (what else). If a shopper/browser had more time here, I am sure they would not want to leave."
Juknokwon Bamboo-Themed Park in Damyang,A bamboo-themed park was built since Damyang has been very famous for bamboos in Korea. You can see a lot of boys and girls including adults walk around there. They sell bamboo sprouts and products.
Fresh paradise,"This is a wonder full places for relax,the atmosphere here is fresh and peaceful. The most impressive here is the bamboo forest. I think it would be an ideal place for camping.spending 2 day here is enough"
Tours by Aaron and Brilliant guide Yong and Damyang Bamboo garden,"We travelled to Seoul on conference and decided to add on a trip to Damyang and Jeonju City thereafter. In an unknown place with just my gut to go on, Tour by Aaron were a spectacular find!. He was the first to respond almost immediately to an online request and theerafter there was a flurry of communication about what I wanted to do. An individual tailormade tour was planned for my husband and I. We were fortunate to have been assigned Yong as our guide who was fabulous and went the extra mile to cater for us, accommodating our need for a relaxed photographic pace and my vegetarian requirements in a largely nonvegetarian region.He is a charming, funny and knowledgeable guide that has become a friend - what more could one ask for. Yong is a real asset to the Aaron tours and the efficient service by a virtual Aaron ensured that our trip was peaceful and most memorable. The walks through the Bamboo garden, experiments with cuisine, Buddhist peace and meeting of the local folk with Yong and the many pictures that attracted locals to a rare South African sighting was outstanding. The resorts and hotels were pure attention to detail and innovation. This remains one of the most perfect holidays and endearing cultures we have experienced...this is how the rest if the world should be!"
calm in the fresh air and peaceful atmosphere,"Take a relaxing walking, calm yourself in the fresh air and peaceful atmosphere in this 16,000-sq M bamboo forest with artificial waterfalls, pavilions and traditional Korean structures. Prepare stay at least 2-3 hours inside this bamboo forest. Recommend come in before noon, after visit the bamboo forest, spend another 1-2 hours to walk around the nearby area.The streets and parks are full of beautiful flowers and bamboo-made sculpture products."
Want to be relaxed? Go right now,"I`ve never seen bamboo forest in my life. It was really great view and fresh air, calm.I felt like i was in another world free from the earth. I really recommend this is worthful to go."
Beautiful Place to Visit!!,"Located a short 5 minute bus ride from the Damyang bus terminal, Juknokwon is very easy to find and is well worth the trip. It is the largest bamboo forest in Korea and a beautiful place for a nature walk. I recommend arriving early, because by early afternoon the park is packed with visitors. The bamboo trees are tall and thick and exotic and it felt for a while like we weren’t in Korea, but someplace in southeast Asia."
Indulge in this bamboo forest,"This is one of my most favourite place in Korea, and had felt in love ever since I had been there. It provides serenity, calm and the atmosphere is just so fabulous. There are several trails in the bamboo forest, one of which that is great for couples is the love trail where you can enjoy the pavillion and waterfall.Before you go, do enjoy a bamboo ice cream which tastes super duper yummy."
 It is great but crowdy on weekend.,"If you are willing to enjoy the atmosphere more, I would recommend to visit on weekdays rather than weekend. I visited on sunday, there were too many people. It looked like almost same number as bamboos."
Never seen something like this before,Definitely worth going here. I have never seen a bamboo forest before. It was such a wonderful sight. It's a really good place for a hike.
surround yourself with bamboo breeze!,"Before reach to this park, me and a friend accidentally took a wrong bus where we end up somewhere that my friend also never been to even though he is local! Hahah! However the journey and moment at this park is amazing! This park bit crowd during weekend especially if you go there bit late.If you plan to come over make sure to go early in the morning so that you can enjoy calm, serenade breeze of bamboo! Refreshing and heal your soul!"
the calm with bamboo forest,"C1 ( 2015.05.22 ) This park was consist of many bamboo, so the inside was very good. When I stood in bamboo forest, I felt fresh wind and bamboo's smell. And trekking road was very good. There was good place to trekking and walking, but there need to accurate map because I was confused on my way. Good place."
Visit after the snow,"It was a short trip from Gwangju U-square Bus Terminal via bus no. 311. The bus stops weirdly stopped at the bus terminal and continued to the entrance of this place.We visited after the heavy snow last night so the place was beautiful! The snowed covered roofs and paths are wonderful for photos. You may also make a big shake of the bamboos to make great snowing scene. You may also make a snowball from the snow accumulated. There is a small village that you may also visit as you walk and follow its map.You would walk around different areas and find a small waterfall with a few artificial pandas. There were benches and shelter when you needed a break from your walk. If you love the nature, you will find the peace and tranquility, and the beauty becomes a bonus. I believe every bamboo forest has its own beauty as I have visited a few such as the one in Japan, I enjoyed every one of them. If you are not a bamboo or nature lover, don't visit. If you don't like long walks without distracting activities and shops, don't visit. This bamboo forest is unique in its own way, if you are photographer, you would love it especially in the snowing season.The souvenir shop in the premise is worth visiting, you would see the bicycles made from bamboo. The bamboo tea and jelly sweet are worth buying if you like the taste. There are many other bamboo products if you are interested to try.Don't miss the yummy food next door though it was slightly off the budget scale. The owner is a nice ajuma and if you don't really know how to read Korean, ask her to introduce a few dishes. The grilled pork and the bamboo rice were delicious.If you are game, walk along the lake beside it (about 1.8km) to the Metasequoia-lined road. It is another good walk with lots of opportunities for good photographs."
"""Bamboos Galore""","After reading all the reviews about the Bamboo Forest, decided to visit Damyang Juknokwon.We took bus no 311 from the bus stop outside U-Square Terminal (Gwangju), Bus fare: 2800 won and journey took 45 minutes. Told the bus driver that we wanted to go to Juknokwon and to our surprise, the bus stopped directly at the entrance of the Bamboo Forest. Entrance fee: 200 won. Senior Citizens 65 years FOC - you have to show your passport at the ticket counter.If not for the crowds of people, it would have been an enjoyable walk through certain parts of the forest. Its advisable to wear proper walking shoes if you intend walking through the whole forest since there are some uphill and gravel filled areas which may be difficult to climb, especially for those with weak knees. We decided to shorten our visit since we could not venture further into the forest due to the above reasons. Nevertheless, it was a"" first time"" experience being the in the midst of all that bamboo.Before you enter the Bamboo Forest and next to the Souvenir shop, there is a restaurant which serves the most delicious meal at a very reasonable price. The tteok galbi ribs and rice cooked in bamboo including all the other side dishes, was absolutely yummy. After the walk and a most satisfying meal, it was a good end to our trip and a day well spent.."
Short pleasant walk but not so fantastic ...,On the way from gwangju to Jeonju ....so decided to visit Julnokwon as a stopover...the bamboo forest was quite big and you will have a pleasant walk there especially during winter.However...as I've visited other bamboo forest before like in Taiwan...this is not so interesting for me. Perhaps there's an ongoing renovation there. Anyway...you can have a short stopover if you don't mind. After all the ticket not that expensive.
Bamboo forest,Lovely and peaceful place if you can get away from the crowds of people who come in. It's quite large so it is possible but can ruin your zen state. The bamboo is very impressive and a good gift shop of bamboo themed items.The area is a bit strenuous in some parts so wear shoes that are appropriate for uphill and gravel walking. Some stairs as well. Not a place for a stroller or handicapped.
1n2d went there,"Went there on winter and the bamboo forest was covered in snowWas one of the most beautiful place I´ve been! It´s fun to go there with friends, so you can shake the snow of the bamboo!More fun is to know that the KBS show filmed there"
Make sure to make it to the Workshops in the back,"A fun little excursion into a Bamboo world. It was obviously a date location for many locals with couples abound, strolling through and taking pictures. It only costs 2,000W per person and is worth the look around if you've never seen a bamboo garden. This was definitely the biggest one we saw in Korea. Still, you can probably walk a majority of the garden in about an hour or so unless you’re taking pictures every five minutes. Recommendation on the photos. On the weekend, it’ll be near impossible to get a clean shot of yourself with no one on the trail. So, to make this easier, there are a few locations where you can stand and pose with a roped off trail behind you. This will make taking that Kodak moment easier and thwn you can just enjoy being in the garden.Notes:There are a couple of places you can go into and it feels like a tunnel of bamboo. Very small paths that are dark even on a sunny day. This is fun.You can go to the back Hanok Experience to extend your visit by an hour or so depending on what’s open. They have workshops for making things back there. We visited the Bamboo Tea workshop room. They served us green tea with bamboo leaf infusion. It was a slow process of three brews with each brew losing the green tea flavor and enhancing the bamboo flavor. Cost was 2,000W per person and came as a welcome break. (If you liked it, you can buy some at the souvenir shop on your way back out). This back part is not easily accessible for anyone with a knee issue. We saw a number of older folk struggling on the way down (steep) and up.Below the souvenir rotunda (the tea house at the junction point), there’s a weaving workshop. The material there was very interesting and unique. The artist uses the local bamboo to make the products. If you have the Korean, custom orders are also possible.Overall, highly recommended. We had trouble finding information on how long to spend in the city of Damyang and thought it would just be an hour. Plan on at least a half day stay there as they do a lot of cool things with just bamboo (especially in the food department: bamboo hodoek, bamboo rice, bamboo alcohol to name a few). On top of that, they have other foods they are known for, like noodles."
Bamboo!!,"It's very impreasive.Bamboo forest and a Koreantraditional house village for you to stay.(Home stay program)There is a very popular Korean food, called Ddug galbi.Damyang is a very nice city for you to stay and this one is a wonderful place for you to visit."
"Damyang – bamboo here, bamboo there, bamboo everywhere...almost","But not for lemang (a traditional Malaysian cuisine with glutinous rice cooked in banana leaves inside a bamboo). OK, I was warned about it being “small” and ""nothing much"" so no expectation there. I wanted to spend my free weekend and it was a pleasant walk, could have been better if my college-going student guide had not seemed rush because he had been there many times. It is a place for a family outing to just walk, particularly with small kids – free to run and act cute or not. And there was a show where individuals sing and play their instruments entertaining visitors. A few old traditional Korean houses - if you have not been to Bukchon in Seoul. If you need some relaxing hour or two, time to while away, you won’t get lost in the Damyang bamboo forest."
Bamboo Forest (Garden),"Damyang's well-known bamboo garden is a pleasant place for pictures, and an enjoyable walk. It can get busy, but the garden area is large enough to accomodate plenty of visitors. It is difficult to clarify what this attraction really is. Is it a garden or a forest? Well it fits both descriptions, the area is often well-landscaped and chairs or pavilions can be found throughout the grounds. On the other hand there are areas where it really is just large areas of land surrounded by bamboo.The paths spread in multiple directions within the grounds. Visitors can see all there is too offer in 1-2 hours. There are not many areas in Korea where bamboo grows, but South Jeolla's climate is the most ideal on the Korean peninsula."
A surprisingly nice visit,"I went to Damyang for a night on a trip through some less frequented cities and towns in the southwestern part of Korea.Damyang was a very nice town overall, and I enjoyed the Bamboo Park a good deal. It was more than I expected, and a nice hike through bamboo forests and other random bits here and there. 2,000 to get in, including free (but busy) lockers for your bags, which was a good idea considering it's a decent bit of exercise."
