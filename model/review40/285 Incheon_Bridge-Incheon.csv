Incheon Bridge is standing strong ...standing strong... standing strong...,"In the 8 years I lived in Korea, I crossed the bridge at least 15 times on Airport runs. It is truly impressive. I will be crossing again in the next few days, and it is something I am looking very forward to. It is a real showpiece of Korean engineering and building know-how."
A great bridge and a short cut to the airport.,I draw bridges for construction so crossing this iconic bridge twice was a real thrill. It crosses the bay from the airport to Incheon and is well lit at night.
Beautiful ,Amazing treasure of South KoreaTruly a beautiful master piece. Engineering feat a beautiful site at night 
"Incheon Bridge, Incheon, South Korea.","I had just spent the afternoon visiting two Trip Advisor attractions in Incheon and I was riding the Number 303 bus heading out to the Incheon International Airport when what to my wondering eyes should appear ahead of me but this absolutely amazingly wonderful bridge. So out came my trusty camera and I snapped several photos of the Incheon Bridge, here in Incheon, South Korea. What a wonder of creative design and construction. I wonder how many people ride the bridge and totally ignore its beauty.I was on an airport bound bus and did not have to pay any toll fees. I don't know about automobiles and other vehicles traveling across the bridge as to paying tolls or other fees to cross the bridge."
Spectacular,"Well , coming from Italy where 10 meters long bridges collapse it’s even more incredible... this is wow. Beside I just crossed by bus I was shocked how ling and steady is"
Spectacular view night time,"It is amazing what the peple doing to cross over the seas ..... amazing bridge, especially night time ..."
Very long,We enjoyed the view from out hotel Premier Incheon and we had nice drive with taxi as well. It is very modern and very long.
One of the longest bridges in the world,"This bridge is a feat of engineering. It is one of the longest bridges in the world. On clear days it offers amazing views of the sea and islands along the coast. You can also see beautiful views of Incheon. It is also the quickest way to get from Songdo to the international airport and vice versa. If you are driving keep in mind that you will have to pay a toll. If taking a taxi, the driver will add 3,000 to 4,000 won to your tab."
Miles and miles long,"Great fun to drive on this bridge with nice view of ports, terminals and cities on the horizon. Great to see sunset and sunrose on a clear day."
Beautiful ,Not really an attraction. We crossed this bridge every day for a week back and forth. It is amazing with views from both sides of the car. Toll road to cross. Goes from airport to different area of Incheon. Feels like you are in the future around here. 
Majestic!,"It's a magnificent bridge that connects direct travel from Incheon Airport to Incheon (30 min drive) and Seoul; it doesn't have walk/bike path. At night, it has rainbow-colored alternating lights that illuminates the night over sea. I love watching it from my studio (in Incheon)."
interesting,long and beautiful bridge from incheon to the airport. it is a piece of art. deserve visit it by car or bus
Gorgeous bridge!,Stunning views of the bridge and FROM the bridge! A MUST SEE when you're back and forth from Incheon Airport.
A 22km long bridge!!,"The bridge is a very long one, crossing over the sea from ICN International Air Port. Connected on the other end is a super modern village of skyscrapers called Songdo."
What a beautiful bridge!!,Everytime I cross this bridge it envokes great pride and joy that I have the opportunity to go through this beautiful piece of architecture! And once you see this bridge you know that you're in close proximity of Incheon International Airport!
Anazing suspension bridge,"You gotta see this, so huge and well built. Our big ship fit right through the middle. I like the lights at night on the bridge very spectacular . "
"What it lacks in Beauty, it Makes Up For in Length",The modern suspension techniques are surely impressive. What makes this bridge pretty wild is the length. Its causeway style for 90% then it rapidly elevates to the suspended part. The views all around are so impressive you are reminded how gray and banal the surrounding Korean cities are. 
Impressive engineering feat,You cross this in the bus if you go from INC airport to a hotel eg in Songdo. An extremely impressive engineering feat and more so at night when it is lit up.
INCHEON BRIDGE,"I only got to see it from the airplane, but it looks like an amazing structure from what I could see. Kind Regards, Friscoboy"
Longest bridge ever,"I think this must be one of the longest bridges in the world. It is increadible how they constructed it. Incheon airport is also extraordinary, housing its own little forest inside (!)"
Back to Jakarta Indonesia,No Photo at Inchoen Bridge. Back to jakarta Indonesia with Garuda airlines. Many people visitors in here go back to country. Wifi okAc ok
Incheon visit,I was on South Korea trip for one week due to business trip. Incheon bridge is very beautiful during night.its about 23 km long and connecting inchion air port and city. there are also may bridges in city with lighting.
One of the world's longest bridge @21.4km,"You'll probably end up driving through this bridge when visiting Korea. And while it's not an attraction per se, it helps to know a little bit about it as you go through it.It spans 21.4km (13.3miles) and was constructed in 2009. It is the main artery connecting Incheon airport and the larger mainland area. As of 2010 it was the 7th longest cable-stayed bridge in the world.The cable stayed section of the crossing is 1.5km (~1mile) long, the bridge section ~18km long and the highway section making up the rest.It is an impressive way to get in and out of the country, no?"
Great place to attend,"Very modern and convinion bridge, provide fast roads and beautiful views for new Incheon city district and sea."
Neat to see the longest bridge in Korea!,Drove over this bridge as part of a tour and it was neat to be on the longest bridge in Korea. It is 21.39km long and 7th in the world. Impressive structure.
Elegant bridge from Incheon!,"Impressive long bridge linking Incheon with the mainland. Aside from the bridge itself, the tidal mud flats on either side are fascinating! Depending on the stage of the tide, you can see thousands of birds on the mud flats."
Amazing to see one of the world’s longest bridges,Really had a good view of this hotel from the taxi ride heading to Songdo Central Park. Amazing all lit up. 
"""Awesome view""",Nice bridge.Beautiful view.Great place in south korea.It was a great experiance.Must visit south korea.
No walking just driving.,"This is the bridge that goes from the airport to Seoul. It isn't free and will cost you around $6.00 usd each way. You can't walk on it, you can only drive on it. I wouldn't go out of my way to see this bridge, unless that is the kind of thing you are into. Looks better in the night time. That is when it has ""Seoul""."
It's a bridge with character,"It's a bridge with character. Nothing to go out of the way for, though I doubt you can go far in Inchon or the airport without traversing the bride. Job well done by the designer."
Very pretty bridge entering Incheon,"You cross this bridge going from Invheon Airport to the city of Incheon. The trip takes 30 minutes. KAL bus/limo brings you to many of the hotels; Grand Sheraton hotel etc. The bridge is very nice and is a nice introduction to the city of Incheon... clean, safe and pretty."
Its large bridge,"Okay, its large bridge and beutiful view. However, not so interesting to me. May be a major landmark for the city."
Very long bridge.,"The road from Incheon airport to Seoul takes you over a very long causeway, including a very high bridge to allow shipping through.The tides here mean you see mud flats some of the time and deep water at others, so it always looks different.There is a toll to use the crossing."
Passing under the longest bridge in Korea,"Last October when I headed to Baekryeong -do Island of Incheon, I passed under Incheon Bridge, the longest in Korea. The view was awesome. Whenever I see the bridge, I am touched by the amazing architecture skills of South Korea. Through the bridge, many tourists and visitors come in and out the country from Incheon International Airport in 20 minutes. "
from one side to the other,This bridge gets you from an island to the mainland---over water! Great isn't it?(Why should I rate a funny bridge?)
Very Impresive bridge,"I have driven over some high and lengthy spans in the States and this one ranks up there with the best of them. When approaching the bridge from the mainland, you can see it looming on the horizon and only then do you appreciate how long it is.I will be honest, I was getting nervous and anxious as we approached the uphill but once you are on it you notice that it is a nice moderate incline, that is most importantly controlled, so there is nothing to be nervous about.It is also beautiful at night when lit up and viewed from either a high floor hotel room or from a flight."
Master Piece,Fine engineering on a massive scale . If your the passenger you'll have a great view . If driving concentrate.
30 min driving over the water,"Short cut from airport to the Incheon, nie view, the middle part is above the boat ""water way"" Ride takes 30 minutes"
Nice but not an attraction,"So this is a bridge, not a tourist attraction. It is great for driving and very long. Nice view. It is silly that Trip advisor thinks this is a legit attraction."
Really good piece of roadway. ,"If you like to travel above ground in a car or bus, this is the bridge for you! No need to use a submarine, boat or bother swimming! This bridge connects the land masses at both ends so you can ride above ground, staying dry. Really. It's a bridge. It does bridge stuff. "
Long bridge ,"This bridge is pretty long, impressive view from land and also when you take off and land. As per wiki this was build with private public funding "
Longest!,The longest land bridge by far that I have ever been to. The view from the bridge is just breathtaking. Sunset would be the best view in my humble opinion. 
Long scenic bridge,Nice to view day or night. A very long bridge approximately 13 miles long linking Incheon Seoul International Airport with the mainland..
city with many bridges,"To reach incheon airport from Seoul or Incheon seaport, you passed many bridges with various designs, height and length, there are suspension bridges, circular, straight and arched bridges, they are very beautiful when the light are on after sunset"
This bridge is vast,It's never ending never seen such a bridge fantastic to see. We were on the queen mary 2 cruise liner and had to walk around the decks to see the beginning to the end of the bridge. In fact 5 passengers were left behind as they went to the wrong side of it to get back on board and were in a taxi looking on as we sailed under it. We were all advised that they would have to fly to shanghai to embark back on board again 
spectacular bridge,"The bridge is iconic to Incheon and can be seen from the road, especially at night time when lit up."
Becoming A Korean Icon,"A truly iconic bridge that is rapidly becoming a Korean icon. An interesting architectural statement, it's a long toll bridge that makes it much easier to get from Incheon to Seoul."
Nice architecture ,This bridge has a beautiful architectural look only seen it in daylight. It's very long and has nice view while crossing it.
It's amazing architecture ,"The Bridge is a sight to behold both during the day and night. There are cables which can gives a scenic view, difficult to take photos while driving but any high rise that gives a vantage view is a great place to shoot it. It's a must drive through!One truly appreciates the Korean spirit here "
from nothing to something,I have watched this bridge go up from when it was not much more than a planner's dream to being functional. I come to Seoul nearly every year and sometimes more. I have come to appreciate that it has cut the time to the Songdo area [the first time I stayed here there was only Songdo Beach and no Songdo/Incheon]. I has cut 20-30 minutes of the journey each way and for that I am appreciative
7th longest bridge on the world ,"This is worth a drive over. Views are great, architecture is pleasing, and it's the longest bridge in South Korea."
it's a looooooooong tollbridge,"well, it's a Bridge like many others. Once you arrive ICN Airport and Need to go to e,g, Songdo Business area, you Need to travel this Bridge. It's beautiful view from the Bridge but for sure not one of the MUST SEES in Seoul."
Can't turn around easily,"We had to go to Kimpo but our driver accidentally went to Incheon instead. After paying 6600 won for this strip of road, we couldn't turn around for 10-15 minutes even before the bridge. Overall added 30 minutes unnecessarily to our trip. Seems like a scenic ride during the day."
A convenient journey-shortening tour from the airport to Incheon/Songdo with impressive engineering,"Built about 4 years ago, it shortens the journey time and is one of the longest crossings of its nature in the world The floodlighting makes the bridge especially attractive at night and you can often see it on the right of the plane as you land at Incheon."
Wonderful bridge,This bridge is truly wonderful.You can see it from Songdo island in Incheon. There even is some kind of platform to see it properly.You can cross the bridge when taking the bus to Incheon Songdo direction.
You NEED to VISIT The Incheon Bridge,"What an incredible statement and engineering marvel for South Korea to be proud of...This is THE BEACON or central focal point once you land and traverse be transportaion from Incheon Airport over to downtown Seoul or Incheon or Song Doo, just breathtaking... This is a very impressive bridge and what a wonder to behold definitely in the class of THE BEST Bridge on Earth..."
Longest Bridge in Korea,Beautiful Structure that shortens the driving time from Incheon Airport to the metropolitan districts of Seoul by 40 minutes.
It's a big structure!!!!,It's a huge structure close to Incheon International Airport. During a round trip you could see a so beatiful view OF the City.
Its just a bridge,"Nothing special about the bridge except that it is once the longest in Asia, but not anymore. Nonetheless it reflects human capacity and capability in engineering."
A spectacular entry to Korea,The suspension bridge provides a link from Incheon airport for travellers going by road to Seoul. At nighttime it is spectacularly illuminated
Incheon Bridge,Used to go to the city of Incheon form Incheon International Airport.The night view is beautiful.Third longest bridge in the world.
All bridges should be this smooth of a ride,Long and smooth. It was an easy ride with no traffic. After a long flight it was nice travelling on it leaving Incheon Airport as well as returning.
OMG,"It is amazing and trilling, I was a bit scared to walk by as it is v very high above the see. It costs around 6000 won, but it worth a ""visit"". "
View form my window,This is the best part I am enjoying in my current job. This is the view from my office window. My lab is situated in a way that I can enjoy the longest sea-link of Asia for all seasons and day/night. Amazing experience to drive trough this sea-link.
Great ride and view,"Something you will experience when you go to ICN airport. Its a nice bridge, design with a nice view "
Views of the bridge and from the bridge,I took a few photos on the KAL limosine bus from the Holiday Inn Songdo to ICN airport. Nice bridge with lots of big ships on the waters. 
Wow what a site,"Though I do not have pictures, I enjoyed driving over this bridge on my flight to and from Incheon. Is absolutely stunning to see in the day and especially beautiful at night with the lights! My husband who is very into architecture has named it one of his most favorite in the world thus far that he's seen in person."
Incredible. ,What a monumental feat of construction. I was amazed by it. Even measured the length by calculating the speed and time. At 100kph it took 25mins to get across it. It's a spectacular sight. And a great view. Although we were in it when it was a bit foggy. It has various exists to different regions and each exist with its own unique structural nuance. 
Long entrance/exit to Korea,"After landing or when departing Korea, this bridge is a spectacle to see.From the marshes, to the fishing vessels, this bridge is a massive tribute to south Koreas ability to chimeric massive structures. "
Construction technology exhibit with full functionality ,The incheon bridge is beautifully constructed the use of modern technology to get functionality gets exhibited when you drive on it... We were a bunch of professionals traveling to Downtown for dinner and light up bridge was an amazing sight... You will cross this bridge on your way to town.. 
Engineering Marvel,We took a bus to Incheon and passed over the Bridge which spans almost 20 Km.The traveling time has been reduced giving good scenic views from the bridge.Amazing engineering that allows ships to pass in and out of the bay.
Return to incheon ,"Well designed and beautifully sight seeing. All the bridges are well decorated by light during the night,so the view is gorgeous ."
place to see,The place a a good tourist attaction. The bridge connects the main land to the manmade island. We passed the bridge during night time so lights in mainland offered us a nice view.
A must visit,"We had a 16 hour layover and took several of the free tours around town. this is a must visit, but hard to get a good picture. "
Good view at night,"It is a very long bridge depicting modern engineering, it leaves you wondering what all can be achieved with will power and proper planning. The bridge allows for ship to transit under it so its of adequate height. Also travel time to airport has been reduced by it."
Night view of Incheon Grand Bridge,"There is an observatory to see Inceheon Grand Bridge which is the longest bridge in Korea (18.4km long). In the evening, photographers gater to take pictures of the LED-lit bridge.You must bring telephoto lenses to zoom in the bridge."
The workers who built it must be proud.,"It is amazing to ride across such an engineering accomplishment. I know there are others around the world, but I still think highly of the people who worked to build it and give them credit for the accomplishment."
Impressive (and efficient) bridge to Incheon,This bridge is roughly one year old and according to our taxi drive built by Samsung. It's very long with an impressive section in the middle to allow ship traffic in/out of the bay area. It cuts about 15 minutes off a communte from the Incheon airport.
Only in Korea,They build fast. They do it efficiently. And it is always impressive - like most of Seoul. Beautiful bridge and nice way to enter and leave from ICN
a very long bridge,"It is a long bridge, very long, that connects Incheon International Airport with Incheon. It is nicely lit up at night. But it isn't as fancy as the Golden Gate Bridge in SF or Brooklyn Bridge in NY. You can drive over it and enjoy interesting views."
Fast way to the airport,New bridge from Incheon Songdo (business district) to Incheon international Airport. Many buses and taxies can take you in 20-30 minutes to the Airport.
"Great bridge, amazing view, but expensive!","Impressive bridge, but quite expensive to cross (about 12 USD both ways). Great link between gorgeous Songdo and Yeongjeong islands. "
Work of art!,Beautiful structure and suprising little traffic. Toll road however. Must cross to get to airport! Neat views of the bay area. 
Breathtaking site and smooth ride.,"Incheon Bridge is one of the most beautiful, breathtaking bridges to see. The bus ride is cheap and very smooth. If you are bridge kind of guy like me, you need to go to Korea -- just like take a bus ride over it."
Transit,"A nice thing to say you've done in Korea if you haven't really had time to do much. Came out the airport, went to the hotel and then went on the transit tour."
Visit Yeongjongdo,"Beautiful by night, this bridge connects the Korean mainland at Incheon with Yeongjongdo island where Incheon International Airport is located.The bridge is about 21 Klms in length and traverses the tidal waters of the Han River delta. There are a number of small secluded beaches on Yeongjongdo and many have small fresh seafood restaurants overlooking the beach It is well worth the trip from Seoul if you are looking for a day of quiet relaxation after the hustle and bustle of the Capital."
That's a long bridge,We took the bridge from the airport to Songdo and we were moving at a fairly quick pace and 10 minutes later we were still on the bridge. Stretching out over mud flats and channels it is a marvelous piece of engineering.
You can't walk it,"It is a big piece of engineering. Nice to drive it and seeing. The time that I drove on it, a big ship passed under, so it was a cool experience "
"It's a long bridge, had to drive over it every day for a week to get to a client","Was in Incheon on business. Drove over this bridge every day. Not much to say, it's a bridge. Toll was about 6000 Won"
Well Engineered,"Even from afar, while taking the AREX train to Seoul from Incheon airport, this bridge gives a breathtaking view. I really love Korea! :)"
Nice view on this bridge,"Pass this bridge twice, once starting the school trip from incheon airport and then ending the trip going back to incheon airport. Great view when on the bridge"
WOW!,"What a fantastic modern bridge.This takes you smoothly across the low tide while you enjoy watching fishermen near the mud flats hunting for shell fish. Its a very long bridge, which gets you quickly from the airport to the new part of Incheon which only a few yeas ago was all sea side."
Modern Nostalgia,Incheon bridge is a very good example of modern hi tech engineering. It is strong and magnificent to look at. At the same time there is a nostalgic feeling when you pass by the bridge. The beautiful scene and the fresh surrounding of the sea is overwhelming.
A beautiful sight,"Lovely to view, interesting to drive across! A great view of the mud flats and Incheon. Definitely an engineering marvel worth a look at."
Cool Bridge,"The bridge is long with a great view of the mud march at low tide. The traffic run very smoothly across when I traveled on it. What else can you say about a bridge. One more thing, it better if you travel across the bridge when there is no haze, you could see more."
Impressive,Look down at the mud (depending on tide level) and just imagine that the Americans landed here in Incheon in the Korean war. 
ONE LONG SPAN!,"At a cost of about $2.8billion (if i got our tour guide correctly), the 21 km or so bridge definitely belongs with the best and most expensive modern strucrures. Opened in 2009, the bridge is the second gateway to Yungjong island where the airport is located, and the mainland.It was unfortunate that on 11 Feb 2015, while staying at the Best Western Hotel and waking up to heavy fog and icy morning, we learned of the 100 vehicle or so pile up at the bridge, resulting in two casualties. it was difficult to believe that vehicles could speed up despite the fog and icy road conditions...where was the failure?"
Impressive,This bridge is monstrous. I saw it lit up at night and also during day time. Apparently it is in the top 10 longest bridges in the world. Take a look when you re connecting to Seoul from Incheon.
The Most expensive bridge I've ever traveled on!!!,"The Incheon Grand Bridge,which opened in 2009, is a 6-lane,21,38km long road, and is the 6th largest bridge in the world and the largest and longest bridge in Korea.We were told by our guide,that the roadway rises to a height of 74 meters, a level that allows tall ships to pass beneath the bridge. At that height, the road deck is held up by cables that attach to two Y-shaped pylons that are 230 meters high.Also that he bridge will save the time it takes to drive between downtown Incheon and the airport to about 15 minutes from 45 minutes.The city side of the bridge connects to Songdo City, which is the largest planned real-estate development now under construction in the world. The development was a prospective site of the G-20 summit meeting that South Korea hosted in 2010.It was quite a spectacular drive,with a beautiful view of water!I was also told that the Incheon Bridge is used on occasions for long-distance running and cycling events over the weekends.That must be quite something to run along with this spectacular view!"
good,wow its really a good bridge to pass on ...specially for long drive at night its most memerising...and it leads to incheon airport
Unbelievable,"Looking at the map, I thought that it was just a line drawn between the islands. When we were crossing it and checked my GPS, we were indeed crossing a very long bridge. Looks magnificent and grand."
A SPECTACULAR VIEW!,An unobstructed view from the comfortable shuttle bus ride courtesy KAL! It is perhaps the longest such bridge in the world!
A never-ending bridge!,"I really enjoyed being on that bridge, travelling on it is very smooth and the views are wonderful. Very modern and high-tech."
Very nice bridge,This is a very long impressive bridge Curves nicely tooYou will get your first view of it when flying into incheon airport This is a nice airport with great free relaxation areas and wifi 
Nice Bridge,"Stunning bridge. My Korean host picked me up from the airport and we drove over this amazing bridge. Just a pitty there was not a chance to stop and admire the bridge or take some photos. Travelling by car in Korea, I found as a very ""rushed"" affair, not many places to pull off the road and take pictures, or to relax, it is just very busy and you have to go fast, but the bit of the bridge that I noticed was very spectacular."
"Well designed bridge, great view of changing tides","Incheon is a city that has seen growth since ICN (Incheon intl airport) opened as the main gateway into Korea for international flights. This bridge shows the modern changes that have come with this change. This bridge is a pleasant drive and you can see the low and high tides very well, and all the ships docking at the busy port. A nice drive in from your flight from whichever country you might be flying in from."
Worth the price!!!,"When I first realized that the inchworm bridge costs 7,400won for a sedan I was thinking...NO WAY JOSE! I'd rather swim the 21 km to the airport. But as I was driving around finding a place to park. I thought. Yeah, sure I can swim, but then all my luggage would get wet. So, I swallowed my pride and paid for the bridge. It was great!! High above the water and great views to boot! It also only took 35 min from Olympic expressway! It would have taken me hours to swim across! Take the bridge...you'll thank me later"
Beautiful,"Makes the trip from the airport fast AND beautiful. This bridge is the longest in East Asia as of last year (I think they're building a longer one in China though). It is a beautiful piece of architecture, especially lit up at night, and features stunning views of the harbor."
What a Bridge,"Great drive and an amazing structure to say you have driven over, looks great day and night but best views are naturally doing the day"
the pride of incheon,Amazing structure and has to be the pride of Incheon. 21KM in length and over the sea. We stayed at Songdo area and the journey to the airport took less than 30 minutes which would have taken more than an hour through the city. The sight of the bridge at night is magnificent. Do visit the Bridge information centre for detailed explanation and pictures of the construction.
Lovely bridge,"I first saw the bridge from the plane, and when I drove on it, it was marvellous. The architecture is superb, soaring arches with the sea shimmering underneath. I did not see any place where i could stop and take photographs, this is my only cavil. "
It is a great bridge,You will see it on the way to the airport and is quite magnificent. Enjoy the view from the road all the way to Incheon.
Nothing impressive ,"It's just a bridge! Not high, not original from the side of design and architecture. Not impressive and picturesque (((( very utilitarian and non monumental. Rama 1 and 2 bridges in Bangkok are much more unique and breathtaking "
Nice view especially at night,"I go to this Incheon Bridge Observatory at Songdo, Incheon and I found this place is really interesting.At sunset, you can take a picture of beautiful sunset view and when the sky gets darker, you can take the pictures of beautiful and amazing Incheon Bridge. Unfortunately, it is quite hard to get the very good picture of Incheon Bridge since there are not too many lights and the distance between this observatory is quite far so Incheon Bridge will be seen really small in your camera lens. However, it is worth place to visit especially if you want to have a city escape or simply bring your pets to take a walk in this area is very recommended."
impressive long bridge,it is described as one of the longest in the world of its kind .... it is most of all useful cutting the trip from airport :) 
The best driving road,The best driving road. Sceneray is absolutely great. You can see peaceful views for sky and sea. Very good.
Artistic Engineering,"From every direction, this bridge is aesthetic and impressive. Seven miles long, with a suspension section and a long causeway. I'm just sorry that I used my smartphone camera instead of lugging out my DSLR to get better shopts of this wonder. "
Good bridge,Over the last few years I watched the construction of the bridge whilst on stopovers in Incheon and the last couple of times I stayed overnight at the hotel owned by Korean Air in the city and the bus used the bridge to and from the airport..Fine piece of engineering. I didn't know at first that we were on the bridge - it was so smooth.The bridge cut the travel time to the hotel from one hour to 30 minutes
Engineering Marvel,"Endless, thrilling to ride for about 15 miles connecting the Incheon airport to Incheon city. Can take great pictures if you sit by the window."
goes on forever,didnt think we would get off it as it went on for ages. gives you a good view of the city and the harbour while you are on it at least.
very long,it is 15 Km highway bridge. it's amazing.I drove a car. I expected trembling but not. 
Very Nice.,I enjoyed the view of the bridge both in the mornings and evenings while during night time it has the best view ever.
Engineering Feat,I little spoilt by the weather this impressive 22.4km span is an engineering marvel well worth seeing.
Impressive Engineering Feat.,Seems to go on forever. You see it as you land at ICN or drive on it if you are traveling by vehicle to/from Incheon city. Unfortunately there is no place to part and enjoy the view from the bridge.
Quite Stunning,You cross the bridge driving from the airport into Incheon. It is quite stunning. We were told it was one of the longest bridges in the World. It is actually the 7th longest cable - stayed bridge in the World and the longest in Korea. It just seems to go on and on. Unfortunately we only sped along it on the way to and from the airport and there was no opportunity to stop and gasp!
Long bridge,"Longest bridge and sea view.. I passed this bridge to reach the hill temple from airport.. It just a looongg bridge, it would be better if there's a stop for taking picture"
