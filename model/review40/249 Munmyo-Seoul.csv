Munmyo Confucian Shrine and Seonggyungwan National Academy,"The current Seonggyungwan University in Seoul has a long history. Back in Joseon Dynasty, the highest national academy is this very monument. You can still see the seminar hall and the housing quarters for the students in ancient time. The giant ginko tree has been designated a Natural Monument in Korea. The monument is a photo spot especially during autumn. Many university students like to take their graduation photos in this ancient monument too."
The prettiest temple in Seoul,"This is a much under-visited and atmospheric temple that is well worth your time. Really, I think it is the best temple in Seoul. Situated in the grounds of Sungkyunkwan University, it is dedicated to Confucius. It is the main Confucian temple in Korea, in fact. While the halls are not open, the grounds are more than enough to keep you entertained."
