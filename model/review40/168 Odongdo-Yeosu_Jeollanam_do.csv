Cute little island,"Cute little island to visit if you have some time to spend in Yeosu. There are some paths bringing you to the cliffs on the island, we had a good time there in October, it was sunny and not cold at all. It felt nice to be out of the city and to just watch the boats passing by. I recommend for a relaxing afternoon, 1-2 hours trip. "
good place to visit and walk around,offers nice view and walking trail. I would recommend a trolley ride for $1 to minimize the walk. Easier for rest of trip
Not much to see if Camelia flowers are not in full bloom,The island is tiny and has some very nice views on the sea and the Yeosu port but it is unimpressive. Apparently it is beautiful in the blooming season but we were there at the end of May and there was not much to see. Right now (May/June 2019) the famous lighthouse is under renovation and inaccessible to tourists.
Wonderful Walk,"If you're in Yeosu and looking for an easy walk/hike, this is it. Its a bit of a trek along the wall to get to the island, but it's well set up. The path is marked and has stairs. Lots of stairs, in some places. But overall an easy walk/hike. Doesn't take long, wouldn't need anything special, though I wouldn't recommend any formal wear, esp footwear. But regular shoes are just fine. It doesn't take long and has some very beautiful scenic spots. Wonderful if you like nature."
Loved,"I loved this place! My brother and I came here in the middle of summer, so we were so sweaty and hot. But the walk to Odongdo was worth it. We could have took a bus instead of walking the road, but we chose to walk there and bus back. There were so many trees and rocks (can't think of the right words to describe it exactly) but it was amazing. There is a specific tree that you will see while there as well... Definitely a place to visit!"
Day trip to Yeosu,"Odongdo was recommended to me by my local friends. I caught the bus from the terminal in Gwangju and the ride was nice. Once you get to the small bus station in Yeosu, you’ll need to either walk (very far) or taxi to the pier. From the pier you will see the different bridges that connect the area. The actual hike/walk throughout the island was really nice. Crowds weren’t large and there were seafood restaurants everywhere. There is an aquarium, cable car rides (lines are very long midday and walk up to cars without a car is long) and more. Perfect day trip. The beach was beautiful. I took a cab and he was so friendly. I met more people and ate more local seafood while watching the boats before sunset. There are many small parts that make the whole of Odongdo, so stop by the tourism center, get your map and enjoy your time. If you don’t have time to visit Jeju, this is a nice alternative."
Great afternoon walk,"We decided to go for a walk in the afternoon. You can take the shuttle to cross the breakwater but if you want to walk & enjoy the scenery, I suggest to just walk. We walked back and forth.When we reached the island, we sat in one of the benches while we had some iced coffee (we bought it in the store within the island). We listened to the water fountain show.After that, we climb the hill to see the dragon cave, etc. It was windy and a relaxing walk. When you go back, you can can use the elevator up to the 11th floor where you can see the Yeosu Sea. There coffee shops and snack counters. Highly recommended."
Place for a relaxed hike and a bike ride day and night,"We visited this place during the evening, and caught the last few minutes of the fountain show. We had originally planned to bike here, but without a Korea phone number, we found it very difficult to rent the bike available at the Expo center. Also, Information Center in Yeosu Train station knew nothing about the bike rental locations other than the ones they had there. In the evening, the place was still lit up nicely and the path was easy to follow. The music around the path was creepy, however. We spent about 2 hours walking to and back. "
Odong do is a nearby plate of Yeosu expo station,"When I arrived Yeosu expo station this is one of so many nearby plate I had already come.This small Island has goods sea sight at the top house (white house) of the Island.There are alot of point plate on that Island.You better walk than travel by electrical bus, I think this trip can also improve your healthy when you climb to all of this Island making places.Hope you have a good trip.Best"
Small forest in a middle of see,small a beautiful island just like a forest that you can take rest for hours and listen to ocean wave sound ~
An island with a nice view,"I liked the view of the sea, ships and those building surrounding the island from distance. It was amazing walking on the small forest over the hill. I recommend this place for photography."
Relaxing place to visit,I went to Odongdo Island in Yeosu with a group and the trees and the sound of the sea were really relaxing. You may just walked & climb up to get a good view of the waters & cliff. Then another part that was so calming was near the fountain. Sitting infront of it while listening to the background music was really relaxing.
Relaxing Odongdo,We went to the Island of Odongdo this July and the view of the island itself is beautiful and even more when we roamed around the island. Every corner was breathtaking. You can just relax after a long walk which is also refreshing. There was a majestic fountain there that the whole family can enjoy.
The beauty of Yeosu,"Odongdo is a small island that can be easily accessed from Yeosu Expo World via the breakwater passageway. After arriving at Odongdo island, there are signs everywhere and various levels of hiking paths to choose from, ranging from beginner to advanced. The bamboo-lined roads are easy to find and well-marked, the island is pretty small and it takes about 2 hours to explore the entire island. Remember to check out the view of the dragon cave view."
Sightseeing highly recommended,"We visited this place on gloomy day. However it turned out to be a amazing experience. The sea view, dancing fountain, dragon cave etc., these features made the trip exciting."
Highly recommended,"Odongdo is a small island which is connected to Yeosu Expo Park by the bridge. The forest on the island, a dancing fountain, and Dragon cave are worth watching. Also, view of the blue sea from the island is awesome. Highly recommended for recreational activities."
Best of Yeosu,"Very comfortable and chill the vibe here. I love everything about the place, especially the Dragon Cave, it is the best place. The forest was the best healing spot in Yeosu. But walking to the village is quite long."
Not many things to see,The island is small so it does not take much time to see. The weather is good you can stroll and enjoy nature and the see but nothing is special here. The view is just ok.
Nice stroll within the city of yeosu ,"It's a little island which is 30 minutes away from the downtown yeosu but it's worth doing when you have nothing else to do. Nice climb up and down the trails and there are few things, including the dragon cave and lighthouse that you can see, oh and the beautiful coastline!"
You can skip Odongdo,"Odongdo is a little island off Yeosu. You can walk around it and glance at some small waves, but this island is a 30 minute long activity that probably takes way more effort to get to than it's worth."
Back to nature,"Great place to get away and walk. Depending on the weather, it can be crwoded, but go early in the morning, and pretty much the paths are yours."
Neat and peaceful island,The place has neatly laid out walkways. It is also free to roam around. One can find lots of scenic views both on the walkways amd on the greenery filled island.
Nicely laid out,"This island should be seen in sunshine, and summer - not in fall with heavy rain. What we saw was interesting and well kept."
Nice and easy walks,We went to Odongdo on the first day of our stay. It is rather relaxing and offers good views to the EXPO site.
Must See if You are in YeoSu,"My coworkers (51 people) and I spent 2 hours on this small and fascinating island. There are several trees to provide cool shade. Check out the Dragon's cave, bamboo path, lighthouse, exhibition hall and several other sites. There are bathrooms and benches along the way. The exhibition hall and lighthouse provide cool air; the view from the lighthouse observation deck is spectacular - even with cloudy skies. You can see the ""sea woman"" divers from there. There is an elevator that can fit about 15 people per trip. You can walk over the beautiful mural bridge for 10 minutes or pay 800 won to take the tram to and from the entrance of the island. Not sure if the purchase is cash only, so be prepared. We took the train back; it was a 5 minute or less ride after waiting a few minutes for the train to arrive and load. 8 people can sit face to face on a single bench row in each car. The tram is windowless, so bring a fan. I recommend the bridge at least one way, because the artwork is beautiful. Take a break on a bench and watch the musical water fountain. Be prepared for the mosquitos and sun! There are vending machines to purchase beverages. There is also an ice cream vendor near the tram pick up and drop off. We brought and carried our own water bottles."
small island in secret forest,"best hot spot in yeosu is the odongdo island. recently yeosu expo made this island more popular in korea. easy to get and easy to walk hills will made ur spirit healing. here you can take cablecar to downtown, there u can have nice lunch any"
Nice gardens and beautiful bridge,"Odongdo is a beautiful island. I recommend taking the cable car from the opposite side to Odongdo because you can see a beautiful view of Odongdo. There is a beautiful colorful bridge that you can see at night. The gardens are well organized. I give three stars because after seeing the island by cable car and then seeing the gardens, there is nothing much to see. Also, you have to wait one hour for the cable car."
Handicap Unfriendly,"Sadly, I didn't get to see much as I'm a wheelchair bound disabled person. So I would like to let other disabled persons know and forewarn them not to make a wasted trip here. A single cherry blossom tree did tried its best to comfort me though. :-D"
A lot of walking/hiking but worth it,Be prepared to walk a lot. If you are at Yeosu you definitely should visit this Island but be prepared for walking / hiking.
A tiny island,I could not enjoy because the strong wind. Ask the time of departure before you buy the shuttle bus ticket. Sometimes they make you wait for 30mins. for the bus when the total walk is less than 25 mins.
A nice afternoon walk,"Nature is nicer than anything built in Yeosu town. Odongdo is a smallish island linked to the mainland by a causeway. There are paved paths on the island, weaving their way through lush greenery. Here and there the path opens out to the shore cliffs, giving pretty views of the sea and ships passing by. Odongdo is quite a popular place (almost all domestic Korean visitors) and except for a few moments, you're never quite far enough from others and their chatter.On the other hand, because there is steady visitorship, toilet amenities are well provided."
Beautiful and musical,Is perfect to walk and to enjoy the nice views of Yeosu Sea. Odongo Island is famous romantics place for couples. Lovely
Nice Island,"good place to see the sun rise, and also it is nice for people who love to climb the mountains, with lot of trees and nice climate..."
Great park for all ages~,"I loved visiting this park/island with my elderly parents. The walks are clean, well built, interesting. The signs to the different views are well marked, bathrooms are many, also clean. "
Beautiful and well kept,We hiked around the small island and it was quite a pleasant visit. Very well planned and there were plenty of trees to shade us fro the hot summer sun. Lovely place!
A little island off the shore,A light hike with some stairs and a lot of viewpoints. Loved the surrounding sea even though the island itself wasn't too special. Nice for a Sunday afternoon stroll with the family.
Trip to Odongdo,What a wonderful and relaxing experience to visit this small island. It is of 15-20 minutes walk and surrounded by heart aching lovely views. Sunset at Odongdo is especially recommend and after that the from this island we can see the whole ocean covered by lights. 
Ktravel trip.,I have raelled to Odongdo just few days ago. It is beautiful island with lots of nature. I have visited here with Ktravelbus friends and it was just amazing.
Nice protected island,"After a 50 min boat trip in the bay of Yeosu, with the scenic view of the city, and above is the shuttle cable car connecting the two parts of land surrounded the Bay Area; then we landed in the same place when we left the harbour. From there you may take a shuttle tram or go by walk which will take you about 15-20 min depending yr speed to go 1.5km and we took the later to accomplish our daily 10k steps. A nice track indeed and very safe and flat . Till you reach the end team station where you may wander the whole island with many options to see , the caves, the exclusive trees like penis tree and other object , we were in time pressure so we chose the shortest distance , and go back by a tram . There is a replica off ship with which the Korean success fully attacked the japanese invasion during the world war 2nd. Located near the water fountain."
"Fresh air, good walk ","An island developed very well as the tourist spot One can take a bus ride from the start or can walk to the islandThe climb to the lighthouse is good & the view from the lighthouse awesomeA long walk , don't forget to carry water while exploring the island "
We enjoyed a peaceful walk on this island,It is an island connected to mainland by a 200-meter bridge. You can walk or ride a tram. There is a small shop selling drinks (tea/coffee) on the island.
A great walk,"I'm fortunate to live within walking distance to Odongdo. It gets busy with tourists and locals alike wanting to get fresh air and beautiful sea views. There is a casual restaurant for a drink or bite to eat, a souvenir shop, speed boat rides, and marked trails."
Top Priority in Yeosu ,"Beautiful Island. You can reach it by food, actually. Really nice paths to take a walk in Green Nature... and the Highlight is the fountain park, which is combined with classical music! Perfect for a Picknick... just ist and relax!"
A fun afternoon,This island is a cute place to go for couples. It is small enough to walk around in just a few hours. There is a small little cafe in the middle to grab a drink and relax a little. It has great spots to walk out along the coast for cool pictures. There is also a small lighthouse but not really worth going to the top. The train ride is short and only 800 won. The walk out to the island is not really pretty or anything so the train is worth it.
Beautiful,You can just enjoy the Ocean scenery or hiking with your company will make your day. Also there is seafood restaurants that you can relax and enjoy. 
nice diversion for a few hours,"Nice enough park, with a well marked trail running around the island. Only about 2-3 hours of activities unless you're a very slow hiker."
Quiet Island with great views - a location resort in itself,"Odongdo is an island joined to the mainland by a man-made pier. It is a resort location in itself, and my review, in keeping with others reviewing the location focuses on the island on the whole and not on any individual attraction, as there would be insufficient to comment on each. The pier, about a kilometre in length is served by a tractor driven bus. It is worth taking the bus the length of the pier which costs 800 won per adult - each way. If you want to buy a round trip ticket you must buy two single tickets. It is easier to do this in one go when you're travelling to the island.Getting off the bus, I must confess to being a little disappointed. It was a selection of cheap novelty shops and Korean seafood restaurants. None of this appeal to me. I took the steep footpath to the summit of the mountain on the island, which is quiet and shady and suddenly the place had sense of appeal. I carried on walking up the hill until I reached the Lighthouse. There is a good view from the Lighthouse in all directions. The top floor of the lighthouse has been turned into a viewing gallery which disappointingly has Perspex windows through which it is difficult to see clearly. The viewing gallery is served by an elevator to the left of the Lighthouse.I stopped at the coffee shop opposite the Lighthouse. I ordered a coffee which tasted nothing like coffee but was quite pleasant. The outdoor seating area was quite tranquil and in the background the shop was playing quiet classical piano music. It was very restful and peaceful indeed. I stayed there for almost an hour in the shade listening to the music and enjoying the fresh breeze that was blowing over the island.I explored the various footpaths, which offered me different views of the sea. I eventually took the coastal path back in the direction of the bus. This was a very circular footpath but again very enjoyable with breathtaking views of the ocean and the rock formations.The island of claims to have a tree which appears in the formation of a penis. Is known as the penis tree - amusing I suppose and bearing some resemblance. I shall remember the visit more for the breathtaking views and the relaxing coffee shop at the top of the hill. It's well worth visiting for a few hours, but I would suggest to visit on a weekday when the island is far less busy than at the weekend.Of note, the app 'maps with me' does not work on the island to show the footpaths, given the island is so small this really is not a problem however. I would take my own drinks or food if I wanted to stay longer unless you appreciate Korean seafood. Notwithstanding, the coffee shop on the top of the hill is well worth a rest and bodes well for moments of contemplation."
Cruise around and exploring inside,"We took cruise boat and sail around Odongo island there were amazing landscape all around,then we disembarked and stroll on the island, lush greenery and rocky shore ,it's unforgettable."
Easy access - very pleasant place to just chill out,A good free option- only a ten minute walk from the hotel (MVL) I stayed in - great place to just relax if you want a break from the city - feels like your far away but actually very close
Lovely island,"Your experience will depend on how many people are there. It's very touristy, but also beautiful. I went on Lunar New Year and it was absolutely packed, but the scenery is awesome regardless."
Good for your legs and heart!,"Like most tourist attractions in Korea (so it seems to us), Odongdo provides a great workout for your legs and heart. many places to hike around, with plenty of stairs to climb. Be sure to find Dragon Cave and climb down to the surf-side rocks!"
First out of the country trip,"Very late review. Amazing view at the top of the hills. Definitely worth the walk. There is also a lighthouse here as part of the trip, which is interesting as it was my first time seeing a lighthouse. Amazing experience."
Wear your walking shoes,"I was curious about the locals I saw all decked in bright hiking clothes, and soon realised that the island is a good place for a hike (which meant that the walking trails are not that easy).Walking into the island takes about 15min. If you are with children or elderly, or just feels lazy, you can opt to take the tram for 800krw. Free lockers can be found before the bridge to Odongdo.Odongdo is also a filming location for Running Man!"
Beautiful little island escape,"Yeosu is a pretty strange city. It seems almost a little haunted after the big Expo. For me the best part about visiting Yeosu was our little trek around Odongdo island. We had planned on just heading to the bus stop but I'm very glad we stopped here! We came in September or October on a surprisingly hot autumn day. The walk across the pier to the island was really nice, but it was definitely a relief to get into the shade. The island is fully criss-crossed with walking paths but there are a lot of stairs if you want to get out into the open, climb over some rocks and get close to the ocean. I love the mix of rugged and convenience on this island. There is a nice open area at the beginning/end with a musical fountain, a gift store and a cafe. I really loved the ambience on this island even though it was quite busy.Definitely a highlight!"
A lovely island with its own charm,"Odongdo is a beautiful place. Among the must-sees are the musical fountain which churns out good water show while playing popular scores, the lighthouse with great views of the surroundings (but not Yeosu city), the seaside rocky cliffs and simply the natural surrounding in the island's woods. Be sure to check out the Penis Tree which is not a misnomer after all! Food and souvenir shopping are aplenty but souvenirs are pretty mediocre (not Yeosu or Odongdo specific). Nearby there's a small building where you can learn about Yeosu's better days when it became the host for World Expo 2012. You can go to the island by walking across the causeway (700-800m), paying 800 won for a bus-train trip (the queue can be sometimes long) or cycling across (5,000 won for 2 hours). I don't recommend cycling because the route to lighthouse and other Odongdo attractions in the woods is too steep and not easy to cycle on. So your cycling is only limited to the flat area near the musical fountain so it's a little pricey for that. Furthermore, near the entrance to the island, there exists the only tourist information centre in Yeosu which has English-speaking staff. Be sure to make use of that facility as you may find it hard to move around or find good food without advice. When you exit the island, do NOT go into the tunnel as it will lead to Turtle Bridge and not Yeosu city."
Hidden treasure Odong Island,"This is a great place to go with little kids, 2 and 4 year olds. They loved the trolley ride to the island and all the trees (evergreens, bamboo forests and other.) The paths were paved or had wooden planks so it was easy for us to use the stroller. Some paths had stairs so we parked the stroller and walked down with the kids. The lighthouse was a highlight for the kids, especially climbing on the big orange. There was a good view of the outlying islands, Expo grounds and Dolsan bridge. Fortunately the lighthouse had an elevator and bathroom. The musical fountain was under-repair when we visited. I guess they were getting ready for high season in July/August."
Beautiful rustic view,"Odongdo Island is an easy to access place that is good for some gentle walks. Expect a lot of stairs but beautiful scenery. You can also take the tram to reach the start of the walks, but I find it unnecessary as the walk along the coastline is beautiful and serene."
A nice little Island,"Odongdo is a nice little island on the Yeosu coast. Here, at the Asian mainland's frontier, you can easily spend a few hours enjoying hiking and nature. The island is densely forested and has some very good viewpoints on the rocks. It's nothing spectacular, but if you're in the area it's a good place to visit. Best to combine with the Yeosu Expo site and the Aquarium, which are all situated next to eachother."
Beautiful walks,A beautiful island with well marked trails that allow you to explore. Worth a visit. Great views of the surrounding seas.You can walk across or take the tram for norminal charge. It's located waking distance from aquarium and yml hotel. 
Go for a Picturesque Walk!,"I highly recommend taking the time to enjoy this picturesque place! I'm pretty sure it's a little island, but not 100% sure. I recall walking across a bridge to get there ( there was also a tram/ train for a nominal fee, but was also sold- out when we arrived).  Bring water and be prepared to walk up and down many stairs. It's really worth the views. There are so many places to just stop and watch ... It's beautiful and serene. Two hours here is more than enough time."
Hike around Odongo island,"A beauty spot even on a hot, muggy day! We parked near the stop, and got the tram to the end of the island. After a short, crowded ride, we arrived and saw the fountain- got misted by it- lots of children playing (during August vacation) and after getting bottled water at a vending machine, headed up a path to the lighthouse. The trails were immaculate, easy to walk along and well-marked. Walking in the wooded area was cooler. The lighthouse had a dramatic view from the top and a pleasant, stiff breeze. Next we followed a path down to the rocks facing the sea. Again, a dramatic vista. We walked through the wooded areas and returned to the paved section where gift shops, concessions, bathroom were. Our group had left! So we race-walked along the causeway. Fortunately not a terribly long walk."
My trip to Yeosu..Korea:),Went to Yeosu..with my husband..stayed at hotel Benikea..went to Odongdo island..though it was a unplanned rain that day..still manage to see the cave of dragon..n light house..feel like walking on a mountain island..beautiful musical fountains..took about 1 n a half..hr to take a complete round around the island..beautiful town Yeosu..n it's num.1 attraction Odongdo..loved it..
Odongdo Island,"We walked from the hotel out to the island along the breakwater, unfortunately Typhoon Sanba had caused a lot of damage to Yeosu 10 days earlier. A lot of the rails were bent over from the force of the water and several walking trails were closed as the steps or railings had been destroyed. The island itself was green, cool and restful and hopefully in time these trails will be repaired. The restaurant and convenience store were tired looking but how much this was due to the typhoon I don't know. If it is a hot day make sure you have a hat or umbrella as the walk to and from the island along the breakwater is not shaded and very hot."
A really refreshing change,"Well, coming from a city, Odongdo is a pretty quiet and refreshing place to relax and just enjoy. To be really frank the photos do not do any justice to the place. Odongdo is much more beautiful than just these. I went with my parents to Yeosu with the precise reason that a lot of people have given really good reviews of the place. However, details on how to get to the place was really minimal, and we had a hard time finding the place. Anyway, here's to other travelers. There is a bus to the bridge that links the main island to Odongdo from Yeosu train station. Bus #2 or #333 I think. Best to double confirm with the local information counter. As my Korean is not really good, I can only understand but not speak. So what I usually say would be, Odongdo bu-seu or something of that sort."
a nice walk,"I like the way when we walk on the 'road' connect the mainland to the island. We do it at night and the temperature is just great with breeze. There is a 'fisheries experiencing zone' which is fun ( I think it was there because of the Expo around).In the Odongdo island, the souvenirs shops were closed when we got there at around sun-set time."
Lovely place !,"It is located next to the Yeosu Expo and a breath of fresh air. Take a walk along the bridge as you enjoy the view of the 2012 Expo especially at night with the lovely lights. Stop for a refreshing iced camellia tea at the little shop facing the lighthouse. I bought some delicious camellia jelly after sampling it there. It cost 5,000KW and is cheaper than buying it at the airport and could only be found at these 2 places. Take the lift up the lighthouse to enjoy the view of the surrounding. "
Beautiful little island off of Yeosu,It was only 20 minutes walk from Expo site...and crossing the bridge you get a really good view of the sea and the Expo grounds. It doesn't take long to walk around the island but must-see spots are Dragon Cave and the Lighthouse. 
Sailing is wonderful here!,I can't wait for the 2012 EXPO here! People are friendly and it's easy to get around.
"Beautiful, and worth the walk out the causeway","a short walk past the location of the 2012 Expo (was under construction when we went), you can see the entire island in about one hour. Weather was poor when we went, but it is a must-see if you are in the Yeosu area, peaceful walks, and a small lighthouse where you can see the northern harbor. There are a handful or restaurants right past the entrance."
