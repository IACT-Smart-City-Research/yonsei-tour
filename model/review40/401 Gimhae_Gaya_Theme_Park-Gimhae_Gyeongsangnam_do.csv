Better avoid visiting during winter months,"We started the day by watching the live musical (Miracle Love) that gave us a pretty nice background introduction of the ancient Gaya kingdom. During the winter period when we visited this place, there were hardly any visitors around. All the F&B stalls within the theme park were closed, except for a couple of restaurants outside the main entrance (the right hand side one was a much better option!) and an excellent cafe on the 1st floor away from the main entrance. There are about 8-10 different sites to explore within the theme park, and kids would be happy to run around collecting different passport stamps whenever they arrive at a new site, The most attractive site for me was the gated palace area, where a few mini museums are housed. There is a small amusement/adventure park for kids, and visitors are required to pay a separate entrance fee for that. Daylight was rather short during the winter months, the whole place started to turn dark at around 5pm. To make full use of the time there, it is therefore more meaningful to visit the theme park in late spring or summer time."

Kaya Themed Park in Kimhae,"This themed park was open on May 2015. You can experience the cultures and life of old Kaya Kingdom. Also, you can see a historic play there, though it's not free of charge."
