its good,come here after visiting Gamcheon Village- take Bus 96 from near Jagalchi station. it was cloudy. its good for me the skywalk not too high. its not scarier like in Oryukdo which higher and windy.
Lovely walk,"Came here after visiting Gamcheon village - Take Bus 7, 9, 26, 30, 71 or 96 from Chungmudong Gyocharo Board and get off at Songdo Beach Stop. Lovely walk along the bridge."
so so,It was good at cable car to see the view but not worth to go because far from other place. Not much interesting thing to see.
HBH disappointed,"We read 'SkyWalk' so we were expecting something a little higher! It is a walkway over the sea just a few metres above the the sea level. There is, in parts, the opportunity to look down through very scratched plexi glass to the sea below, which is also somewhat dark. Don't expect to see fish swimming around underneath the walkway, Busan is a very busy sea port and the sea reflects this. At one point you have to scramble over rocks to reach the viewing area at the end, this could be very difficult for less able folk or wheelchairs,"
One of the many Sea view strolling locations at Busan,"Just like several others, Songdo skywalk is another sea view strolling location at Busan. It is near the Songdo beach. You can have a great view of the sea, shores, bridge and all around. Walking over the bridge and near the area is very comfortable. There is a cable car nearby to have a view of the whole area from top, but ground views from skywalk are just as fine as well. A good photo shoot location."
Very pretty!,"This area is really pretty, especially during sunset. The skywalk takes you a little bit further out which gives you a very nice view of Songdo Beach. Just be aware of the seagulls as a lot of people are feeding them in the area. "
Ok,"A nice little promenade out from the beach front, but really not much more than a pier! You do get a pretty good view of the big ships waiting to come in to port though. The beach itself is fairly average but it seems to be patrolled. If you’re from somewhere like Australia which has beautiful beaches, I wouldn’t go there on purpose. "
Cool skywalk in Busan,The sky walk and the cable car is located at the Songdo beach. It's near Gamcheon village. You can grab a taxi from the village. The skywalk is very long and cool. 
Not a big thrill,"It’s a walkway over the water with scratched plexi glass in a few spots. The beach might be fun to hang out in fur a day, though"
Nice Bridge with a nice view of the sea and Gamcheong Village,This is near Gamcheong cultural village. Good to drop by here to take some photos after visiting the village. The skywalk is not very long and you should be done with this place within 30 mins. Go this place only if it is on the way.
Interesting skywalk!,"We came by Songdo Skywalk after visiting Gamcheong village. The skywalk overlooks beautiful sea! Some parts of the skywalk are made of glass and one can see the sea below! Great photos of the colourful village, lighthouses and surroundings. Not to be missed!"
Holiday ,"The walk itself is not overwhelming however the concept is novel and the scenery from the walk offers a whale in the ocean, a mermaid and good views for the beach which is pleasant. Easy walking and a good experience. "
Another Great Busan Seaview,"There is a beach located beside the Songdo Skywalk. Peace place to feel the sea breeze and take some photos. There are some statue built on the cliff rock. Other than that, nothing much on this skywalk."
free activity,"an activity that does not cost anything if you happen to be in this area.across the road, there is an observation deck as well."
Songdo Skywalk,"Nothing much just walking on the bridge. Okyrudo is much better. But if you want to see the surrounding, it is better to take the air cruise cable car."
Calm place for your little resting,"It was really short time but Song- do sky walk was strong impressive place for me. Just we can see the Sea and walk and talking follow the wind and calm wave. Travel make people hard and hurry sometimes, but when we meet some special place, we can find another reason ' why am I here, and Who is with me now ...' if you need some break in your trip Song-do sky walk it will be great place for you. "
Worth a walk around after getting off the Songdo Cable car.,You can either drive to this place or get off from the Songdo Cable car.It's just a couple of fancy bridges you walk over the water on.There are lots of food places and car parking.It's worth the effort if your in the area.
Great for a weekend,It was rainy saturday but we was planning to go there anyway. And we was quite impressed of how nice this place even during the rain. We took one way ticket and when we reach the top base rain was over and we walk back along the sea with the nice sea view. Highly recommended place if you like walking.
Beautiful view with seagull company ,Really awesome place for a walk and view the Bay of busan. Overlooking the sea and have a great sunset view. The skywalk nicely built with some open space on the bridge for and can be scary .. the seagull is coming so close to you and you can even touch them . It is a small walk and probably 100m from the shore. Nice view with great sea Breeze make it a perfect place for all Seasons to visit . 
Beautiful sunset view,"The cable with the glass floor cost 20,000 won per adult. Was there in Oct 2018 and saw the moon and sunset at different end.Best time to visit is between 5 to 7pm "
Sky walk....? Elevated pier.,This is a slightly elevated pier walk with some glass floor panels in places. Nice walk nice views and free.
Beautiful!!,This whole area is stunning. This is a must see and a very easy pretty walk. Do the cable car as well. Such a beautiful area.
"Very Nice, Worth a Visit","This also features a skywalk and is a lot more interesting. On the left hand side of the entrance there are boulders for people to climb out and get close to the sea, to take pictures or simply sit and enjoy the nice seaview. It is safe and clean.To the right is a clean, broad esplanade for people to stroll, sit and relax or watch the world go by. Seeing the sun set is so lovely and sets a romantic mood when capturing the orange pink sky at sunset. In one area they have cable cars so buy return tickets, get on the cable car to the other end and return, and take some nice pics whilst inside the glass cabin. Walk along the beach and waterfront and enjoy the sun and breeze. On one far end of the esplanade there is a cycling path as well as a broad pavement for joggers. It is quiet and at some areas along the waterfront you can see people fishing. This is really very nice and as it is far from the bustling crowd, staying there a bit to enjoy the full seaview, will, for a second, make you forget you are in noisy, busy Busan."
Beautiful night view ,It's near to Songdo Beach and Busan Aircruise. Beautiful place to stroll around at night with cable car view and Namhangdaegyo bridge view. A place of local people hang around and take a foot dip at night during summer time. 
Better then Oryudo skywalk,"Better skywalk with longer length protruding out to the sea. Good place to sample live seafood albeit bit of pricey,"
just an elevated cement boardwalk,Nothing interesting. Just for visitors to take some photos to show their friends where they have been. Could give this place a miss.
Okay but nothing really special,"Went there as part of a city tour. A bridge near the beach, boats and jet boats available. Fairly relaxing walk as it was not that crowded; on the other hand there are probably better places to enjoy the coastline of Busan. Not really worth a special trip though possibly worth a look when you are in the area"
A pleasurable morning walk,"Went there around 9am on a Tuesday and had our leisurely walk as there weren't much people then. The place opens early and is available to the public for free. The place will give you a good view of Songdo beach. You'll be delighted to learn a bit about Songdo beach history at the very small tunnel at the middle end of the walk. There's also a statue of a mermaid along the rocks. It was a good walk as though it's sunny, the wind is cool during that time. Overall, it's a good place to visit when you're along Songdo area."
Waste of time,"I thought it would be really skywalk, but it's just the walking bridge near beach and about 10 meters high with some windows to look down. So boring."
Songdo Skywalk,Good place to take picture of sunset as there was less people as compared to Haeundae Beach. It’s winter too so there’s nobody at all in the waters which again is perfect as you can take unobstructed view of the coastline against the sunset. 
An enjoyable walk,A good idea to have a skywalk which is more like a walking bridge to allow good views of the sea. It’s free and easy to access.
It’s not just a Skywalk,"There are a variety of things to do and see here. Aside from the nice view of the beach and skywalk. You can also take the cable car for a bird’s eye view of the place. While on the cable car near the other end, we saw a cliff path where people were walking on, but it was already dark when we got there so wasn’t able to walk there. We would like to definitely comeback here."
Nice scenery,"Beautiful structure of the bridge. Worth to go.. maybe for me. Is a first timer. Very enjoy the great sea and place. I like the bridge very much.. Beside the bridge, there is a cable car. You can take from one side to another side. Cable car it has 2 type, 1 is normal cable car. Another type with the glass flooring. Fee a bit costly. If you have more time, you can drop by for cable car there too."
Beautiful structure and place to enjoy.,"Visited songdo Skywalk in late Oct. We walked the Songdo Peninsula geotrail from Annam Park to Songdo beach and to Songdo skywalk.The whole Skywalk structure is awesome to see and best of all, it is free (no entrance fee). We loved the sea wind blowing to our faces and see the clear blue sea and sky. It was not crowded as we went on weekday. We spent about 45 mins on the skywalk.Good to spent a whole day at Songdo area. Apart from the skywalk, we visited songdo beach, the park on top of a nearby hill and took the busan airbus (cable car) for the vening and night scene. The park is just on top of a nearby nearby hill and it is linked the Cable car building. We can see the whole skywalk structure from the top.Plenty of seafood restaurants, coffee shops and other food shops to stop by for meals, tea break and coffee."
Beautiful seen,My Thai and Chinese friends recommended to me there. I took a taxi there from the see food market. Sunny day but really strong wind like as storm ha ha ha.... but really good. I'd like to visit again. Thanks my friend
