Pleasant stop,Need only about 2 hours here. Combination of botanical gardens and kids amusement park. Pleasant way to take a walk through wooded areas on Jeju island
Different Sceneries ,A very huge place. You need to check on the weather before going to the place so that you will have a splendid moment.
Worth a visit,We enjoy the visit. The place looks magical. We couple enjoy it and so thus our young adult kid and 9 year kid. Each of the stop is worth the visit. There are coffee shop and snacks in each of the stop.The best stop is the last stop wherein there are so many beautiful flowers fully landscape and so good to take pictures. We visited autumn. The place is clean the restrooms are clean. I love their coffee its worth the visit. 
Beautiful Place,"A very nicely organized theme park with different views at different stations. If you like to take pictures, a good half day can be spent there."
Good way to see some nature trails with kids or those who can’t walk too well,"If you want to see some nature trails but can’t do long distances over natural rocky ground, then this will suit. The train ride to each destination makes it easy to travel. The walks are well groomed. Plentiful toilets. There are some theme park like features, such as boats & a pirate ship, to keep the young ones entertained along the way (at extra cost for some)."
Great outdoor place for kids and family-fun locomotive train! ,"Great place for kids and a family-went with 1 year old and 3 year old and both had a blast. It’s 12,000 per adult and 10,000 (Korean Won) for entrance and you ride a train to 3 different stations. We only stayed at the first station as we didn’t want to skip naps but it was wonderful-big open areas to run through and lots of nature. Can be congested at points but runs smoothly and big enough to find some space to yourselves as well. Didn’t check out toilets/facilities as it smelled a little funny but run very smoothly-not chaotic or anything even during Chinese National holiday week and the first sunny day in a few. The staff was all friendly and we were so glad we went! "
"Good for a family day out, green and refreshing",Good to visit with family and children. the train ride takes you to different spots where you can relax and enjoy the natural beauty. Access to many areas are restricted and you need to stay within the designated areas. Staff are very helpful and polite. lots of cafes around to rest and have a quick bite.
Maybe it’s winter so...,There is nothing much to see at all. Bare trees and plants. And super cold in March. The only fun to do is the train ride that’s about all.
Interesting sights,Ice covered trees provided a beautiful vista and provided lovely background for photos. Train rides from site to site made it easy to get around and enjoy park. 
Great day spent outside with good weather,"It was a good experience for me family with 2 children as they enjoyed ut the most. Weather as a bit chilly even during autumn, so bring extra layers with you so that you can get confortable. The train ride at the start of the trip really feels like the highlight of the trip, although you can board the train on and off later to get from one garden to another. There are 5 stops for you to stroll around, toilets, cafes and other facilities are available and very much well taken care off. We had a great time all in all. Highly recommended to friends and families. "
Beautiful landscape,"Unfortunately, when we arrived it was a raining day (moderate) but we managed to cover the whole place. 4 train stations/stops. Each station shows a different landscape and beauty. 3rd stop (flower) there is a hot footbath area to relax before leaving the area. We took the walking trail to the 4th stop and enjoy the forested route and chilling day after the rain. Entrance ticket is KRW12,000/pax (group of 5 & above) "
Fun experience," Eco Land Theme Park - A great fun day trip is a must here, I recommend to go with friends or family."
Nice theme park,Very nice place and worth a visit. It will require you around 2 to 3 hours to visit the entire park. Train ride is nice too. Beautiful scenery. Love how the park or each train stop has different theme. It maybe very hot during sumer time
Nice Train Ride,The park will appeal more for kids rather than adults. The train ride provides a nice experience and there are some attractions in the park that caters for children. The tour in the park took us about 3 hours to finish. 
Nice Place ,"This park has many nice attractions featuring nature and props for photo moment. Personally, it will be great to visit during spring where the park is peppered with plentiful of flowers. There is very little shades and therefore kids need to have their sunblock on. My kids love trains and they had trains to bring them around between the stations. Great fun!Worth the visit but please do not expect it to be universal studio or Disneyland type of park."
Just a park,"Nothing much about the park that wow me. Supposed to have full bloom in of the stations, but nothing at all. quite disappointed though. Will not return after 1 visit."
Disappointment ,Read mixed reviews about this place.However decided to go ahead to visit.Disappointed as it was very man made.The only thing that was natural was probably the short walk through the forest.Personal opinion would be that it’s not worth the visit for the price.
Nice scenary,Enjoy the activity which is mainly train ride. December is quite cold and wish the centre to have more areas to warm up. 
Nice train ride with scenic outdoor areas for picnics,"For family with kids, this will be a nice to visit as there's a nice steam train ride which brings you around to many scenic areas within Eco Land. A nice break from all the nature views and long trekking walks."
For nature lovers,"Its big, full of trees, nice view for taking pictures. Dont go there during holidays, lots of people, long queue for the service train that will bring you around. We didnt enjoyed the place coz its raining during our visit. The windmill area is beautiful, not so much flowers around coz its start of autumn. I think its better to visit during spring season. "
Nice Place,Visited with wife and found it to ba a nice place and relaxing.did the train ride and was fun.This place I think would be great if visiting with young children
Very nice and romantic theme park,"We visited just right before winter ends, so the timing was perfect. Make sure that you come early in the morning as the crowd builds up quickly."
Wonderful place to visit with children,There is a great deal to see and it was excellent for us as teachers with over 50 children in our group.
Nice time outdoors,"This was a nice place in Jeju to take the kids, preferably in cooler weather because we went in July, and we were dying. Besides the weather, everything else was nice. There's a train that will take you to different stations. We only stopped at stations 2 and 3 because we brought our boys ages 5 and 7, and those stations had more stuff for them to enjoy. We probably could have stopped at all stations, but it really was just so hot! There were lots of places for photo ops, whether all cute or nature-like. The restaurant at the main building was very limited in the food that they sell. We ended up eating light food at station 2's cafe and also got drinks at station 3. All the staff there were very friendly and seemed to enjoy their work. Overall, nice place to visit. Oh one warning though, our rental car's GPS brought us to different places even though we entered the correct phone number and even when we asked someone for help and they entered it in Korean. Just make sure you research how to get there because it was very frustrating for us."
Nice and big park,"Every one enjoy in eco land, a place can be visit if u like nature,can be reach by public transport, must pay entrance fee ,big park with train "
Perfect place to relax and enjoy nature with kids! ,"Ecoland is a great place to hangout if you're traveling with a family and have kids in Jeju island. Lots of activities centered around kids at Ecoland. You buy a train pass for 12,000KRW and it takes you to 4 different stations with each stop has a different theme. Definitely a great to place to enjoy nature and have relaxing time with the kids. Train rides is short 5-7 mins between each station! Enjoy your vacation in Jeju! "
Too crowded and mostly man made,"A pleasant theme park with train rides around 4 stations. As it's summer, can see entire fields of flowers.Lots of man made structures and buildings for educational purposes.But does not really fit in its Eco Land theme and can be too crowded in weekends"
Relaxing and enjoyable ,"Not so much of a theme park, there isn't any rides apart from a train. But we had fun there, many gardens, landscapes and things to see. We walked the long Eco trail. The place is well maintained and clean. Wouldn't advise to go in winter tho, as many of the flowers won't be in bloom. "
Nothing spectacular,"So plot of good sized land and put in a very rudimentary""Disneyland""train, windmills, galleon ship, ponds, streams, landscapes. That's about it. Yes many photo-ops but not much else to do.Yes weather was nice on day of our group tour, but probably won't seek this out if on my own."
"Ordinary park, nothing special","Named as Eco-park but really artificial at all... Nothing special with ordinary decorations and plants. Fairly speaking, young children will enjoy the train ride but for adults/teenagers not worth spending time here..."
A Nature Park,Eco Land Theme Park has different stations each station differs from the other with a theme. I Love 2nd station where the windmill is and noah's ark. it's a huge area for family and i love the train too.
Ecoland visiting!,"By the time we visit Ecoland, it's already 4pm so time limited as it closes at 5 pm!We took a long train that stop at every 4 places of visiting.In the first stop, we went through attraction on beautiful scenery and artistic work and went to another second stops to wait for the train. Then the train took us to third stops and another attraction artwork of beautiful small houses and Christmas artwork and many others. Then we went to last stop that is garden which grows lavender,green tea and many types of flowers. It's a beautiful garden on the whole. On whole, I'll come to again another time again on next visit!"
Interesting but need maintenance for some areas,"It's a nice place and interesting concept but some of the attractions seem run down and nothing much to see.. It's good to go with kids to explore the fresh air or play area , got spare time or if u on tour good to pay a visit . If not there are many other places in Jeju with nice scenery to visit .. "
Close to nature,"If you love nature, this is a place you should visit. Nothing much to do , basically just walking and taking photos. But I personally love it ,because you can't find such a relaxing place back in a big city. It's good to visit during colder days."
Large park,This attraction is not theme ark but a large garden. In my opinion station 1 and 4 is the best area for taking photo. Down from the train at Station 1 and take a walk aroud 15 minutes to station 2 and take lots of picture :)
"It was good, nothing special","You can't expect more from a park. It is good though but nothing special.During my visit, it was pouring and can't enjoy the place to much. The park was managed well but really nothing excited me when strolling around. There were some theme park there and we can using train from one place to another places. Yeah.. it was ok."
Good half day,Great for kids. A fair bit of walking if you want to everything but I would highly recommend it for kids up to 10. 
GOOD for Photos,"I went during autumn but seams not many changes is leafs color at that time. love the view, flower garden, took tons of good photos."
Relaxing and simple sights,"A train ride that takes you from sight to sight, there is a gorgeous lake walk and a pretty garden, but sights are very simple and straightforward. Not a must-see."
Relaxing train ride,"Engaged a taxi driver to get here. When you arrive, you need to buy tickets to enter the park. Although the sun was out, it was also raining, so we didn't enjoy the Park as much as we could have done. The train was a hop on/hop off style and had it not been raining, we probably would have explored more at each stop. As it was, we needed to stay under cover of the train! Would only recommend going to this place on a rainless day!"
Train ride,"The purpose of my visit is for the train ride as my kid is crazy about that. It's really good and pleasant. We have so much fun just for the ride. I can see also some of the attractions along the ride, should be good as well if you visit those. "
Recommended if you are with kids,"The best part of this is all the nature surrounding you while on the train (which takes you everywhere) , the river, just the pretty landscape. I'm a teen and I definitely wouldn't go there again, it was boring for me except for the nice pictures of the landscape tbh. There's a windmill, a big pirate ship, picnic side. If you have kids they are gonna love it, trust me. I went with other families with kids and they completely enjoyed it. If you want to have a picnic, I suggest this place also cause even when it's crowded the picnic side is literally huge so you have all the space you need anyway."
Beautiful serene place! ,Very scenic and quiet place although really hot for the summer. Take the train to get to the various sections of the park and bring a picnic mat if you are keen on having some nature time. 
Beautiful place,- The windmill is beautiful and good for taking photos - There are really large grasslands which are very suitable for picnic. - The train is cute but it was often full and we have to wait for the next train. Maybe because there were so many Korean students having a day trip there on that day- Smaller than expected - Worth a visit
A great theme park that closed to the mother of nature,"There is a train servicing in the theme park that will drop the visitors to every station and allow them to walk around and take photo. As of the name ""Eco"" the theme park is closed to the mother of nature which basically full with plants and trees. Besides, highly recommend the lavender ice cream in the lavender and rose garden station. "
Very touristy but nature lovers will enjoy,"We went there with a tour so we didn't wait at entrance. Very pleasant walk, and small train ride, but gets a bit crowded."
Big Park With Nice Walking Area,"This Eco Land is nice and Comfortable for doing Recreation. Relaxing and Quiet Place to visit. They also provide Train Inside the Park. The Train come every 5-10 minutes Here we can decide which area we want to go. There are area with Park, Lake, Holland Decoration. There also a place that we can do Recreation with Family Complete with the children playgrond area. They also have Garden with some Flowers, such as Lavender, Tulips, etc. They also have Place to have some snack like coffee, churros, ice cream. Enjoyable place to relax and need some time to enjoy all the area. Good to Visit."
"I mean, it's kinda cool...","Attractions are fun and relatively interesting, but I'm just not sure if it's worth getting trampled by Chinese tourists. Wouldn't recommend to anyone."
Good place to enjoy nature,The weather was Excellent when we went. It was foggy for 10 mins then sunny for next 10 mins. Too good to see the change. Lot of places to take beautiful pics. The toy train ride was a great experience and the staff was very friendly.
Suitable for family with young children,"I went there with my 7 others female friends. We just walk around and take photos. This park is suitable for family with young children. There is a lot of things that u can do such as take train, picnic and eco friendly. "
Nature at its best,The theme park stays true to its name. Loved the sceneries and took plenty of photos in there. The train ride is also enjoyable. Perfect for any kind of traveler.
Kids friendly park,Kids would love this place! The small steam train travelling in the forest would attract all the kids. There are a few stops you can drop off the train and enjoy a wonderful stop over and the next train (every 15 mins) can take you to the next stop.
Lonely looking landscape,Beautiful landscape but failed to showcase the unique view in different season of Korea. There is nothing much to see in Mar as the spring has yet to set in thus what you can get is leaf-dropping trees and looking a little dry and crusty. I guess Japan has done a better job to ensure different plant is growing according to the season in their landscape which still make it look stunning during winter & autumn . But this place will definitely look beautiful when Spring set in.
"We just didn't get ""it""","Expensive for what it is. It appeared that people love it, but we thought it was average at best. (Disclaimer: American perspective)"
A great place to visit for photo shooting,This is a BIG park. There is a lots of nice scenery for photo shooting. Do spent more time to walk around and train ride.
Bare in winter,"Experience⭐⭐Advisable not to go in winter as there's nothing to do except explore a dirty, sandy ""shipwreck"" and ride a train ride. Probably the train ride was the best part. The pond has some fishes but that's about all..."
Nice Nature Walk,"This place was nice to walk around and relax. Don't go here and expect to see anything crazy or exciting. It is more or less a nature walk. If you are into photography, it is a great place to visit."
Good for one day excursion with family,"This is a huge park and we go around by trains. Not much to see other than natural scenes, but good to walk around. Access is not convenient, you need cars."
Just for children,We went there with a tour group as part of a package. It's basically a long walk in the park with a bunch of photo ops.If we had kids with us I would think it was OK. But not for a couple of retired folks.
Bof,"Do not try to go there in a rainy day. It wasn't that good coréen people said. Better go with children, adults will get bored quickly."
A theme park rich with tropical trees,"It may seem to be an ordinary natural tropical theme park. However, it may be seen by some of the visitors who came from different country than mine."
Not much nature,Drive around in a small train and have some prepared walks around the forest.I think nice for half a day with kids but there are more natural places on the island which are worth a visit.
Welcome to nature,Very natural place to visit and relax. Beautiful place for rest and meditation. Very peaceful and full of fresh air.
A photo worthy pretty place!,It's a very pretty place! Definitely worth visiting! Will be better if we have more time there to take more photos~Basically its like a mini land with their own little train with many stopovers.Good place to take lots of photos with cute little stuffs!But a pity some of the area is close in March when we visit.For full review: http://wanderer.summeree.com/travel/korea/jeju/ecoland-theme-park/
worth to come,"i was spending 4 days on jeju island and i went Ecoland in the 2nd day morning. the entry fee is WON12,000 per head. parking is free. You will like here if you like tree and nature environment. the weather was nice when i visited . therefore, i took some beautiful pictures. and i also had a quick lunch here."
Fun Place to Explore,"there are many things to enjoy including Eco Bridge, Hovercraft, Eco Windmill, Picnic Garden, Kid’s Town, Eco Road, Bare Foot Scoria, Lavender Garden (season) & etc"
Real place to relax,"I went there with my family members in a cloudy day. This place is composed with several parts of themes. Lake, play ground, short hiking with spa, and snack bars.My kids(9, 5yrs) really enjoyed the place with running, taking pictures, and eating.Even I visited in Jeju more than 10 times, this place is the most memorable place to visit. Because kids didn’t have any bother others.Additionally, there were packed with people and very noise when I waited for tour train. Then please be sure to keep you eyes on your kids. I visited there at the last of tour then I couldn't have enough time to hiking.However, I recommend you to take a walk at the picnic garden station (2nd stop).There are kids town and eco-land at Picnic garden station"
A place to visit in Spring & Autumn,Winter got nothing to see. Better to visit in Spring and Autumn.Fare was expensive not worth for visit.
Not much to see,"The title Theme Park may confuse some people. This is not an amusement park, just some natural park with lots of greenery, ponds, windmill, etc. You get on a train that takes you around the park, stopping at several stops where you can get off and later get on the train to move on to the next stop. Honestly, the park is just okay. Not much to see or do here. I recommend you save your time and find other, more interesting attraction in Jeju"
Worstest attraction I'VE EVER BEEN!!!!,"Don't know go to this place,it's expensive and there is nothing to see,I went in March(2015),basically you pay for a 30min train ride though a forrest,no flowers,no grass,just a windmill and an old boat,then the picnic area was rubbish,awful,waste my money and time."
nice train trip,"nice train tripmany tree , small lake , fresh airwe have to pay for enter but very good placerecommend"
Very good natural views,"Eco land has big landscape. Inside there are 4 trains station. A small train that drops people in all station, after reaching a station, people can look around and get into next train. One part is good for children, since there are kids house, kids coffee shop(miniature), fire station (miniature), bank(miniature), movie theatre(miniature) . This whole place is good for natural lovers, people in all ages, Photographers and videographer. Near this place, miniature park, Sangumburi Crater and stone land are there. All these 3 places can be seen in one day. So book a taxi for these 3 places. My Taxi driver charged me 90,000 KRW for 11 AM to 6 PM. Bus doesn't come frequently to these places. Usually if you taxi for using between 9 AM to 5 PM, you will have to pay 120,000 KRW."
Worth Visiting!,"Entrance fee is 10,000KRW.I visited during Spring and the place is so beautiful with flowers all around! Daisy, roses, lavender are everywhere. It's so breathtaking!The place is divided into 3 parts, and they take you to these places via train. The train will stopped at each stop and you can get down to visit and explore the places and get on to the next trip of train to get to next destination.Their ice cream is good too! Tasty and fresh! Worth trying.Good place to enjoy beautiful scenery. The air is so fresh and you could really enjoy your time here.We visited this place for like 2 hours."
Suitable for family,It will be very nice if you travel with your kids to educate them about ecosystem. Quite boring if you travel in couple and if you from a more natural place like malaysia
Ecoland South Korea,"A group of 22 of us went to South Korea from 13 - 20 April 2014. We visited Ecoland Theme Park after our flight from Jeju Island. If you have seern Disneyland in California, you wil;l; have some idea of what to expect from Ecoland. However, when we were there, there was this tulip festival. So we got to see tulips of various colours in a number of places, particularly near the entrance. Overall, the theme park is an exciting place to visit. I have one grouse to make. We lined up like everyone else for the safari park ride on the bus. Guess what? Instead of our turn to get on the bus, the ushers pushed us aside and gave some other tourists (locals I think) preference to get onto the bus. In all my life, I have never been humiliated this way. Come on South Korea, especially Ecoland. You are developed country. Civilsed society don't treat tourists to your country like that. There were not many animals in the park. Safari Park Indonesia beats you flat. I like tthough the bus driver got the bears to stand to get food thrown to them."
Was alright nothing special,"The visit to Eco land was part of a tour, we liked the train ride the best, there were some nice spots to get off and take pictures of but other than that there was not much to do."
Time well spent,"The Eco Land Theme Park is well worth the visit. With the tram from main station to other station. Total of 5 station. Best for photo taking, scenery, and beautiful theme park. Advisable: if you really want to enjoy the theme park, Don't join the day tour. I did and regretted. Super rush and not enjoy it. Best to come with taxi/drive. "
For anyone that like train ride,"Great for kids and any others that like train ride.You will be taking a small train ride through beautiful natural forests. Some walking is require in between stations, but just have fun and enjoy what nature brings. Take pictures of mini lake... the water is clear, windmills, grassy fields, pirate ship and not to miss the last stop with beautiful tulips."
Train ride,"Eco land is a fun mix of train riding and nature walking. You should be aware that some walking and waiting are required. The train takes you through some forest area and fields that are properly much prettier later in the year. We visited in February and the scenery from the train wasn't great, but still fun. The train stops and you have to walk from the first station. It is a nice stroll across a lake. You can check out how windmills work, if you desire. The second stop is a kids play area, which if you are travelling with young kids they will love. There are slides and swings and miniature buildings. It was hard to get our kids to leave. There are some unpleasant aspects to the train, getting a seat can be a hassle after the first loading. The seats are also two sided benches, so if you have someone behind you that is inconsiderate, it can be quite uncomfortable. Nonetheless, we had a great visit and really enjoyed Eco land."
Great Steam Train Experience,"My kids request for it & quite excited at 1st. The excitement last for the 1st train ride & once we got off the 1st station & need to walk nearly 1km the kids mood just went sour. Then it becomes a more sour when you need to wait for the next train & need to fight for a seat. They're several trains runs every 15-20m if i'm not mistaken. If you missed one you need to wait till the next train. There is no ticket system while waiting for the train & one must grab the seats. So for me with a 2 kids & a baby it was just very hard. Luckily we stayed at the far front of the track station. We managed to get the train & never get off till the end of the station. We went during end of spring. Nothing much to see. Some flowers & i think it will be a great view during summer. Pro's : A great way to relax while enjoying the ride. Con's : You need to walk a lot. The truth is the train tracks was just goes around the same land. 1st come 1st serve basic when taking on the trains. Not stroller friendly. Tip's : If you have a tight schedule, just stay on the train. Don't go off."
