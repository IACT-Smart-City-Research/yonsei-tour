I love this place!,"I was able to buy 60 face masks for 15,000 KRW (That's about $13 USD). In my country, a face mask costs about $2 each, so it's really cheap here. Imagine if I bought it at it's regular price, then it would be $120. Would definitely go back next time I visit Seoul."
Korean face masks,Beautiplex sells face masks and beauty products like any other shops in Myeong-dong. Do walk around the area to cross check the prices.
