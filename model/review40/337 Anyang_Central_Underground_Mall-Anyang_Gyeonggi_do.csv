Less expensive & variety of items,"Phone cases, Hand bags, Dresses & many more products. Connected to Lotte department store and Anyang station. A lot of restaurants outside this underground mall. Taxi stand is outside the underground mall"
Come only if you're restricted to Anyang,"If you're in Korea and for some reason or another restricted to this area specifically then I guess it deserves a visit.However, being not too far away from Central Seoul, I can't help but recommend tourists to visit the underground malls there instead. They are larger, recently renovated, and more lively. For example, the underground mall in Banpo has wider paths so it feels less cramped. It has more sitting and relaxing areas and has much more store varieties."
