Big Underground Market,Alternative option for all your shopping. It’s connected to a Lotte Department Store. There is a food court at the 3rd floor and offers a lot of food options. There’s also a Led ceiling which makes it a more interesting mall. 
I used to live near here,"As well as making it easy to get around Bupyeong it has: Air conditioning, connected to the subway station with 2 lines, cheap clothes but mostly for females, cheap food court with coffee, juice, Chinese food, sushi and more. $5 phone cases, suitcases, cheap bags and handbags, passport photo service, lotteria, uniqlo, lotte mart, make-up shops, snack shops, socks and phone accessories. If any of this interests you or you just want to walk in somewhere air conditioned for a few hours, then check it out. "
Great place to shop,"August is the probably the hottest month for South Korea so this huge underground n air-conditioned shopping complex is a great place for those who need to get clothing or handphone related items. We were there on a Mon and found half the shops closed. But there were still enough shops to occupy you for 1-2hrs of window shopping.With a link to the Buyeong Station (though not so easy to find) you can remain totally covered regardless of the weather on the surface.Prices of clothing seems cheaper, at least for those items we compared."
Nice shops and amazing LCD ceiling !,"On my way back to Seoul from a day trip to Songdo , I decided to walk around the mall , which has easy access to the Bupyeong subway station. Nice items to see and buy , bought some jewelries for my Mom . Nice to see if you are around the area. The LCD ceiling is amazing !"
The must go place if you are into shopping!,"Largest underground mall. You can get lost in here if you are not good with your direction. However, the things sold are more or less the same. So, if you find something you like, check out a few stores first before you decide which store has the best price. The items sold here are also generally cheaper than other smaller underground mall. Get ready to spend at least half a day here if you are into shopping and doesn't mind there are no place to rest. Didn't manage to see any eatery here tho (probably i haven't walked enough)."
Large enough for walking around,"The shopping mall is located underground the station/street Bupyeong station. Many clothing on sale here, most of the fashion you can find here, some of electronics and gadget accessories also available here.The location far away from Seoul close to INHA University.The shopping mall is not too special where goods sold here can be found in many other shopping places in Seoul"
Not recommend,Better go to myeongdong underground shopping mall.. price is cheaperSo far from cityBut u can take subway
Very different place to shop,The Bupyeong Underground shipping mall is over a mile long an is located underground. You go down a flight of stairs an you enter this strange mall that is one long aisle with dozens of shops on both sides. Their are ATM's located at each of the entrances to the mall area in case you need cash for many of the vendors do not take credit cards. Also be prepared to bargain on the prices. If you are a Samsung phone lover their must have been 12 phone stores selling all types of phones and supplies. It was just a fund place to walk through; but try to remember what entrance you came in for its easy to end up a mile from where you came in.
Neverending stretch of shops,"You'll first be blown away by how this place seems to be neverending. It's quite astounding. Prices are quite reasonable so this is definitely for the shopaholic. The food court is also worth a visit. Do not go with anyone who does not enjoy shopping, you will lose them in the crowds and have a hard time reuniting :D"
Go for the food court,"If you are interested in women's clothing then you'll be spoilt for choice. We didn't find any homewares which was why we went, so disappointed. Had great bibimbap in the food court."
Lots of Steps,"Walked through several times on way to the station. Agree with other posters, they sell most everything. Prices seem fair. Could use some escalators for a complex this big, when you are carrying heavy bags. Good workout though. Restrooms on a 1-10 are about a 3, but that's more in the subway station adjacent. Lots of choices in food court, even more just outside, including McDonalds, KFC open 24 hrs, and Dunkin donuts if you're so inclined. Could use a bar. "
Pack your patience!,"After a few days of sleeping off jet lag. A friend asked where I wanted to go shopping. Naturally this being my first time to Korea I had not the foggiest idea. We went via subway to this underground swap meet if sorts to shop. It was very clean, climate controlled and easy to access.Merchants sell every everything from fresh flowers to socks and underwear.There's a food court and places to sit. It can be a little crowded so have any idea of what you are looking for. Wear comfortable shoes as it is not so accessible at times. Wheelchairs and strollers will be a challenge to use. What I do know is that it is very affordable and most vendors take credit cards and Won. I may go back to buy a few more trinkets for friends and family back home. No real tourist souvenirs located as of yet, but I may just wait until the Duty Free in the airport for key chains and magnets, etc."
Endless Shopping ,"Talk about shopping til you drop! You get so turned around with this underground shopping mall because it's literally just aisles and aisles of things to look at. Not only that, but it branches off at a central area so you have even more to walk through. They have everything from clothing, cosmetics, contact lenses/glasses, random souvenirs, and a food court. Most everything is cheap there too. Awesome shopping - I loved this place so much that I decided to come back from the World Lotte Mall just to do a second round of shopping! "
Really huge,Really huge underground shopping. Sells everything from baby clothes to accessories mens clothes. If you r hungry just head one floor up to the food court. Choose your stall well though cos my friend had diarrhea after eating at one of the stalls. Another option for those who have already been to gangnam underground. Not cheaper though
Shopping and dining haven!,"After our session in Yonsei International University , we decided to gallivant around Incheon. We were told to go to Bupyeong Underground Shopping mall. The mall is filled with fashion items from dress to cosmetics ( Korean brand). The price is reasonable and quality is beyond question. We had lunch in the market and authentic Korean food with ginseng and kimchi abounds. What a happy tummy we had after lunch!"
MUST go,"This is a place introduced by locals. Things won't go wrong if you follow tips from locals. Clothes and accessories here are definitely cheaper if you are to compare it to the famous Dongdaemun, Hongdae, Edae. For example, a facial hairband was sold at KRW 1000 here. I saw the same at Hongdae, it was sold at KRW 3000 or you can get KRW 5000 for two. So do drop by this place before heading to Dongdaemun, Hongdae, Edae"
"place to buy clothes, accessories, bags and food","actually, this is very far from Seoul if you stay at Seoul. i went to this place because of the recommendation of my friend. it's nice place to buy most updated fashion, accessories. it's cheaper than in Seoul and usually they have sale items. for sale items, you can get 1 cool or cute shirt / t-shirt only for 10000 won. the non sale items, it's slightly cheaper from many stores at Seoul, so forget about bargaining. they said that it's fixed price. if you still insist to bargain, maybe the seller will be yell at you. and some stores didn't give a shopping bag, they will charge at least 1000 won for 1 shopping bag. i brought a little suitcase, so i didn't worry about this. go to 2nd floor, to get local food and it's very big food court. i picked randomly and the seller was very nice. he served very well. choose a set menu. i picked a set of bibimbab and donkatsu and payed only 5000 won. it tasted very delicious. it has many entrance door, be careful or you'll confuse. i just memorized the first way i entered.take subway line 1 to Bupyeong station. don't take exit number 1. if i'm not wrong, just take exit number 5 or 6. or just follow the crowd and it's underground so just go down."
Similar to Express Bus Terminal but slightly cheaper,"Personally think its worth a go if you're heading to elsewhere in Incheon or looking for a day trip away from Seoul... Subway Line 1 to Bupyeong Station brings you there directly.Place is huge and you might get lost. Street level wise, its more like a drinking hole... many food aplenty as well..."
