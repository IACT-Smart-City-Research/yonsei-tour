"great architecture, nice museography","not to be missed ! entrance is free, the displays are truly well organized and have to be seen, activities for kids as well"
Learnin about the sea,"The museum on the Youngdo island, you can ride the 66 bus from around the Nampo station to get there. They got some knowledge about North Korea and how they be ineracting with the sea and all that. Upstairs you can learn about the ships, the underwater sea creatures and even the boys who explored the oceans back in the day. The got an aquarium on the 3rd floor you can walk under and watch them sharks and fishes doing their thing, swimming and all that. Outside you can walk around and check the views and the buildings and the outside of the museum look like a spaceship. Best of this place free, so what you got to lose?"
Not a disappointment at all,"Zero entrance fee and the building architecture alone was awesome. There were a great variety of exhibits on Korean maritime experiences over many centuries. An aquarium exhibit was inside too. There were very few foreigners who were aware of this attraction. Outside, a deep sea submarine was the exhibit. "
Fascinating,"Visited on a weekend, so it was naturally jam-packed.However, the main exhibitions halls were not as crowded so we were able to enjoy the exhibits in peace.The aquarium was entertaining."
Not great for foreigners ,"Visited this place mainly as it is a walking distance from the Hilton Busan hotel I was staying at. I must also admit to not having any particularly strong feelings towards fishing. I found the museum rather old fashioned and not engaging enough for today's audiences. Very static exhibits and all mostly in Korean. Their efforts to create drama with models resulted in weak outcomes. Also the aquarium section at the end of the tour was very small. This could be more engaging if you came with kids. Also, I don't think this is a maritime museum, but in fact a museum for the fishing industry. I think their translated name even suggests so. "
Nice,"We enjoyed the Maritime Museum. There was a lot to see and a few things for young children like the library, aquarium, and Childrenâ€™s Museum. The only thing we paid for was parking and lunch from the restaurant upstairs, which was really good. "
Impressive architecture,After reading a brochure of the Museum we visited the place. The building that house the Museum has an impressive architecture. There were three floors of exhibitions. A lot of thought has been put into this place as the building was divided into different areas for education purposes. I enjoyed the live aquarium with live sea creatures.
An eye-opening Experience!,"Contrary to the popular belief that the Europeans are the pioneers of maritime achievements, Asian nations, including Korea lay claim to some of the ingenious and heroic maritime accomplishments, whether ship design, navigation, naval warfare or even maritime trades. A must visit place for anyone who has interest in maritime or general science and culture!"
Worth a stop,"I stopped at the maritime museum on the way back from Taejongdae and was glad I did - there was lots to see and it was well laid-out. The little aquarium was a pleasant surprise but otherwise it was a comprehensive overview of Korea's maritime history with most exhibits explained in English as well as Korean and Chinese. Videos were the exception to this. The building is also lovely and there are good views over the harbour.I caught a #101 bus from Taejongdae (I think you can get several buses from there to the museum) and walked about 10 minutes. The #186 goes right to the museum but is less frequent, however I did catch this back to Nampo afterwards."
Engaging,Found this really interesting. Enjoyed the display and the history. They have great kid activities incorporated into the Museum as well.
Cool museum,"I spotted the museum while hiking on the hilltops and I immediately got curious. The curved shape of the facade stands out in it's surroundings. The harbour is full of activities and people having fun, especially children. A good place to take some photos."
Really fun museum Go!,"Busan is a fishing and port town. This is a national museum and has history, beautiful models, and great things for kids to do and see, including an aquarium and interactive games allowing chilren, to their delight, to learn to sail! Loved it. Go!!!"
Good for Kids,"Nice and modern museum, good to kill time with kids, easy to reach with the red busan city tour bus. "
"must see museum, no entrance fee",get to learn more about busan through hereyou get to see a lot of shipsthere is a small aquarium for kidslearn the basics of sailingrobot fishes are here
A MUST see while in Busan !!,This Maritime Museum is certainly one of the best Maritime museums I have see worldwide. It is located at Stop 6 of the JUMBO BUS Tour. 
It's rainy day but I love it ,It was great experience although it's raining but when you are in Busan aquarium you feel relax its a free of entrance also the free wifi is fast ... I love it
Unlike other museums (in a good way),Visiting this place will astonish you. The place has a lot to offer including educational materials. Logistically it's seeing what you read in books so far.
Interesting outing for rainy day,Very interesting voice tour guide. Especially appreciated the 4th Floor about Marine industry and sustainable development. Entrance is free of charge and easy to get there by bus from MTR station Busan or Nampo. Closed on Mondays.
Lots to see,Cool place with lots to see about marine history. Also has an active movie theater ( moving seats thing) and a large aquarium. Certainly recommend. Also it's free!
"Small space, big experience","This museam is one of the few I've been in that has both Korean and English explanations of the exhibits, which makes it very foreigner friendly for those who speak English.The building itself is worth looking at, and the surrounding grounds offer opportunties to stroll or just sit and look at the harbour. The museum itself informs people comprehensively about Korea's past and present seafaring and fishery industries, with clever use of the availabke floor space. A small aquarium adds a quirky touch, and includes a touch pool with sea creatures to stroke. The staff are friendly and helpful. All in all, a great way to spend a rainy day in Busan."
Go if you have a chance,"Must be very news, which may be why it's hard to find, not on our GPS yet. Nice building, very roomy with lots of space to expand. The collection isn't that large (yet?) but what there is is good. Emphasis on historical aspects with some great life-size models.There's a nice aquarium with a rounded tunnel to walk right through it, but those things always make me seasick. Lots of fish and a big turtle in there.Well worth a visit."
If you're interested in ships...,"If you're interested in ships and maritime culture, this is the place for you. Otherwise I found it pretty boring. Yeongdo isn't accessible by subway, so you'll have to take a bus or car there."
Worth stopping off on bus tour,"I spent 2 + enjoyable hours here and lost track of time..I wasn't that interested initially in the Korean Naval Industry but I am very happy that I spent the time on this floor reading and viewing the replica's.It was extremely well presented and I learned a lot about Korea's involvement in the Artic and Antartic,it's mining in the Pacific basin for mineral deposits and much more. I also found the shipping building Industry facinating and am awed by the technical expertise used in building these numerous vessels.To me it was a highlight of the several days touring on the Busan City Tour Bus.I am a 62yr old female thats enjoys shopping so just goes to show you this can appeal to all ages and sexes."
Fully Agree with the Prior Review,"We came here all the way from Haeundae Beach (1 hour one way) because the hotel we were staying in provided a shuttle. The best part of this museum is the architecture of the building. It looks like they (I am guessing this is the Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs) spent a fortune on the design of this building and then ran out of money to buy items to fill it up. The aquarium and the exhibits relating to live species is relatively small. The remainder of the museum is just historical artifacts and rather dreary exhibits. There are a lot of kids, mostly doing homework by filling in obligatory reports about their visit. The prior reviewer was right. If it wasn't free, I would have been incensed.One additional advice - the restaurant is a barbecue restaurant (ironic for a maritime museum) with very mediocre foods. They really should have several dining options. Jump into a cab and head over to the Jagalchi Fish Market for lunch instead."
"Nice building, poor content","The area around the museum is brand-new and well maintained. It's a huge building with 3 exhibition floors. The firts one is dedicated for children. The other ones related to the history and the present of Korean Shipping industry. Sounds nice, but in fact the content is quite poor.Second floor was all about the histroy of Korean shipping with a replica. Third floor was more about the Korean ports and shipbuilding industry. Lot of scale models to show what kind of ships there are build. An overview over Korean Coast Guard and Navy.Nice aquarium in the middle of the building and wonderfull view from the top.NIce thing about Busan Museums, there are free of charge."
"Free, but not a lot there","If I paid for this, I would have been upset as there is not a lot there. There are English translations of everything though, which is nice. Also a little aquarium that will surround you as you walk though a tunnel"
