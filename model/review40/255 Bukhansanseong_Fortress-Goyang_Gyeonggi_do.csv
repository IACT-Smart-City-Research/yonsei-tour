Wonderful SEOUL,"Lots of citizens of SEOUL go there by subway, and step up along handrails. Stand on the top, you can see amazing scenery of mountain rocks of KOREA. Highly strong recommend you walk up."
Fortress of the past,"This fortress is located inside Bukhansan Mountain National Park. While hiking up the mountain, one will find a few fortress gates along the trail. There isnâ€™t much left of the fortress, except the gates and the walls. Hikers typically take a break at the gates while enjoying the view. The stretch of surrounding walls are well preserved. Just imagine the effort to build the wall on this mountain."
Fortress on Bukhansan Mountain,"This is a fortress on Bukhansan Mountain. It's amazing to know they built a fortress on the high mountain like Bukhansan.- It was initially built in 2nd century by The Kingdom of Baekje.- One way or another, hikers meet gates of the fortress during climbing up.- Unlike other fortresses in Korea, walking up on the wall is not allowed.- It's risky to hike when it's dark. Not recommended to see sunset here."
Beautifull hike - especially in fall,We spontaniously decided to hike to Bukhansanseong fortress on the sunny saturday last weekend. It turned out to be the perfect trip for that day. In total we hiked a nice round trip of about 8km in roughly 3 hours. The trails are not very steep and quite easy to hike up. Hardly any stairs compared to other trails and nationalparks ;)When walking along the old fortress wall you have a beautiful view of Seoul on one side and the Bukhansan national park to the other. Take some food and water along and rest at one of the eight old fortress gates. Oh and don't forget the typicall Makgeoli ;)
Very nice hiking and sunset,"Going by subway to Gupabal Station and then taking bus No. 704 or 34 to Bukhansanseong, we got there easily by public transportation.Than we had a very nice hike (maybe 1,5 hours) to a peak, with an extraordinary awesome sunset mid of September.But the national park is huge, so you have endless other opportunities.Since maps with details about the high are rare, it's sometimes difficult to estimate how long walk may take, so bring a flashlight to be save (especially when going there for sunset)"
