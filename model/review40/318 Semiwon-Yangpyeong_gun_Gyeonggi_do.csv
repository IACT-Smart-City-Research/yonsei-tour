Part of trazy tour☺,"It was a wonderful place, enjoyed it very much, really recommend visiting here ☺It is a huge place! A lot to see,There were many cool sculptures"
Good rest area on the way of biking at the Han riverside park,"Taking the riverside bike road on a bike from Seoul to Yangpyung direction, this pretty place is located next to YangSu subway station. On our way back to Seoul on a bike, we needed a short break. This garden has nice free lotus museum, coffee shop and a loctus cookies store. The garden has addimsiion, 5,000KRW. We only visited the museum and snak stores, taking nice break outdoor sitting palce. The gate toward the garden is symbolic shape of Korean national flag. Very unique and pretty."
Large Lotus and Water Lily Garden,"Large Lotus and Water Lily Park in Yangpyeong-gun. You can see colorful lotus in many ponds (should visit around summer time is better). At the end of the garden, there is a bridge accross to Dumulmeori."
Semiwon Garden in Yangpyung,"Thus is a big garden, where you can spend half a day or all day. Especially, lotus gardens are the most beautiful in late September or early October. You can walk up to Dumulmeori where tow rivers - Namhan and Bukhan - meet. There are several cafeterias in there."
Water Lilly Park -Catch the beauty of Huge Lotus Flowers,"Semiwon garden is dedicated to water-based flowers. The garden has huge ponds filled with beautiful lotus flowers and water Lilly flowers. The best period to visit the garden would be towards the end of July and beginning of August, when the flowers are in full bloom. Unfortunately when I visited towards the end of August the flowers were at the end of their life cycle so I was not able to catch the beauty of the huge ponds filled with lotus flowers. Yet still, the remaining flowers were bravely showcasing their beauty under the scorching summer sun.A specialty of the Semiwon Park is the Soy-bean Jars Fountain (장독대분수). Arranged in a circle around a pine tree, this fountain represents the 12-months and various sub-divisions of the months according to the harvesting times in Korea. From Semiwon Park you can see the Dumulmeori area across the Hang River."
"Good place to visit in summer with lotus, but..","C1 ( 2015.11.05 ) I visited there after Dumulmuri, beside attraction, and went around there. The entrance fee was a little high than I think. In there, because of cold weather, all lotus was wither, so I couldn't feel there was good. Though ship bridge was interesting, but the others was so-so. Just Dumulmuri trip, that's enough, I think. If there charge admission in full blossom time and will not charge in no flower time, there will be more good place."
연꽃 구경하기에 좋은 곳,"단순히 연꽃을 보려면 두물머리에서도 충분히 감상이 가능함그래도 물도 흐르고 분수도 있고 평상도 있고 데이트하기에도 좋고 가족끼리 놀러가도 좋아요!It's a good place for photo,especially for lotus in summer.But if you're going only for louts,you just can go to Dumulmeori(두물머리).Good place for dating,picnic etc."
