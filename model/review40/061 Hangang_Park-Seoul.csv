Alot local picnic and cycling here,"There are some walking distance (at least 10mins) to reach the park if you ride there by bus or metro. That is why some local cycling there to save time and evergy.There are food festival during weekend, however till month Oct only, maybe due to weather. During night time, there can be very cool because of strong wind. No worry about food if you going during weekend (please check it out the status first, night close due to changes of weather). Overall, is a great experiences."
Great for cycling by the river,"You can start anywhere along the Han river and cycle south all the way to Busan, almsot entirely on bike paths. There are concerts and other events on weekends at various places, like Banpo or Yeoido. Many people bring tents and order food at the park."
Do what locals do! Picnic and Han river view.,"I visited this park because I was missing a ´local´ experience. Though I love Seoul and especially all the historical sites, I wanted to see what locals do in this town. It was recommended by a business contact of mine when I asked him why there is almost no movement at all on the Han river and he explained to me that almost all transportation of goods happens over land so the river isn´t really used a lot. What people do, is visit and look at the river, enjoy it´s wide open space while it cuts through Seoul. The place to experience this is the Hangang park (metro Yeouinaru), where especially on friday afternoon thousands of Corean youth gather and have picnics, meet with friends or with a date and just sit and talk. The Hangang park is really wide and stretched along side the river bank, so you can stroll for hours, rent a bike, buy some food at the foodtrucks and watch people have a great time. I recommend you to buy food, some beers or sodas, a blanket and have a picnic before going on a stroll!As a bonus you will have an amazing background scenery of (one of the) Seoul skylines."
Scenic Place,Hangang Park has been a very popular shooting location for KDrama scenes. It feels good to be able to step on the ground where KStars also walked on hahaha :D
Beautiful,"The Hangang-Park is a beautiful place to be. Where you can have a walk or jogging around or sit there for a beer and chicken, which you can order right to the spot you are sitting. It is awesome!"
"Nice riverside park, but ot much else","Nice enough, and we rented bikes for a lovely afternoon. Services are limited, so pack food or go in the evening when the food trucks are open. Prepare for the crowds. "
"Come here, you won't regret it","Great place for a good time! So many activities you can do regardless of who you're travelling with. We visited several times during our stay, during which we tried one of the night time river cruises, had a picnic another day, and came for a night walk the last one (so many great food trucks here!). You can take the metro to Yeouido."
Best Place to Enjoy Seoul Summer,Its summer time. Weather still nice in June. Not so hot. Not so cold. Just nice for picnic with family and couples. Lots of food truck to choice for food .Can rent a bike and ride along the river bank. Surely will come again for the sunset view.
Breath Taking Park in Seoul,A Park where you can Relax and stay positive :) this is a great place to meditate and think about life. Experience picnic like a local here just bring your blanket and you are ready to go. And it is place for taking a picture :). and just be mesmerized at the view of Hangang river and Cruise. and in addition if you want to cruise there is a mini cruise at that park on Hangang River and experience the romantic view with your love one :)
"Ok cycling, luckily tgere was food-truck festival","If you are in company eveb better: nice walk, nice cycling and on fridays and saturdays there are food trucks with music show, nice but don't expect too much"
Pleasant riverside park . . .,". . . from which one can see the Banpo Bridge Rainbow as well as the changing lights on Some Sevit. Numerous folks were having picnics, while others were skate boarding or bicycling on a cool, June evening."
Not well maintained,"We walked to the park from Gangnam station (~40min) and absolutely hated the entrance to the park through the dystopian looking underpass along the busy highway. The park itself is small and surrounded by heavy traffic, there is almost no vegetation and very little room to sit or walk. We went on a Thr afternoon and it was empty with only cyclists passing by. Even the building on Sebitseom were empty and partially closed. We ended up walking from Sebitseom to Dongjak bridge where we took the subway. It was definitely not what we expected and dod not provide a relaxing nature experience. It might be worth visiting at night for the night lights but could easily skip otherwise. "
Bicycle Ride <3,Love my first cycling experience here with its perfect cool breeze from Hangang River and great place for picnic. Too bad I was alone but greatly enjoyed the view.
nice walking park,If you are bored strolling the crowded streets of downtown take the Metro Line 9 to Yeomchang Station and you can walk upstream along the river front first through Hangang and than through the Riverside park as far as to building 63.
perfect place for those who would like to do an outdoor leisure recreation activities,"Hangang park is one of the most popular park in Seoul and it is one of the must visit in the time of cherry blossom. Normally it will be very crowded during Spring season but on the day that my friends and I visited this place there is not very much people because due to the weather that was raining.Hangang park is a perfect place for those who would like to do an outdoor leisure recreation activities and those who would like to escape busy city life but don’t have very much time. It is a very nice place to spend time with your family, friends, or love one. This place is definitely worth your while to make a trip here because it has so much to offer and one of the most popular activities that when people come here like to do is picnic, you can bring your own food or if you want to feel a little bit local you can ordering fried chicken and beer and get it delivering directly to you which is very convenient and popular here but the activity that my friends and I did was riding a bicycle which is also very popular, there are many rental bicycle service that you can rent which will cost you about 6,000 KRW for 1 hour which we thought was a reasonable price because you can ride along the river where you will totally have a great moment here. It is also a very nice place to just sit down relax and chilling.For those who would like to come I highly recommended you to take a metro to Yeonaru which is the closest station but if you want to enjoy the scenery view you can also take a metro to Yeouido station and walk from the station through Yeouido park. Please check the weather before coming to the park because if it is too cold it will be very empty and quiet and rental bicycle service might not be open."
Very big park with little to see.,"There is is a huge area to walk around with little to see except people with dogs,boats passing on the water.You can hire a bike which would be the most practical way of seeing the entire area.The must see place is Banpo bridge at night with the coloured water jets at 7.30,8,8.30 and 9pm."
Lovely,Lovely to walk by this river. Lots of seating area. Good playground areas for kids. Good picnic area. Can get 1 hr ferry here. I think it was about $35.Negative: all the loose dirt/ grass that was being blown about. 
Get away from the city in the middle of town,"Biking, hiking, Cherry blossom viewing, camping, picknicking etc. all this is possible in this green area on the Han river in the center of Seoul. Access it from different subway stations and stroll or bike as far as you wish. A great outing with rental bikes available and separate biking lanes."
Beautiful at night,The night view here is beautiful especially the lighted bridges. A good place to relax and picnic. Best to come in the evening to enjoy the night view.
Great place to chill,"Hangang is a wide river passing Seoul and there are several riverside parks along the river. It's a great chance to get refreshed for citizens and tourists watching the cityscape and enjoying activities.- There's no certain park named Hangang Park on the map. It consists of multiple riverside parks along the river. Of those parks near the river, Yeouido Hangang Park is the most famous with campaing grounds, river cruises, playgrounds, bicycle tracks, etc. Other ones have different satisfaction too.- It's also nice in the evening with the illuminations on bridges.- Hangang Park is a bit away from the touristic center, it takes some time to reach by bus, subway or driving.- Better not to visit during flood in summer."
"Cycling, picnicing or cruising, the Han is a special place.","So in Korea when you picnic, it involves a tent, mat and small table!!! So much fun. The Han is obviously important to Seoul as it cuts the city in two. We spent the day eating, cycling, playing cards, taking photos and then going for a cruise. Plenty of parking and easy to get to. An excellent way to spend the day, even in the middle of winter."
Relaxing place,Great view of the Han river. Spending time and camping could be done in the park. Renting of bicycle is available as well.
Lovely Park,A nice park to walk around or just sit for a few hours and relax. I went there with a few friends and they ordered some Fried Chicken which I was told is a pretty common thing to do in this area. A very peaceful place and a beautiful view of the river.
Peaceful place,Looking at the Hangang river to refresh the mind and think of inspiration. Walking and strolling down at Hangang park.
Love this park!!!,"I love coming here, especially during nice weather. You can just walk along the river, or rent a bike. Bike rental are nearby and it is cheap and easy to rent."
Peaceful place to spend quality time,"Walking around the banks of Han river is a very pleasant experience. In the evenings, looking at the bridges connecting both ends of Seoul is just mesmerizing. Perfect place for morning walk, jog or cycling."
Great part of Seoul,"We love going to the Hangang river and go often. We love to take a walk along the river or go to one of the many activities. Different activities are located at the bridges. You can find things such as bike rentals, restaurants and festivals. The banpo bridge is great because during summer, spring and fall they have light/water show with music. This year they had food trucks there but previously we would order chicken from one of the guys on a scooter. There are also restaurants and a kids cafe at Banpo brdige."
really amazing,hankang river is one of the most relaxing and enjoyable places you can visit once you come to Korea cheers
Good Place for Chill,"Accessible to Seoul Metro.Great place to hang out, chill and relax.You can get a spot just to sit and enjoy the view while watching performances.Would really recommend for travelers. ="
going to the Hanging park,"Going to the Hangng park. Hangang is one of the most famous river in the Korea, because around the Hangang there are lots of people who is hang out outside. Around the Hangang there are lots of activities such as riding bicycle, and riding electric kick board. also during the summer when the night's come the people come out and they enjoy their night. eat chicken and beer, because this culture is very famous in Korea. also sometimes there are people who is doing small concert so people can watch it freely and enjoy it. at night Hangang is very cool because of the river water"
Nice place for a pleasant stroll,It is a pity that it was raining when we visited but it was still lovely to stroll along the edge of the lake and enjoy the lake's beauty even so.
Love it,"Hanging Park is on the very top of my favourite place in Seoul. You can go on picnic with family, friends, or boyfriend or girlfriend. Blue sky, fresh air, soft wind, delicious food, and nice people would make you feel happy. I really really highly recommend you to go to Hanging park on any season if you would visit South Korea."
Han River!,Han River is very big. But there are many attractions beside it. You just have to do some research in order for you to know what side of Han River you should be going.
Nice public place,I've come here for 3 times. It's a big place with the fresh air. I love walking beside the river. Cheer!
"Relax, walk, jog, run, bike etc.",Good stretch of pedestrian/bike path without much elevation change. Great for any activity. You can make your run or bike shorter or longer depending on how you feel and where you decide to cross over to other side from one of the many bridges across Han River.
Perfect for relaxing,"My family love this park especially riding the cruise. We went there on Friday night, there were lots of people putting up their cute tent and camp there, eating ramen. The place is very close to metro station."
Spring time-good for picnic day,"A lot local people will have picnic there, can easily order food by if you can understand Korean words leaflet. Spring time you can see roses, lily and a lot poppy flower around the park."
River trip,Awesome experience!!! There are a few places off to the side if you want to be alone or with a small group... but also plenty of other places to be around people and food trucks that are amazing.
Nice place for picnic ,"Visited the park just to watch the Banpo bridge Rainbow fountain and was cancelled. Nevertheless, it was such a different experience, to feel so local. This park is full of people, picnic with their friends, loved ones, family. We thought there were the street festival but apparently there isn't. We went to a convenient store and it was super long long q, u even need to q to get into the store. Inside all locals are grabbing instant noodles, beer and cooking them and finally settling it down by the river and enjoy their meal. It was very windy as well. There were lots of cyclists as well. Overall, it was a very nice experience for me to experience how local Koreans spent their weekends. "
Lovely views,"The park is actually several parks that make up part of the national parks. For us, the park gave us some fantastic vantage points for photos as well as a great stroll."
Hangang is a must do in SOul,If you are going to visit Seoul be sure to visit Hangang as it is a good tradition. You can see how Koreans have good time after work with friends and family. And of course you should order Korean fried chicken. Upon arrival you would meet a lot of ajhummas with brochures and lot of different set options. The chicken will arrive approximately in 15 mins and you can enjoy it together with Hangang view as all other Koreans there feel the atmosphere
Nice walk by the river,"It's where the locals go for a run, walk, picnic etc etc. Especially the Banpo Hangang park is one of the nicest areas amongst the others. The park is considered safe even at late at nights. It's a good walk if you happen to stay near by."
FREE DAY OUT,"The best free day out in Seoul. Beautiful at night too. You can order a picnic to be delivered to you if you can speak Korean. If you can't, ask a local to help you call and order. You can also rent picnic blankets."
Fun riding,"I ride bmx bike. It was fun rode with my own bike with local riders. It was winter when i get there, as south east asian i feel freezing. The local said that hangang park is coldest in seoul,because it outdoor place and there are no building over there. When you come to hangang park and winter season,please get some soju or odeng for warming your body"
Huge fun riding along the Han River,"Everyone loves the Han River - walkers, joggers, people doing exercise, grannies having dance parties, kite flyers, families having picnics, friends drinking beer, fishermen, swimmers, wildlife photographers, casual cyclists and racing cyclists. It’s an amazing fun atmosphere ... and a little crazy. I have visited in October and July. July was hot so early mornings and nights were when it came alive. Along the way are steer markets and chicken shacks. Made a work trip into a little vacation as well. So much fun!"
Rent a bike!,We went twice: once to see the Banpo Bridge water show (which was cancelled b/c the river was mucky from rain) and the second time we rented bikes by the I SEOUL U sign. Biking along the river was so fun and so beautiful! Super relaxing. I highly recommend.
Great place for cycling,"One of the best parks in Seoul and maybe in megapolises of SEA. Very clean, peaceful and calm. So beautiful. There is a special line for cycling, probably as long as 70 km long, both sides of the river. On weekends always crowded, so I prefer weekday."
Ride a bike and enjoy the vibe,This was my second time in Hangang Park and a trip to this place is always worth it There are lots of activities that can be done here and the best part you can even order food and have it delivered here. They have designated pick up points and it’s just wonderful 
Nice cooling bicycle ride,"We visited Hangang park at noon. Got some bikes inexpensively (sorry I forgot price) for 2 hours.Along the way there are playgrounds and convenience stores to rest and fuel up.There are also some fried chicken stores near the waterplay area. Saw many people who had fried chicken delivered to them but since we could not speak the language, we were unable to. Nevertheless the fried chicken store near the waterplay area (3rd floor, 2nd floor was a convenience store, and it faces a small carpark) was quite yummy."
levely place,"lovely place to spent with your lovely freinds or families, there is great park to walk or camp or picke and there is little Coffee sohp."
Great park,"Not sure if we are lucky but the night we came, there was a food festival, an hour concert, and a competition for rock climbing. Other than that, there are a few restaurants in the area and you can also rent bicycles to cycle around the park, however do note that the alignment of the wheels is not great and you will be trying to go straight the whole time, but it’s cheap. About 3000 won an hour. Oh yes. There are severe hangang park located along the river. We chose the banpo hangang park so that we can enjoy the water fountain show in the evening and night. There are different show timings for weekday and weekend, so heck the website. "
Korean Park,"The park is clean, fresh air. Not advisable to visit this park around noon time...very hot in summer and not much activity. The only activity my family did was to ride a tour boat along the river. Foods along the river are a little bit expensive."
Saturday Fireworks,"Not sure if it's every Saturday, but there's fireworks when we went the last March 24. A lot of teens are also setting up their tents on the park.We can still feel the chilling wind of winter but we got hot packs ready ^,^.hahaha. If you're into chicken and beer, there's stalls available where you can buy and eat on the benches overlooking the river. Just make sure to clean as you go.(gmrc will save you a lot of trouble=)), Since we went there at night, we didn't see much attraction other than the fireworks and the I SEOUL U letters.City lights are quite far.. Maybe we'll visit there at daytime on our next trip."
Don’t miss,"If you go to Seoul, then you should definitely pass by here. You’ll get a great view of the city. Don’t forget to take something for a possible picnic mood. Also, you can stroll around the place while waiting for the Banpo Rainbow show. You’ll have to check the date and time for this. Recommended. "
Great views of the city.,"Hangang has what is probably the nicest collection of views in Seoul. The river cuts right through the centre of Seoul and means that there is a lot of diversity in what you will find along the river banks. Summer and spring are the best times due to the weather, but even winter can be nice provided the weather isn't too terrible!"
Beautiful walking area.,"Although crowed most times, this area is a terrific park on the banks of the Han River and makes for some amazing city views. Beautiful gardens and seating areas allow a relaxing (as can be in busy times) place to sit and visit with family, or walk along the endless pathways. Campers can be found hanging out; bikers and skaters/bladers mix in and family picnics were everywhere. Can be chilly with the wind off the river but on a lesser polluted day, it is a lovely place to visit."
One of my favorite park in Korea,A very beautiful spot in Korea. You can do activities such as enjoying a bike ride. There are seats where you can relax. When we visited there are many flowers arranged so you can use for your photo op. I suggest you visit on weekdays and start to stroll early in the morning so you can enjoy the place best. This park is free :)
Always crowded but best place to enjoy Han River,"Clean and kept up well despite the massive crowds this place attracts. Dog-friendly. A quintessential Seoul experience if you're visiting would be to enjoy a stroll along the river, find a spot on the grass to settle down, and order chicken delivery right to your blanket for an impromptu picnic."
"Great view, too many campers","The view was great and there were a lot of cherry blossoms when we went. It was a bit crowded because there were a lot of campers. If not for the cold, I would have strolled around this place. "
This needs to be broken down to other sections,"There are several areas that are Hanggang park. There are parts where a nice stroll or bike ride. Some have soccer fields, basket ball courts, swimming pools. There are usually convenience stores or some cafe/restaurant. Check out more specific reviews for the park (ie Banpo, Ichon, Mayo, Yeouido, Ttukseom, Jamwon... maybe more...) that you actually want to visit because there are differences between the parks and locality may make it better options for day or night."
Seoul's Classic,"One of the best option if you want to escape from the routine and stress that a busy city like Seoul gives. You can take a brake and relax in the middle of the city and enjoy some beverages, a walk or even a romantic date here. I really recommend this environment to anyone who is at Seoul."
Great place for picnic!,"Blend with the locals, prepare your mat, sandwiches or chimak and some drinks!Many people will pitching tents, sitting on the grass enjoying the food and drinks they brought! There will also be bicycle kiosks and people will renting to ride around the park!Enjoy the breeze and sunshine!(If the weather is good!)✌️"
Nice park and food truck,"Nice park after the long walk at yeouido Park. The walk on water pool is really awesome and amazing. Would be much greater if it was cherry blossom bloom, we just missed it by a week. The food truck gives pretty good selection and it has a vast area to enjoy your food. Do check out their event on the web before heading there."
Ttukseom Han River Park Snow Slope,"NIce place for kids to play snow sledging. More for family with children, unlimited play for minimum fee. "
nice place to hangout,We found Hangang Park while searching for SM building. The environment is quite nice and peaceful since we went there at 10 am. We saw many Koreans cycling along the park. The public toilets are clean too.
Place for soul,"Walked there, played basketball, chilled, drunk etc... It is just nice place for any type of hanging out or chilling:) my personal recommendation to Seoul visitors!"
Hangang Park,"Very nice park with possibilities of eating, resting, walking, biking. Better to visit on a warm day. Possible to have a river boat trip."
Great views and memorable place.,"We went at night where the wind made it really cold. We were dressed for 13 degree weather, but with the wind, it felt like 5 degrees. So we were really cold.Great place to walk, enjoy the scenery, catch a movie. But check weather and activity schedule ahead of time to make good use of your time."
Amazing Hangang Park Fair,"There was a fair along the Hangang at some specific time of the year. Different kinds of stalls would be temporarily set up there to sell all kinds of goods, from food to accessaries. Definitely worth a visit if you're around in those dates!"
걷기 좋은 장소,지하도를 지나기 약간 그랬지만 걷기 좋고 야경도 멋진 장소였어요. 잠원지구로 갔었고 대교까지 걸어서 갔다가 청담동 쪽으로 빠졌어요. 여름에 오면 좋을 장소입니다.It's good place for walking. A bit scared of subway. But will be great in summer time
Hangang,Hangang Park is awesome. If you like to go walk along the river and you are in Seoul you must go there. You can rent a bike or just walk. There are a lot of photo zones. I think that was the best park ever.Park nad rzeką Hangang to jeden z lepszych parków. Można tam wypożyczyć rower i zrobić mnóstwo zdjęć. Polecam!
Family walk,What a great area. There wasn’t a lot of infrastructure such as playgrounds for kids but it leans toward people exercising. There was an area to exercise using the provided equipment as well as some equipment to use a skateboard. 
Fly your drone here,"Seoul is a no no for drones. Fortunately Hangang park provides a descent space to fly your drone. Search for ""hangang drone park"" for details. "
Visit to any Han River Park in Seoul,"Each Han River Park may have different features, but if you do not have time to visit a specific one, try a nearest one. The promenade is very well paved, and the river is wide so you can feel the nature at the heart of Seoul. You can rent a bike too. The wind can be strong in the winter, so be well prepaired."
A quiet and romantic park!,A peaceful and quiet park and which is suitable for jogging! We came here during winter and there were not many people except minimal joggers. The winter view is great with lovely trees along the park.
My favorite place in Seoul,"Despite going in a chilly spring breeze, this riverside park is absolutely delightful and a joy to visit! It stretches a fair distance if you like walking, and it's also great to ride a bike or skate. The ministop is great if you need a quick snack, drink or even ramen, and the view is absolutely beautiful. They also sell fried chicken and other street food if you're in the mood for a warm bite. I think the annual fireworks are even held there, which is great if you find yourself there at the same time. Amenities at the park also include sports facilities including basketball courts and fitness centers, The river is really clean too. The night light show is also worth checking out if you get the chance to! "
Breezy and beautiful,"Went here on my own one cold December night. I had the park to myself so I grabbed the chance to take photos of the park. It was beautiful, even at night.I decided to head to the nearby Mini-Stop which sold ramen in aluminium bowls. I also had some sausages along with my ramen. Yumyum!I strolled a little bit more to walk off the heavy meal I just had. It was very cold that night but it was memorable."
Chilly walk in winter but nice long pathway,"My friend wanted to rent bikes to ride along the river but it was so cold we just walked. Very well maintained, with convenience stores along the way for snacks."
Nice place to have bicycle ride,"I went there around evening and having my ride, it cost me 10000 won per hour. you can enjoy the nice view from the river and it have many activities. it also have many cruise that u can having your dinner inside the cruise. you can also choose for food delivery that are very convenience. if u cant speak korean is ok, there also many road stall that u can purchase food"
Awesome and big,"Gwangnaru Hangang Park is a series of parks along the Han River and is located between Gangdongdaegyo and Jamsilcheolgyo. The park covers a very large area. It is for recreational purposes only. The river Han runs through it. No commercial boat activity is allowed between Seoul and the mouth of the river. The river provides clean water. The park is made up of large areas of reeds and other aquatic vegetation. There are sports facilities comprising of football pitches, basketball and volleyball courts, tennis courts, fitness centres and an inline skate rink. There is also a large swimming pool. There is a large biking area and there are bike lanes.There are stalls selling snacks etc."
Beautiful Great Place for Day and Night,"Enjoyed walking along the river, coffee stop and deep fried chicken there. There is a night market held after sunset (check the date and time) and we enjoyed many street food (but not very cheap). A bit difficult to find tables and seats, but it was fun. Also fountain from the lighted bridge was fantastic. "
Great night light show,"Great recreational area! If you’re going there for the light show, it’s suggested to go there a couple hours earlier to get good sitting.Not a big fan of the chicken delivery service as it took really long for us. But you could order food there with the different delivery guys.It’s also great visiting there in the daytime. The park is huge so you will not get bored."
Awesome for Night Picnics in the Fall!,"We went there on a Saturday night, and the place was just alive with crowds of friends and families spreading out their mats just about everywhere and talking and laughing. There were buskers every few meters to add to the fun atmosphere and old ladies handing out flyers for local delivery shops. We ordered chicken and bought beer and found ourselves a spot. There are public bathrooms nearby, carts that sell mats and some snacks for those who didn't bring any, and convenience stores if you run low on drinks. It was just so fun. You can rent bikes too."
Good for biking,"I rented a bike and biked along the river for many miles. During the weekend, the place is very poplar with walkers and cyclists. The view is nice. The bike path is very well maintained. Lots of stops to rest and take pictures."
Tip for you to enjoy Seoul like local people,"As the review below, it seems like there is nothing to do in hangang itself. Only river, and track to run or for bike. But let me give you tips to enjoy Seoul like a local. 1. If you want to explore hangang, there are plenty of options. You can take one day kayak class, or just rent a kayak in Ttukseom recreation area, which is western side of river. 2. You can also have a cruise dinner while enjoying the beautiful night view of Seoul. There are some restaurants able to do this. 3. What does real local people do? After work, we run to river with chicken and beer, and enjoy ChiMak (we call Chimak for fried chicken + beer) watching river!"
"Nice place, but nothing to do","the Hanang Park is a nice place and there is water and you can go and stay there for a couple of days. And there is a big sign that says I SEUOL U, but to get to the sign it is a 10 min walk from the entrance, it was a very nice long walk, but it was hot. Along the way to going to the sign we came across stores, food shop, lots of tents, rental bikes and people flying kites. And the nice thing is that most of the people brought tents and they were sitting in there tents eating and thee wasn't even one spot that they littered or that they made dirty, everything was SO CLEAN, even the stores and the shop.I recommend you come in the night because it will be a very nice place. I recommend the Hangang park"
Great walk or bike ride by the river ,Really enjoyed my walk along the river. Get to see many interesting bridges and some great views.Very busy with bike riders especially on weekends. Can combine it with Seoul Forest 
good park,"in spring season, nice palace to walk. you can order delievery food near by han river. night time, beautiful night view there"
A must to visit ,Great place to stroll around in the evening totally fell in love with this place. We went on the river cruise and rent bicycle to move around the park it so was fun and there are plenty of activities for friends and family.
Great view of the city,"This park is at the other side of the river so you can get a nice view of Seoul. It is easy to get here by taking the bus. Good spot to make some good memories, take pics and just to chill on a bench."
Not just Seoul's lungs but the playground.,"The immense water's edge of Seoul that is the Han River is home to such a broad and varied collection of activities: cycling, swimming, water skiing, paddle boarding, canoeing, camping, bbq-ing. You can rent bikes, camp grounds, etc. Along its impressive length, there are water shows, water park resorts, restaurants. It really is an impressive array."
I looooove love love this place! Especially the park at Yeoido.,"The title says just about everything - I love the Hangang park at Yeoido so much. I hung out there three nights in a row while I was in Seoul, as well as after church at the nearby megachurch (Yeoido Full Gospel Church is a 15 minute walk away - it's the largest megachurch in the world with over 1,000,000 members if you're interested in attending!). There are always tons of buskers there singing and performing, so there is entertainment. The second time I went there was also a fireworks show over the river. There's a famous sign there that says ""I Seoul U"" as well, which makes for good pics during the day and at night. When I went a couple nights ago, it was also lightly raining so everything was just beautiful. There are little stores where you can get bingsu as well, and just eat and hang out. If you want to get right to the good part of the park, take the subway and get off at Yeoinaru station. Don't make the same mistake I did and get off at Yeoido station (I thought it was closest to the church, turns out Yeoinaru is MUCH closer, and I got lost looking for it). Oh and there are also food trucks right outside the park if you're into that kind of food, and a Gong cha (my favorite boba place) next door to the church (i.e. about 15 minutes away by foot). It's a really chill place to hang out, and you can get food delivered there and drink outside and everything, it's all totally legal (and acceptable!). I highly recommend going with a friend and hanging out on the grass, or just going alone with your boba and a journal to write and be in peaceful solitude like I did! :D"
Nice waterfront park,We went there at evening because it was too hot to visit the park at daytime during summer. There were a lot of visitors both local and foreign. It was good for walking along the river. There were also many different activities offered at night time.
A must!,"We were at Banpo Hangang, Lovely place to spend the evening with ramen and fried chicken :) Especially lively on weekend. Across Banpo Hangang, the new ""round"" building is open with cool cafes and outfoor sitting where you can just hang and read a book. Great Place : ) "
Perfect both for relax and sports,Perfect for sunny days relax! Lot of arractions and places for whole families. Would love to come back :)
ONE OF THE BEST PARK I EVER WENT,"Its one of the best park i must say, its clean and very cold specially at night. Alot of activities to do but if you feel to relax and makes you feel your in Korea you must go here. Just bring your snacks while resting here ."
People friendly park and best resting area,"I live in Seoul. But as originally from a small city in one province, I 've always missed the mother nature that can be found fully in my hometown.For me who gets tired a city life, Han river is a great soothing place. As large as enough to compare to a sea, by delivering cool winds and the location where I can glance at colorful lives of others, it comforts me a lot. In totall there are more than 20 bridges across the river, and along the river a long park stretches down, where many convenient facilities are installed, such ad like convenient stores, bicycle rental shops, toilets, ferry decks, retaurants and museums. From season to season, you can various shows and events going on. My favorite activity there is to ride a bicycle.To a traveller, I recommend to take a ferry and do bicycling, and most importantly try to eat Chi-mac(chicken and beer) like locals. It is the most popular menue for Koreans when we have casual gatherings. Feel the breeze and relax and the history of us that has lived togethet with the river and its bridges for more than a half century."
"Park, River and Views","Hangang Park is like other parks adjacent to a river, however this park is designed with a couple of commercial structures that light up at night, galleries of food trucks and a view of the Bampo bridge that illuminates at night with water display show. Definitely recommend."
Best place in Seoul,The river park is a quiet place that feels almost completely removed from the city. I've gone many times to relax or exercise when I feel stressed from the bustle of the crowded city. All the people I've encountered there all act totally different in the majesty of the serenity. It is a reprieve for nature folks such as myself.
A place for the youngster,"I was there in weekend and on a cloudy day. So many young people was there to skate, cycle, and even camping. The entire place was colourful and lively. Some food trucks and hawkers were selling mostly BBQ and noodle. But I felt it was quite boring to me (maybe I am getting old?), and a bit disappointed as I saw a lot (yes, a lot) of trash scattering around!!!"
My Favorite Place in Seoul!,"The Hangang Park is actually the entire system of parks and biking/walking path that parallels the Han River and tributaries on both sides all throughout and beyond Seoul. Rent a bike (available at stations throughout town or at shops on the river) and spend a few hours just riding along the path to take in the sights. Sometimes its even faster than car or subway. Some notable areas are the path around the Banpo bridge, particularly at night when they put on a lighted water fountain display. Picnics are also a great way to enjoy the park. "
Spend many hours at this park ,"This is an amazing park along the river. There is so much you can do here. Can really recommend to hire a bike or tandem bike for 2-3 hours. You can also walk and just enjoy what comes in your way. There is a waterpark for children and also some ""rivers"" floating through the park were you can dip your feet."
"Cycle, picnic, stroll, take photos","There's plenty to do at the Hangang Park, that is if you have the time.WE took the subway to Yeouinaru station and got out at exit 2.This is where you'll find their iconic ""I SEOUL U"" signage.To rent a bike, you come out of the station, go further up front towards the river, and at the main walking path, turn either to the left or to the right and walk about 100M and you'll find their bicycle rental booths. Cycling is the fastest way to cover and see more area but you'll need to return you bike to the same station you rent it from to collect your security deposit of your passport or identity card.Even with walking, you can still enjoy the air, the scene and many photo stops. Convenient stores selling instant noodles, snacks and drinks are nearby. "
Great outdoor activities!,We came here by subway and it's so easy with that. We went there on Friday evening so there was so many truck food. With the live band playing. We enjoy that very much! And if you are have free time can rent the bike and ride around the park!There also local family lying down on the garden with tent! This is so cool experience!
Romantic,I LOVE THIS PLACE! My favorite part about my holiday in Seoul! Barely any tourist there! So relaxing. A great place for an evening stroll. They even have small shows & performance. Locals having picnics & riding bicycles.. My happy places. They even have water/bridge shows at night.
Beatifull,"We went to Hangang Park at night, we missed the lightshow, so there is not much to say about that. Hangang Park is a beatifull place to relax at at night. "
Perfect for biking,"For 3,000 KRW, you can rent a comfortable bike for an hour to ride on a big bike path along the river. The path is mostly flat, with occasional challenging hills. It was my favorite activity in Seoul!"
Lovely place if you have kids or into drama,"I enjoy the serenity in Hanggan river though there are many tourists and locals. What made this exciting is our love for Kdrama knowing that some scenes were shot here. OTher than that, it is just a place to stroll and walk around"
Awesome: cycling at sunset,"It's a big park, and perfect for a nice cycle along the river at sunset! Lots of amenities as well. Really recommended!"
I was proposed to in this park.,"Hangang Park is huge. It's great for exercising, riding your bike along the river, having a picnic...On a nice day, it can get pretty crowded, but that's to be expected in Seoul. "
Great outdoor activity along a beautiful river,"Inspired by the recent Korean dramas featuring bicycling on the Hangang, my daughter and I decided to try the bike rentals and see the sights on wheels. Managed to download a pretty good guide on Bicycling-Along-the-Hangang from visitseoul and started at Yeouido Park after getting out at Yeoinaru station. The bike station was easily spotted on the right (if you stand facing the river). Have an ID card handy to register for the bikes. Cost is about 3000 won per hour. Bikes are pretty new and have baskets to carry your stuff.The bike paths are well maintained but are not all flat. Some effort required for slopes. Maybe because it was a Sunday, we met with many other ""serious"" cyclists who were polite but kept overtaking us. Only complaint is that the signages were mainly in Korean and we didn't know half the time which bridges we were at. As a result we missed the crossing and didn't make it to Seoul forest. A good place to go across the river to the other side is on the Rainbow bridge. Keep cycling till you come to a traffic light along the path with car access. This bridge also has a water display at certain times of the day.Lots of convenient stores along the way to stop for a drink and snack. There was even a concert with live kpop bands.Scenery is beautiful but weather was a bit hot already in May. Would cycle again in cooler weather on a different route."
Sunset at Hangang Park,"I visit this place at 5pm. So many travellers (i met them from Lithuania and China) and Korean people here (they finished working,came here from the office and relax with their boy/girlfriend here).The view is really..really awesome.the river so clean,the air so fresh,the view is so amazing with long bridge spread from east to west.i dont know what the name of the bridge.there's a ferry tour to discover the river. The park is so clean.there are some cleaning services put the rubbish.There're a words I SEOUL U in the park and ppl can take a pict over there.so i reccomend you this place to visit.come here in the evening and you can see the awesome scenes here."
Park ,A nice place to walk. At night/evening it is better to visit this place. I was here during noon....and one time at evening. Both was worth the trip....
Lovely Walk Along the River,"This is a lovely river walk and park. Serene, beautiful. Hangang Park is defintiely worth the time to check it out."
Ttukseom Resort Station Park,"The park on the side of Ttukseom Resort Station was really good fun. Enjoyed the skateboard park twice during my trip, many ramps and large skatable area to practise. There is also convenient bicycle rental and many convenience stores along the way to get food and drinks. There is a public pool there too but it was not open yet."
"Incredibly large, well-maintained park with tons of activities","I've visited this park with my husband several times since we moved to Seoul 9 months ago and plan to continue going once our baby arrives this spring. It is a fabulous park that we find is always clean and well-maintained. The park has plenty of inexpensive parking and options for restrooms and refreshments throughout. The park itself is huge and spans quite a length of the Han river. I doubt you could see it all in a day. However, it's a lot of fun to spend time here on nice weather days. We like that there are separate walking and bike paths along the river - it means much less risk of getting flattened by bicyclists than other parks we have been to. There are also wonderful sweeping views of the city skyline to be seen from this park - bring your camera! We have also observed children's playgrounds, basketball courts, soccer fields, picnic pavilions, sculpture gardens, water sports and water taxis, waterfront dining, and other attractions at Hangang park. We would definitely recommend this park to fellow nature lovers."
Good for a gentle bike ride,A great park with many different things to see and do.I recommended hiring out a bike and riding alongside the river. Ask at the desk for a good route. You will need to hand over your passport as a deposit and the cost is very cheap.Good for a day out and the whole family will enjoy this.After you have finished coincide this with a visit to the world cup stadium.
best place to chill,it is one of the best place in Seoul to get some air chill out friends. it is usually best to go in summer time as the weather is very hot and you get some cool air and do some water sports too.
View of Sunset,We managed to catch sunset from the Han's river park. We walked along the bridge too. Good place for cycling and catching up with friends. Visited the area where they acted the Legend of the Blue Sea 
Spent the Afternoon Just Hanging Out,Great place to watch the world go by. We bought snacks in the building and sat on the steps overlooking the bridge. It was a cool and shady place to relax.
Everyone's Favorite Spot in The Town!,Just in love! A favorite spot for hanging out or walking down the river side to watch the beautiful scene of Han River and everything around. Best time to enjoy the view is near the sunset time but it's good also in the evening with the city lights bright up the the surrounding. 
nice park,went here at night strolling looking at the night lights on the streets and here after dinner so far we love it
quiet walk in autumn,"Hangang Park covers a vast area of land, both sides of the Han river. From Itaewon, the floating island is just a bus away. The park can also be accessed from different start points using the subway, one is via Exit5 of Express bus terminal station. I visited the park last 2015 for the sunset. I chose to walk around while waiting, but bikes can also be rented if you want to cover a much larger part of the park. It was spectacular looking the at the at the silhouettes of buildings, the bridge and Namsan tower appear as the sun sets. Unplanned, I dropped by at the park at night and I was at awe with the illumination of one of the structures on the floating island. I saw a lot of couples that night, and I can't blame them for choosing the place despite the cold. Oh so rrromantic!"
An off-the-beaten track experience,"We came here to take the Hangang River cruise. After the cruise, we lingered here for quite a while to enjoy the walk along the river and witness a part of the lives of Seoulites. Hangang Park is a bustling place for young people and citizens to come here for recreational and sports activities. There were many people cycling, picnicking and doing water sports here. It is not too difficult to get here as long as you travel by the subway and will experience something different from shopping and eating in downtown Seoul. "
Icon Attraction,"Like the Park very much, nice breeze and fresh air. Went during May so sun was pretty hot but the strong wind has help to relief the heat.... walk along the park all the way to the other end of the bridge. Spend a sweet afternoon with my husband there. Love it."
I SEOUL U @ Hangang Park,We were here last November 2016 during Autumn and its super cold. This park is beautiful with the icon I S E O U L U. Its quite quiet tho theres few tourist sight seeing around when we were there as its on weekdays. Its located in the middle of Hangang Park .
Ride the Hanging,I went for bike ride here on my last trip..great way to spend a secret afternoon off from the office!
Landmark!,"This park is the site of many Hangang River attractions. Including the Banpodaegyo Bridge Moonlight Rainbow Fountain, the Underwater Bridge and Moonlight Square. During summer time, there are waters sports on the Hangang River. Perfect location for family outing. I saw kids riding bikes, flying kites, picnic & etc. Lots of outdoor activities. My favorite thing at this park definitely has to the Moonlight Rainbow Fountain. During the day, you can see the natural rainbow. At night, there is laser rainbow show. The fountain show from April to October. The rainbow jets of water stretch 1,140 meters. It creates a fantastic view over the river along with 200 colorful lights. This fountain was listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as teh world's longest bridge fountain. Subway Line 3, 7 or 9, Express Bus Terminal Station, Exit 8-1]Subway Line 9, Sinbanpo Station, Exit 2"
A must visit place,This park is so suitable for all ages and I should have your picnic there. It was exciting to be there!
"Beautiful but cold in winter, must be buzzing during summer months","I went to this park in February and it was very cold but sunny day. Just make sure you use clothes to make you warm and you still can stroll around in this park. The day I went a few people were jogging and riding bike. you have great views of N Seoul Tower and there is a sign I SEOUL U, where you can take good pictures. There is a ferry and also a place where concerts are held but because it was winter, they were close. To arrive close to the I SEOUL U sign, take the purple subway line (number 5) and get off the station Yeouinaru exit 2"
Lovely park,The weather was really nice when I visited this wonderful park. Very cool place for couples and tourist to visit. I visited this place with my friends but still enjoyed it. I wish my boyfriend came along haha. A must go for a tourist to click some amazing photos. 
Nice place for couples ,"In my opinion, this is the place to come if u are coming with your girlfriend..... a good place to hangout "
nice place for relax,"My friend in Korea bring me there, we have bike for 2 hours, walk for a while, we even ordered take away chicken and eat , we enjoyed a whole afternoon there"
Nice walk,"It was freezing for us in February but it was a nice walk along the Han river. If you are specifically looking for the I Seoul U sign, it is still there! Line 5, exit Yeouinaru subway station and head out exit 2 or 3. Warmer weather will bring out the food vendors and people hanging out on the grass and steps. Will revisit in warmer weather."
nice area to visit,"There is a drone park there so we were visiting to try out the mavic iron albs. The weather was nice although it was cold Feb, i believe if you go during spring it must be much more beautiful to walk around."
Beautiful Park on the Han River,"There's lots of activities to do here; you can walk, bike, and even go on a boat ride. It makes you feel a little relaxed compared to the city's noisy traffic. "
Nice Place!,"We have a short visit only at this place, but i think this is a nice place to visit with friends just to enjoy the moment."
New Years,This area at night looks always beautiful. Came around here for New Years and it was very nice. Some local food around to eat
Wonderful scenery,"I rent a bicycle and rode a little bit over a hour by hangang river. The day was warm and sunny. I don't remember where the place was where I rode a bicycle but I hoped that there would be more places to eat something. Anyway scenery was great, bicycle was good too and I had lot of fun. Especially on sunny day you can see many korean people enjoying of their free time. You can just go and sit somewhere, maybe walk a little bit or rent a bicycle which I recommend. If you rent a bicycle I recommend to buy some snack and drink."
Good place to chill,"we plan to go somewhere else but we accidentally got here because we got out the wrong subway station, Yeounaru.We had a quick rest on one of the benches while watching some local kids on their bicycles. Nothing much to do here especially with the chilly wind on winterThere was an ""I SEOUL U"" sign which we took the opportunity to take pictures with, while analyzing the subway route and thinking about how to go to other tourist destination."
Chill acitivity,"I used to visit the Han River with my family all the time when I was young. It has always been part of my life until I stopped going as an adult. Last spring, I was visiting Seoul and decided to walk along the river to see cherry blossoms and it brought back so many memories! It is a cool place to hang out with friends and family for a picnic and fly kites. You'll see a lot of family bringing their kids to just hang out and play sport or games. You can literally come here anytime of the day to chill. Just make sure you are warm during the winter because it can get very windy during the winter. Ride the ferry if you have extra time..."
"Morning, Afternoon, Night","If you still have some spare time before you go back to your home country, try going here for some relax. You can jog, walk, riding bicycles, picnic, have fun drink beer at night, take pictures and just sitting and relax. The best time to go there is at night where you can sit and be overwhelmed by the view while drinking beer or sodas and order some chicken to eat. Going alone or with friends is your preference. "
Hang-ing by the river,"Well, it is what it is - a riverside park. There isn't much to do here, except to just take a leisurely stroll along the river and enjoy the wind and the waters for a while, maybe even snap some pictures.There used to be more food outlets here, but they have since closed down and are now replaced by convenience stores. Still, if you do want to get food, you can buy them from the pushcarts selling food like kimbab and tteokbokki, although these are priced a little more expensive.The best time to visit this place is actually in early October, for the Seoul International Fireworks Festival (서울세계불꽃축제). But if you are going for the festival, do head down to the park early even though the opening ceremony only commences at 7pm. In fact, you should be there by around 4pm to reserve a nice spot in the park to get a good view of the fireworks. If you don't have a picnic mat, fret not because there will be people selling. Likewise, there will be a lot of pushcarts on that day, so you don't have to worry about food while watching the fireworks either.To get to the park, I recommend taking the Seoul Subway to Yeouinaru Station (Line 5) and going out from exit 4. The park is right in view when you exit the station."
One of the great places to hang out meet the locals,Fall and Spring are excellent times to visit this enormous park. Check out the different options depending on where you go. Both sides of the river are wide green spaces even though there is always a freeway nearby. Seoul has done an amazing job at assuring that the river front is a relaxing place. Bike paths are every way and a separate walking/hiking trail is available. If you a bit outside of the main city center you will find some well restored natural parts for bird watching and a sense of wilderness which is hard to come by in this city.
Empty ,The park isn't very big and relatively quite empty especially in winter. We walked along Yeouido Park to the cruise terminal and hardly see anyone. 
Leisure time in evening,"There are several exits to the Han river, near one of the exits to the park is the I Seoul U sign. At evening there are lights and people come here for a picnic."
A nice place," In the three-month summer holiday vacation, I travelled to Seoul, which is the capital of Korea. Korea is a country that gathers different kinds of culture. Except for the shopping malls to go, there is also a nice park in Seoul for people to visit which is called Hangang Park. Actually, when I am on the subway, sometimes it will pass on the river, it is really beautiful. This time we go to Hangang Park to have a look. As we entered the park, it is full of local people or tourists. The greenish area there is quite large. You can see many people doing different sports there. Like riding a bicycle, playing football swimming and so on. I have a picnic with my friends sitting on the grass. I enjoy the sunshine and fresh air there. It makes me comfortable. I recommend that the people who want to have a picnic there can prepare more things."
Banpo Bridge in Seoul,"I think it's caused by we didnt came on the peak seasons so it's not crowded at all. Really a good experience for us to feel the peace & busy of Seoul together. When sitting down near to the bridge, you can feel the busy of Seoul through the sound of cars driving by and the lights of buildings but you can find yourself in peace at the same time. We spent 2 hours here & doing nothings than sat down & listen to the sounds of ""present""."
"Dip Your Tired Feet, Soothe Your Soul","We came here to see the view of the river and we got more than what we expected. It was a Saturday when we visited the park. There were families camping out and kids were having a great time playing in the park and in the ponds. The water was flowing and it was cool, much like the water from a mountain stream. We joined the crowd and walked through the shallow ponds. As we sat there with our legs dipped in the water, we are mesmerized by the view of happy people out there. It was such a delight seeing a clean public place like this in the middle of the city. Best of all, it's free!"
Morning run in Hangang Park,"Compared to other parks in other major cities, there's nothing special about Hangang Park. It looks plain and the view of Han River does not seem to look spectacular from the park. I did a 12km loop by the river bank and the flat route was pretty much the same. "
ISeoulU sign,"This is where you get to take photos with the ISeoulU sign (similar to I Amsterdam sign). If you take the train, go to the Yeoinaru station, it is 5 min walk from the exit"
Banpo Bridge,"When I feel bored after having dinner, sometimes, I drove my car to Banpo Bridge to see waterfall from Banpo Bridge. It's good to see with colorful light and for this reason, it is called Rainbow Fountain.There is a spacious parking lot in the southern part of Banpo Bridge. And another good place is a underneath bridge below Banpo Bridge. This bridge is called ""Jamsu Bridge"" in Korean which means it is overflooded with heavy rain in Summer. You may walk and acrosse Han River just over its surface. It is one of my favorate driving path in Seoul as well.During night, the floating islands called ""Sevit Islands"" are good to drop by. These there places are good to go on foot."
great use of river way,This is a great way to relax or take in a breath of fresh air after Seoul's city sights and shopping.
Beautiful sunset,"For directions: once reached Hanum Station, turn left upon exit and head up the flight of stairs to walk right, along the expressway, until you reach the zebra crossing, get across and look to your left for the underpass to get to the other side into the park next to the river.Personal verdict: It's beautiful with the sunset over the mountains and the rainbow lights across the Hanum Bridge. Worth a visit but besides this park and river, there is really nothing much around here. Have fun travellers :)"
Great place to spent a whole day in Seoul.,"It can be a really nice pause from all the sightseeing. You can hire a bike for free (for expample near Oksu or Eungbong station) for 3 hours or 1-2 hours during summer (you leave your ID). You can also hire a bike for a whole day for 15000 W. There is a bike path near the river so you can admire Seoul from the other perspective. There are a lot of 'gyms' and places to play basketball on the way. You can also see the unusual fountain from the banpo bridge (at certain hours, the best at the evening with lights and music)."
Highlight of my trip!,Somewhere my friends and I rode our bikes on our last arvo/night to relax and chill by the river and enjoy a little picnic. There's so many people out and so much to enjoy with a beautiful view of the river and sunset.
Beautiful night walk,"We came here in the evening during the weekend. It was nice to walk around and be near the water. There are people playing music, riding the bike, having a picnic, and skateboarding. We had a good time getting a little rice cake dish near by the station and eating and walking around the park. Next time, we want to rent a bike and ride for a little while. "
Great Place for Some Peace and Serenity,"Hangang Park is the ideal place if you want to be away from the shopping streets of Myeongdong/Dongdaemun etc. The views of Seoul City are just amazing. You can also take great photographs. The Hangang river is huge so you can alight at several stations to enjoy different views of the river (Exit 2 or 3 of Ttukseom Resort station (Seoul Subway Line 7, Exit 1 of Cheonho station (Seoul Subway Line 5 & 8) or Exit 2 or 3 of Yeouinaru station (Seoul Subway Line 5))"
huge river in middle of city,"Nice, peaceful park near the river bank. good for walking and exercising. view of the city is very nice too."
Nice location on the Han River,"This park is about a 10 minute walk from my house and we enjoy taking our young children down to play at the park in the evenings. Enjoy the river views and the beautiful sunsets in the evenings. At night, the city lights up all around the river and this is worth seeing too!"
"Great park to visit and walk around, the view is amazing and so much to see. ","Nice place to walk around and relax, great view. This place is great for outdoors activities and play around."
Best Morning Practice,"Walking, bike riding, enjoying the Korean sunrises and sunsets- this was the best place to do this! There are work out stations every mile or so- and the scenery and river are incredible. "
What a nice park!,"Seoul has really put together some wonderful places for the residents to get out of the urban concrete highrise filled dongs and back to nature, and Hangang Park is one of the great ones. We visited at night, pre Eland Cruise, and it looked like a place that would be a go-to weekend destination of mine if I were to live in Seoul. Walking and biking paths along the Riverside, a beautifully sloped grassy rise perfect for picnicking with views of the Seoul skyline, it was very nice and seemingly much appreciated by the locals as many were out enjoying the evening- mostly couples naturally. Is it a tourist destination? Not so much if you have limited time in Seoul but if you are going to the river cruise, building 63, or even the huge wet market it is worth taking an extra 1/2 hour to go stop by for a visit!"
Afternoon walk,"This was one of my top activities in Seoul! What a great way to get out of the chaos of the city and walk, run, cycle or just hangout by the river. There are lots of open green spaces and outdoor fitness areas. What I like in particular are the separate paths for walkers/runners and cyclists. Along the path are several gateways that will allow you to enter/exit the park. Due to the proximity of the Gangnam neighborhood, you can easily explore the shops and cafes of Sinsa-dong Garosu-gil. "
Good for walking or running. ,It's a long park beside the river. I think it's good for exercise there was machine to exercise and there was a line for those who drive bicycle. المكان ممتاز لمن يودون ممارسة رياضة الجري او المشي. وهناك ايضا موجودة آلات رياضية للاستخدام العام. و يوجد خط لمسافة معينة لمن يود ممارسة رياضة قيادة الدراجة. 
"Biggest near-city river park ever, maybe","Almost every important civilizations brought up with near water environment, and most of big cities such as NY, London, Berlin, or others are placed near water(river, whatever else)But the difference is, Han river is broad overwhelming compare with others. It's enormous scale could suggest you different kind of assessment of openness.And additional facilities near by are quite fancy and clean, convenient. Like CVS stores, public toilet with tissues, good greenfields, etc."
Nice view,"It is a lovely place to view the scenery. walking and looking to the surrounding. suitable for couples, family and friends."
Great view,"Banpo hangang park where takes 20 min. From the bus express terminal by walking. It's the greatest places for picnic on the grass and look at the view of city. There are many activities that you can do such as flying the kites taking a walk, running, jogging, riding the bike, roller skate etc. There is the world's longest bridge fountain that you can watch the spectacular moonlight rainbow fountain show at night!"
Lovely place to visit on a sunny day!,"Lovely place for couples and families. Spotted many families and friends gathering for picnics, camping, various sports (baseball, running, cycling, usage of fitness machines). I enjoyed the night ferry cruise from Jamsil Dock that went to Banpo Bridge (8pm rainbow fountain ""show""). "
visit this place on a sunny day,the river is a place where Koreans are visiting to have a picnic during sunny days. its a rather large area where you can just sit down and enjoy life. Also several river cruises that are leaving from this area. 
Nice place for a picnic,"Nice park with good views of the city, it is very heavily used, lots of people come here with their picnics, you can even hire picnic blankets. We came to late to hire a bike unfortunately, it would have been nice to ride up and down the river."
The best place in Seoul; picnics and bicycles,"This place is without a doubt the best place to experience Seoul on a weekend like a local. Ride a bike for hire (cheap), order fried chicken to your picnic on the grassy areas. Thirsty? No problem. Get food and drinks from the nearby convenience stores in the park. Also this is the place where the famous han river cycling route is. There are several water sports, although nothing terribly must do. This place is fantastic to chill with friends, picnic and bike location."
Visit on a weekend night,"There are street performers on weekend nights, making it a perfect place to chill. You will also get to enjoy Hangang Park to the fullest as there will be loads of young adults hanging out here but not to the point where it is too crowded. There are also food trucks available. Definitely a good place to relax and chill."
pefect place to visit at night,"this place is really amazing ,you can take a pictures near the river or take a boot for river tour , in this location fresh air and a lot of Activities dance , some bands and some place for sale a food and goods , at night especially in the week end the park full with the people ,really don't miss this place if you want to visit Seoul"
So pretty!,"Walk around, see the river, maybe take a boat tour - it's so nice on a sunny day! do note that there aren't a lot of places to eat nearby, so get your own or try going into the small streets. "
On the Up and Up,"I visit here a couple times a year with family/ friends from out of town but I hadn't been in a couple of years. Wow! The money that's been poured in here! There are actually five separate parks under the umbrella of Hangang Park, but they have all had a massive revamp in facilities and pathways etc. Especially notable to be here at sunset at it sets along the length of the river and is very picturesque."
Nice Park,"It is a nice park, but nothing too special. It is nice to walk along the river in a park. Just not too special of a place in my mind."
Disappointed bike rental closed.,"We were a family of 6, looking to limber up on a bike ride, unfortunately, the rental operation was closed-on a Sunday in August. But walking was pleasant avoiding the speeding bikes."
Fun afternoon,"We rented bikes (about $2.00 an hour) and walked along the river, had a snack and rested under a tree. A great place to people watch. "
Believe it or not!,"In the early 90's during one of the major storms in Korea, I was in Korea on the Metro crossing the Hangang river and the river had risen very close to the track. So this is a must on your visit to Seoul, visit the beautiful parks built on both sides of the Han river. Now this is the believe it or not, and but from the park, look up to the Metro rail, take a photo, and then make a mental picture of how much water was flowing down the river. Wow. And yes, all the parks built on the river sides were washed away. What I was impressed with is soon after the storm, they were rebuilding the parks again."
Hazy Scenic View,"Strolling along the Hangang Park is only recommended as a precursor to the Han River Cruise; however, if you don't have time to spare, missing out on this attraction would be fine. The park provides a scenic view of Seoul's city skyline; however, on our date of visit, the skies were quite hazy. I'd still pick HK's Victoria Harbour over this."
To foreigners visiting Seoul,"If you are plan to visit Garosu gil or Apgujeong, don't miss Han river park! Garosu gil and Apgujeong are not really different with anyother spots in Seoul city.. relaxing in han river park would make your brain and body clean.. I recommand you visiting here at night time, after having some tought walks. Stair at Big river, breathe fresh air!!(oh let us just think as that way lol) take a break! You can also rent a bicycle. I love this park so much!!압구정이나 가로수길만 가지 말고 한강공원 꼭 와보세요! 특히 저녁시간 선선할 때 지친 심신에게 회복할 시간을 가지는 것을 추천합니다"
Park,I go here in the night and so cold and also so windy maybe it will be nice if i go here in the morning or afternoon.
Cool place to chill,"It was first time visiting there. Due to the fact that it was Wednesday night, there were not so many people as expected. Im sure that there will be no space during weekends. Its really nice to go out and grab some unique street food. The food around there is quite costy compare to just normal ones, but the stakes there are pretty nice (8,000₩-10,000₩)Park was a lot cleaner than expectation and the cool breeze was enjoyable."
Nothing special during the day,"I went there in the morning hours and wasn't impressed. It's a narrow road with paths for bikes. Other than that and people running, I didn't see much more. There are also no big green areas."
"Cool Place to chill, stare off into space or ride your bike","If you want a chill place to just to hang out and free your mind from worries, Hanggang Park is a great place to check out. The bridges are very pretty. No wonder this place is always chosen for those movinng emotionally charged scenes inn K Dramas where the lead characters have the big confrontational talk.:)"
Chill and Relax,"Its a long river that features different attractions depending on where you enter. It has parks (some sports oriented and some water oriented), restaurants, and a boat ride too. You can both visit in the day and night. NIce play to exercise and chill and at night see the lights."
It nice Park,Hangang Park it was nice place for visiting and have good building .we take a lot picture .it natural view.
Should visit Hangang Park both at day and Night,"Don't just look into Hangang Park from the highway, cause it has a lot for you to explore. You can just visit Hangang Park at day and go biking around it or you can also visit it at night cause it has colorful light and bridge attraction everynight."
"A great place for cycling... the earlier, the better","This review is about cycling. There are many things to do on the waterfront... dance, have a meal or picnic, walking, etc., but it is the bicycle paths that make this such an enjoyable place to visit. The country is strewn with well cared for paths. The main one in Seoul is here at the Hangang. There are plenty of places for refueling yourself and for caring for your bike. The coffee shops and convenience stores are often the scene of cyclists in their matching gear and colorful sticker-speckled helmets.This park is so popular, though, as a cyclists be careful! The pedestrians tend to spill off the walking path and onto the cycling path."
A place to chill,"Yeouido Hangang Park is the best place to chill. A lot of locals come here with their couple and families especially at night. Plenty of things to do like riding bicycles, river cruising, watching street performances, having picnics or just taking a stroll along the river. The closest metro station is Yeouinaru and there's plenty of convenient stores to grab a snack."
...and time went by,"I had planned to go for a stroll along the river, but I didn't know what to expect. I was pleased to find myself in the middle of peace and away from the cars. True, there is ""nothing"" else to do but to walk and enjoy the view alongside with taking a break from the otherwise crowded Seoul. I walked for at least 2,5 hours and enjoyed it heavily - those who want to drive their bicycle have their rode, the ones strolling around their own. Everything is settled and really beautiful. A beautiful green space to switch off."
Cherry blissom,Lovely long stretch with great breeze from the river Cherry blossoms were all over making it extra charming and it was lovely to chill and stroll and grab a bite Beautiful
Green spaces,"Love this park along the Hangang River - it is a clean, green, lovely place to walk and ride a bicycle. We rented a flat for a week and had the privilege of a view of this park every morning."
Crowded Park with Beautiful View and Interesting Street Performance,"Yeouido Hangang Park is the place to be if you enjoy street food, beautiful river view and street performances, bring a picnic mat or tent on a good weather day to relax and unwind.Just a couple minutes walk from the train station, the entrance of this park is filled with street food vendors and fried chicken delivery people. Take your pick. After getting food, head towards the river and you'll spot many street performances, especially on weekends, some are really good. The river view is also beautiful and you can cycle in the area too. If the sky is clear, the sunset view is also very memorable."
Mr,It is very far from metro station about 1.2km and 20 mins walk. Check the fountain schedule and plan you trip allow extra travel time. We had been there during the night and couldn't tell the view during the day.
Oasis from the concrete jungle,You must visit the Han River/Park at least one time on your visit of Seoul. It serves as a lovely break from the concrete filled jungle that Seoul is and lets you breath a little. Watch out for the many pedestrians and cyclists thought!
Beatiful Greenspace in a Metropolitan City,"Of all the places in Seoul, this is where I thought, I could live in this city if I came to this park every day. Though Seoul is a big city with lots of buildings and traffic, it does have a lot of greenery and hills (I thought of Seattle or San Francisco) throughout the city that I loved. But, this park had something else (perhaps it was the proximity to water). It was a well planned and designed park for cyclists and pedestrians, there were the mini-gyms spaced out through the park, small gazebos where people were relaxing or picnicking, and lots of beautiful greenery. It made me forget I was in a city (as long as I didn't look across the river)! "
River Cruise,"Took the river cruise, worth the trip, though the trip was a little short. Beautiful place you would not want to miss when in Seoul! Gotta catch sunset here too. "
Go at sunset for fountain show,"Nice place to escape the heat, sit by the river and people watch. Around sunset there is a fountain show from the bridge set to music. Locals gather here, order takeout and set up tents and picnics for the evening. Would have been great to rent a bike and cycle around the area. The floating island buildings are nearby for touristy type food, otherwise they quite vacuous inside with not much to offer. They are nicely lit at night and make a nice photo backdrop. "
Worth a visit,"Not the easiest place to visit, but sure worth it. I can recommend to rent a bicycle and take a drive along the river. It is fun."
Good for cycling along the river,"This park in the Gangnam district of Seoul is on the Han river. There are a few cafes and shops in 2 large glass buildings, and other than that there's the bridge across and not much else.Nice for a stroll if you happen to be in the area, or for some cycling, but if you're on a tight schedule you can safely give this one a miss."
Night water show was so-so," Really large area - under two bridges so its very unusual! They have two neon buildings for restaurants and a lot of cycling tracks. At 8.50pm. from one of the bridges at the bottom, they would start spraying out water to the sound of stand by me! From the bottom bridge, it looks like a waterfall. Have seen better. However, the park is a nice area for families etc. "
Run of the mill,"Seoul is sprawling with parks, and this one doesn't offer much -- it's good to visit if you're staying near the area but other the usual fare of biking, and having a picnic, there's not much."
a Drama on my own,"if, by any chance, there is any of you who is like madly in love with korean drama (like me) then u must know when sometimes they're just hanging around Hangang Park while eating spicy fried chicken with soju or makgeolli? well, that is exactly what im doing when i went here..turns out, its quite fun and i really had a good time.so why dont you try?"
Free your Seoul by cycling,"Pretty much sums it all up with my title. Cycle along the river, enjoy the breeze, take in the sights and sounds, join in the laughters. "
the lungs of the city!,"We have lived nearby the river park for three years, and value every kilometer -- what a great vision! At all hours, people are walking or riding or skating along the river walk. It is so encouraging to walk or ride there, even if only for a few minutes. And there are convenience stores every few kilometers! I wonder why there are no official sit-down restaurants along the water's edge."
A nice place to hang out,Its a really nice place by the Han river just to hang out with friends in the evening. Carry a picnic basket and a mat to sit int he park. 
Relaxing spot in the city,"Great view, perfect for a bike ride. Walking can be nice too, however, it's not a 'real' break from the city, the air quality is still bad so people should be careful spending too much time in the area without wearing a mask."
We miss the season...,We came to the park hoping to see cherry blossom unfortunately we miss the season already... yet we have our time there sitting on a bench and enjoying the moments we have :)
Decent. Should be better.,"The Han River Park is a popular spot to escape the city, but I always feel it could be so much better. It's great that Seoul has such a large park running along both banks of its river - few cities do - but the facilities are poor."
Nice little walk,Nice walk with great view. Very conveniently located and could start or end almost any time. Bike ride is also nice.
Ideal for chilling by the riverside,"Visited the stretch of the park in Ichon, near the National Museum. Spent a relaxed late afternoon here, in the shade of a rest shed, with a view of the well-manicured eulalia grass fronting the Han. Bicycle tracks line the edge of the park. Plenty of open green space for dog-walking or just chilling out. I came with guests from a friend's wedding, and we had a chimaek (fried chicken + beer) picnic, thanks to Seoul's relaxed open container laws."
Great place to spend the day relaxing,"What a relaxing way to spend a day. We took a 45 minute boat ride down the Han River, then lunch at the boat launch. I would split up my trip with a day here to unwind and view the great scenery"
Awesome Fun,"It is really easy to get to this park on the river using Purple subway line 5 - getting off at Yeouinaru - go out Exit 2 - you are there! Must see how Koreans flock to the park. We went early evening and it was a blast. If you want to the left, under the bridge - keep going til you get to the fountain area, you can rent bikes to ride the trails. So much fun. You can also have a picnic there - we had chicken delivered - you can pretty much have anything delivered to you at the park to eat, but I would not recommend that unless you have a Korean with you to make the call and explain where you are located in the park. There is a convenience store to buy drinks - vendors - and you can even buy or rent these shiny square pads to sit down on the ground for a picnic from the vendors. It was great - one of the best activities we did in Seoul - and you can really see how Koreans relax, as there are not many tourists going to picnic on the river."
Lots to do at this park!,"We opted for the 45 minute (roundtrip) ferry ride down the Hangang River. Great views with plenty of photo ops. We noticed many people renting bikes. There's also a ""pool-like"" area that locals were using to cool off. Popular place for locals to hang out on warm days."
Wow amazing. ,"It is huge. There are 10 Hangang riverside parks in Seoul two island parks in Seoul. Among them banpo bridge and Some Sevit, Yeouidi island park is highly recommended. :) "
Very cool place,"Lots of fun to get outside, walk around, see the Korean lifestyle where they are walking, jogging, cycling, strolling hand in hand or picnicking, even at night, ,while motorcycle taxis deliver food to them. There is a watershow with lights and music off of the big bridge at night, and the riverside buildings are lit with pretty colors. Good outdoor fun."
Fit and Fab even for just a half day!,"This is amazing for those who want to have an exercise for free! My friend and I really enjoyed the experience here even for a while. So many sports equipment found there. When you see Yeouido Full Gospel Church, cross the road and go down. There's this long line of cars alongside the park. "
Nice place to relax and enjoy the beauty of Han river,"There are several Hangang parks in seoul ( Yeouido Hangang Park, Banpo Hangang Park, Jamsil Hangang Park, Ttukseom Hangang Park etc). Gang means river in Korean and Han is the name of the river. It is nice place to relax your mind. Some people use tents. Also there are lots of outdoor activities. Good place to ride bicycles. On every Sunday Parking is free in some riverside parking lot. Nice place for having a picnic with family and friends."
Perfect picnic place,"If you have enough time apart from vising touristic places, bring a mat/blanket and come here for a picnic with your beloved ones. If it's sunny and warm, you can even soak up the sun here. It's also good spot to ride a bike or run. Don't worry about food. You can order food by a phone call like locals and it will be delivered to you. If your korean is not good enough to make a phone call or you're not with someone who can speak korean, simply use convinient stores or restaurants there."
A pleasant walk,"Though this is just a park, you will be surprised to find such a nice walking place instead of only shopping experiences of everyone. A nice walk to start with your relax day if you come for holidays. It's got a nice views and nice flower arrangements in the Park. We noted there are so many Korean family having picnics and even camping in this nice park. To the Hongkongers, this is a paradise you can't miss especially with kids."
fantastic views,"One of my favorite spots in Seoul, I visited the Yeouido Hangang Park once in the morning and evening. It is a great place to relax, people watch and take in the sights. Try to take the night cruise that brings you to the Rainbow Fountain show, the night views are great. I also cycled along the Han River in the evening. Great experience which I will remember for a long time to come."
"Cozy, nice weather","We took a han river cruise for sightseeing and It was awesome. Seoul is amazing city to see the new and old culture at the same time. I was shocked how they developed their own city after Korean War and this area, definitely, you can feel the new Seoul as it-self."
Nice place,"Big and nice park, always busy with people walking, cycling, doing some exercises. Also some guys doing some performances. You can rent a bicycle, there is a nice cycle track there or you can do a cruise on the river, there is a lot of kind of cruises, from just a single cruise (during morning and afternoon) till a romantic dinner cruise or a live music cruise. The simple cruise is not really interesting, the view from the river is nothing special "
Great place for picnics!,"Yet another attraction seen on Korean dramas and if you have extra time, do arrange for a picnic with your friends/family which is common for the locals.✌"
Strolling Nostalgic Hangang River...,"Quality time from the hustle and bustle city life with family and friends, whether a picnic or a river cruise, or be surprised by the many organised events esp on the weekends... this is the place to be... well maintained and safe with public ammenities such as toilets along the river bank, you'll also appreciate the occasional Internet accessibility. In 2011, Hangang was voted the 2nd most scenic location in Seoul... so that's a little something you'll have to find out ... cheers!"
Nice place to enjoy the river,"I really enjoy walking this park on a Sunday. Although this is not a park in the sense of other city centres parks, it is a nice place on the riverside. It allowed me to glimpse what locals do on their free time."
great relaxing time outside the center of Seoul,"It is by far my favorite places. If you want to enjoy some time away from the crowd and noise, that place is perfect for that and quite close still. There , you can rent bike, Rollerblade, skateboard, badminton rackets ... you can even exercise for free as there are an outside gym equipements , or just have some picnic. It is usually very clean and well maintained and so huge that there is enough space for everyone ( seriously enormous ) . It is really great to take photos. "
"Pleasant -- But Not a ""Must-See""",I enjoyed strolling by the river. It seemed to be exclusively locals enjoying picnics and families and couples out for the day. The views of the skyline in the distance were extraordinary. It looked like CGI from a Sci-Fi film! I also liked watching people paddle the little duck and chicken boats. 
Probably the best park in Seoul. Has great views of the river.,"Hangang park is huge! Great nature scenes with wide bicycle path, perfect spot for biking. Go around the park and you'll notice great architectures too, like this spiral bridge."
The best part of Seoul,"This is by far my favorite place to visit. The Hangang Park runs down both sides of the river and consists of biking and walking trails as far as you can see in both directions. Scattered along the way are various ""stretching"" stations, like mini gyms to get your legs and arms moving. There are very clean bathrooms along the paths and the occasional convenience store with water/snacks. This is a great place to hang out with your family for the day. Also, you can have food delivered directly to you anywhere in the park."
Nice place for a walk,Hangang park is a beautiful place for a walk. We went on a holiday so it was quite crowded with families and tents. Plenty of options for food and drink. Nice view of the river and city.
Go there except the day in smog,I walked from the World cup park to the Yeouido park.It was gray weather and I feel some stuffy.But other things like the sight and the facilities are perfect!
A place for chicken and beer,A place to relax and chill at with good atmosphere. Suitable for having finger food and beer there with a couple of friends to hang about.
Public park along the River,"The Hangang Park built for your relax time with your friends and family and you could rent a bike and ride along the river with the beautiful natural scenery. It's really worth to get there, believe me!"
Perfect for Picnic,Nice view of the Hangang. Must by Ramen from convenience store and eat with the Hangang view. Great for a leisure afternoon. There are bicycles rental too!
"excellent for biking, hanging in the grass, relaxing, or people watching","excellent for biking, hanging in the grass, relaxing, or people watching. I would often bike in the bike path in the mornings before work. friends and i celebrated easter in the grass by decorating eggs and drinking beer. celebrated a friends birthday there as well. "
A handy spot for drinks and snacks on a budget,I don't really see the beauty here but it's certainly quieter and more relaxing than most of the city. If the nearby bars are threatening to stretch your budget you can buy drinks in the 7-Eleven where they have tables and chairs outside by the river.
Any time of the year worth to visit ,"As I'm overlooking the park daily from home I can only recommend to visit the park.There are sooo many activities one can do, there will be one for you.During the cherry blossom season the Yeoido island section is good, near Ichon the basketball courts, rollerskating tracks, bicycle renting place, waterskying centre, soccer and camping grounds, sailing school and all Korean sports grounds are well visited from spring till autumn. Throughout the year the place is well visited for cycling and walking. The endless cycling paths at both sides of the Han-river give you plenty of opportunities and all are well maintained. Various location provide open air swimming pools in summer. Also evenings along the river shall not be forgotten such as cruises on the river from Yeoido to the fountains of Banpo bridge or a simple picnic (don't forget the chicken and soju) anywhere along the river."
So beautiful,"This park is really beautiful with a coffee shop near the riverside. Because of the strong wind in late autumn, I went inside and ordered a coffee. The view was so peaceful. Should visit here to enjoy the fresh air. Out of the coffee shop, there a nice park that u can walk around for sightseeing."
Splendid Park,Despite it being a drizzly day we still enjoy strolling around the park and taking in the sights along the river as well as the beauty of the cherry blossoms. There is so much activity going on and must be especially wonderful on a sunny day. 
Great example of urban regeneration,Great for a riverside walk or a biking round. Nothing stunning to see but the night lights look bright enough.
Walk along Hangang River so Relaxing,"if u love walking, hangang park is suitable for u. u can walk along hangang river or rent bicycle. when i was there, can see some uncle auntie (ahjushi ahjuma) exercise under road flyover. there have a space that build up with gym equipment. so people who coming there, they can fully utilize their time with exercise."
BEAUTIFUL! ,Hangang Park is definitely the best place for couples and to do tandeum bike riding. We were extremely lucky to have perfect clear weather while we were there. My partner and i enjoyed cycling along the Han river and admiring the awesome view it has got to offer. Definitely one of the best memories made from our trip in Korea. 
Stunning Hangang River,Do rent a bike to stroll along the riverside to enjoy the scenic view of Hangang River. It could be nice if you have enough time to come back for fireworks from one of it bridge 
TO RELAX,"I went to this place with my friend last summer. They have bike rental which is very good for people to just relax and do some sports. I went back again during last autumn and it was chilly. When I first came here, I was so happy because you can't really find a decent park in Korea. They do have, but not as I expected. I highly recommend this to someone who loves picnic, some me-time, cycling... Enjoy!"
Best place for a run !!!,"Running beside the han river is a wonderful way to enjoy seoul !!!!! small shops, water and bike stations ( in case they you are tired of running) are available along the route. If the weather allows you can have a picnic too ... love this place"
Winter Picnic at Hangang Park,"It was unforgettable yet fun experience. I went there with my mom and a friend on winter in the end of December. We want to walk around but we didn't eat anything before we leave, so we decided to buy a food at a seven eleven and eat it on a bench. The wind blows so hard and the pigeons try to steal some food from em. So I eat and tried to make the pigeons leave"
Great for Picnic!-THE GOOD AND NEED TO IMPROVE,"THE GOODWe brought food, a cloth to sit, and had a picnic. It is really wonderful to watch han river and the sun set. After your tiring day you can just relax here and play. They have a comfort room, a cafe, and you can even rent a bicycle. They also have a playground/gym for kids and kids at heart.NEED TO IMPROVEI hope there are street food there."
"Beautiful, but maybe more so in summer!","This is a lovely park with fantastic views of the Seoul skyline, but maybe plan to go in summer. This past weekend was too cold to be out long enough to enjoy it! "
Nice view,Nice view over Seoul skyline. Very calm and quiet by the bank of the river. Floating artificial island nearby. Superb water show Apr/Oct. Very nice walk.
Han Sell & Great Tell,"What a boon. For those that were here in the late 1990s - before this park existed - it's a transformation and introduction of public space. In particular the ""Nanji"" section on the north west river bank near Mapo and the World Cup Stadium, is well cared for. Cycle tracks are great for old and young alike. It's a huge space along the river. "
Rollerblading,Went there to learn rollerblade. There are rollerblades and bicycles for rent. Also popular among locals to have a picnic. Main spot of fireworks festival every year.
"Summer - yes, winter - no!","Not easy to get here. Good for a stroll in warmer times... I have been here in the summer and it is a great area to spend a day picnicking, swimming in the pools, jogging, walking around, etc. Walk to the colourful water bridge in the evenings... but in the winter months is is fairly dull and lifeless..."
Sailing on hangang river,"Even thought it was winter, we can go on the cruise and sailing on hangang river. The tour guide gave the Information in 3 languages: korea, chinese, and english. So no worry about the language. It is a good experience seeing so many things during the river trip. The park is also beautiful, some people were playing kite on the afternoon."
Beautifull view to enjoy seoul,"My friend explain that in past this is a suicide place, the South Korea government develop this area to give positive passion for the people."
"Great evening of shopping, people watching and fun","This was a lovely park, with stunning night and lights views. Right by the river, it was bustling the whole time, with lots of young people. "
Cool and relaxing,"Visited here with my boyfriend. There wasn't much people when we visited, so we are able to enjoy the scenery and the cold wind. While taking a walk around the park, we noticed some youngsters riding bicycles, skateboarding, rollerblading, etc. There are also couples and families. Convenient stores and cafe are nearby the park. It is nice to have a warm or hot drink in this cold weather after a walk. Must visit this park once when you are in Korea. To get here, you can take the subway and alight at Yeouinaru station (여의나루역), exit 2. Walk out of the station and the park is at the right hand side."
Cool river park,There is parking available as well as public transportation. We found plenty to do and the atmosphere was great. 
best spot for couples/families,"Went there in the evening, plenty of couples and families there. Enjoyed the scenery at night & definitely worth a visit"
Pretty and Relaxung,"Miles and miles of park extend along the Han river as it rolls through the city. This where Seoul locals go to relax. You can go lay out your picnic blanket or even sun tarp, and spend the afternoon sunning yourself, or playing games. But if the weather is nice you need to be prepared to share your little piece of green grass with the other 13 million residents of Seoul."
a cold morning,been here last december. it was a freezing day. i'm glad that there were less people when i went because i was able to appreciate the park in a more serene way.
"Chicken and beer along the river, what more could you want?","One of my favorite things to do in Seoul is to have a picnic at one of the Han River Parks. Two of my favorite ones are Yeoido and Banpo Han River park. Spring and Fall are the best times to visit cause of the warm weather. Bring a mat (although you could buy one at the park) get some beer at the convenience store and order chicken (there are many people passing out flyers) to be delivered to your spot. You can ride a bike (there are many rental spots), take a nice stroll along the river, play basketball, play lawn sports (Frisbee, badminton, catch), exercise with the equipment or just eat and nap under the sun and cool breeze. There is usually bus and subway access to the major Han River park spots. Seriously one of the best things to do in Seoul."
"Relaxing attraction, biking and sightseeing","I came here during spring (nearly summer) and it's just the best time to visit here because the weather is just soooo warm~ I came to Yeouido Park and it's really accessible from subway station. Once you arrived, you could rent a bike with cheap fee and it would really help you since you dont need to walk far to the Han Gang riverside. The riverside view is just amazzzzinggly breathtaking! No wonder many dramas used this location for shooting. The park is clean and many families came here to swim in the pools near the river. Durinh spring, there are many beautiful flowers and no one bother to ruin these flowers❤️ as expected from Korea. "
BEST PLACE EVER FOR PICNIC,"i went many times to this place when I was living in korea. First, its safe like all the places in seoul. Second, you will find all types of people including families, teenagers,kids and foreigners."
Great bike trails,"Excellent network of bicycling trails, but watch out for inattentive riders (who often seem to wear earbuds). This park stretches the length of the Han River in Seoul. If coming for a short visit, stop by the park near Yeouinaru Subway Station or near Mapo Bridge. These are great areas to fly a kite on a windy day. There are convenience stores up and down the river path, so one is never far from a snack. "
Picnics and Riverside Walks,"As a former resident of Seoul for 4 years, Hangang Park was a wonderful mix of entertainment and solace. Its banks are lined with walkways for both pleasure and exercise circuits, and there are countless parks for picnics and other such gatherings. Especially during the warmer months, city festivals and events are often held for the public. The Banpo Bridge Rainbow is one example of how the city brings nature's beauty and man's creativity together for social enjoyment. A walk under the cherry blossoms next to the 63 Building by Yeoido Park always makes for a lovely spring afternoon. A visit to Hangang Park is a must on your next trip to Seoul!"
Seouls Central Park,"Hangang park runs along Seoul's Han River. The river that seperates the older from the newer side of the city. The Park was revamped a few years ago and the end result is exactly what a crowded city needed. A place to jog, bike, roller blade, play basketball, fly kites or just relax. The best part is that there's always cheap parking and plenty of space to cut loose. Thata because the park pretty much runs along a good stretch of the river so its huge. "
Best in the world,the park built alongside the river is probably the best of its kind in the world. a visit to Seoul without a visit to the riverside promenades would be a shame. I always wonder why the city can't promote the river and the parks (in which it invested so much money) as its symbols more aggressively.
A Place to Decompress in Seoul,"If you're planning your first trip to Seoul I must warn you about Bali, Bali - hurry, hurry. Be ready for people running up the escalators or the moving walkways. People dive into the closing subway doors. Shopping? Be ready for impatient and pushy sales people. Don't get me wrong, Seoul is an amazing city and you should go there, but just be ready. So, what to do with all the rushing and breakneck pace? God to Hangang Park and walk along the beautiful Han River. You will have all you need to see, beautiful cityscapes, glistening river views, and beautiful gardens. Take a break from Bali, Bali at Hangang Park."
Great place for afternoon walk or night stroll,"came here to see rainbow bridge and it was beautiful. best time to come is in the afternoon, even though it's tend to get crowded especially in weekends."
A place to chill out,"After watching this magnificent river from Running Man a few times, I guess its really as nice as watching the show. Its a great river back with stools and grassplain for people to chill out. Bicycles available for rent too! I suggest to rent a bicycle (3000 won/hour) and enjoy the river bank to the fullest! Since its autumn, Its a great experience cycling in cool windy riverbankRecommended place to go!"
"Great breeze, nice place to hang out.","Loved it! Chill place to hang out with people, especially with your family! Doesn't need to spend a penny on it. Highly recommended!"
Great view,"You can walk at this place with family, friends, your lover or anyone you want. This place got really excellent view especially at night."
Cycling by the HAN river,"It was a crowded place and the lane was a bit narrow though however my wife and I had great fun cycling on tandem bike.. It was a bit chill but the view was good enough for me ...this was where the block buster movie ""the host"" was shots...so its kind of nice to be in the film site....it was clean and well maintained but again too crowded..."
Please exclude this if you're going in winter,"It's quite a walk from the Metro station to this park. The fountain only opens from April to October. If you're visiting this in the winter, you still can sit in the park for picnic but you wont get to enjoy the fountain show at night.At night is somewhat quite road to walk from the Metro station to the park. It's better you bring along a partner with you."
"Walking, running, cycling","And of course, enjoying the view of this island, especially if you know it used to be a huge military airport (& turning into a new financial & broadcasting hub of Seoul by now). I was there in last winter & the freeze is unforgettable as well."
Nice area but a bit run down,"The parking the Han river banks offers a really nice view on Seoul's skyline and the many bridges across the wide river. You can walk around the whole island of Yeong. Maybe because it is October, the park appears to be a bit run down and not well kept. Quite a lot of waste was on the lawn and the walkways. "
My favorite place in Seoul,"Whether you want to rent a bike and cross from Seoul east to west or just pick a spot a set your tent to have a nice meal under the sun or have fun while doing some water skiing, kayaking, speeding with the water bikes or to take a simply 30-40 minutes walk looking at the runners, the bikers, the sleepers, the baseball players and all of those who pass by the Hangang river is the location to do it. Go down on one of many subway stations beside the hangang river, choose your method and direction and start enjoying what it should be a GREAT day!"
Stay fit and pass by!,"Nice place for jogging/biking. Very peaceful if you are looking for some private time. It's good to see many locals getting together and meeting after sunset. Cheers,"
"Healing place in the middle of the City, Seoul by the Han river side","You can stroll alone when you feel lonely or exercise for your good health both on foot or bike rides.During the weekend, many families come out altogether for a change and sun bath etc. just like those in Central Park in NYC, USA."
Nothing much to do here,"After struggle with the map to get to the park, we found that there is nothing much happening here apart from the Banpo Bridge Show.The show itself it also a disappointment as there is no 'wow' factor at all.Not worth to come."
Very peaceful and relaxing,This park stretches a long way and is definitely an excellent place to jog / exercise. Very peaceful environment and provides a great view! Definitely the place to be if you want to avoid the crowd for a little while in the morning / afternoon!
Oasis in Seoul,"Hangang Park is a beautiful oasis in Seoul, you feel like in a different world. Considering Seoul is such a huge and busy city this park is really like an oasis. You can go for a stroll, have a coffee at the floating island, rent a bike and just enjoy the day. The park is definitely worth a visit."
Nice place to chill & relax,"We love that the whole atmosphere was very chillax and enjoyable, particularly in the evening/night. Many people cycle/jog/walk their dogs/picnic there. If you want to have a korean experience, may I suggest to buy friend chicken & beer to enjoy by the Hangang?"
Great park to spend time at night!,"The park is stunning at night, you can see the rainbow water from the bridge which is stunning. Sometime there is a free concerts at night which is also fun. There are 2 hugh resturants complex which you can enjoy various foods. Great to spend time watching the lights of the buidlings too.. Stunning !"
Best for family bonding,"The park is huge and alot of things to do. My family enjoyed riding our rented bikes and strolling afterwards. Well maintained gardens, water parks, bike lanes and fountains can be seen. You can even want to fly your kites here. Restrooms and tents are also offered. You can even delivered your food wherever you are in the park. Some ahjummas are giving flyers of menu and deals of their respective restaurants. However, we get our food in one of the convenient stores in the area.,"
Wonderful river,"If you like cycling, skating, walking or just enjoying nature a trip along the Han River would be perfect for you. You can rent a bike and enjoy a leisurely ride along the river. There is a cool breeze on most days. During the summer and on special occasions the park will be filled with people who are day camping and enjoying fireworks. "
Be mesmerised by the rainbow music play ,"The highlight of the park is the rainbow musical performance which only played at 3 timings at night. My gal pal and I didn't take the boat to cruise the river. We had taken the train and walk a fair bit of distance to reach the destination. Although the temperature then was 14degree Celsius, we didn't notice the chill. The music and water performance were mesmerising. It was one of the highlights of the trip in Seoul. :) "
Surprisingly peaceful,"Walk from the Lotte World Shopping Mall in a straight line to the Han River and find yourself transported in a different world, away from the hubbub and along a surprisingly quiet river mid afternoon. There are earmarked areas for exercising and for resting along the river as well as paths for joggers and cyclists. Beware of the massive pelotons you may see now and again (we counted well over 120!). Here you can see wildlife (fish of course, egrets, wild flowers) and admire the symmetry of bridges from below or the reflection of the underground bridge in the water.These are not manicured gardens, this is countryside in the middle of a city."
Nice park with beautiful view,"The Han river is nice place to walk with beautiful view. In the morning, this place is usually very quiet and so nice to walk. But it can be a little bit noisy nearby 6~8p.m. at sakura season especially in Youido. I like this place especailly before 6p.m. I enjoy to walk or take a bicycle in this place. You can rent a bicycle in some places in this park."
Seoul's Pride,"The best thing about Seoul is it has free, beautiful, well maintained river parks along the Han river. It is like the Malecon for Cubans for people in Seoul. You will see many chilling under shades, playing sports and riding bicycles. Stroll around and blend in."
Avoid if you have breathing problems.,"Standard river stroll. Although quieter than the city, the air pollution from the adjoining Highway makes strolling along this path unenjoyable. There was a free musical performance on Sunday."
Rent a bike & enjoy the scenery,"Rent the bicycles & enjoy the ride along the riverfront. Gorgeous view of the city. There are cruises from the pier but you must check their timings. If they don't have at least ten people, they will cancel the cruise."
Escape the Madness,A nice place to go when you want to escape the beautiful madness of Gangnam or Myeondong. It's great for picnics or to just go walking. The current trend (2015) is to head there in the evening with friends or a date and have fried chicken and beer. 
A place to be,"My favorite place to be when in Seoul! Great views, happy atmosphere, excellent for both spontaneous or planned picnic. "
Great Place !,Great place for different activities1 From swimming camping jogging relaxing walking and of course biking
Great place to be ,"Lovely place post sunset , definitely great scenic beauty and lovely breeze - add to that the lively atmosphere of an amphitheatre with lots of families flocking that area "
Nice riverside walk,"Lovely views across the river but not many facilities, the only cafe we passed was closed. Did enjoy the free exercise area."
Hangang Park in Spring,Love the park and was lucky to have caught the cherry blossoms.Will pop by next time with the kids of a picnic
Wonderful area to visit by the river,"Wonderful park to walk around in. We found an outdoor rock climbing wall, bike paths, cafes and restaurants and a campground off the river. The tents were reasonably priced (free WiFi was also available for the campers) and a bbq area and coffee shop. A great place to stroll by the river, relax, picnic or camp!"
Take your blanket and chill,"This was a nice relaxing spot to visit. Very crowded, but I love people watching so that did not bother me. We laid on our pad and chilled, hung out, and ate ice cream!"
Nice Park,Nice park however was a little disappointing going in evening for lights and view -- Nice park for romantic evening with spouse 
A relaxing riverside walk or cycling,You can spend a relaxing time walking along Hangang Park.The best time for walking the park would be spring as you can admire the flowers planted along the sides of the parks
A nice place to chill,"For those expecting this place to be lively during normal days, you are definitely going to be disappointed but this place is where most Koreans have their daily exercise or yearly marathon but if you are looking to have a slow walk with your love ones or just to chill with your family while enjoying the breeze, this place is just right. You will see old couple having slow walks but if you are lucky enough to be at the right location of the Hangang park (Yes, the river is very long) you might encounter celebrities jogging. Although you may enjoy the boat rides across the river by paying a few thousand won."
Nice riverside spot,"Coming from a city with some of the most diverse architecture in the world, the views of Seoul at Hangang Park can seem almost dystopian, but in an odd way that lends something to the experience. The park is a great place to relax at the riverside or take a cruise down the Han."
Check out Nearest Park,"There are numerous Hangang Park along the Han River. You must check out Nearest Park. Personally I like Jamwon Park most, because it is less crowded than other park."
An excellent way to get out ,I enjoy walking down that's very long stretch of Beautiful greenery; that is to say it's nice to get out of the city and enjoy being on this path you see many people good reviews and it's a relaxing time
Away from city centre,"This is rather a long stretch of green place with all the facilities suitable for the young and old to hang out, relax and exercise. You would realise cycling is rather popular as lots of cyclists can be seen even on a hot summer. If you are travelling and wish to get away from the city, this is one of the places to consider."
"Walk, Jog, Bike, Stroll,...It's a great place!","We love living near Hangang Park. It is miles and miles of pedestrian and cycling paths along both sides of the Han River. There are playgrounds, fitness areas, sport courts, 7-11 cafes, and yes...toilets all along the river. During the summer, there are fireworks by the Banpo Bridge each weekend. A great way to spend the morning, afternoon, or evening. "
Daily Commute,"I lived off this park. I attended school nearby, but lived around 30-45 minutes away when taking a car or metro; however, on days where I had to stay late, I made sure to drop by hangang park and sometimes even walk the entire 3-hour distance home by the riverside. I love rivers and parks in general, having a park by the hangang river is great."
Seoul's green lung,"Those who say that Seoul lacks greenspace don't spend enough time at the riverside. Walking and biking paths line both sides of the Han River for tens of kilometers. There are several stations along the way where bicycles can be rented for an hourly fee, which I highly recommend. Apart from walking and biking, cafes and restaurants are placed at intervals, and there are also larger amusement complexes, such as Ttuksseom Resort. As a resident of Seoul, I like to visit the riverside park as often as I can, but I think it's also a good thing for casual visitors to do at least once."
Relaxing Park,Nice place to go to an pack a picnic and very beautiful and peaceful place to ride your bike in a safe environment. They have a restaurant and a place to drink coffee so you can enjoy the view. 
"Relatively quiet in the fall and winter due to the cold, but unlike the romantic hype attached to it","I tend to remove the romanticism attached to this park and the surrounding area from it, because it is actually rather bland and mostly meant for a day out with family or friends during summer and spring. In the cold fall and winter, you can consider going here, but the biting wind will mean that you cannot stay for long under the draft, and will be likely to catch a cold. During the cherry blossom festival in Seoul though, you will be likely to catch the sight of the cherry blossoms, along with many other tourists from within the country and foreign tourists too. "
Addicted to this place!,When I was in Korea I went to this place 3 until 4 times a week. A perfect spot for spending your time with friends and having evening bike or stroll. The river is magnificent when the sun comes down. 
Great place to relax,You can relax and enjoy your free time around the HAN riverespecially the night view is so beautiful
visit and get the boat tour,"not much to see, but the garden with river view and city view couldn't nice without boat tour. so you must jump to the boat and get the tour. it is nice."
Great for cycling,There are paths for pedestrian and cyclist/skaters along the river. You can enjoy the view and play sports like basketball at the courts. Great place to relax and workout. The place is nicely revamped with wooden walkways at some areas.
BEAUTIFUL,It was the best! The Park was green and awesome! It's perfect for camping. It's a great place for biking. Have fun!!!
Fun biking,We loved biking along the river. Free bikes from the LotteWorld station allowed us to see the river and all the recreation opportunities available there to Seoul residents. 
Cherry blossom near hangang park,Worth to go in spring to enjoy the cherry blossom surrounding you... Along the side walking a short distance from train station and enjoy the view of the sea and blowing of winds!
"Worth to see, Worth to walk","This is one of the best areas of Seoul, Korea. I walked there for 3-4 hours with my friend. Very well-decorated , neat-clean though crowded. It is a great place for camping and picnic. There is a rainbow-fountain bridge that works in evening to night at a 30 minutes interval"
Loved it,"Rent a bike and go along the river, its pretty awesome!Seeing Koreans camp and enjoy the water was great site.I also got to play basketballs with some locals in the huge playground area next to the bike rental stand."
Not to die for.,"Hangang park is fine for a weeknight stroll, but for the true nature lover it's just another city park. The breeze off the river is lovely in the hotter months, but if you're only in Korea for a short stay, try to get to one of the stunning national parks in the area. Otherwise, good for running/walking in the evenings and early mornings when it's less busy."
Lovely space for recreation and relaxation in a busy city,"Had a lovely time exploring the stretch of the river, on bicycle, from Yeouido all the way eastwards to Seoul Forest. A great way to enjoy urban nature. The area along the Han River is essentially recreational space made up of many different public parks and other facilities, ranging from benches to playing courts to fitness equipment, toilets & convenience stores You'll need many repeat visits to enjoy the charms of the various parks dotting the riverside and exploring the 40 km stretch. Only thing is that it's not yet fully tourist friendly. I was not able to find an English map of the biking trails and other info on the facilities. I also faced difficulty getting the guy at the bicycle shop to understand and agree to my request of renting a bike along one part of the river and returning it to another station. Eventually sorted it out thanks to translation services by Tourist Hotline #1330. "
Rent bikes and bike along the Han!,My wife and I rented bikes and rode along the Han for a couple hours. Definitely a worthwhile and cheap activity on a nice day. And gives you a good opportunity to see a lot of Seoul - and the really cool gyms on the river!
Sunset paradise,"Hangang park is like Seoul's backyard. I think that since people live in apartment buildings, they don't really have a place to play outside so this is it. There are many people around but that's what makes it awesome: they are mostly Koreans, not tourists. Relax by Hangang and get a glimpse of Seoul from a Korean perspective.People go there to have picnics, eat delicioud fried chicken and beer (chimek), do bicycling, skateboarding (growing slowly in popularity), in-line skating, walking, or if you're with a special someone, to just sit together in the grass and enjoy the view. Best enjoyed at sunset :)To get there, go to Yeouinaru station, for the Yeouido Hangang park."
Athletes listen up!,"This is not only a great place to chill out and enjoy the scenery but also a great place to become active by renting a bike or going for a run along the riverside. There are also outdoor gym machines for a quick workout, on a nice day this is a good place to be!"
Views of the river are spectacular.,You can rent bikes to ride on the 50km of trail or relax and enjoy the view of the water. Its very romantic after dark. Its very safe too.
Romantic and interesting place,"Relaxing place with friend! Also you can order junk food delivery until over 2am, which was very interesting.Rainbow fountain show was also something! I've never seen that kind artificial one in my life. Anyway good memory, worth to visit!"
Hangang Park,"Many have already noted how relaxing it can be to visit, so I think I might mirror their reviews because it really is. There are various parks along the river, and if you are looking for a specific activity (boat rides, rainbow light show~~~ etc.), you should do your research beforehand. Still, the park is beautiful and a great place to see!"
Great place to relax if you don't mind the crowds,"On the river in Yeouido, Hangang Park is nice for the whole family but gets crowded on the weekends."
hangang bridge light show,we are waiting for the bridge water light show around 8pm to 9pm. very beautiful and only for selected time and season. 
Park in the Heart of the City,"We had great time in Hangang Park. I personally enjoyed the cool breeze and smell of fresh air and the running water which allows visitors to dip their feet. Unfortunately we visited the park hours before our flight. I wish we had visited it earlier. In the park you can also enjoy biking , which we were not able to do due to time constraints. But over all it's a good view of Han River as well. "
The Definitive Seoul Experience,"Walking along the Han River in Hangang Park is the quintessential Seoul experience and the best way to see the city. Sure, it's not a clean river, but walking or biking along the river offers some of the best views of the city besides Namsam. "
Cycling @ Hangang Park,"It was a nice place for relaxing, photo-taking, friends and families to get together for a picnic and even cycling."
Nice park for a picnic and cycling,The park is located in the middle of the city. It is a perfect spot for families and couple to have a picnic and leisure activities such as cycling. Most people are here with chicken and beer for gatherings. Good place to chill and relax. Plenty of chicken and beer stalls.
Nice,"Just nice, but the ubiquitous piped music is too much, especially at the volume at which it is played near the ferry departure points. Don't bother taking the ferry trip. It is too short and commentary is rubbish. Also very tacky. You'll get the same views and photos from the water's edge."
"Grass, glass and steel","This park has many interesting features. Except being park itself, two big landmarks can be found there. First is Rainbow fountain. Check show times, there are not that many. Show lasts for about 20 minutes. It's not very colorful with naked eye though. Second interesting places is floating islands. Impressive example of modern architechure of organic design. They really make you say ""Wow!"". Fantastic views after sunset. On island themselves there is pretty much nothing except couple of cafes and one small souvenir shop. Floating islands are must see!"
Great to pass by,"There are multiple Parks by the Hangang river ... hence, the review will vary according to the Park visited/ passed by... "
Romantic and peaceful,"I love this park. The scenery is peaceful and serene. You can have a date by riding a couple bicycle, rollerblading, picnic, dip our feet in a cold stream, playong kites, eat ramyun and enjoy a live band. "
leisure and relax,"Its place to relax, camping, cycling, exercise and jogging. Its the best family park i've been to. When were there, there's a live band played near the stage next to the river."
Wide open space next to clean big river!!!,Beautiful place to relax...buy a kite and fly it there or rent some bicycles...roller blades..loads of outdoor fun...mats for ground picnic will be a great suggestion if you want to have picnic by the huge riverside with beautiful view of the bridges and city skyline......
"It is beautiful, but watch out for nature.","The park is nice and spacious. It is a great place for a picnic or beers with friends (there is a convenience shop if you want to buy stuff there). However, if you'd like to find a shady spot under a tree, look out for many bugs and pooping birds. They really got me!"
Beautiful night view,"The park is the site of many Hangang attractions, including the Banpo Moonlight Rainbow Fountain, Moonlight Square and 3 , floating islets. The rainbow colored fountain composed of 200 lights, unfolds on both sides of the bridge, which is 570m long. With the fountain's total length reaching 1140m when both sides are included, the fountain is recognized by the Guiness Book of World Records as the world's longest bridge fountain. The fountain's water jets are dynamic and can moved in time to music creating spectacular ever changing displays. We visited on a Saturday and there was also a display of fireworks, lighting up the sky. We could also see N Seoul tower from where we were seated. Then we proceeded to visit the 3 floating islets which was brightly lighted up. There are many restaurants , cafes and a souvenir shop"
Sweet retreat from the city traffic,"A short walk from the buzz of Garuso-gil. Great place for a picnic or just sit and enjoy the vistas along the Han River. There are quite a few floating restaurants which make for popular haunts for night dining.It's not a ""pretty"" park with ornate, manicured gardens. But nonetheless a nice respite from the traffic.A popular bike trail stretches along the river. Great place to people-watch!"
Lovely Spot for a Picnic,"This is the place to go if there is nice weather. It's so much fun to pack a picnic and sit out on the grass enjoying the weather and people watching. From the south side of the river, you get a beautiful view of the city on the north side, with Namsan Tower popping out among the high rises."
Great day and night hangout,"There are a few parks along the river to choose from, with Yeouido Park and Banpo Park being two of the most popular. You can rent a basketball, a bike, set up a tent or simply walk around enjoying the river. It's beautiful at night as well. Lots of couples and families walking around when the weather is nice. Just be prepared, sometimes it can smell awful, like the day we went. "
Nice Garden,Plenty of flowers and Sakura everywhere in this garden. Good for camping with family and friends. Stroll around and feel the fresh air..
Cherry blossom festival,Cherry blossoms are everywhere and on most streets but are concentrated around here. Locals flock here for picnics and to camp. Worth a visit!
Beautiful and serene,"Rent a bicycle and take a ride around the hangang river, beautiful sights and flower gardens along the way. "
beautiful blossoms,nice sunset and beautiful view of the hangangdisliked the crowds along the row of sakura trees though
Beautiful night view,"A good riverside park during the day and night but the night view on the other side is simply great , even a great place to hang out with friends, if you like to walk, jog or simply bike you will have a pleasant time here."
Perfect for a stroll or bike ride,"The most famous area is Bampo but there's so much more to discover and enjoy. There are cycling (rental shops in several locations) and walking paths along the river and tributaries. There's also outdoor exercising equipment, football fields, inline skating spots and so much more. It's more enjoyable on week days since it can get crowded on weekends when the weather is nice and people bring tents, tables and chairs for picnicking. "
place to chill,"I went at night. The night light of Seoul on the other side of the river is mesmerising.There are many locals there, hanging out with friends, and it really is a good place to be after a long day of walking in Seoul."
Favorite place for late afternoon strolls,"With the Han river next to you, it's a great place for a relaxing stroll with dogs, biking, jogging, and just hanging out. "
Riverside Park, Day or night the view is quite nice and the bike and walking paths are well maintained. There isn't much else to it other than that. I've enjoyed the park as a daily place for walking during an extended stay but I'm not sure I would make it a tourist destination during a trip. 
Night view is better,Actually nothing is really interesting here except the park or bike tracks along the Han river but when I went there at night the view is quite amazing. You can see the colorful namsan tower from distance and the view is quite romantic. You can get a cup of coffee and enjoy the view I think that's worth to try.
"Great to run, bike, eat chimek, or impromptu yoga","Popular area and easy access to paths that are fantastic for running, biking (you can even rent bikes), or grab some chicken and beer and head to the river to catch up with friends. Great area to hang out alone or with others!"
Great Place to Spend a Summer Afternoon/Evening,"Hanging out at the park along the Han river was one of our favorite things to do in Seoul. It is a very popular place for all kinds of recreation and leisure. You'll see just about anything and everything happening at certain places along the park. For a quick visit I would recommend a stroll along the walking paths or renting a bicycle and taking a ride. There are certain places for free bike rentals, and many places where you can pay just a few dollars per hour to rent a bike.But frankly, the best part of the park is to get some friends, food, a few beers or bottles of Makgeolli, and watch the sun go down over the city. The place really gets going after dark as the crowds begin to change from families to college students and young couples. There are convenience stores dotted all around the parks selling basic food and drinks, and if you can speak enough Korean you can even get all kinds of food delivered. As far as I know you can be there as late as you want and pretty much get as drunk as you want. Literally the only thing it seems you are not allowed to do is tie things to a tree (so much for our hammock purchase.)If you have the time when visiting Seoul I would say that this is absolutely a must do. You will truly get a window into the lifestyle in Seoul. This is definitely not a tourist attraction. It is really what people in Seoul do on a regular basis. I am getting very nostalgic just thinking about it right now.Although you can access the park in many places all along the river I think two of the best and most poplar areas to hang out with easy access would be at Ttukkseom Resort and Yeouido."
Escape the city,My favourite place in Seoul. I love the river parks and the cycle paths that span the length of the river on both banks. You can literally cycle all day if you want. Then stop off for a rest or a work out at the many exercise stations along the river. The paths are well maintained and are constantly been extended. 
A peek at Korean leisure life,"I'm glad I came here on the last day of my visit to Seoul.Many days at tourist area, shopping area and city, the first place I experience Korean with their leisure life - couple sitting side by side chatting, lone person sitting by the river looking at the view, youngsters in group having fun, family picnic, etc. A place where some Korean drama and program took place but I can only recognize some."
Great place to unwind with friends!,"I was here for the Fireworks Festival and it was amazing! Although it got super chilly towards late evening, my friends and I got a superb view of the fireworks and met an incredible bunch of locals who were kind enough to share their mats, blankets and food with us. While waiting for the fireworks to officially commence, we had a splendid time chatting with the people around us. A day well spent at the park! On another occasion, we decided to have a fried chicken party at the park in the late evening. We ordered and waited for our fried chicken delivery off the road (literally) and devoured the yummy spread near the river. There's so much to do at the park! Find a nice and comfortable spot and you could easily spend a couple of hours behind a book or simply people watch."
Now you can spend evening at parks watching Hangang (Han river),"there are several Hangang parks along the Hnagang so you have many choices in both north and south side of the river.Parks are well made in terms of location and environment but parking is not free anymore and it is hard to access without a car.Bicycle trails and walking trails are good but food stands are very annoying with trash problems.On sunny day, this is a good place to go and relax and perhaps some exercise will make you feel better.Only the problem is the adjacent roads (88), it is very noisy and the air quality is not great, so mindful about that."
Good views,"Just beside the Han river, the park is rather tranquil and quiet if you know what time to go there. I once saw KPop star IU there. It really is a great place to chill out."
Must see place!,"Nice and chilled out place. There are bunch of stuff that u can do here, water sport, fishing, rides, night cruse, cycling and so on.."
Near 63 Building,"Take the Subway to Yeouinaru Station.Go there if you want to take the Hangang Cruise.if you want to experience banpo moonlight, the event start in April to October every year. It was a very quiet place. nothing much around the open area.i rent a bicycle and round the place after that walk and cross the road to go to 63 Building"
Quiet Park to relax and take photo.,Take the Subway to Yeouinaru Station. I went there to take the Hangang Cruise. It was a very quiet place. nothing much around the open area. Need not purposely plan to go there unless you are to take the cruise
Love this place,"I like kdramas... Hangang park is one of the most places they used to picture korean people's life, a place to relieve stress... Well it's right indeed... I went to the park near jamsil area.. It was very comfortable to just walking around... At night, u can enjoy the citylights... Some people even still jogging and cycling at the park.. Few restaurants were there too to have dinner or just have coffee and snacks while enjoying the fresh air and view... For those who wants a calm place in the middle of seoul, i recommend this place.."
There are actually many Hangang parks,"Great to walk along the river, ride a bike or just indulge yourself.The banks have been beautifully renovated, they are very convinient.Great for families, friends, couples..."
Peaceful Respite; Great Place to Run,"If you have spent much time in Seoul, you know it's difficult to have room to breathe and stretch your legs. As a runner, I find Seoul one of the more challenging places to run due to the traffic, the pollution, the hills and an absence of other runners. Hangang River Park is a great place to get away from it all and go for a stroll, bike ride or a run. This is especially the case on a warmer winter day (I assume it's a lot more crowded in the spring).My in laws live in Kangnam (south of the river), so I find it easiest to enter the park from the Express Bus Terminal, near the Banpo Bridge. I have run in both directions from there, west and east, for as long as I've wanted to (up to 12 miles) and in any case, have always been able to run further if I had wanted to. I encounter bikers, walkers and the rare fellow runner. The path is paved and well-maintained. As others have indicated, there are stretches where the path runs under the Olympic Expressway that are somewhat less pleasant, although on a hot day or in the rain I would welcome these stretches. The park has evolved over the years, with new bridges, landscaping and paths sprouting up every time I visit.A few suggestions:1. Watch out for ice! I have taken a few spills here on cold days. Stay away from the painted areas of the path.2. Run, bike or walk in the direction indicated. The path is generally straight but there are semi-blind turns.3. Bring your own water. As this is Seoul, there are no shortage of convenience stores. There's one near the Banpo bridge but I have always picked up a bottle in the Kangnam Undeground Shopping Center.4. You can get to the park from the Express Bus (Kosok) Terminal and walk through the Underground Shopping Center. If you look hard there are signs...exit 8-1 or 8-2 if memory serves me right.Once you are done chilling in the park you can venture back to Central City or Shinsegae and rejoin civilization!"
Scenic,The visit to the place is a must if you are looking for a place that can be a bit far from all the hustle and bustle with a serene air and views. The park basically overlooks the Han River and is good for a quick stroll and even picnics. I though loved the place for being able to rest and a have a peaceful time from all the city exploration. 
"An interesting development, still a work in progress","Hangang Park aims to revitalize the River Banks with parks, fountains, bike trails, nautical parks, etc... Outdoor junkies will find it very enjoyable. Development is greater along a few areas: Yeouido, Banpo, Ichon, Jayangdong... This is indeed a very ambitious project, but it still feels bland at time, empty at others, uninteresting at others (ie. riding a bike underneath an expressway interchange). This is the result of decades of history and urban planning. The Korean War has cut off the Han river from its estuary, reducing traffic on the river in Seoul. The width of the river itself (about 1km) discourages walking by or across the Han. Finally, urbanization turned its back on the Han, with bustling areas near the river facing away from the river (Yeouido Financial District, Apgujeong, Sangam, Ichon)... Most of the buildings near the river are still aging apartment complex (the infamous ""commie blocks""), with commercial areas a bit farther away from the river. However, this is still a step in the right direction. The park can be especially interesting in the Summer Days (when swimming pools are set up), or on special events (such as festivals or fireworks). New developments should help make the area more interesting (such as Saevit Islands) down the road. In any case, try to visit it, be in only for the view of the skyline across the river."
Great biking trail!!!,"This place is SO great. I can't even begin..So me and my friends went here during sunset. We saw a lot of groups and couples. They were out on picnics and dates. We keep hearing songs and music. People were singing, chatting and drinking. You know, being merry.♧ We just decided to lounge around and take it all in. It was a bit late for a bike ride.I returned 3 days later at 7 am. The bike stand was not yet open so I decided to get meatball soup and ooyoo at a nearby convenience store. Bike ride was amazing, one of the best I've been. It was a gorgeous day in mid May, the sun was out, the morning wind was still crisp and a little chilly and, the best part of all, the flowers were blooming. I remember seeing roses on the wall and daisies and lavenders and thank god I went a the right moment. There were tons of lovely parks and bridges and areas along the way. I loved going under the bridges on this trail. They were big and gorgeous and so is the river. Go to Hangang!!! ♡ This place is a must. It's great for both solo and group trips!! ☆☆☆☆☆"
Picnic.,"I came here with my friends and we had a picnic.We could also rent bicycle at 3,000won.It is a good and cheap place to spend time !"
A lovely walk,"I ended up here by accident, but I'm glad I did. It was refreshing to have a walk along the river, and the views of the city were gorgeous. I only wish I couldn't hear the traffic so much! It was otherwise a great escape from the bustle of city life."
Lack of sign board,I visited the park at night. Its pretty dark with very little signboard. I just had to find our way to the han river cruise by sightings of foreigners. The cruise was decent and we strolled around the bay area.
Nothing much at night,"we went for a stroll at night looking for the cafes that were recommended online. Not only we couldn't find the cafes, we had to walk almost an hour in the drizzle before we reached some cafes. The paths were not very lighted up and there was nothing much to see and do if one goes at night."
"Hard to find , little to see.","Admittedly was winter but no activity accept 2 fitness stations. Not enough signage to find way to the park, all amongst some huge freeways. Does not take advantage of riverside area"
A walk to remember..,South Korea is known to have a lot of recreational places and Hangang Park would be one of it. Its big and so many activities to look forward. Nice!
If you enjoy picinicing by the motorway...,"I must be spoilt because there is nothing ""refreshing"" or ""oasis-like"" to me about the Hangang Park. Sorry Seoulites, this is admittedly a welcome stretch of space for cyclists and pedestrians in a city that prioritises automobilists but it is not a park in the European sense. It is nice to look at the city from the riverside but if you are looking for some relief from the stress of the city I would head to one of the mountains instead. It is quiet noisy due to the 4 lane motorways running either side of it plus the bridge traffic."
Scenic Han River,"The Han River is a major river in Korea & was used as a trade route to China in the past playing an important role in Korean history. Presently,its lower stretches are lined with pedestrian walkways, bike paths, public parks and restaurants and it is voted as the second most scenic area in Seoul next to Namsan.Hangang Park is a representative people's park located by the Han River. It is a large area complete with sports facilities & areas for relaxation. Many come for strolling , jogging & biking. There are also in-line skaters, soccer fields,basketball & volleyball courts. It is especially beautiful in the evenings because of the lights from the bridges, the buildings & the streets."
Refreshing,"a refreshing oasis admits the hustle and bustle of Seoul. The efforts of the Seoul,metropolitan government in keeping this waterway clean is definitely obvious and appreciated."
hangang river cruise,we went for a firework cruise. the cruise was fine but there are not enough seats and we have to stand during almost 1 hour trip..sigh!! we are ok but it just that our little daughter were not comfortable
Something relaxing at night time,"A good place to hangout for a little while at night. You can walk around the park, or just chill by the river and watch the musical water fountain. My kids liked it too. Will go again if I ever visit Seoul again."
nice place with friends,"korean always spend time here with their friends, eat chicken and have beer, chatting each other~ u can see music fountain here at night, but we spend 3 days to wait for the fountain, i dont know why it didn't work. people riding bike here so be careful. whatever, u will enjoy this place~ i went here on June, but it is a little bit cold at night, so bring warm cloth when u walk around the bridge."
Good place to go gallivanting,"I think this place is pretty cool just to look around and stroll about. Clears your head a lotIn the night (summer), you can find descent amount of people having a beer with their friends. Actually really wanted to join in but couldn't haha. https://plus.google.com/u/4/b/106023067131637354979/106023067131637354979/postsvisit my blog to find more places to go in Seoul"
It is actually a coastal road rather than a park,"It is a huge park by the Hangang river and it has a nice walking and biking road. The remaining part of the park is usually isolated. no trees, not so much green area."
Best way to escape the city for a bit,"I have spent many enjoyable days at this park. There are always so many people out enjoying the nice weather, having picnics, riding bikes or just strolling along the river. It's a nice way to enjoy the skyline while still feeling like you've escaped the craziness of the city for a bit."
amazing,"a great place in any season and any time of day or night,picnic, swimming pool,cycling, cafes, recommend it!"
Cruise the han,The cruise is very recommended. I would say a daytime or latest dusk time is the best.I did a night time cruise which I enjoyed but there is much more to see during the day. You can also head to building 63 (nearby) after you're done.
"Picnic, cycling and sightseeing!","Excellent place to have a picnic with friends and family by rolling out a mat or setting up a tent. If you feel like sweating it out, rent a bike and cycle along the Han River and enjoy the view of the park and skyscrapers of Seoul!"
Nice at night time,"Enjoyed watching the fountain show and listening to music. Had a nice evening walk there. A bit distant though, and there were no cafes or restaurants nearby."
Amazing place,Han River has great view with nice park. It is especially good for couple activities. And cycling is also recommended.
It's a nice park.,"This park basically gets a lot of nice view, especially at nite. If u wanna see more beauties of this river, I recommend u take the tour boat and enjoy the view there. Btw, it's good to go there at evening or nite."
Quiet!.. Except for the fireworks competition!,Went here for the October Fireworks extravaganza. It was cheek-to-jowl! 2 hrs before we got a small place on an embankment. 7.30pm fireworks were awesome from the park. We loved it and left 08.45 pm. It was Very dangerous though with police having great difficulty channeling thousand of people across narrow bridges. It was scary. I can imagine a real problem and serious accident here if things do not improve....
If your are tired of the city,This park is between a Highway and a river. Not really calm because of the Highway. But to have a calmer walk this could be a good place. I have enjoy it. At the end of the park you will find the National cemetery that is impressive
Visited during Seoul International Fireworks Festival,"It's a big party atmosphere when we visited so this may not be representative. Bought some roasted chicken, oranges etc from the street hawkers and have a picnic with the crowd before the fireworks display. Extremely crowded but I guess it will be mostly empty without the festival. Good for picnic in cool weather."
Nice park,"Good place where locals hang out and relax. Comfortable park on a nice day, just near the water, great cafe near by. Many people sitting on the grass, friends, lovers, families.People riding bicycles along the path, quiet. Clean."
very nice river at night,people were very kind even if they didnt speak chinese. we were in south area. 
Beautiful,"Beautiful park to stroll in, or cycle, especially at night. Very nice views of the river and bridges. "
Escape from the city,"A friend took me to dinner in Hongdae and then brought me on a stroll here. Very nice walk by the river in autumn, just a stone's throw from the city. I'll consider trying water sports here next time (in warmer weather)!"
A lazy or active time in the park,This park is great for walking around or to relax at one of the benches. Bike rental available at reasonable price. The park has a biking track. The roads are flat and easy to bike. Enjoy the view on the Han river. Hawkers and small 7-11 around the park for refreshments after a long walk or bike track. 
Perfect place for Road biking,"Do u like cycling, jogging, running? Or just hanging out with friends or lover? Perfect place for u is here.Park around Han river is really peaceful and nice place to working out or just chatting with others.And there is a popular water skiing shop so if you like water leisure, stop by there and enjoy yourself.Water skiing is $15 per each( just 1time).A little bit expensive cause it's around 15minutes per time but really exciting.Anyway everything is awesome here.Come and have fun."
Nice view but sandy park,The grass were patchy not really an ideal place for a picnic but saw many locals setting up picnic there. Nice view though.
Great for the family,"Easy to access, and has a beautiful view of the river. The park is well kept, clean and a lot of fun.Bikes and Tandem bikes are up for rent at cheap rates (3,000 won per hour for a single bike) and make for a great way to explore quickly.The playground included a lot of interesting installations which even I had fun playing. All in all, a great place to have a picnic, enjoy a Monday (because everything else is closed), and have a blast."
Biking along the Han River was awesome,We rented bikes (US$25 for 2 bikes for 3 hours) and road 18 miles. We could have gone much further on the dedicated bike paths. We highly recommend this!
The life of Seoul,"A neat and clean environment with all facilities, one may need as a traveler or any local person love an evening outing with fun, sports,cycling or dining."
Hangang River View,"If you want a quiet place with your friends or with your partner, this is one place to go. You can relax and enjoy the view. There is also a place where you can jog or ride the bicycle for those who are physically active. :)"
Love it.,"I live near the stretch of Hangang Park so I come here pretty often.It is a comfortable place for you to enjoy a stroll or if you come in the morning/afternoon, you can rent a bicycle at 3,000won.At night, it is more lively as a picnic area with a lot of koreans eating chicken and camping here. Lawn is pretty clean as everyone is laying around it.To be cautious : There are a lot of mosquitoes especially around Summer."
Perfect for a weekend walk,More water than Ive seen in Beijing for a long time. Rent a bike and check out the nice bridge design. Lots of 7-11 stores along the bike path to get some snacks and fluid.
So relaxing!,"One of the best places to enjoy snack / food / chicken & beer with your friends, sitting on mat while enjoying the view. :) About 20 minutes by bus from Sinchon / Hongdae area."
"Picturesque enough,Good place for couples","Braved the cold wind and made it here with my friend. Lovely Hangang River view, you get the feeling when couples meet on bridges over a river. Nice place to escape from the buzz of Seoul shopping and chill at the nearby cafe for a good sunset view"
Love it!,Love the bytes and the river cruise! Great places for picnic too!The lawn looks clean and there are bicycles rental. 
Banpo bridge water show,It is a fantastic sight to go to for a picnic during the day and during the night to see the bridge water show. It starts from 8 pm for 15 min and every 30 min. Highly recommended! Here is how it looks like both day and night:http://youtu.be/GM7dUzwkFXgHope this helps!
An ocean of calm,Got here at about 12am on a rainy July night. We were out at meetings the whole day and by the time I got back to the Hotel it was well past 10pm... I had 3 days in Seoul and wanted to maximise on what could be seenThere is a covenience store on the banks of the Han river (Han - the river name Gang - the word for river)Found open wifi too - IPTIME and spent some time talking to folks back homeThe views across the river (on to the North banks (NSould Tower etc)) were beautiful
A great park for a long bicycle ride or jogging,"This park provides a stunning view of the city from the river side (Han river). There are trails and the only bicycle road in Seoul. It stretches several kilometres, but there are facilities at your disposal at regular intervals. Also drinking water fountains and some 7-elevens will be on the way.We rented a tandem bike close to Yeouinaru station, line 5, exit 2 and walk straight for 2-3 minutes. The price was 6000 for the first hour and then 1000 for every additional 15 minutes. Half the price for a regular bike."
Beatuiful park,"The park is a peacefull place in the middle of the big city, close to Itewon. Very beautiful trees and flowers. Nicely made with paths that are easy to use even with a baby. Very clean and neat."
Sports and outdoor activities.,"There is a beautiful path along the Han River, a walk of about 45 minutes. I was very fascinated to this fantastic place as they have been able to exploit this park and the river itself. A pleasant walk watching all those people playing sports and outdoor activities. All in all it worth a stroll through it."
A highlight of our trip,"You might not think there are places like this in the crowded city of Seoul, yet there are many such oasis as this one where you can retreat for a day. It was very popular with local people and travelers alike. Hangang Park (Han River Park) is beautiful and well maintained.The park reminds me a little of Golden Gate park in San Francisco, except this one is not quite as populated by trees and you still see sky scrapers in the distance and occasional reminders that you are still in a big city. Even so, it is a peaceful place to relax and see friendly local people. There are many things to do, and you can take short routes or long routes for walking. If you go down to Banpo bridge, you will see the Rainbow Fountain lights after dark. Also pleasant at night is the varied color lighting of the trails and trees. The Koreans have done a nice job on this park. In some spots there are places to get something to eat, or perhaps order food and have it delivered to the park, Seoul has many such places that do this.It's easy to get there from inexpensive taxi ride or convenient to the subway system. About the only time you would probably not enjoy it is during the rainy season of course. And if you go in the winter, you better keep moving and bundle up with clothes. This trip was a nicer one because it was in June before the rainy season and not yet too hot or humid.Bikes for rental at inexpensive prices... about 3,000 KRW for first hour and 500 KRW each hour after that. You might want to do this on your first trip to cover more ground and see more things. As a tourist, remember to stay out of the bikes lane and into the walk lane, In most cases, they are right next to each other, so it is easy to become distracted and walk into the bike lane. While most biker's come along at a leisurely pace, you occasionally are passed by someone who thinks he is in a race to win money! If traveling by car, there is not a lot of parking, yet we had no trouble getting in there and the price for park is inexpensive.Summary is that it is one of the nicer parks we have visited around the world. The high rating from most people is due to the combination of many aspects of the park. Clean, beautiful, enjoying, and several things to do. It's worth your time to visit at least once."
A super place to visit!,"This park is a very large area on the banks of the Han River. There is so much to see there. Like most of South Korea they have special walkways, bicycle paths etc, as well as plenty of seating just to sit and watch the world go by. At the one end one can board a ferry that sails along the Han, and this too is well worth while to do. There are places to eat all along the way. It is very easy to get a cab to take you there or home again. One just has to phone!! A great place to visit on a clear day, in summer or winter."
A Great Area to Burn a Few Calories,"I am visiting family in Korea. The Hangang (means Han River) Park is less than a five-minute walk from my brother-in-law's house. I have been here 27 days now and use the park almost daily. The ""Park"" is quite long (more than 15 km) along the north side of the Han River. I like the exercise location along the walking/bike riding/roller blade areas. The also have tennis courts, basketball courts, picnic area, camping areas, sitting areas, Nature trails, etc., along the walk. It's very pleasant. I've seen lots of Koreans using all facets of the park. It's a nice get-away from the city (Seoul) which you happen to actually be in the middle of. Very relaxing."
Beautiful greenery in a huge city,Nice to escape the city rush and walk along the walk boards through parts if this park... it feels like a place out of the city when you are actually smack bang in the middle
Great for outdoor activities!,We spent most of our time walking and riding bikes which we were not able to do back home. The park was clean and people were also friendly.
Along the River,"Great view on the city and a nice way to ""go out of the city"". Even though you're in the middle of Seoul, it feels fresh and nice there. The park is actually the area next to the main river of Seoul (Han River). You can access to Han River by a lot of places but the most famous one is probably Yeouido (Yeouinaru Station, line number 5). You can also go to Ttukseom Resort if you are in this area.There, you can just have a walk, ride a bike or even do some camping! Koreans love to go there with their friends, order some chicken (the delivery guy will come next to the river!), sit on the grass and just chill. Usually I like to go there by bike and just enjoy a nice ride. There are a lot of places where you can rent a bike. You'll need to leave an ID and pay 3000won for the first hour. Then if you return your bike after more than one hour, it will cost you 500won per 15 minutes. You can also cross most of the bridges with your bike. On the side, they have specific bike lanes, the view from there is amazing. I particularly recommend to cross Mapo Bridge or Sogang Bridge.If you go untill the Banpo bridge, you can see the Rainbow Fountain show. The schedule is as follow :* Weekdays: 12:00, 20:00, 21:00 * Weekends: 12:00, 17:00, 19:30 (July & August only), 20:00, 20:30, 21:00, 21:30"
lots of facilities at Ttukseom Resort,"The parks along Seoul's Hangang are a great place to relax. The Hangang park in reality is a collection of areas all along the river Han. My favourite spot is the one accessed from Ttukseom Resort subway station (exit 2 or 3). It is nice in all seasons and from here I saw an amazing sunset in winter however in summer it transforms into an activity hub. All facilities are easily located near the station. Just outside the station you can find a bicycle rental place (you just need to leave an ID at the counter, pay the first hour: 3000 won, and then 500 won for every additional half hour when you return the bike) with the bike you can then cycle on the well maintained cycle path all along the river. It is a nice way to see the city from the river. Here you will also find an outdoor climbing wall, a skate park with ramps, and a number of watersports (wakeboarding/water skiing, windsurfing, kitesurfing, SUP). There is also a swimming pool which should be open from June onwards. It is quieter during the week; if you go on a sunny weekend it is better to go in the morning as it can get quite busy. The Hangang park in Yeouido instead is the place to go for the cherry blossom in spring."
Best evening walk with great view of Seoul along the river,"Has been here twice and yet still stunning with the nice atmosphere surrounding. An area full of young people and couples spent time together camping on the park, jogging, cycling, and near to ferry cruise to sightseeing beautiful Seoul from Han river especially at night."
Nice place to soak up the summer sun in Seoul,"If you have got some time to kill in Seoul and want a nice place to relax in the sun, then check out Hangang park in the spring, summer or Autumn. There are large grassy areas to sit on, a stream and a large pond which is interactive public art you are allowed to swim in, and bicycle paths and bicycles for hire. Once you have had enough of the park, you can head to Building 63 (aka City 63) and get a birds eye view of the city. More info and lots of pictures in my blog.http://gdaykorea.blogspot.kr/2014/05/seoul-hanggang-park-bicycles-building-63.html"
Awesome Park!,I love visiting this park for picnics or just going for bike rides along the river. You can rent bikes at various places and get refreshments at various stores dotted along the river on both sides. Its a great summer's day hangout spot.
Nice walk along the river,"It is not so much a park but a long promenade along the shore of the Hangang river. It would be nice day out if weather is fine. Frankly speaking the view of the two sides of the river and the bridges spanning across the river are not very spectacular and also there are not many facilities such as cafes, viewing points, pavillion, shops that you can rest during the walk. Could be quite dusty when there is strong wind. Felt that the park is half-finished and facilities can be improved. Quite some locals have picnic or lunch or running there as weather was good and cool at the time I visited. There are bikes for rental and this may be a better idea if you wish to finish the whole path. "
Breath taking,"away from the city is a long walk along the han river.We wanted to try the cafe there. We thought it was a proper restaurant for dinner, but it was normal cafe with good view, ended we didn't try.but the view was amazing."
Beautiful,"Hangang Park is beautiful and very peaceful. They have walking and bike paths that span the river, and many areas to sit. The views of Seoul are also nice. It's a nice place to get away from the bustle of the city and to just sit back and relax! I visited the Park where there are two floating restaurants near Garosu-gil, and that was the best! They have public restrooms and there is also a 7-11 if you need snacks while there. They also have food delivery right to where you're sitting in the Park. You definitely have to visit the Han when in Seoul!"
Exercise by the Riverside,"Following along the bank of the Han River, this park offers ample activities for the fitness inclined. Spring is the best time to visit. After the biting cold of winter and preceeding the sweaty heat of summer, springtime invites Seoulites of all ages out to enjoy the sunshine. Families and couples picnic on the grass, while Ajumas and Ajashis exercise on the myriad machines underneath the highway. The smooth, level path entices cyclists to ride down its length, rain or shine. All in all, a very enjoyable experience, particularly on a warm spring day."
Great place to..,"Do sports, ride a bike, have a picnic and lots more.Now that the warm winds of spring are approaching a lot of Koreans go there especially in the weekends to unwind from the stress of working long hours. There are convenient stores so if you need some drinks or food you can get it right there(gangnam side of han river).Also they have the outdoor gym which is great for pre workout warm up and after for stretching."
just for a river view and nothing more,"This river park is good for long term stay visitors for jogging and walk in the river park, and for cycling if you are cycle mania.however, this park lacks clear division between walkers and cyclists so that there is a possible collision between the walkers and the cyclists."
"Cool on a weekday, awesome on the weekends",Bands and solo singers alike will come to Hongdae park to perform and you can join in the crowd and enjoy the music.
Sammy,Oh ! Wonderful day for me . I hope will comeback comming soon . I love korea and nature frome korea .
Disappointing in Winter!,"My family took the subway to Oksu station last night, and were greatly disappointed with the barren landscape of the so-called Hangang Park. The stretch of the Hangang Park we walked along from Oksu to the next subway station was more of a parallel cycling & walking pathways, peppered with a couple of exercise & children playground. Rather poor representation of a park & nothing scenic about it. Perhaps there would be a bit more greenery & a better representation of a park."
Good walking place,"I and my family just walk and enjoy during visiting this place,..the walking path, bike path are also very good.taking picture and the river being a background was beautiful.Do not forget to have noodles and enjoy a cup of coffee during relaxing and enjoy the spring.keep walking."
walk in night,"I can walk in the night, beautiful image there, clean water also the little fountain for some pictures"
Nice place to stroll,This is a long strech so I suggest choose a specific location. 63 building has a nice park where you can take a cruise or enjoy a bicycle or simply take a stroll. They also have j bug park and part with floating islands which until now is still closed.
Ideal for couples,"Would love to lay a mat, open a bottle of wine on the grass patch and enjoy the buskers performance on a cold autumn night."
lantern festival,"I've been so lucky to be in Seoul during the lantern festival and it has been a treat. In the night all this colourful walk ( little chilly but charming), we were all excited like children.. great"
Outside soul crowd,"If u feel boring and wanna get out, u can bring mat ,pillow,beer and dont forget plastic bag and tissue, in 7-midnight, get the perfect place than sit there , i want to share my experience drink end enjoy river than sleep there ,i try thats once time, my korea. Friends suggest me sleep there, first time i just thing its a crazy thing sleep outside,especially public space,in the case in my country no ones sleep it out in public space especially a woman, but in korea is safer , i also put my ipad and mobile phone and no ones taking in, u should try is drink till sleep there and see sunrise , Amazing!!! Cool experience !!"
Best and easiest place to get away from the city for a little bit.,"The Hangang banks have been transformed over the past few years and there are great walking paths, benches to sit on and outdoor exercise facilities for anyone. There are bike rental locations and fountains to watch. A great place to get away from the city a bit while still being in the city."
Watch old people work out like beasts lol,"The great thing about Hangang Park is that there are a million ways to get there because it travels throughout Seoul. The first time I went there, I was actually wandering and had gotten lost and ended up by one of the entrances. It's a great place for walking and exercise, as well as other activities, but my title says it all haha: the elderly in Korea are serious about their work outs! It's quite inspiring for a young, lazy person as myself, who drives everywhere. Anyhow, my second time here was for the annual fireworks show. The place was packed! I think it's necessary that everyone who goes to Seoul, go to Hangang, just because it's ""The Han."""
Great park for picnic,"The transformation of Seoul is the most noticeable around Hangang Park. There are bike trails, hiking trails, and picnic area next to the river. There are 10 or 11 bridges on Hangang River connecting Seoul to other cities."
Enjoy the sunny breeze and relax by the Han river,"Went on a Sunny but cool day, with the comforting cool breeze it is a perfect place for you to chill out the whole day, perhaps throw a baseball around with your friend. Lots of locals around and feel free to take a river cruise to see the beautiful scenery of the Han River"
Relax and Enjoy Seoul!,yup! when you get tired after walking so many miles.. go to hangang park! you can see around and relax.. ah! i just experienced it!
Seoul modern life style,"For me, this is a must in Seoul. Many people, families, couples, and tourists came here for many activities. I rent a bike for a good ride in the park. And if it was warmer, I could have rent a tent for a picnic. The scene of the river was beautiful. And by the night time come, lights’ reflection on the water made the park a very romantic scene. Many couples would be around at this time of the day, so don’t just go there alone."
Stroll along the Han River or Bike if you like?,"Personally, i like to go here in the fall when its not so crowded during the week, the weekends is always a popular place for everyone to gather. There are miles and miles of bike trails and if you are into biking than this is the place for you, bike rental places are all over the place and you can rent by the hour and time flies when you start to bike along the river. If you prefer to walk there are alot of trails that take you close to the river and great place for couples to take pictures and families to bring a mat and have a picnic. Its relaxing and enjoyable but spring and summer are really crowded so pick and choose the time to go. I have never been at night so i dont know how it changes but during the day until sunset is a great place for a place to chill and take a breather!!"
Where drunks and couples gather,"Way to kill the romantic night strolls with drunks lying and stumbling around, reeking with cheap alcohol. The night view is good, however, the day would be better with more activities and sober people."
First cycling trip along the Han River,"I am a keen cyclist and wanted to see a different side to Seoul / Korea from that I normally experience. I found a shop with high quality road bikes to rent (Ritte / Shimano Groupset / Reynolds carbon fibre wheels) and headed off. Getting to the cycle paths by the river felt a bit hazardous and was not much fun, but once you are on them it is safe and relatively flat. The first day I cycled from Seoul to Yangpyeong and back,the second day up to Bukhansan National Park. I particularly enjoyed the old railways paths. In the confines of the park in Seoul there is plenty to see and do, but the paths are also quite busy with other bike users and pedestrians, not all of whom appear to have much awareness of other path users- you need to keep your wits about you. As you head out there are plenty of restaurants / stalls to keep up hydration and energy levelsand people very friendly. All in all, it was a great experience, that I have no hesitation recommending."
Lovely Friday afternoon,"This is a lovely park that has stunning views of the Han River. Bring your mat, pad, or tent to relax out on the rolling grass hills."
lovely park,"Nice place to hangout with either friends or family. It's best to come here on weekdays as it might be too crowded on weekends.Bike rental will cost you about 3000won per hour. My friends and i went there at about 12 in the afternoon, and surprisingly there were quite a number of people at hangang park (jogging, cycling, etc...). Anyhoo, if cycling is not your thing, you can stroll around or even ride cruises."
Great park with rental bikes,"My husband and I love this park! We rented a tandem bike for $6,000 won per hour and rode along the Hangang River. It was a great way to see the city and give our exhausted feet a rest. A plus is that the back person on the tandem bike can also take photos! The rental bike shop if off the Bundang Line, exit 2 (note that this line may not be in the old metro map). There are gardens, outside gyms, volleyball courts, bat mitten nets, a rock climbing wall facility, a roller skate park, and convenient stores along the bike path. We enjoyed the breeze, watching the locals, and stopping along the way to soak in the scenery. Highly recommended!!! Even if you don't like biking, I would recommend that you check out the park for its facilities (fountains, playgrounds, deer zoo, etc)."
Yeouido Hangang Park,Hangang Park is crowded during weekends especially Sunday afternoon. A good place for family outing and picnic. Beautiful place for cycling too. Hangang Park is less than 5 minutes walk away from Yeouido Church and a minute walk to the subway station.Read more on my blog.http://loveanqila.blogspot.sg/2013/08/travelogue-yeouido-hangang-park.html
Excellent park!,"You can rent bikes and ride the trail up or downstream.... it's a perfect place for a picnic, or great stretch of green for a friendly game. The backdrop of the city across the river also make a great spot for taking photos"
Relaxing lovely enjoyable space,"We went primarily to do a boat cruise - which we did and thoroughly enjoyed the 1 hr return trip, great fun and highly recommended! But the park area is lovely! Clean beautiful space that goes for miles by the river Busy with cyclists picnics and loads of people chilling out! Lots of eating and drinking options and bike hire if feeling energetic! My son who is 7 loved it and had a ball playing in a great playground with Korean kids who made him really welcome despite no EnglishGreat fun place"
Summer Time ~ Picnic!,"Bike rental were available at 3,000 Won per hour. Cheap and good. Loads of kids and elderly having picnic and playing water by the river. It would be better at weekend night with light shows and fountain performance."
Taking a chill pill,"An awesome place to go when you want to just relax from the busy life of Seoul. Great place for all travelers, whether you go as couples, family, friends, solo, or even business people. Just sit down and relax while watching the water, and maybe order something to eat while you're at it. Take a moment to enjoy the scenery and relax, or maybe go take a walk along the river. It's a safe place for families with younger children to just let them go and run around. But remember to come back after the sun sets too (but it may be a bit crowded as more people come). This place is just amazing at night and has the perfect atmosphere for every occasion. So take a short break from your traveling and just take a seat."
Have a rest and simply chill,"Hangang Park is simply so big that you see different happenings and people when you visit a different stretch of the long winding road along the river. During the evening you can see tons of locals either coming to Hangang to cycle or simply chill while admiring the beautiful river at night. Not to mention the tons of flyers advertising fried chicken and pizza given out once one exits the closest station to the river : Yeouinaru station. Went there thrice in total - Had fried chicken with friends sitting on the boardwalk along the river on my first time. That's the area where most people simply eat and chill, with the occasional busker playing and singing along to a nice little ditty. Had fried chicken again on my second visit, but this time monsoon season had struck and the river bank apparently was overflooded. The boardwalk now had disappeared and police patrols were advising civilians to go back home. Still had a great time though. Landed up at the cycling path of the river on my final visit, arrived from the bridge connecting Seoul Forest to the park. Tons of cycling enthusiasts and people jogging along the path at night. A definite must visit for travellers and tourists. If you have a penchant for beautiful sceneries and simply hanging out."
just a park next to the river,"the lane for cyclist, jogger is a bit narrow and the space for picnickers is limited. Good thing is it's not crowded and they provide food delivery in the park!"
perfect for a walk or jog,"This park is great if you enjoy walking or jogging. It gets crowded in the evening with everyone coming here to walk their dog, or for dates to see the Banpo bridge rainbow. There are also no places to rent a bike, or even sit in the shade, but it's a pleasant park, very clean, there is exercising equipment, and you can walk/jog/bike a decent distance without going in circles. "
Great place to hangout,The hangang park is beautifully made and is extremely clean and well maintained. It has a lot of people cycling around and strolling to enjoy the evening. 
Better at Night,The park is more romantic with the lights at night. You can have a picnic or ride a bike while you're there. 
bustling with enerby,"Rent a bicycle for a great ride. The water is brown, but the people are bustling with energy, and you get a sense that the park was designed for enjoyment for all."
lovely place,"a lovely place for walking & visiting at first introduce with Korea (Seoul). There are a lot of interesting sights at park such as Banpo bridge, floating island, cruise trip along the river Hangang & so on."
Cherry Trees in Full Bloom,We were lucky to be at Hangang Park when the cherry trees were in bloom. A beautiful spring day with people riding tahndem bicycles and rollerblading.
Nice for a short walk,"I walked along here both at night and during the day with my husband. At nighttime it was nice to see all the Korean couples holding hands (Koreans seem more romantic than Americans, constantly holding hands but never making out) walking along the trail, and during the day it was nice to see school groups."
A place to relax and exercise ^^,"I came here almost every night with my friends during our 3 week stay in Seoul. In the morning, you get to see downtown Seoul across the Han River and just relax in under the sun. In the evening, there's a few live performances (we walked into a live rock concert!) families and friends exercising (outdoor gym equipment (free) & bikes for rental) It's walking distance from the metro station, 63 building, lots of street food carts, and local cafes."
Wonderful place to walk or run along HAN river,"The park was very clean and the walkways level and even for runners / bikers. They had separate sidewalks for pedestrians. At points, there were fountains and water features and other whimsical art works for children.. It stretched for miles along the waterfront."
AWESOME,This is a beautiful stretch of bike and walking trails along the Han River. You will see everything from the 63 (tallest building) to the colorful trees (spring) while you ride or run the path. Luckily this is where we choose to do out Semi-Annual Physical Fitness Test... WAY better than a track!!
A pleasant surprise,"The Han river stretches far and really wide at some parts.it is quite picturesque with a number of bridges spanning from one side of seoul to the other part.We went to the hangang park in yeouido..but,when taking the subway,stop at yeuoinaru.read and follow the exit signs for yeouido park.the park is just out by the exit.there is a cart selling drinks,snacks and worms(?) boiling in 2 huge pots.There are actually a number of parks,but,we chose yeouido for it's close proximity to the subway exit.for some parks,you have to walk from the exit to get to the park.It is beautiful..vast and wide..with the cityscape of seoul across ,and, also behind you.we got there around 4pm on a weekday in very early springtime..it was chilly and there were a few groups around.it was peaceful and just amazing.There's a Public toilet accessible by ramp,a small playground, benches, and shops where you can rent bikes from around 6000won to around 10000won per hour.there are kiddie bikes with trainer wheels,junior sized bikes, bikes for adults and tandem bikes. The bike shop is just right beside the mini playground.they will ask you to leave some identification if you want to get a bike.From where we were we counted 6 bridges that we can easily see.I would suggest this stop on your second trip to seoul, or on your first if you are staying long enough to make this stop without hurrying things up.This stop best taken slow and easy."
Banpo Brigde,"I went here at night, to see Banpo bridge rainbow show.There were many local people doing exercised here, or just hanging out with friends. At noon some local picnic here.The rainbow show only 15 minutes, but it was beautiful.Even I can see it when I still ride subway on the way to the bridge.One tourist attraction must see at Seoul. "
"Great views, great cycling",Park runs alongside the river in Seoul. In parts there are busy roads which also run alongside the river but the park is wide enough particularly on the south side that the road noise does not disturb. Great place to watch seoulites take their exercise and enjoy themselves- day or night. Several little snack places and shops in the park. Those on the south side are floating structures for when the river floods. 
Ttukseon Hangang Park in Winter,We went here during winter when they convert the swimming pool to a snow sled area.Good for both kids and adult to enjoy sledding and playing with snow if you dont have time to go to the ski resorts. Walking distance from the train station Ttukseom Resort
Good for cycling,Cycle tracks on both sides of the river take you from one end of the city to the other. There are also extensive cycle tracks along various smaller rivers.
A Spectacular View,"Last day in Korea,I planed to go Han river for an annual fireworks festival that started 7.00 PM but I came too early and no have time for keep waiting this show.....what a shame TT..... There're a lot of people from all around the city came here to see the fireworks.So I was only just riding bicycle along the river....such a best moment EVER!"
By the Han River,"This park is by the banks of the Hangang(Han River).Meticulously clean and safe, most parts of Seoul are low-crime areas, if not zero crime including this park.Even if you walk late at night, you feel safe strolling in the park."
musical water spray from bridge,"if you are looking for something out of normal trip,come to this banpo hangang park and watch the bridge become rainbowly color with music being played out.the show time could be vary and remember to do some homework before you come,the show will be cancel if raining.if you come here before sunset,you can walk around and it is a good place for exercise as well as photo session. the show take places about 20minutes."
Riverside Park,"Walked going to the park from MBC. being alone I was not impressed really, it's just a riverside park. Maybe If I have the time I may rent a bike and just enjoy the cool river breeze. I guess the views at night is great. May take the cruise next time from the park. "
Great park by the River,"This is a nice park where you can chill, hire a bicycle catch good views of the Han river, and you can catch a cruise day or even better, by night, from here. Cruises have live shows as well as going past the Banpo Bridge for its evening water and light display. "
"Nice, lots of locals jogging and hanging out.","Lovely to visit, take a slow stroll along the river to just destress or relax. You will find that there are many locals jogging in the park or just simply sitting around on mats and chatting, having a picnic etc."
Nice Place to Ride a Bike,Several places to rent Bicycles by the hour along the River. Many places to stop and grab a snack or just rest and take in the views.
Beautiful!,"Beautiful park and nice to walk around, enjoy the nice weather and view.You can rent bicycles too, but we did not do so as we did not have enough time as we took the cruise.We were there last week from Noryangin Market. We took a taxi to Hanggang Park that cost less than KRW5,000. We were there at around 5pm and took the cruise to view 8pm rainbow banpo bridge. Recomend for everyone who visit Seoul.The subway with elevator is just across the road from where the cruise is."
Nice Place For Rilexing,"Great area to do some sports.. Like a walk, bicycle, jog or just a picnic by the Han river. A bit far from subway station tho..."
Great place if you love jogging and walking!,If you like jogging this could be the place where to go while you are staying in Seoul. It is a 10km long path along the river. You can hear the traffic in the street but it is fine. The river allows for a nice view of Seoul. 
Biking in Hangang Park -kids and adults,"Come here if you are a biking enthusiast. Fantastic trail for biking. For kid, there is a Bike centre where your child can bike in an enclosure, trying variations of bikes. Tip: Long walk (25mins) from the nearest subway. Much better to go by the route past the shops then highway. Come only if you have time to spare, otherwise, a kid would prefer Lotte World"
park with river view,"we went there at night to catch the bridge glimpse ..banpo bridge with golden fountain ( check the show schedule)... i thinks its start around 4pm, with 2 hours interval).. Enjoying the park and walk along the river is very relaxing. the breathtaking river view ..we stay there until midnight....along with bunch of people ..really have a good time"
My Favorite Place in the World!,"Rent or borrow a bike and use the bike paths of Hangang Park to visit other places, think of it as the arterial system of the city, as many of the tributaries also have bike paths. One can bike the to the far reaches of the Seoul suburbs. If there is a river near an attraction, it is very likely you can use the paths to get there, the network has several hundred Km of paths. .The park itself is has 12 individual parks that range from Ancient tombs, to windsurfing and munificent modern art. Moreover, one can see Koreans using their little leisure time to enjoy themselves. From Unification church women doing traditional fan dances, to old men playing paduk, to some excellent music at one of the many performance areas. I lived in Seoul for three years, and this is my favorite place in the world One can really experience Seoul at this park"
Impressive job by Korea government,The whole cycling path is impressed. The have spent so much time building the whole park and everyone get to enjoy the view of Han's river as well as relax along the river. Good job!
Fantastic,Can spend an entire day out here. Hire bicycles and ride along the river. Very good cycle track. Lots of places to stop at and lots of places to eat at along the way. Could even spend some time at the pools that are available in the summer season. A must see
~Nice place to spend a relaxing few hours!!!,"~We spent a lovely afternoon here. We took an hour cruise down the Han River. Not much to see on the river but it was relaxing. We also took the swan boat out for 40 minutes (the kids enjoyed that). You can cycle, have a picnic, eat at one of the restaurants (the fried chicken at the swan rental place smelt good..LOL). Many photo ops with the statues and the Seoul skyline in the distance."
"Love the running, walking, cycling trails",Can be a bit crowded on weekends. Be careful of cyclists if u r a walker or runner. Be careful of walkers or runners if u r a cyclist.Great way to relax anytime of the dayLong trails. Can easily spend hours along the river
Pleasant stroll,"One of our hosts took me for a walk along the river and a boat cruise. It was quite pleasant, with paths for both pedestrians and cyclists, of whom there were many despite it being the middle of a week day. Small stores every so often selling drinks and snacks. Some of the locals were setting up tents for shade (not many trees). I'm told families will come there and call one of the local restaurants on their cell phones and the restaurant will deliver. Enjoyed a glass of citrus tea (tasted like sweetened marmalade) while waiting for the boat cruise. The hostess on the boat spoke in Korean and then put on recordings for English and, I believe Chinese, the time I was there--I assume other languages were available as well."
A relaxing break from city life!,"I was visiting in Seoul and was taken to Banpo park to enjoy a picnic and the water display with lights off the bridge. It was a lovely evening-- music playing, families, couples, friends, enjoying the great weather and the show of the water and colored lights off the bridge with the city of Seoul in the background. I highly recommend it!"
Waste of time,"Sadly this is what Koreans mostly call a park. Okay, its next to the river, it has some patches of grass, but almost no trees and is mostly concrete. Also, the river cruises which take off from here are very user unfriendly."
Biking by the Hanggang river,"Fantastic series of parks along the Han River - hire a bike for 3000Won for an hour and ride along any of these parks to escape some of the hustle. Good landscaping has made these parks very popular so you'll see Seoulites enjoying the urban outdoors, but there awe also many areas left to grow naturally."
Banpu Bridge,"Reached the park through Express Bus terminal station exit 8-1. I thought it the fountain show is 6pm but unfortunately was moved to 5pm. I was about 30 minutes late that time so I was not able to see the show. However, I did enjoy the view of the floating island and the people relaxing, exercising and biking at the park. Watched the sunset and then head home..Hope to catch the show next time.."
A great city asset,I love seeing people enjoying the outdoors and excericising. Hangang Park really celebrates the river which is so central to the city. It is well used by locals - there is still so much of it I am yet to explore.
"Great place for a run, bike or walk!",Hangang Park runs along with Han River and has a walking/bike path as well as lots of other things to see and do. It is a great place to take a walk or ride a bike (rentals available). I highly recommend it for anyone looking for something relaxing to do without the hustle and bustle of the city.
Must visit,"I would recommend this park, definitely. The view was absolutely breathtaking. Spend some time to sit at the park and enjoy the Hangang River too."
Lots to do!,For a small fee you can purchase a blanket (more like that shiny thing you put in your car windows in the summer) to sit on and just relax. Lots of people and activity. Lots of artists performing on the streets when I was there.
Beautiful,"In korea, every place is so beautiful. So as the hongang park. Hangang park exist in many place in seoul, just along the hangang(han river), if you are bored, go there walk for a while, bring some food to there for eat, is a kind of enjoyable."
Beautiful view at night all lit up from the room,"Beautiful view at night all lit up from the room, unfotuantely i did not have time to visit even though i here they have a awesome resteraunt up top."
Try the night river cruise -it's so romantic,"the fee is about krw14,000 (foreigner price). There's also some magic show inside the cruise. You can sit on the open air deck to observe Seoul's mesmerizing city view during night and see watershow (if lucky)--but avoid boarding during late autumn/winter (it's freezing!). You can also rent couple bike inside the park."
Except it is not open during off peak season!,"I was here in November the previous year. Totally enjoyed it. It was a beautiful display, with music and all but we were disappointed to find out that they are not open during the off season such as March."
Nice to get away from the city,"But, there is still a lot of traffic noise; the park is an afterthought from a river-front highway. The bike lanes are nice but crowded."
wonderful,"Its a nice place to walk or bike with friends and family. From here, you could see 63 building and hangang river. also can get to hangang cruise to refresh your mind with their sceneric park."
Great views all year round,"There are always a bunch of things happening around the Hangang River... hours of entertainment and happenings along this River... Camping sites, great for outdoor activities, biking along the river, Play baseball... the yearly fireworks festival... many music festivals...nightly cocktail cruises and a whole lot more has become home to the Hangang Park!"
Riverbank Biking,"The Hanggang Park is a bikers haven. Whether you have your own bike or decides to rent in the many bike rental shops along the park, it is just mind blowing to see the Han River in it's majestic beauty by pedaling. Bike rentals offer regular (3,000W) to premium (6,000) type of bikes per hour plus an additional (500W) for every 15 minutes thereof. There are dedicated running and bike lanes that make it safe for both runners and bikers. There are also distance markers on the road that make it easier for bikers to see how far they have biked. The elevation is not too bad and is pretty alright for newbie bikers and requires minimal to no gear shifting at all. The shops also provide tandem bikes if riding in tandem is what you prefer. The Hanggang Park is very accessible by Seoul Metro Line 5."
Great parkland skirting the Han River to exercise and relax,"I live nearby (+/- 1.5Km) from the Han River and I use this park to run in 3 to 4 times a week. It stretches for 30 - 40KMs along the river, with well established cycle and walking / running paths and on summer weekends it can get quite busy. Lots of exercise stations located in the park along the river with sports fields for a number of sports (soccer, Rugby, badmington etc). I belong to a running club that bases itself in the Ichon section of Hanggang Park and we run every Saturday morning a 5km and 10km course. Everyone is welcome to join us there. You can find our location where we meet at www.seoulflyers.com. We are one of many clubs that base their sporting activities in the Hangang Park."
Great for bicycle rides or walks,"The path along the Hangang stretches for many kms so it's an excellent place to go for a long bicycle ride. However, if you do you'll know why so many of the people on bicycles have bandanas covering their face. The pollution is pretty bad. But this is one of the best places in Seoul to exercise away from cars. Also every so often you'll see outside gym machines that you can exercise on."
Fun & relaxation in the middle of Seoul,Perfect place to just go and relax or have fun with kids. It does not feel like you are in the middle of the city.
American Football,"I have traveled to Seoul periodically over the last 8 years, to visit my son, who lives there. He and his buddies play American Football, and their usual venue is Hangang Park. A beautiful spot!"
beautiful scenery,it is great to cycle along Hangang! Fresh air accompanies superb scenery of buildings as well as the river itself.
Nice place for a walk,Great way to relax and get a little exercise at the same time
Banpo Hangang Park,"We arrived at the Banpo Hangang Park at about 6pm, 2 hours before the scheduled musical rainbow bridge show. A walk around the area is pretty relaxing. I would recommend this place for quality photo sessions.As the sun sets, the street lights are lit up along with the floating islands and the bridge, which is a beautiful sight. A lot of people does their evening exercises there. Ahjummas and ahjusshis brisk walking and there are bikers dressed in full gears cycling along the river. Some others would drop by in their working attire. I supposed, the came right after work.The Banpo part of Hangang Park is children friendly in the sense that there is a very big space for the children to run around. Do take a walk to the floating islands which are lit in technicolor. One of them has a restaurant upstairs where you can have a good view of the Banpo bridge.When the clock strikes 8, music started blaring from the speakers (which we could not find) and water was sprayed out of the undersides of the Banpo Bridge according to the rhythm. Really pretty.A great effort by the Seoul Government!"
My favourite day in South Korea was cycling along the Han,"Rent bikes, cross to the north bank of Mapo Bridge, cycle down the blue ramp, and find yourself on a pristine, flat cycle path running for miles alongside the beautiful Han river. We nodded cheerily at the locals cycling, walking, boating, fishing, playing competitive frisbee (complete with cheerleaders) and using the copious outdoor exercise equipment as we cycled along this serene, beautiful stretch of water in the heart of the city. A delight of an experience and my favourite activity in Seoul. (For further info, the Lonely Planet Korea guidebook describes this cycle.)"
nice recreational area...,"The Han River spans 500 plus kms and is 1km wide within the Seoul city limits. Along the banks of the river in Seoul, there are pedestrian walkways and bicycle paths on both sides. Various restaurants and cafes are located on these paths. Its a great recreation spot for locals and tourist. If you are a local you can even rent for free bicycles and its nice to cycle along the river and marvel at all the buildings on both sides.Its great place for exercise or just to pass the time. Suitable for people of all ages. You can also do some fishing or even ride a jet ski, if you have one that is. We cycled for like 9kms and spent around 3 hours. It was a nice experience."
Great place for kids,"We spent about an hour and a half on one afternoon just walking and playing along the Han river. It was a great place to run around--after sightseeing in Seoul, this was a great break. We found several playgrounds South/East of the river. It was fun to see what creative equipment Korean kids play on. There were even exercise machines on the playgrounds--my kids ages 7, 5, and 2 had a great time. The only downside--no real places to eat, so pack your own snacks and taxi to somewhere in Itaewon for dinner."
don't go there....nothing to see,"Basically...they will take you to cruise cross the bridges of Seoul...but nothing special with the bridges, only 1 bridge which has colorful lights (but absolutely not comparable with ""symphony of lights"" in HongkongQuite expensive too (went on 11Nov09, 8.10 PM Yeuido-Yeuido with 13,000 Won)"
