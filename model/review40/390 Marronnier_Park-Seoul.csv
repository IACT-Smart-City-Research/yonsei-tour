Small park,"I passed by this place when I exited from Hyehwa Station on my way to Naksan Park. It is a small park with open spaced stage for performance and a playground. Besides are the Arts Council Korea and Arko Art Centre. Park was quiet with a few locals sitting in the park. Nothing special, good to take a break and rest the legs before moving on."
Not much green space but live music,"When I went here, there was a live cello performance which was free by high school students. I would have stayed longer to listen but there were 2 other music performances in the square at the same time which was distracting so I left. I have heard live music is common, hopefully it is usually one performance at a time. Maybe if I try another time I will give a better review. As a previous reviewer said, it is a square, not really a park."
Lively place especially on weekends ,"I won’t say this to be a must visit place but for someone who is in Seoul for a considerable time, you can pass through this park on the way to Naksan park. It’s located just outside exit 2 of Hyewha station and has a lot many performances going on especially on weekends."
Marronier,Nice park in a college area. Lots of restaurants arounds. The Mural Village is pretty close up the hill
Marronnier Park,"Lovely place, especially when the foliage turns its colour. The park is in Hyehwa area which is famous for its vicinity to the university (daehak-ro/university road), theatres and cafes. Take metro to Hyehwa station, exit 2, and within a few minutes' walk is Marronnier Park."
If you're tired of walking,"The name of this place is Maronie ""Park"", but it's basically a square with some things to sit on. Next to this place loates Arco Art Theater or some restaurants and cafes. The round thing to sit on looks like a moon and it radiates, so visit there after sunset. Thete are lots of couples and friends chatting in nice atmosphere."
