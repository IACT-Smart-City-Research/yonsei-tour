Daegwanryeong Sheep Ranch,"This is a hiking trail which is fairly steep & sometimes slippery as as the walkway is covered with gravel > the walking course is circular & it is more slippery on the way down then up. this is a sheep farm but during our visit we saw about 50 sheeps feeding on grass in one sectioned off field & remaining field did not have any sheep except for about 20 sheeps in the feeding area. We were travelling with an elderly person & course was not suitable to walk together & the hills & trails are not suitable for wheel chair therefore had to wait in coffee shop. the admission price was Krw6,000/person including the grass to feed to sheep. Its good if you have children & want to let them see sheep close up & feed them but if you want to see large flock of sheeps then you will be disappointed. There is a good view of Pyeongchang area at the top of the hill. Its good for 1~2 hour visit."
Quick stop,"Worth a quick stop, come in the morning to beat the crowds. There is not much on display in terms of sheep, but a very nice walk trail is made within the park. "
Nice spot for a family trek,It's on a beautiful grounds with plenty of sheep to feed. There is a nice walking course. Not the best for strollers. 
Feed the sheep,Feeding the sheep and seeing the views is the main attraction of the place. It is not expensive and it is a nice hike around the grounds. Kids love it. 
Our toddler loves this place,"The views are fantastic. Sheep were wonderful. They are scattered on the hill. The sheep are the superstar but one can also come here for an easy hike up the hills where there are set trails. It's not as overwhelming as other bigger hills/ mountains are. With the 4,000 won ticket for adults and free for children under 5 or 3 (not so sure, but my child is 3 and free), it includes sheep feeding. Sheep are very kind creatures. This may just be not exciting for people who have been to countries that have abundance of sheep, but this is a great experience for anyone if you're in Korea. We visited during the summer. I wish I could be here in winter. Also, this is a good side trip for those who visit Pyeongchang for the ski resorts."
Natural Beauty,Natural Beauty and scenic view of Hills is just amazing. Very good for natural lovers. Very good experience. 
AMAZING!,Wonderful scenery. Abit of a walk up but so worth it. Beautiful way to spend a day. Bring a good camera the view is awesome! 
Interesting for Children,"This farm is attached with another attraction : "" Making Cheese D.I.Y"", we were instructed how to make a cheese by milk, then we walk to the farm, there were a lot of sheep waiting for us to feed them, I personally think is ok only but my children love it. It was raining after visiting the farm, and was very cold."
Very hilly walk. Very serene atmosphere.,"The landscape at the ranch looks quite foreign. All the sheep were out on the hills, dozing. It was nice to walk around the ranch going up and down. You can also feed some of them. I and my friends enjoyed the visit."
It's a good place for couples.,"I went there last August.Although it rained, still had a lot of fun.If you are planning to go there, I advise you to check the bus time table"
Beautiful scenery and experience the sheep feeding here,The scenery at the farm was among the best. Beside experiencing the feeding session with the cute sheeps we enjoyed the fresh air here. 
Good both for children and adults,"From seoul, it takes 3hours at most through highway and easy to find. It is in Kangwon province, named pure and clean area.This sheep farm is located in Taeback mountains with clean and cool wind.In summer, you can feel cool and green scene.In winter, you can enjoy the romantic white scene since this area has a lot of snow. You can enjoy the slide on the hill in winter.You can touch the sheep and feed them as well.It is a fantastic experience. One good thing is you can enjoy the Korean east sea when you drive one hour to the east.Or you can visit Selok mountain in one hour.You can enjoy fresh fish at a good price.You can enjoy the beauty of korean nature.In the fall, the foliage is great as well."
Daegwanreung Sheep Farm Tour,"It was great expereice that we have visited the sheep farm in Daegwanreung during our Winter holiday in Korea. It was only 15min. from the ski resort we stayed.We could see many of snows on the hills of Daegwanreung. Although it was a bit difficult to find any sing board for direction in English, it was easy walk to climb the hill.We enjoyed snow sliding activity for half an hour and visited the sheep farm.Feeding grass to the sheep was one of great experience we never had before. My daughter was enjoyed and she never afraid to touch those sheeps.As a half day activity about 3-4hours, Daegwanreung sheep farm is highly recommended."
Fun time for the little one,"This is a very nice sheep ranch with plenty of little sheep and very friendly ones. They seemed to enjoy the little kids touching them. With the admission ticket, you can change for the feed to feed the sheep. Lots of kids were having fun feeding and touching the friendly animal. A must do in Pyeongchang if you have a little one."
