Cheese Time,"This place is kind of far from any big cities in Korea (Jeonju is the closest, but it takes 1 hour to reach this place). We tried pizza making experienced, and it was a fun experienced. THe view of this theme park is also good for relaxation."
Good place to enjoy wide grassland with cheese theme,"CY+c ( 18.04.13 ) We didn't expect where is good, but there was very good place with wide grassland and good view. In weekday, there was almost no traveler and had calm atmosphere. Sometimes, there was held experience how make cheese, and could experience. We went around this theme park and there was good to walk. It was inconvenient that some facility was closed in weekday."
Cheesy experience!,"When you are in Imsil, you must take the opportunity to visit the Imsil Cheese Theme Park. This theme park houses different play areas like the rolling slide, animal (goat) area, cheese building, playground, etc. You can also try their cheese making courses (e.g. pizza making, mozzarella cheese making, etc.). The view and ambiance are like that of New Zealand. This theme park caters to all ages."
