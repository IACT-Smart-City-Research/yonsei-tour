Nice to visit,"The fish market is full of loads of stalls..and restaurants upstairs...you buy product and pay or it..then go upstairs where they'll cook it..however,they charge for cooking and EXTRA bits, so be aware of this..we found it fairly expensive by time you add it all up..so decided to opt out."
An eyes opener for me,"Wow and amazing experience for me. Seafood market really big, outside section selling all types of seafood frm live seafood to dried seafoods and dried herbs and cooking pot too. Inside section provide cooking for us to eat. We ordered live octopus, sushi, grilled fish and seafood noodle as our brunch and cost us 90k won. I would say fair price."
Fascinating!,An incredible place to wander around even if you don’t end up eating any of the unbeatable fresh raw fish on offer! Lots of photo opportunities of a huge selection of fish and seafood. Worth a visit! Lots of stalls around the market area too. 
大家煮( Jalgachi) Best fresh seafood in Busan,"I call it 大家煮 in Chinese for Jalgachi. We went there around 5:30 0m so the market was not busy. The market is huge with at least 50+ seafood vendors. It could be quite confusing which vendor to choose. There are signs in the market displaying the seafood market price on some items (You won’t find one vendor offers much cheaper price. I don’t know how they compete for customers then). You can choose any seafood and amount. Each vendor works with one of the many small restaurants on the second floor. After you purchase the seafood, the vendor will call the restaurant upstairs. A server will come and take you to their restaurant upstairs where they will prepare the seafood the way you want. In additional to the price you pay to the vendor for the seafood, the restaurant only charges $4 US ($4,000 Korean won) per person for using their service which include kimchi side dishes and food preparation. Therefore, expect to pay a bit more upfront for the seafood. We spent $240 US ($240,000 won) on the seafood for six of us and we were full. We had a yellow tail which was about $110. We had it for sashimi and was delicious. We also had abalones, conches, octopus, shrimps, eels, and scallops. It is better to have a small group of people to go so you can try variety of seafood. For those who don’t know how to select seafood from the vendor, you may go directly upstairs to any of the restaurant. They have a regular menu you can order from. The restaurant will get the seafood from their vendors and cook for you. They are just as fresh. By the time we finished around 7 pm, the place was packed with people. We noticed many were local people’s this is not just a hotspot for tourists. I would say this place is the place to go for seafood in Busan."
All you can dream of sea food,"Any food creatures you ever saw a nature documentary about can be found, bought and eaten around here."
Jalgachi,Wander around this amazing fish market and see a lot of interesting creatures from the sea. And don't forget to go out the back to where there's a walkway along the water and hopefully you'll get to see the seagulls playing in the sky.
A must see while you are in Busan,"One of the reason we go to Busan is to have a taste of its street seafood and this is it. There is a central covered market and around it grows and grows of fishes, eels, shrimps, octopus, conches, oysters, giant crabs...most of them alive and swimming. The view and smells are overwhelming but you get for your money. We ordered seafood meals in the covered market and they are so delicious on the grill. You should try the abalones, the squids and the big prawns."
 Beware of being ripped off,"Don't go to this place unless u want to be ripped dry. They overcharged us. We paid 44000 kwon just for bbq 3 types of seafood. The seafood is bought from the fish market on first floor n cost is separate. U have to pay for rice separately n they forced u to sit on floor even though we told them my hubby had problem bending knee to sit on floor. This place ought to be investigated by the korean tourist board. The cooking bill they gave wsd initially, 32,000 won when suddenly it become 44,000 won. "
"If you love seafood, go here","I have never heard of this place before and my friends that I am travelling with, one of them recommended it so we decided to go and if you love seafood go here cause not only is it a seafood market, the animals are all fresh and alive. You look at what you like and buy but they don’t give you the seafood cause they put them in bags and tell you follow them. I was confused, I was wondering where we were going. We went upstairs and it’s all tables and chairs, you guessed it they cook your seafood and serve them to you. It is sooooooo good I didn’t want to leave. So recommend this place to all seafood lovers. "
Every time friends visited I took them here,"Whilst living in Busan for 3+ years from 2011-2015 anytime friends or family from Canada came I would take them here. You can buy nearly any fish or crustacean imaginable. I’m a big Alaskan king crab guy more than some of the korean stuff like love octopus. I find the more korean prep of seafood is very basic, or not at all (completely live octopus). The crab is amazingly good though with some soy sauce and onion and garlic stuff, and *relatively* local catch. Recommend just for the sights. "
Busan free n easy family tour,Stayed in Shin Shin Hotel for 5 nights. Comfortable room with tasty breakfast. Strategic location adjacent to metro transit and many places of interest. Busan has friendly people and clean environment. We enjoyed the street food. It's a pleasant holidays for us.
Not worth a detour,"If you have visited Japan's Tsujiki Fish Market, give Jalgachi a miss. Drop by only if you have never visited a fish market in your life AND you have lots of spare time in your itinerary. If you do visit, wear shorts or jeans and preferably boots. Jalgachi Market is busy and colorful but the floor is perpetually wet and slippery. The stallholders vie with one another to cajole visitors to view their fish and thrust their laminated menu cards in your face. The stallholders who are not touting for customers will invariably be doing some washing and think nothing of pouring pails or basins of fishy water in a random fashion so visitors should keep a lookout and duck quickly to avoid getting your footwear and trouser legs wet.Honestly, you can get good quality, fresh seafood at most places in Busan. Jalgachi is overrated and overpriced (see photo of menu); the cooking is rough and the cooked food is just slapped onto melamine plates and put on plastic table tops. Unless you are resident Korean, chances are you will be unwittingly ripped off. Even if you do understand and speak basic Korean, you will still be outwitted by the friendly but shrewd stallholders. Be prepared to spend at least KRW50,000 per pax for a simple meal, excluding beverages. For this price, one deserves (imho) to dine in a better (and drier) environment and served neatly plated food by trained waitstaff in uniform, especially in Busan where cost of living is lower than Seoul."
Fishy,"If you like fish, alive and dead as well as the smell of fish then this is great. If you dont like fish then not worth it. "
Good service of staff no 29 2nd Floor,"Sincere boss with charges tally with the menu. There are 2 menu actually, 1 for tourist (10,000 won extra of each dish) and 1 for local. Great spot for seaview and good seafood. "
Interesting experience,I recommend you arrive around 4pm because it gets quite packed in the evening. Strong fish smells might ward you off but great market for seafood fans. The fish do look sad in their small quarters though.
An unpleasant experience,"After reading so many reviews about this so called great market, I was really looking forward to visiting it. Unfortunately all I saw was poorly treated fish in overcrowded buckets/containers literally trying to jump out to find oxygen and crustaceans clambering around trying to find space. We are not vegetarians or animal rights activists and are more than happy with fish markets in the right conditions, but we felt uncomfortable with the conditions here and left quite quickly."
A place for seafood lovers,"You can walk around the seafood stalls at level 1 to check out the various seafood. I suggest you go to the food stalls at level 2 where u can choose which stalls u like. You get to check out their menus and see what offers they can give you. Prepare to spend ard 50,000 won for 1 pax."
HBH love the bustle but hate the live fish,"We were taken here on a tour. Now I loved the hustle and bustle, and it sure is a busy place, but Hubby, who hates crowds and fish, was very disturbed by what he saw. Lots of small stalls line the numerous narrow walkways in this undercover fish market. Fish are mainly still alive and kept in small tanks so that you pick out what you want to buy. Octopus, squid, trying to escape captivity, the obvious smell that comes from fish. And the intense noise! Very colourful and plenty to photograph!"
Crazy Place ,"So much was going on the place very busy full of people not good for small children and buggies. But what a place to try fish. Pick and buy then get a local restaurant upstairs to cook it, amazing. "
Live seafood and cooking options,An eye opener for live seafood lovers. Many stalls and wide range of variety. Most were hard sellers and will try to push their produce to tourist. The price were average and almost the same for every stalls. We bought live prawns and sand crabs because they were our favorites at ground floor from a lady near one of the entrance and was guided to level 2 seating. The lady who sold us the seafood recommended that the crab be steamed and the prawns be grilled. The crab was steam well but all our live prawns was swapped with hard dried unfresh grilled ones. So buyers beware! We know our seafood so being cheated for the prawns was the biggest let down for an otherwise a good experience. Make sure your fresh seafood had not be swapped behind your back. Fresh seafood is best steam if cooking is required. Having a friend who speak Korean may be beneficial in communicating with the locals.
"Fresh seafood, special experience","We had a great dinner at the Jagalchi Market and it is a special, local, and relatively inexpensive experience. The market is very clean and each shop has its own eatery. We searched for the eatery with the most group of people and ordered our sashimi by pointing at the tanks and processed dishes by pointing at the other tables.We recommend sashimi and steams, as kitchen here is not sofisticated."
Impressive Fish Market,Just looking at the variety of sea creatures is impressive enough. The option to sample them takes the experience to another level. 
Fresh seafood and enjoy immediately,"The seafood market is located in an area with a rich history of the development of Busan. This place is very popular with tourists and is a must-visit place in the city of Busan.The seafood market is very wide with indoor and outdoor areas. The outside area sells fresh seafood, mainly by local residents.Inside the market there are 2 floors. The first floor also sells fresh seafood such as squid, octopus, lobster and abalone. All the seafood here is fresh, you can see fish swimming in the container before buying. After buying seafood, you go to the 2nd floor and can ask the restaurant to process seafood to eat as you like. It is convenient.It is best to take the subway for cheap, but can still go by taxi.In my opinion, you should visit in the afternoon to eat seafood, then continue to visit this area because there are many interesting activities that you can not explore in a short time."
Footwear required,"The floor is constantly wet. There is an elaborate ""water"" system setup to keep the fish ""alive"" for as long as possible. Amazing amount of variety of fish available. The market is very close to the shopping, eating and entertainment areas surrounding BIFF square. Tip: go there early to avoid the crowds. "
Closed on tuesdays,Just fyi-they built a nice market that we were excited to see but found they were closed on tuesdays. Ended up eating at restaurant (there are tons surrounding the market).
Worth a visit and have lunch or dinner ,We wondered through this market. It is suggested to go early in the morning I.e. 5 or 6am the market is being set up. We arrived around 2pm and it was nice just wondering around the market and then we wondered into the building adjacent to the market to try the fresh fish sold at numerous eating places. 
Delicious grilled eel,"The market is very interesting, seeing all kind of sea creatures (some I never seen before) and talking to vendors.Picking the right vendor is a must (and Jay was great). He even told us that we were selecting too much food.We were lucky to get a table with a great view on the second floor.The food was very good, specially the grilled eel.... crunchy, spicy and well seasoned.It was too bad that our trip was very close to Chuseok and they closed for the next two days, as I would have loved to return and try other dishes.Can turn out to be expensive depending on what you pick, but worth it."
WOW! Very Interesting Seafoid Market,"We took a taxi here after visiting the culturevillage. Amazing cos many seafood. If you love seafood you must come here. Prices inducated on menu.  We walked about. From here we also get to the fashion street, BIFF square so all within this area, Busanbtower akso hearby. So we suggest you spend half a day here. You can eat the seafood. Just so interesting to go through the BIG seafood! We were in awe!"
things to do in nampo,Jagalchi Market was the most lively and interesting place in Busan!I had a lot of fresh fish and grilled fish.Jagalchi is close to the surrounding attractions of Nampo-dong. It's called ZerolatencyVR.Six friends talked about VR together and just moved and played in the open. A series of shocksI hope you will experience the ZerolatencyVR while looking around Jagalchi Market!
Birthday trip ,"The first pic is our meal for 6. Delicious. Hanwol Fish Restaurant is the name of our eating place within the Jagalchi market, it does not appear on TripAdvisor. Really, really great food and service. My goodness, we could hardly find space on the table. They kept the food coming each time a plate/container was empty. We had to say ‘no more’. As you can see from our empty plates, we were not disappointed. So filling and healthy. The beer and soju went well with everything. Our tour of the market was another story. They vendors were happy to demonstrate what some the strange looking items were and allowed us to take pics. The vendors found the incredulous looks on our faces hilarious. You haven’t been to a seafood market until you visit this place. A must see in Busan. "
Experience Fresh Seafood Market ,"If you love to see seafood, Jagalchi Market is surely a living museum of South Korean seafood produce. A great place to walk and see locals doing their bargaining in the morning. "
a real experieance,"Eel Alley? Urchin corner? Clam court? You can see it all here at this huge sprawling market with every imaginable type of food from the sea. If you know what you are doing you can buy your own and go upstairs (in the main building) to have it cooked. Otherwise go to Jackie's seafood (#8 on the 2nd floor). It's not fancy, but boy is it good."
A wet fish market that sells amazingly fresh seafood that's worth a visit,"This fish market is open 7 days a week. from as early as 7.00 am to late at night. Its a delight to visit to see the wide varieties of fish, clamps. prawns. crabs, abalone, octopus and etc... being sold. Some of these are so fresh and kept in the tanks and you can see them literally swimming in it. You can buy them and bring it upstairs to get it cook by your choice of cooks (as there are a number of stores/eateries) in whatever style and way you want (provided you speak good Korean otherwise sign language can still bring you somewhere with some of these cooks). If you are a seafood lover, never miss this opportunity to have a meal there. You will love it to the max!"
Amazing fresh seafood!,"Our local guide brought us straight to one of the stalls (can't remember exactly which one it was, but it was near an entrance) and we ordered king crab, fish, scallops, and abalone to eat at the restaurant area upstairs.Everything, including the massive array of Korean side dishes, was fresh and delicious, but the king crab and fish (which was served both raw and fried) were the highlights for me. Of course, the meal didn't exactly come cheap but it was worth it for the quality of the food, as well as the experience of dining at the market itself."
Eye Opening,"Had a great time having the fresh seafood at the market level 2, you can either choose to choose the seafood yourself and the bring up to the restaurant to cook or just go up to the restaurant and choose the dish you want as i find the prices are even cheaper as they did not charge you additional for cooking fees. I recommend stall no 8, the owner speaks chinese too, and very honest. "
Memorable experience! ,"We were lucky enough to come here with a Korean speaking guide, who helped us communicate with the seafood vendors to purchase some seafood. Our fresh purchases were then swiftly brought upstairs to the restaurant area to be prepared for our lunch.We sat at a restaurant directly to the right of the staircase and this is where I would insert heart-eyed emojis...All we could do was gape as each dish was brought out for us to eat. We had ordered sea bream prepared two ways - fresh sashimi, and flash fried. We also had grilled abalone and steamed scallops. Everything tasted good, however, the highlight would have to be the snow crab - a must-try if you are a crab lover!!! The steamed crab meat is sweet and easy to pull out of the shell...but the best part is the roe and ""juice"" pooled in the crab shell. Get some rice, mix it into the roe and you get this rich, salty, crabby rice with the texture of risotto - Korean style. So delicious!!!I think it would be advantageous to have a Korean-speaking guide with you to help with the purchasing and ordering process, if you don't speak Korean. Without a guide, this should be fine too as some vendors speak English and they are probably used to tourists. But make sure to negotiate the price upfront to ensure you're not hit with an unexpected whoppingly high bill! In terms of cost, our meal totalled around USD200 for 5 persons, and this comprised 4 abalones, 4 scallops, a large fish a large crab, and an endless supply of vegetables and side dishes. Well worth-it I'd say! "
Fresh but unsure about proce,"Definitely a place for seafood. Snow crab, Alaska crab, abalone, scallop and just about any type of fish and more. Once you have selected your fresh seafood, they will bring you upstairs and have the restaurant cook for you at a price. They will serve you side dishes such as kimchi, sweet potato, lettuce and water. At the end of it, I must say the food is fresh and well cooked and indeed delicious. But just take note it will cost you. We have a great experience because of the local guide who helped us. "
Interesting,"Lots of fish, shellfish, clams, snow crab, (giant) lobster. Hungry? You pick the one you want and eat it upstairs in the restaurant. Be aware of the fee, per dish and table setting you pay an extra amount. For us with 3 meals 23000 won extra above the fish and crab. However, special interesting place."
So much fish!,"Had heard about this market from a few people and it’s worth checking out. Even if you don’t stop for lunch, it’s worth just wandering around to see the incredible amount of fish there."
Yummy but slightly expensive seafood ,We walked around before hand-picking some seafood for lunch. The sellers are friendly. You should try and bargain for the price. 
Don't go to stand no 23 and be aware of others,If you like seafood don't be scammed by the pictures or sales people at the restaurants. Loads of mussels in the plate and looks nothing like the picture. Be aware...
Good place to go to,We liked this market .Not to long so you don't get confused with what you want to buy.You will find Cafes outside the market
Lots of seafood on display,"The Ja-gal-ch'i Market is worth a visit if you're downtown Busan. You'll see all sorts of fish, crabs, eels, and more. All alive in tanks, waiting to be purchased. Depending on where you're from in the world this might be normal, fascinating or kind of gross. We found it fascinating. We weren't there to purchase anything, just there to walk through as tourists."
Must-visit in Busan,"It’s must-visit in Busan. An awesome fish market. We are seafood lover, it’s great experience of walking and seeing live fishes, octopus, oysters, shrimps.The sellers are so friendly and nice, always smile. We stopped at a small seafood restaurant and enjoyed our lunch"
Seafood paradise!,"This is a must-visit in Busan if you're a seafood lover. Both the inner and outer market offer a variety of fresh and dried seafood at reasonable prices. There is a level of negotiation for some items and not for others. Most vendors are open to creating a mixed package deal, e.g. $25 for a mix of clams, scallops, oysters, etc. It's a great way to try many things. You can take it home or have it prepared for a fee."
Don’t Get Trick By Seafood Vendor,"This is the place where you select your seafood on the ground floor and eat on the second floor. Be warn, check price first before committing if you are on budget travel. Unless you speak Korean and able to communicate what you want and willing to pay for, most likely to walk away feeling you are not paying what you get. "
 Very clean and well organized market of fresh seafood,"A market with many kinds of seafood, such as octopus, fish, prawns...and many others that you can’t name.The price is the same at all stalls. The vendors are very nice. And you can either buy food to cook upstairs to eat or you can order directly from the many sitting areas upstairs. "
Huge fish market,"I love visiting markets and wet markets in particular. The Jalgachi market is clearly a gigantic seafood market. However as a tourist who doesn’t speak the language, I find visiting it not so much fun. First of all, I won’t be buying any seafood, and second of all, I visited the market on a Monday morning around 10, there was not much buyers activities there which makes browsing around kind of awkward. I understand from some recommendations in guidebooks that says you can buy seafood there and get it cooked. I just didn’t figure out how while I was there. That’s just my experience. The neighbourhood has other things to offer, such as the Gukje market which sells everything. Gimpo is round the corner so there are more shopping there too. "
Great to walk around and awesome food,"Walking around the market was great to see the ladies selling their fish in the street. The view of the bay from behind the market is greta as well.What makes this place special to me is what happens on the second floor. If you like seafood you need to go to the second floor and select a stall (we went to 40 as we liked their menu and options and it was great). Order the food and enjoy amazing fresh seafood and a greta view of the bay.We have been to Japan and other countries that have amazing seafood and I must say that what we had there was as good if not better. We had the best Sea Urchin we ever tasted (Better than Japan). The oysters were fresh and creamy and everything isles was amazing as well. Im sure the restaurants in the streets surrounding the market are great, but our experience on the second floor was truly remarkable. If you like fresh seafood, if you have to go there. I believe you can buy your own seafood on the first floor and bring it to the second to have them cook it. We simply ordered and saw our waitress go downstairs and pick it out from a vendor."
Disappointed ,When I buy fish at a fish market I expect the fish/other items to at least be in clean water. Well at least I was able to check this location off my to do list in Korea. Busan offer so many other locations to visit so don’t waste your time coming here. 
Simply amazing,"I have not seen so much marine life ever in my life. Not a very huge market, its in doors. ground floor in wet market. and 1st has restaurants. In south korea they call ground floor as 1st :)Expensive, and they dont even serve you free condiments when u dine in, that wasnt great. and cash only (no credit cards)"
Stall No. 23 New Busan - a must try!,"Love everything about this Stall No. 23 New Busan at Level 2 of Jagalchi Market. Delicious freshness served with a smile!Totally damage for lunch after ordering good for sharing portion of (1) Abalone Porridge, (2) Grilled Assorted Shellfishes, (3) Sea Urchins, (4) Grilled Rockfish and complimentary Chives Pancake was just 95,000 won. Jagalchi Market is the largest seafood market in South Korea, selling live & dried seafood. Jagalchi Market is close on Tuesdays that fall on the 1st and 3rd week of every month and Stall No. 23 New Busan is opened from 9 am to 9 pm.I let my humble pictures do the talking! Try it to believe it! Enjoy! "
Huge modern seafood market,Fairly new and modern seafood market building in Busan. Must visit. The wet market is on the 1st floor. Hundreds of stores selling everything the ocean has to offer and so so fresh. On the 2nd floor there are lots of seafood restaurants. Yummy! A great experience. A 5 minute walk from.Jagalchi metro station exit 10. 
Get fresh seafood prepared Korean style,"I ordered some raw fish and uni from a restaurant on the second floor. As is the Korean way, it came served with many different side dishes. I still have dreams about the uni that I ate at this market. It was so fresh and delicious."
"Unbelievable, fascinatingly colourful place to visit if you love seafood !!","One of my Korean friends in Melbourne rated this as a ""must see"" if we were calling in to Busan on our cruise; and she was absolutely correct. There is a HUGE range of fresh seafood being bought, sold and processed over several floors of this multi-storeyed building; and then there are the dozens of street stalls in the surrounding area to explore as well. If you aren't particularly interested, of course, it's a bit like visiting your hundredth European cathedral, thousandth Asian temple, or millionth woman's shoes and clothing store. My wife likes all three but was only interested in the Market for about 10 minutes !! . On a cautionary note, enthusiasts keen to visit should be aware that the market (but not the neighbourhood stalls) are CLOSED all day on every first and third Tuesday of every month. Amazingly, tours seemed to be able to be booked on these days !! Slightly unethical, but fortunately we're not into tours and just caught the shuttle buses ""under our own steam""."
Colorful Fish Market,It was later in the evening when we visited the biggest fish market in Busan and there was not a lot of activities going on. This was a large building housing the fish and seafood sellers on the first floor and the restaurants on the second making it very convenient to buy and then get your food cooked in the same spot. However having read other reviews we opted just to wander and look at the very colorful plastic bins filled with all sorts of sea life swimming or writhing around. The sellers just left us alone which seemed unusual. Most seemed to be cleaning or closing up shop. The vibe was much different than the larger Tsukiji Fish Market in Japan.While here I suggest visiting outside the building on the docks in the back. Here was a view of the harbor and off in the distance on the hill above was Gamcheon Village.
Give it a miss,"If you are intertested to see live octopus wrapping hands, some unusual looking fishes probably can have a visit. Otherwise look elsewhere"
Great seafood but a tourist trap,"There are plenty of fresh seafood to choose from. The problem is when you buy the seafood, there are additional cost to prepare it on the second floor. It can be expensive.. we bought $40 usd of seafood. It was brought upstairs to cook. $20 usd fee to prepare it and additional $4/ person. So for a party of 4, it cost as much as the seafood we just bought. That seems unreasonable.. I think it’s a time tourist trap. "
Best experience evee,"The market and its surrounding areas are a fish lovers dream. So many stalls selling live fish to eat. The types of sea creatures where endless - crabs, octopus, fish, abalone, other shelled creatures I had no idea what they were! We just selected one store and chose our fish (a snapper fish and an octopus. The creatures were then taken upstairs along with us to the restaurant and prepared by the chef. Whilst waiting we had a nice selection of side dishes. The octopus came to us cut up but still moving! Quite the experience to try eat it as it was try to escape chop sticks and the fork!! In your mouth it tried to sucker onto your tongue and cheeks! Was so different. Half of our snapper was prepared as sashimi which was wonderful and the other half cooked which was the real highlight. No idea what restaurant we ate at but it was amazing. The stall with the fish had a young Korean guy who spoke amazing English and his store was about half way down the side walls on the left side as you enter with busan behind you (rather than the sea side). There’s also a dried fish section which was interesting to taste. "
FRESH FISH ? No LIVE FISH !,If you like seafood or if you like to see an incredible variety of fish this is a great place to visit. Be aware that fish will go from live to sashimi in front of you within seconds. could be a bit cruel to see these fishes trying to escape their tank and often seem to be starring at you while waiting for their turn .. 
Gijang Crab Market ,This is a local market with so many shops can enjoy eating the steamed Crabs.Please check and bargain the price with them and do check few more restaurants before you decide to go which one.The price is worthy with good quality of foods
Fishy Market ,"It was quite an interesting experience. We just went to see the fish market but were amazed with the different kinds of fishes, eels & other forms of oysters etc. we took a train from the city, it was very easy. They even cook your meal on the upper floors. The shops around had a variety of dry fish, sea weed & other varieties. Yes a must travel to view the area . Very clean & organized. "
Jalgachi Market,Went there few times and found it is quite concentrate as lots of shops along the road and easy access. Connecting to food street and comestoc stores which makes it easy for traveller to settle shopping and food at one place.
Once is enough,"We did not walk around the ground floor as it was wet and smelly. Also, we think, no point choosing the seafood and haggle the price with the store owners because in the end, the restaurant owners will charge another cooking fee and some additional charges, which could came to a lot. So, we just went upstairs to the restaurant level and concluded that most restaurants sells the same thing and the pricing could varies too. We ended up with 1 of the more crowded restaurant and the lady told us that it is actually cheaper if the guests were to come straight up to the restaurant instead of buying your own seafood. We ordered: A whole flounder and have it cooked 2 ways - grill and other half, sashimi (these are ok); A seafood hotpot (filled to the brim with lots of shell seafood and squids. I find these ok only); A abalone porridge (it came out greenish. I think they used the abalone spare parts to cook these. It didnt have much taste too). We did not order crabs because too lazy to work on it. Conclusion is, we will not be returning to this place for dinner because there are more alternative delicious food out there."
Only nice when you actually like seafood,"I don't eat seafood, so I did not really enjoy going here (it was included in my tour). I wouldn't say it's a very special place, as it looks exactly like other markets I've seen in the country. It's just bigger. The fish is pretty fresh, as most of it is still alive, waiting to be killed."
"Fun, but it's all the same","They say this is the biggest fish market in Korea....I don't know. Seoul's seems bigger to me.It's not bad by any means. But almost every stall has the same stuff. It's worth a visit if you're around, but I wouldn't make a special trip...."
Local market ,I love this market that I can find everything. Food is awesome and yummy. Enjoy for shopping and eating here. 
5 star for experience,"It was very interesting for me because I have never experience the concept of purchasing seafood in a market, only to have it cooked by restaurants located on another floor.It was definitely a fun experience. The seafood is undoubtedly fresh, but it also depends on the cook. My overall food tasting rating would be 3 to 4 stars, which was okay. First, you purchase the seafood on the lower floor. You can choose whatever you like and they will charge you accordingly. In my opinion, the raw seafood is relatively cheap. Then, you have to inform them that you are planning to have the food cooked and they will call one of the restaurants on the upper floor to come get your raw seafood. A person will then come to collect your purchases and bring you upstairs where they have the normal dining service. Take note that you have to pay the cook separately, which turned out to be the same price as the seafood. Hey, it's business, no qualms there.Nonetheless, the whole experience was amazingly entertaining for me and for that, I give it 5 stars!"
Best for Samsung phones,This is the best market in the world to buy Samsung phones at an unbelievable cheap prices and many other stuffs but best to buy phones and u need to bargain 
Interesting experience,"This was for us one of the 5 top highlights in Busan. We saw all kind of seafood there, several quite strange and we did not know that it is possible to eat them. We had 2 dinners there to discover local seafood. Everything was fresh. At evenings it was pretty crowdy, but not too many foreigners - mostly local people. But it was not cheap - we paid almost the price in Brussels."
Fish market in Busan!,"It was not quite as big as I had thought. Prices were fairly inflated just like anything else in Korea. If your intention is to eat fresh seafood, it is ok. Otherwise you can skip it."
Fishmarket,"Very large fish market. Incredible, the volume being offered out there. And all fresh from the vessel. Clean building with possibilities to make your choice on fresh fish, put it in a basket, and carry to one of the many restaurants upstairs, where they will prepare your food and you can enjoy a wonderful meal of your own chosen fish. After that you walk to the open market next to the fish market and stroll around."
Fantastic ,A huge live market where you can buy downstairs and eat and cook upstairs for a table change pet person. Local like to eat most raw.
Vibrant and colourful,"This is without doubt the largest seafood market we’ve ever seen. It was vibrant and colourful with all the fishmongers wearing different coloured full length plastic aprons and matching wellington boots. The fish tanks, kept filled with running water, were full of live seafood which can be upsetting. Outside was a large open area with great views and live music."
Seafood market similar to Noryangjin,"If you are a seafood lover and wanted to visit the market, you get tanks and tanks of live seafood in here. A whole building with the side alleys all filled with vendors peddling live seafood like shellfish, fishes, abalones, octopus and everything from the sea. Prices are not cheap by any means so be prepared to spend slightly more. We spent 150k won for 4 people with 2 fishes, some scallops and 2 pots of abalone congee."
Not for us,"This place is filled with rows and rows of seafood vendor selling almost the same things. If you have no intention of eating expensive seafood, it can be skipped. The stall holders even said themselves that all are the same, only depend on price. We ended up in one of the traditional restaurant outside of the market."
A Great Experience,"A very lively seafood market. We spent the morning wandering around the market admiring all of the seafood offerings. The variety of seafood is amazing. We then made our way upstairs and had a fantastic seafood lunch at one of the stalls. The food was very nice at a very good price. A word of warning, some of the stall owners will try to upsell you, just be firm with them and you will not have a problem."
CHEATED 2ND FLOOR FOOD STALL,"If you are from Asia countryThis is not special venue for you. Just a wet market with alot of fresh sea food. Beware if your are wearing nice shoe!! Basically I think we was cheated by second floor seafood stall. A Chinese girl can speak Korean and mandarin keep hot sale how good is their seafood. And my foolish decision to dine in. (refer my picture and zoom in to see the stall number 37 and NAME with orange colour ) A seafood pot of 2 small prawn and 2small Not fresh crab and many clamps cost 300,000 krw. A SoCall seafood pancake taste awful is just vegi + chopped tiny octopus with flour cost super expensive 200.000krw and a small plate of raw octopus cost 100.000krw total of 600.000krwServe with free water for 2 person meal is way too much too expensive and Not tasty totally not worth at all. We cannot finish and left with very unhappy and disappointed .Above just an advise. You still can make your own decision whether to dine in or else where. "
Live seafood heaven ,"Jagalchi seafood market is an awesome market with so many seafood vendors and so many types of fish, shellfish, crabs, etc.Buy your live seafood on level 1 and the vendors will bring you up to level 2 to be prepared by one of their “associated friends” .. We bought a 3kg+ king crab for W70,000 per kg. Cooking charges are not included and extra."
Clean N Varieties ,Market is very very clean and not so fishy smelling... Wheelchair friendly place and the people there are quite friendly.Nice view behind the market
Live Seafood Market ,"We joined a guided tour to visit this popular seafood market which is a 4 levels building.At level 1, there are many stalls selling varieties of live seafood which you could buy and get them cooked at level 2. Do note that you've to pay a fee of 4,000 won per person for cooking the seafood. We didn't buy any but had our seafood set dinner at level 4 instead. We enjoyed the fresh and delicious seafood dinner!"
Busan,The fish market is a great experience. We have never seen such big crabs in our lives. The only problem is ordering food as a foreigner you are not sure what to get and not many people speak English. Despite that we had a great experience 
"Overrated, another foreigners trap","We ordered from a random stall that spoke English. We didn't haggle too much.- 3x abalone for 10000won- 3x shell for 8000won- 1x live octopus 2000won- 1x sole fish 25000won- 1x kimchee pot 7000wonTable fee was 4000won each. We spent 90000won for 4 of us. The hot pot was full of bones. The grill fish was dry, abalone were tiny and the shell fish didn't taste fresh.One of the worse meals we had in busan."
Live Fish Market,This market is huge and not for the animal lover as all of the fish and seafood is in water and alive - never seen a place this big with all this assortment of live marine life for people to buy but it must be popular with the localsAmazingly though the prices were not cheap to European costs at all which did surprise us 
fish world,"Fish world! what can you say more! If you like fish, this is the place for you! Millions of fish literally everywhere! the first time we saw such a big market! Fish, seafood, seaweed, literally everything! The only minus is the smell which is really specific and powerful!"
Seafood place,"This is a great place to eat your seafood. There are many stalls selling seafood on the first level. Upon choosing your seafood and paying them, the stall owner will call the restaurant on the 2nd floor to fetch their guests upstairs. The restaurant will check on the method of preparing the seafood for the guests, like steaming, frying or eating them raw. They will provide cutleries, small side dishes and water for the guests. We requested to steam our seafood and we paid a total of 22,000 won as service fees. "
Live octopus and fresh seafood!,"Honestly, I didn’t plan to go here, but I went ahead and glad i did! They have all the seafood you could ever imagine. You can choose whatever seafood you feel like eating and they’d bring it upstairs and cook them for you so you could enjoy your food. I didn’t choose any particular stall, the one which had the friendliest approach won. LOL. I had live octopus, and seriously, it is still alive even after being shashimi-ed. Caution: Only eat it if you are daring enough (smirk). We also had white fish and clams. It was freaky but I had a good lunch!"
An eye opener,Refreshing tour experience to visit a local wet market. A wide range of fresh fishes and seafood are available for us to buy and cook on the spot by the informal stall. 
Weekly shoping done here,"I went here with my friends ,they are residents of Busan .They always do there weekly shopping here as everything is available here at very good rates.All the vegetables were very fresh as well as the fish.You can get live fish here ."
Jagalchi Market,"Jagalchi Market, located on the shoreside road in Busan's Jung-gu, is Korea's largest seafood market, selling both live and dried fish. After the Korean War, the market solidified itself as a fish market. Most of the people who sell fish are women, so the vendors here are called Jagalchi Ajumma, ""ajumma"" meaning middle-aged or married woman in Korean. This market represents Busan and is famous throughout the country. Visitors can eat fresh raw fish right at the market. Even nowadays visitors can see women selling mackerel, sea squirts (ascidians) and whale meat on wooden boxes along the road outside of the market and along the shore. Every year in October, the Jagalchi Cultural Tourism Festival is held, and it is easy to visit because of the convenient transportation provided by subway. Jagalchi Market is where you can see the lifestyle of the Busan locals.Operating Hours 05:00-22:00 (Hoe Center opens from 09:00)Closed First and third Tuesday of every monthStore Information 1F: Fresh fish market (live fish/live eel/albalone/live fresh fish)2F: Hoe Center (East.West Hoe Center/Resaurant zone/dried fish zone)3F: Soribada norabang, exhibition room4F: Dadohae Korean restaurant5F: Oase Seafood Buffet6F: Oase convention center, buffet7F: guesthouse, sky parkConvenient Facilities Rest area, tourist information center, exhibition room, terrace, sky park, elevator, escalator, etc."
Interesting to just be there...,Objective was to eat sea food. As fresh as possible and there u are. Loads of sea food. Then again u will find yourself wondering what to eat with every fish and crab swimming in the tanks. So we went to level 2 where they would Sashimi your favourites and cook what u choose. Just remember whatever u buy... its really alot of Sashimi to consume. Be prepared for a fresh flesh meal!!
Interesting Fish Market,"If you like seafood, it may be one of your highlights. The type of products vary from sea cucumbers to all kinds of sea weed. Dried or fresh, even pieckled... Very different from western fish markets! "
Seafood galore,How much fresher can your seafood get if not from South Korea's largest seafood market? Prices aren't exactly cheap but one could without a doubt gorge yourselves silly on all the available fish and shellfish.
Amazing fresh market,"After discussing with my friends who love eating Alaskan Crab, this place maybe is one of the cheapest place to eat Alaskan Crab.U can get a fresh alaskan crab for around 50,000 won per Kg. But watchout. Make sure you buy from trustworthy seller. The basket for weight measurement might be heavier than what it looks. Also make sure choose the crab with full meat inside. Not those empthy meat inside.."
Fish Fish everywhere,"If you are a diehard fan of sea food, then never miss visiting this place. While the road side open market is like any other fish market, there is also a market which resembles a super market where you can select your favorite one from the wide variety of live fish available and the same will be cooked and served to you fresh. This place is usually packed to its capacity during weekends and holidays, so be ready to wait for a while. The prices are also reasonable and there is always space for bargaining. The place is reasonably clean and the flowing water and good drainage system ensures that one can go around the shops comfortably."
A must to haggle. ,"If you love Seafood, this is a must place to visit. Live seafood at a reasonable price. Lots of varieties. As long you are tourist and you don't speak or read korea language, the price quoted will be inflated. It is a must to haggle. Get the best price for the seafood you want. After which, find a nearest shop which can cook for you. Per dish will cost about 10000won. I had 6 different kind of seafood and it cost me additional 60000won to cook all the of it. 3kg king crab at 120000won. Oyster, clam and cockles cost 15000 each. All of it at 2kg. And abalone cost 20000won for a kg. Small size seabass cost about 15000won. All the best in haggling. "
Traditional korean market ,Very local market where most of the local Korean would visit and buy their daily seafood supply or dine. Lots of seafood stall and restaurants. Be careful of the restaurant who tried to offer you and always asked for price . The English language command here is not great make it difficult to express and bargain. So better choose a restaurant who listed the price on the menu before you order. The other stall that do the simple cooking right behind the fishery stall can be a challenge if your stomach is not too strong to handle. 
Rather clean and well organised tourist trap,"Great for taking in the sights and sounds. Most stallholders here can speak Mandarin, and many visitors who stream in are tourists. Huge variety of fresh seafood to choose from, which can be cooked on the spot at 2F. Most fishmongers have their own preferred restaurant partners who will do the cooking for you at a price. View from 2F is great; overlooking the coast and what looks like Gamcheon Cultural Village in the distance. Dried seaweed and other dried seafood can also be found on the 2F. Cheaper seafood options can be found elsewhere in Busan, like around Haeundae Beach."
Great varieties of seafood,"Good choices of seafood. Most of the hawkers can speak Chinese. Selling seafood at ground floor. Seating and cooking with fee at second floor. I put it as average pricing as I have tried the Noryanjing Market in Seoul - which was throat cutting. So I am rating the Jagalchi Market as good variety of food with average price and affordable. For us, 2 adults and 2 kids, we had a king crab, 5 medium sized abalone and 2 squids for a total of KRW105k. Cooking and seating cost KRW45k. Total is KRW150k."
Expected it...,"...yes, most definitely a touristy venue. But what a variety and with limited time, one could accomplish much. Try once and it would suffice. I am sure there are other locations with better prices but I see Koreans eat here too. The wet market appeared to be a new building and clean. There were still construction going on outside but perhaps just tying up the loose ends. Even if one doesn’t feel like eating here, a visit is a must. So many live creatures to see."
Amazing Sea Creatures!,"As your walk along, countless of amazing sea creatures, fishes, octopus, many i dont know their names also, along the alleys even before your enter the huge Jagalchi market. Plenty of ""open"" restaurant on second floor, however, food price here is rather high comparatively. There is also a buffet restaurant at fifth floor with nice cozy environment. Depending on your requirement and budget, no harm trying to explore all floors before you finally decide which place to dine! Night scene at the back of this market is not too bad."
Skip this,"This is a tourist trap and we definitely regret dining here (good spot for photos though). We spent around 90000 krw (2 pax) and it certainly was not worth it. The broth of the seafood stew was as bland as it gets and everything in it was rubbery as hell. For people who find pleasure from traveling on a budget, you can get a much better meal in Korea for as low as 7500 krw per pax."
"Great Food, Clean Market","It was a really nice market. 1st floor is the market, and 2nd market is the seafood restaurant. Sashimi cost me 50,000 won. It was okay. So many seafood I've never seen before."
Great Seafood @ Great Prices,"Dropped by Jagalchi thrice in two days. Found this stall manned by lady who could speak both Korean,Chinese and English with a stall by the side entrance. Went around and found her rates the best. Took a dive and went for a 3kg King Crab and she threw in a 1.8kg lobster at a great price. Preparation was superb with reasonable prices. They say their name is Kohayng Market. That's the one. "
Interesting spot,"Very interesting spot to see the workings of a fish market. Although we visited in late afternoon plenty of stalls with live fish where you could see a huge variety of seafood were still open. Restaurant on 2nd floor to eat raw fish bought downstairs.Neighbouring streets quite interesting to see too, as there's plenty of street stalls selling fried or dried fish/seafood that can be eaten as snacks."
Clean Market!,So many choices to choose from! Choose from a stall & take up to the stalls upstairs! They'll cook for you! I am amazed with the cleanliness of the market & friendly they are! A must go if you are in Busan!
Huge working fish market with lots of restaurants,"We had heaps of fun visiting Jagalchi market. The market is huge with heaps of live seafood on display. We went at midday and it was really quiet, we were able to look around the market without it being crowded, and we never felt like we were in the way. This is a real fish market, so yes the floor is wet and you might get splashed with fishy water, that's to be expected. We went upstairs to the restaurants & ate lunch at Jacky's. The staff were lovely and our grilled sea bream was amazing. We ordered a small fish, not being sure how big it would be, and it was a good size for two people. The restaurants upstairs are expensive, there's no way around that if you want to eat at the market."
Great Fresh Seafood,"the seafood taste so fresh and we enjoyed 2 days dinner there. we had grilled eels, king crab, grilled fish. Even though it is expensive but it worth the money spent there. "
You haven't seen a fish market until this...,"You haven’t seen a fish market until you’ve been to the Jagalchi Traditional Market. Thousands of ocean critters, both alive and dead, line the narrow streets as old women yell at you to come in and eat. It is definitely a unique cultural experience you should have when visiting Pusan."
Fresh seafood market ,"If you are there, it is worth ordering seafood from a stall you fancy in the building. Fresh sashimi octopus is worth trying. Lots of stalls along the roadside selling fresh seafood but they do not offer a place to dine."
Interesting for tourists; convenient for locals,"This is the biggest fish market in the Republic of Korea. They have all kinds of seafood, fresh off the boat, and provide a real shopping opportunity for seafood lovers. For tourists, it's an interesting walk through and insight into local culture. Locals come from all over the city to shop here because the seafood is the freshest and most abundant. Much of it is still alive at the time of sale. One featured product is the beltfish, found locally but not throughout the rest of the country. Neighborhood restaurants can take your purchase and prepare it for you, if you wish. They stay busy, but not hectic."
Pricey,Seafood are fresh at Jagalchi Market but you must negotiate with the seller as the price did not spell out clearly. Once you choose and pay for the seafood they will recommend a stall to cook for u. Do note that another fee will be charged for food preparation (cook) by the stall operator at level 2. 
Wet market full of seafood,"Jalgalchi market is a traditional wet market. It is located along the seaside, thus they provide fresh seafood every day. There are many peculiar kinds of seafood, which we never have seen in our life. The market is also nearby BIFF square and Gukje Market, both of them just at the opposite of the road."
Fascinating and well worth a visit,The fish market is well worth a visit. It is very clean and doesn't smell particularly fishy - maybe in summer it is different? There are many fascinating things to see - varieties of live fish and shell fish as well as the dry fish market on the first floor.
Seafoods Galore . ,"This Market is a “must see “ when your in Busan. They have a wide selection of Seafoods. The Market was fully packed when we went there because it was dinner time. A gentle man approached us and offered us their place, where we can dine, he speaks english fluently so we didn’t had a hard time ordering our food. "
Cut throat prices,"The prices at the market are so freaking expensive! I feel like the prices are ridiculous sky high. Starting price is always 30,000won for seafood. Cheapest is maybe 13,000 won for fish. Prices in Japan is so much more cheaper & affordable.Come here only only if you really want to eat expensive seafood.oh, drop by the observatory deck for the view of the market."
Must Visit,"This fish market is a must visit. In my opinion, between Jagalchi and Gamcheon Cultural Village, it is well worth the trip to Bhusan from Seoul. High speed rail makes the cost relatively low next these two grade A attractionsJagalchi fish market is not just an opportunity to see seafood galore but an opportunity to eat some of the freshest seafood you'll ever have. Ask a stall to prepare sashimi in front of you and you'll go from a live flopping fish to eating it with chopsticks and wasabi in under 5 minutes. Don't forget to ask what fish is in season and enjoy!"
Delicious,"So interesting! Very smelly, as exoected. Remeber to wear shoes. I wore sandals and they werent suitable as the floor is very wet. Chose our own fish and then it was taken upstairs and served to us. Some of it was barbecued, some raw and there was also wriggling octopus. "
fresh seafood galore,"Went here several time for the seafood. You can choose the seafood, how they will cooked and serve at the building near the market. "
Seafood Dinner at Jenni’s (2nd Floor),"Small but cozy & busy. Go early, this fills up for dinner. We were there around 5pm and they were planning for a BIG group. Do it now was the way to go. Our waiter spoke good English, but you may resort to pointing to the pictures on the menu. The fresh fish is from the seafood market downstairs - VERY fresh! We opted for beer & soju to start ordering small orders of grilled spicy octopus, grilled not spicy squid & grilled scallops. The condiments arrive, First beer & soju then. A pickled seaweed, plain pickled cabbage, kimchi (the best yet), wasabi, pickled ginger, red chili paste, & cabbage salad. The first main arrives, Spicy Grilled Octopus (this is a small order!!) nicely grilled baby octopus with onions & peppers - not too spicy either! Lots of octopus bits. Then came the scallops - HUGE! Steamed or grilled in their own juices! They tasted...WOW! ( the small order). Finally the squid. It was HUGE & plain so dipping pieces in the soy infused with wasabi and ginger, wrapped in seaweed or cabbage was great. Even rolling pieces in the spicy octopus sauce was really good! HIGHLY recommended you’ll leave stuffed. Cost about 100K KSW. "
really big seafood market,Eyes opening sea creatures. Some had not seen before. It is a must go if you visit Busan. Easily access by subway.
A haven for seafood lovers!,"Easily accessible, this market is a wonderful place to feast your eyes on all manner of sea food one can imagine, not to mention, the size of some of the squids are strangely large. And the variety of sea food is amazing! It's a must place to visit, especially if you have never gone to the wet market. Wear a pair of good water-proof walking shoes; the place floor is wet, and be prepared for the expected fishy smell, but bearable."
Wonderful experience!,"I had visit Noryangjin Fish market in Seoul but have to say, Jagalchi (only few minutes from Jagalchi station) was not only bigger, but also much better, and of course, more affordable prices."
Powerful pictures at the fish market,"The fishmarket in Busan is really worth a visit. It is very crowed consisting of a good mix of locals and very few tourists (at least of western people). This way it seams to be a authentic experience. You’ll find everything the ocean has to offer, including blowfish and living octopus. But I doubt you dare to try eating it. Do you?As a picture hunter...it’s a must!"
Fantastic experience with amazing seafood,"Walked thru the market to find row after row of tanks with live fish, eels, shrimp, crabs , lobsters plus much more. Had sashimi dinner at one of the stands with fish that had been swimming minutes before. Amazing experience. Very noisy and vibrant. Highly recommended for those that want to feel the vibe!!"
Avoid this place or be prepared to be cheated ,"My friends and I decided to had a meal here as we found that the Ajuma “was” very nice. Although we found that the price is on the high side. They not only cooked our seafood by wrong method and super unfriendly.When we were leaving, they came forward and charged us additional 7500krw per person!! And said it was table charge which they did or inform us in the first place when we bought the seafood at level 1!! We felt cheated and was very upset. They shouted at us and threatening us that they will call police if we do not pay the additional table charge. This unpleasant meal cost us USD 130 for just 3 of us!!!"
A visit to the market,"Definitely is not a place that I would recommend to people that is vegetarian or is sensible about animals are handled...overcrowded fish tanks is the rule, and there are some activity to kill and prepare the fish for cooking (removal of the skin, fins, etc)"
Traditional Korean market with lots of seafood peddlers,"A local-style Korean market, food is good but don't expect too much decoration of the shop.We had a king crab (crab was based on current price, about 100-120k, 5-6 adults)and then had a barbecue eel (it was still moving while being cooked....yucky but tasty)Shop peddlers were a bit too zealous for me."
Crazy experience ,Super overwhelming at first. We wandered around for a while confused about what to do. Finally we picked a few fish and they killed them right there. A lady took us upstairs where they grilled them for us. The fish super tasty and came with several picked (kimchi) vegetables. For dessert a man came by with some dungo and red bean. Great experience 
AAA fish market,"Being the first time here, I can’t be awe but amazed at how Korean do stuff. It’s clean, not “that smelly” and customer service is number 1. Many different types of seafood and they would freshly clean it and you can eat I on the first floor. Place is clean and people are nice. Snow crab is a must to order and they will steam it and let you take picture of it and then they will take the “egg” part of the crab with it’s shell and cook rice with it and it’s AA Awesome! Must go!"
All sorts of seafood and the squirming sashimi,"Come here to see all manner of seafood and if you're not keen on paying for the Busan aquarium.Watch your steps as the ground is wet and shopkeepers will not hesitate to splash water onto the pathway even if you're in the way. But they're mostly friendly and eager to reel in your business. There are English menus at the stalls which cook your food upstairs, but bear in mind that the food is not cheap since it's fresh seafood after all. At the fishery building nearby (next to the outdoor market), there are more seafood stalls but with seating areas. Here you can try the legendary Small Octopus sashimi (10000krw) and experience your food squirming to get out of your mouth. "
An assault on your senses - so much to look at,"A brilliant experience, hundreds of traders with lots of varieties of fish. If it swims, crawls or floats in the sea , you can find it here.Just watching the dexterity of the stall holders catching and cleaning fish that had been purchase was impressive.We went to store 116 - English spoken. Chose a Flounder , An Octopus and a snow crab.You pay for the fish down stairs if you want to eat them, you are asked how you want it cooked and taken upstairs to a restaurant, number 31 in our case. You then pay a table charge to have them cooked and obviously any drinks are extra but reasonably priced.We had the Flounder 50% BBQ and 50% sashimi. The Octopus was chopped up and dressed , raw and still wriggling as I swallowed it. Both were absolutely fantastic! The Snow Crab was expensive, we had it steamed. I didnt know crab could be so sweet!Loads of bachan on offer and replenished during the meal.Not a cheap experience but well worth it."
Korean market ,Get to know the Korean traditional market ...smell a bit funny ....go there for some nat geo photos .
a real fish market.....,"This is a real fish market, with an incredible variety of fish - and other creatures - from the sea. You will hardly see such a variety in your home supermarket, as good as they may be. Impressive indeed, unless you are a vegetarian...."
Fresh seafood!!!,"Our tour guide took us here. Bought the fish and lobster on the first floor. Cooked and prepared on the 2nd floor restaurant. Sashimi, steamed lobster, and a requested ramen on the fish broth, plus the traditional Korean side dishes are just the best! Wish we can experience it again."
Oh yeah!!!!!!,"Monstrous building with rows and rows of every kind of fish you can imagine. Tanks of live fish. Ice beds of prepared fish. You select your fish and then you take it upstairs to be prepared to your liking, which is then served to you at your table (either with chairs or traditional low table where you sit on the floor). All the Korean condiments are brought to the table. We had a flounder and had it cut as sashimi, an abalone which was steamed and beautiful shrimp that was grilled. This is the largest fish market in Korea"
Awesome! ,"When in Rome... went all around in the fishmarket and finally settle on octopus, tigershrimp, abalone, scallop and some fish - bought it and then went upstairs to restaurants where it was prepared for lunch. Now raw seafood is a thing so of course that meant in some cases that it was chopped and had some seasoning sprinkled on top. Tasty - and a great experience "
Fresh seafood to see and to eat,"Be sure to visit and feast your eyes on the variety of fresh seafood on the ground floor; seriously, the seafood market is so clean! Dried seafood and cooked seafood is available on the first floor; Prices of seafood hotpots range from KRW30,000 - KRW40,000. Behind the market is an observation deck which will allow you a splendid view of the harbour and of the Yeongdo brige. I also find the stalls outside Jagalchi market to be very interesting ... there are more varied items sold here, like kitchen utensils, shoes, and other household items."
Fish market and the site of Black Panther,"Movie refers to Jagalchi Market but not sure where that club is.If you are visiting the day, there is a fish market on the street. We went to a comprehensive buffet for ~10k won on the 4th or 5th floor of a building. If you see a cola-bar on ground level... you are in the correct place."
Jagalchi Fish Market Busan,Fantastic. So many different kind of fish and sea food. If you visit Busan in South Korea you should visit this fantastic fish market. 
Can’t get fresher seafood than these,"We went on the Princess Kumano Firework Festival Cruise in August 2018. One of the ports of call was Busan, South Korea. After we booked, we were a bit disappointed to find out that the port time in Busan was only from 2pm to 8 pm. Taking into consideration that we had to go through immigration and taking a shuttle from the cruise terminal to downtown and back, time available to explore Busan was very limited indeed. We only had time to visit Jagalchi Fish Market and the BIFF market shopping area. First of all, let me comment on the disembarkation process in Busan from the cruise ship. The process was not very efficient. After the ship has docked, all passengers going onshore independently had to line up to get a number and wait in a designated dining room. Then we had to wait for our numbers to be called and got escorted to the immigration area with a photo copy of our passports (which were given to us the evening before by the cruise ship’s customer service), and processed by Korean Immigration before we could go outside to the shuttle area. We went to the waiting area before 2 pm, and it took us until about 2:30 pm before we could go out. Outside the terminal building, the Busan Bank set up a white kiosk for money exchange. Rate was quite good and service quite efficient. Contrary to previous cruiser comments, the city did not provide free shuttle services. Instead we had to purchase U$10 bus passes from Princess. Considering that the shuttle ride is only about 15 minutes to the BIFF Square and the shuttle buses were all packed, this must be a very profitable operation for somebody. Entrance to the Jagalchi Fish Market was just across the street from the shuttle bus drop off in front of Foret Hotel. We had visited Busan before; so it was not difficult to find our way around. I was especially glad that I found the same store inside the Fish Market (Store No. 116) that we bought seafood from in our last visit over 3 years ago. The store was run by a very nice couple (probably in their 40’s) whom we had no trouble recognizing. It was amazing that they recognized us as well. The listed price for seafood apparently was about the same in all the stores inside the market, so there was not much point in price hunting. This time, our store owners could speak quite fluent English and we could communicate with them easily. The last time we met them was through a restaurant on the second floor. We found one that could speak English, and the restaurant took us downstairs to buy our seafood in this store. This time, the store owner told us that she now owned a restaurant (No. 33) on the second floor. Our party was 16 people. The store owner helped us set up two long tables and select our seafood. We purchased one large abalone, one large scallop, two clams, two big shrimps and one small fish for each person. The abalones, scallops, shrimps and fish were bbq’ed in their own shells and the clams steamed. The restaurant charged us a table fee and cooking fee. The table fee included banshan (side dishes served with Korean meals), but drinks were extra. Since the store owner owned the seafood store and restaurant, we asked her for a discount. The negotiated price worked out to 27,000 KRW ( about U$27) per person for the 16 of us - very reasonable! All the seafood, except the shrimps, were super fresh and tasty!After eating, we went to the observation deck and the back of the market and got a great view of the harbour. We then walk around the outside fish market and browsed around the food stores in the BIFF Square. Very interesting area. The return shuttle trip back to the ship was very crowded. Don’t wait util the last minute!For people who don’t want to be bothered buying seafood from the store and bringing them upstairs for cooking, you can order directly from any of the restaurants in the 2nd floor of Jagalchi Fish Market. For example, a medium size seafood hot pot that can be shared by 2 to 4 people was around 35,000 KRW; and a large one for 4 to 6 people, around 50,000 KRW.  "
Market Visit,"Be sure to try the local delicacies offered around the market area. Fresh seafoods and modest cooking get my tummy happy all the way! Price is a little bit steep. So, try to be modest upon ordering. Spicy Seafood Soup is a must try!"
Worth seeing,"We went there mostly to walk around but ended up walking to the upper level to have something to eat. We were a bit afraid of being scammed as a lot of people complain about the prices.It is true all the restaurant owners try their best to make you sit at their table, and we gave in at number 4 after looking at the menu (seems to be the same almost everywhere) and trying to convey that we wanted to try both grilled fish and sashimi. The lady told us we could have that for 20000WON/person. We sat down even though we were half expecting to have to pay a lot more.We ended up with a lot (a LOT) of food (many side dishes) for the price we agreed on.We might have had special treatment because the lady in charge was desperately looking for clients, but it was a great experience."
Too expensive ,"The seafood is fresh so they are tasty. But, seems that it is too overpriced. The sellers refer to a screen & claim that all price is fixed price. But, seems to be too touristic & pricy. Good for a look. If you have to try, just try the crab & abalone. "
Felt like a tourist trap,"Jagalchi Market is not exactly as how I imagined it, but rather a huge building divided into several floors with different things on each. You can find the live seafood market on the 1st floor, a collection of different small restaurants on the 2nd floor and a guest house, a bigger restaurant, an empty floor and an observation deck on the rest.I really hated my experience here because I felt like I was cheated the whole time I was here. This may be because I have visited Tokyo's Tsukiji Fish Market before and expected Jalgachi to be somewhat similar. If you have a similar expectation, throw it away.The place can be quite intimidating if you don't speak Korean and you're coming here for the first time, as you may not know how the system works. Instead of buying seafood on the first floor and then letting the stall choose the cook that they're working with, we went to the second floor directly and ordered there. Even when we're walking on the second floor, we were constantly haggled by the stalls to patronize them. We can't even walk in peace to decide. Even though some stalls had English menu, the translation was not entirely accurate and we ended up with a dish that we had no idea what it was. In total, we spent about 80,000 won just for dishes, the most we spent for food in our entire Korea trip. I felt really ripped off.I'm not sure about others, but even if the experience was good, the price still felt really steep, and almost all of the stalls on the 2nd floor charged around the same price of 30,000 to 50,000 won per single dish. The market felt more like a tourist trap than an actual market. While the stalls charged tourist prices, they were not able to communicate in English and neither were they have tourist friendly directions.Comparing to Tokyo's Tsukiji Fish Market, Jagalchi left a very bad taste in my mouth, both literally and metaphorically. Suggest you skip this place unless you have a local bringing you here."
Good market!,i just have some time so i toured the market. its very asian style and you can get a various souvenir
Foodies haunt,"Lots of foods. Another market. Tried some of the local “must try” food here, like ssiat hotteok. Delicious, though a bit to sweet. Heck, it’s a holiday, all the sugar caution thrown to the wind. "
Variety restaurant,"We went there for dinner after visit Busan Tower. We just stroll the street and reach there (of course we follow map - kakao map). It takes about 15 - 20 mins walking if im not mistaken. Quite Far but we enjoy it, a modern street full of shop and boutique. For dinner we decide to eat at O Yang Restaurant. The ahjuma who serve us so friendly and nice. We order fish grilled and stew (cant remember the exact name) its nice and the portion is huge we cant finish it (we are 4 in a group - 3 womens & 1 men). The people in jagalchi market also friendly and greet us. They even can say several malay words to attract to you to eat at their place like makan, kakak, sedap and etc."
Amazing place!,"Not only we could buy any seafood or fish you want there, they do have all seafood and fiah alive; that is a good way of garanteeing freshness. Astonishingly clean for a fish market."
Not quite a worth,"A lot of seafood could be found. Price was a bit high though, be prepared that everything was for tourists."
Plenty Of Fresh Seafoods,"Just take a look inside the market , you will see lots of different kind of seafoods , fish, you can buy and bring to your home or you can buy and eat just there, if you visit Busan , you should include in your wishing to visit list."
This is a fish market,Amazing. You can go any time and will see plenty of fish! The restaurant in the second floor is very simple and expensive. But you will eat the best fish!
A great place to taste fresh seafood with reasonable price,"Although I didn't have the time to visit every corner of this market, I really love this place because it's a nice area. I travelled in a group of 8 and we just spontaneously visited a restaurant here. It was the best decision we made in Busan. The restaurant owner gave us a great offer - buy one king crab or snow crab and get a table of about 20 other dishes for FREE! That includes sashimi, korean raw octopus, korean pancakes, fried rice, a hot pot, ... there were so many different dishes that I can't remember them all. But of course the best thing was the king crab. A must-try! The service was really good as well. The owner patiently tried to explain everything to me in English and the staff were very friendly (if you're in Korea, you know how hard it is to communicate). I think this is the name of the restaurant 원 조 자 연 산 횟 집 (본 점) (I tried to type out the Korean words on their business card). Hope this can help!"
"If you love seafood, this is where you should be!","If you love seafood, this is where you should be! Select the seafood you want and they will cook it on the spot for you. Remember to try bargin for better price!"
A must see!,If traveling in Busan this is definitely a must see market! It’s right off the Jagalchi metro stop. Even if you’re not willing to eat there it’s really cool to just walk through. You won’t be sorry!
Interesting fish market with tonnes of fresh seafood,A must-go in Busan. Many interesting type of seafood and local delights. We were very intrigued by the various species. There are also a lot of seafood restaurants that allow you to have your fresh produce cooked and consumed upstairs. 
Seafood and more seafood,"If you like seafood and don’t mind the smell, then this is the place for you. There are stalls after stalls selling the same to you and I suppose it all comes down to how well you can bargain. The owners are able to converse in several languages here, albeit with limited vocabulary. "
Fresh Seafood,Go here for the freshest seafood. Pick out what you want to eat and then have it prepared upstairs. Great start to the day.
Generic Korean Fish Market,"It was quite impressive on how they are so organised but I am not so surprised after being exposed on how fish markets are in South Korea. It is always nice how they stacked the fish and seafood and I got to see a few interesting things which I never got to see from my hometown. But other than that, its just okay. But I can recommend to spend a little time to take the photography of the normal daily life of fishermen and sellers. It's always nice to take photo of seafood and its products. While I'm on it, they are a lot of restaurants outside the compound and inside the market building. It smelled delicious as f*ck and they're definitely fresh although it could be a bit pricey."
Fish market in busan,"Coming back to busan town from gamcheon market we took taxi about 15 minutes trip. We saw many seafood sellers along the wet street. It’s kind of traditional market specifically selling live seafood. Then we go into a seafood store where you will meet some seafood sellers where they can cook the fresh seafood or making sashimi.We ended looking around at the corner of the store. We bought 2 pieces abalone, 2 pieces sea pineapple, 2 pieces cockles, and 1 small octopus. We asked them to steam it instead of making sashimi. It cost 40,000 won for the seafood mentioned above."
Must try “San nak gee “,"San-nak-gee is a Octopus Actually, it is death but it is still like alive I eat a big meal here There are a lot of restaurant, a lot of food but I think it is same you should choose some restaurant "
Impressive but not so crazy,"So yes its quite impressive to see all of those seafood but if you have been to Tokyo, live on the seaside, its just a big seafood market and honestly its quite pricey. Better go outside, there are a lot of small vendors and smaller restaurant, look where they do some seafood discount and get some, that's what I did and I ended up with a great deal, 3 times cheaper than the market. And really good quality.Best deal for westerners are the clams, mussels, crab, scallop, sea snail, eel or sashimiAn area to look quickly after seeing the Gamcheon Village"
Go for fresh fish and the atmosphere,"This is the place to go to buy fresh fish in Busan. It's actually just fun to wander around the fish stalls to marvel at the variety of seafood!We go there to buy live fish and eat upstairs the fish we just purchased. You pick out the seafood and pay for the fish (sold by weight) and then have them take your purchase upstairs to one of the restaurants (you can choose the restaurant or have the fishmonger pick someone they usually work with) to eat. The restaurant will assess a table charge (which includes a few side dishes) as well as charge for soju and other drinks. There will also be a cooking or steaming charge depending what you purchased.Although pricey, we love to buy fresh LIVE Russian King Crabs (only available as frozen legs from Alaska in the USA), get them steamed at a restaurant upstairs and finish the meal by having the restaurant mix rice with the crab juices left in the shells for a unique bibimbap! The cost per kilo for the King Crab varies depending on the season and holiday dates."
Rather disappointjng,"Actually the fish market was rather ok, but the whole experience was destroyed by the exorbitant price we had to pay for dinner at Jacky’s seafood. Only found out that we should have avoided it completely after reading more reviews about this place and that they had 2 prices, one for locals and one for tourists. It was a pity, what this place might become in future if things don’t change and they continue to overcharge tourists. Even though we were told by Jacky (apparently the guy who has his pictures all on media pictures) that we will be given discounts, it was only a sales gimmick which made us feel comfortable at first. Hope this review warns others who intend to visit this place, to avoid the dining areas there and nearby. The street food would have been a better choice! "
Seafood market ,"It’s a bucket list thing - once and prob won’t return. Typical wet market, lots of fresh seafood, water splashing all over your feet.Fresh seafood, too many choices. Fresh abalone sashimi is not that nice afterall. It’s so chewy!!! We also had a fried fish and it’s not difficult to get a nice piece of fried fish since it’s fresh from the aquarium.Many shops is equipped with an English menu. Most of them can’t speak English but noticed that some could. Not the most comfortable place to dine either.. But good to go once just to see what is this all about. "
Nothing much for me,A market with lots of fresh seafood but very much prefer Tsukiji fish market. So-so place for me sand perhaps a place to visit if you absolutely love seafood. 
Check the pricing before order. ,Seafood is a bit pricy. If you have a Korea driver or tour guide … ask them to help you order food. They have 2 price list for tourist and local. 
Amazing to see.,"Incredible sights, whether fish, sea weed, shell fish and plenty of places for fresh fish.Eat on street after buying fish or first floor in market.Cost about $25 USD for bbq fresh fish with 10 sode dishes.A must go place."
Fish fish and more fish!,"Came here for lunch after a morning T the cultural village. we had a fun time browsing the shops and the picked a place for lunch. Unfortunately most places are in Korean with little English. Universal sign language is the way to go here!We managed to order with the help of a photo menu - seafood soup was DELICIOUS, grilled fish and abalone. All for a measly KRW 90,000! And all fresh! Amazing to try. We were too chicken to try the sea worm or the flat looking eel that they cook on coals when it’s still moving... "
Lunch at the market,"We were at the market for lunch. We went to Jacky’s Seafood which was recommended by other travelers. The owner was very friendly and welcoming. The food was good. The sashimi was very fresh. The prices were not cheap though. It was the most expensive meal of our trip.As for the market itself, we found the outdoor market more interesting than the indoor one. And it was worth checking out the observation deck on 8/F of the Jagalchi Market building."
Just another fish market in a great location,"Yes, go to Jagalchi, not for the fish market but for the general area. The fish market itself was okay - fish for sale with lots of stalls upstairs serving food not that different to most stalls / restaurants in Korea. Enjoyed a sashimi bibimbap which was very good.The best of Jagalchi is the BIFF square market across the road - in my opinion the best street market we experienced in Busan and Seoul. The Lotte department store next door in the Aqua centre has the best in-store food market we saw. Better food and better prices compared to the fish market and more choice - but it it’s a mall which we generally avoid! "
Fresh fishes in outdoor stalls,Interesting fish market with many stalls selling fresh fish. Although pales when compared to Noryangjin Fish Market 3 years ago. Visited the restaurant in a building next to the market - only a few stalls are opened. A nice introduction to fish market but not as impressive as expected.
Your typical fish market ,"Huge place but nothing very special, seafood seemed pretty expensive. Worth a quick look and nothing more."
Eat there as fishermen do,"On the 3rd floor, there is a small restaurant called Mangum Shiktang where you can have a self service korean breakfast at US$6 consisting of dried fish, spicy tofu soup, steamed rice and pickles etc"
"Jagalchi Fish market, Busan, Korea","Very interesting and busy market.Here you will see all possible strange creatures from the deep seas next to the normal catch.Some of the fish are still living; others are cleaned for the knowing customers.Next to the maket, quay-side you can see many moored trawlers.Around the vending hall are stalls and small restaurants to savour the fresh fish.A must to see when visiting Busan."
Tourist trap,"It's a large seafood market and it's fun watching all that seafood. Just don't eat at the restaurants on the second floor. Total rip off. Take your money elsewhere. We ordered seafood hotpot and besides a few clams and tiny slices of squid and a couple of little blue crabs, all there was was radish, radish, and more radish. We've had the same dish in Seoul, Incheon and Gangwondo, and they were overflowing with seafood and for a lesser price too. With the influx of Chinese tourists, Jagalchi market has become a tourist trap."
Must do in Busan,Impressive large sea food market. The outside part is the best. Were older women try to keep the cought fish fresch. Inside you can eat the freshest fish of all time. 
"BEST Seafood Market in Korea, ... a MUST Visit!","like in my previous reviews of restaurants, hotels and airlines, I have been busy travelling both business and leisure that I have not had the time to write any reviews. was a 7 day trip to Korea on business survey. we stopped by in Busan for 1 night and decide to go to this ""Famous"" Jagalchi Market.This is one of the 10 landmarks of Busan, so many tourists visit there.you've got the street like market and the indoor market. believe me, its spectacular! theres also lots of Seafood Restaurants around (please make sure you and the shopkeeper write down in black and white wat you ordered to prevent misunderstandings). inside the ""mall-like"" market, you could buy fresh live seafood and bring up to the second level and get them to cook it for you for a fee, pretty reasonable (like I mention earlier, make sure you write down in black and white).overall experience 9/10 ... will be back thats for sure!"
Enjoyable seeing the variety of food ,"We took the bus from Gamcheon Culture Village and walked to Jagalchi Market. It was fun strolling by the food stalls and seeing the wide variety of sight fresh seafood, fruits, kimchi and pickled food. "
"Live and bustling fish market, must visit. Next to shopping alley with cheap goods.","This fish market is exotic, terrifying, and intriguing all at the same time. In some of the fish shops are little tents in the back where you can have charcoal fire stoves that heat the pans for the fish. Cut live right there fresh out of the ocean and into your tummy.Just one street up, parallels to the fish market are shops with lots of random things and cheap clothing and shoes as well as local goods at local's prices. Worth a visit for Busan if you're into a cultural experience."
Over rated tourist site ,The place was the first spot we visited after arriving in Busan and we found it underwhelming. The market outside was much more interesting and cheaper. The stores and items are rather pricey. Since we weren’t keen on seafood and the stores were also quite ‘pushy’ we decided to have our meal outside along the BIFF square area which had more options and things to do. 
Fresh seafood with a reasonable price ,"You can enjoy fresh and live seafoods here. Name it from King crab (starting from 50,000w~ small), fishes, octopus and more. "
Seafood Lovers Heaven,"Massive fish market of epic proportions where you can buy pretty much anything that calls the sea home.The smell and the cleanliness leaves something to be desired, but naturally this is to be expected when it comes to the wares on offer.The whole area is noisy and slightly uncivilized but it's worth a visit, even if you don't eat seafood and it's just to have a look."
seafood everywhere!,"The Jaglachi fish market was on our bucket list of places to see after reading multiple reviews. We have never seen so much live seafood in bulk in our life and is difficult to determine what one would like to eat. The first floor houses all of the material to cook which is brought upstairs and is cooked. The second floor has many different vendors who are willing to cook the seafood and they will come up to you and try to talk you into eating at their place. The outdoor fish market is separate and is also overwhelming with many, many vendors selling seafood and food items. One must be careful when walking the outdoor market as the motor scooters and motorcycles wind through the walkways and you have to get out of their way! After walking the outdoor market, we decided on a place where we picked out eel, fish and baby octopus. All of it was fresh and we got to pick out what we wanted! The baby octopus was one of the highlights as it was still moving after it had been cut up into bite site pieces. All of the food was delicious! It was something that will stay in our memories."
NOW THIS IS A FISH MARKET!!,"nampo, biff square and jagalchi fish market are situated close to each other. when you enter the building, you’d be amazed at all the sea creatures they have. from fish to eels to sea cucumbers/slugs to crustaceans (and i mean the largest korean king crab!!). if you book a city tour, u get to have a photo taken with the king crab. any seafood you buy from the 1st floor, you can have it cooked and eaten on the 2nd floor. you just have to pay the cooking/sauce fee. if you can’t speak korean, it’s better to take the tour because the ladies and gents in this market don’t speak english at all. overall this is a nice experience."
"Smell the see, and so much bargain","We went there actually for the Seafood buffet(OASE) that located in Market building.. unfortunately we went there and found out they no longer operating. Decided to walk around in actual market and bumped in to so much ladies who wants us to go in and eat in their restaurant. They literally speaking Chinese to us although we are obviously not Chinese (sigh). Don’t get me wrong. it was great experience overall, it is so alive there, atmosphere is different and smelling and look at all those fresh fishes and seafood... makes you hungry even if you are not a fan of seafood. But some places are overpriced for sure, recommend to go deeper inside so you can enjoy your meal with decent price and feel actual marketplace atmosphere!"
Over rating and over prising ,"As a must see attraction in Busan,we went to Jagalchi fish market, take a look and find king crab or winter crab to eat but when I asked for the price we choose to eat somewhere else, it costs 90k won for a kg king crab, 70k won a kg winter crab which is much more than I pay in Norway."
Interesting place,It is a big indoor and outdoor seafood markets with so many stalls and stands selling all kinds of seafood. Interesting for whoever not seen an oriental seafood market before.
Large Seafood Market,"The seafood market is huge and has an amazing variety of seafood. Street food and other restaurants around the area are also good, though the best here is obviously the seafood. It's interesting to see the fish market, but not everybody enters it as it's very smelly. It's a must go as it's interesting, unless you can't take the smell or are allergic to seafood."
The food is expensive here,"Local seafood market - you can choose your seafood and they will cook for you. I think the food is not as tasty as the food in Seoul - not to my taste buds, at least. The price is quite expensive too, despite the market being one of the largest seafood market."
The largest seafood market in Korea,Interesting to see all sorts of seafood available in this market. The sellers were friendly and introduced their products to us. Nearby is the port and you can have some rest time by enjoying the breeze and seagulls
Sea food experience at its best ,Sea food experience at its best Lots of stands selling all kinds of sea food fish crabs sea cucumbers octopus clams and much more every thing fresh clean and cooked on the spot. Visit all the floors and around the main building. 
can try local seafood,"we can try local seafood there but the some shops are dishonest, they provided food with false weight."
fresh seafood at affortable prices,"We went there twice last week for dinner last week. We tried different restaurants. The first time we had our food at a seafood restaurant close to the seafood market. Food was very fresh but pricy. On the second night, we went into Jagalchi market building, a few stories building. There are over 50 seafood stalls in the building, selling different types of live fish, iced and flesh shellfish on its ground floor. We bought a few types of live seafood from one of the stalls, then the seller brought us to the second level for cooking and eating at a very local eatery. We saw quite a lot of local peoples having dinners on the second floor of this seafood market. Over dozens of eateries are there to provide simple seafood cooking service and drinks. There are also a lot of dry food stalls back of the same second floor, selling seaweed & dried seafood. Prices and cooking charges were more reasonable within the building, as compared to those restaurants on the road side close to the market."
Fun spot to see freshest seafood ,We arrived mid morning (9:30 am) on a Saturday and the place was bustling with vendors and fresh seafood. The conch/ clam market was open Saturday morning too and we noted it was closed Sunday when we went back. The seafood was jumping literally out of their containers and onto the floor. Expect to get a bit wet by flying seafood. I got squirted by a clam or two as well. They just project water at unsuspecting tourists that walk by. We went back Sunday afternoon and the seafood was really limp comparatively and the tanks half empty. Not sure if they deliver fresh on Saturdays but seems like a totally different experience based on day of visit. 
Soooo good,"I think we over paid but it was worth it we got fish, crab and loster all fried or grilled the fish itself cost 90000 wan cooking including drinks 38000 won"
Fresh Seafood cook on the spot,This market is really actually a building where the ground floor shops sells you all kind of fresh seafood and once you buy any - you can straight head upstairs to be cooked freshly for you.
Free nightview of busan city and bridges,"Jagalchi market allows you to get to one of their skyscraper buildings, where you can enjoy your free night view experience with anybody you love!They have several binocular-telescopes which you can zoom in to find a single person on the ground! Be aware; no air-conditioning system equipped, avoid going there when it is freezing"
Great market,Lots of live seafood on sale. There are also some freshly cooked seafood stalls with yummy food for sale. Well worth a visit.
Didn’t really enter the building ,This market is in a building.. we didn’t even manage to enter the building because we were walking around outside on the way to the market there are a lot of restaurants and we have already eaten before reaching.. I managed to went in to have a look and somehow got a fishy smell and I come out...
Fresh seafood,Rows and rows of live fresh seafood. Some of them still wriggling as they cook it.Interesting visit and meal!
A Highlight of Our visit to Busan -- Must See if You are Into Seafood,"Granted, this place is not for everybody. But we loved it. Coolest fish market in South Korea. Huge market area, indoors. Most of the seafood here is still alive. All this fish are on the main floor, with the restaurant / eating areas on the second. Find seafood you are interested in, purchase from a vendor (vendor will usually call someone from upstairs), and the folks upstairs will prepare the seafood how you would like it. Plus, they serve some sides dishes with it. A fantastic experience, and great seafood!"
Great seafood ,Many seafood stalls to choose from. You may ask for the price first then if you're ok with the price they will bring you to upper floor. They will charge you 4000 won each and 5000 won for cooking fees. The fish is really fresh. Pricing is really cheap but it depends on what you order
best food!!!,"i came here on my birthday and was so amazed to see live fishes, sea shells, crabs and lobster! i ate in one of the restaurants across, ordered a lobster and got a fried flounder for free! the lobster is so fresh you can fell it in every bite- so delicious!!!!"
Spectacular,"If you are in Busan, go to this MArket in the morning. It is amazing. It is large, large, large. It has twoo floors. IN the first one many different positions selling myriads of different fishes and seafood... ALIVE!!! The system is certainly clever. Since t is locate in the harbor, there is a continues running of sea water, so that all fishes are in recipients. You selecet what you wish and they will prepare the ,material for you at the moment. BUT, ask them to prepare it to eat in the mArket. Most places are connected to a business in the second floor where you would go and tell the people how to prepare them to eat everything there. An amazing experiende. In the second floor there is also a big market of other goodies. From there you can visit the INternational Market outside Jagalchi. "
Fishy fishy,"It was almost 1030am by the time we got there so not much crowds. Stalls by the sideroads and inside main building were selling all types of seafood, 5 to 6 types of fresh seaweeds and kelp plus some ahjumas were chucking mussells for cooking, cleaning fish to air dry or coaxing us to step in and have a meal. And so we did.We had 3 types of fish, all broiled and delicious. Outside crispy but sweet inside. Mixture of oggie, prawns, crabs, mussels and fish balls make the stock even better. Many kimchi side dishes came with the meal. It was a satisfying meal."
Live fish and other mysteries,"I have been to the Jagalchi Fish markets every trip to Busan over the last 9 years and I still see something I haven't noticed before - this time it was Sea Squirts! I have been going to the same stall owner who remembers me. This market is teeming with live fish, eels, crabs, prawns, Busan oysters, scallops, and lots more. You purchase your selection and the stall owner prepares it for you - Sashimi thanks! You can take away to eat at home, or have it delivered to you in the restaurant on the 1st floor. Have tried both. This fish market is the largest and has the best selection of any I have visited in the world, which keeps me coming back. Well worth a visit. Wear rubber sole shoes as there is a lot of water on the floor. Prices are reasonable for what you get."
Overrated ,"Like a market, very commercialize. The stall vendor expects tourists everyday, most of them can speak simple English. Seafood itself 1 price, have to pay another price for cooking them. Not fantastic, I would say overrated. "
A must see,This is really a must see when you visit Busan or Asia in general a stop at a fish market is definitely necessary. I went to this one a few times while living in Busan teaching English and took my family there when they came to visit. It's a great way to see some authentic local culture and eat fresh fish. There is a fish guy upstairs I don't remember his name but he has a little restaurant with a few tables and posters of himself on TV and the news. If you walk around you can't miss him. He speaks English very well and loves foreigners so he may chase you down. I suggest eating at his place as he is also genuinely entertaining.
Fresh seafood,What an interesting place to find all sorts of fresh and exotic seafood. Scenic view from the harbour. Seafood is rather pricey but woryh it.
Great taste of seafood,"If you are looking for seafood restaurant, this is the place. The seafood taste great, and they also offer beer and soju. "
An education,This had to be seen to believe so much fish and such a variety the smell for the first 10min was stronge but once we got in away from the warm air at the door you couldn't smell any thing they are so lucky to have this so readily available 
Huge and colourful!,"This is a vast market, with lots to see and to eat - fresh! It is open all day long and close to the Jagalchi metro station."
World’s best fish market!,"As you enter this large multi story port side “fish market “ you’re in aye of the massive amounts of live seafood and selections of spices. After spending quite some time studying our choice for dinner, we walked to the second floor and found a chef to prepare a delicious meal with the fish we picked. Wonderful meal! Do plan to return."
When in Busan...eat seafood,"Located 5min walk from Jagalchi station, we visited late morning and the market was well stocked of various live and non-live seafood.The market itself has indoor and outdoor sections. There were several outdoor stalls that had seating for eating with prices (before bargaining) clearly marked. the indoor market on the ground floor have a wider selection compared to the outside section and on the level above, dining is possible.The surrounding area of Jagalchi market have shops that were selling basic crockery, knives and other fishing-related utensils."
Cheapest market to buy SEAFOOD!,"As fish/sea-food lover, we went to buy fish and grilled at our villas. We bought plenty of them and price was cheaper comparing to other markets.Go to first floor to get more choices!"
JACKY'S SEAFOOD RESTAURANT TOP !,"We found this great seafood restaurant, thank to Lonely Planet, located inside Jagalchi Market. We had an awesome dinner ! They have a good variety of seafood and we had sea urchin, octopus with tomatoes and peppers, a sashimi that in Korea has a different name and they eat it with sesame and salad leaves, peppers, garlic and 3 different sauces, oysters, and a taste of yellow tails. In the end Jacky who's very nice and fluent English speaking offered us a delicious fish soup and other gifts such as cans of Korean tea, shot glasses, a book. It was one of the best dinner I had in South Korea."
"Huge seafood market, food cooked and eaten on spot","Definitely a must go!Buy your seafood on the first floor, eat it on the 2nd. Doesn’t get more fresh than this.Don’t forget to bargain!"
Live seafood in fish tank,"Outer market was good, we were able to see the authenticity of locals buying fishes from the stalls. Do expect that this is one of the tourists places, hence the restaurants at the outer market will tend to pull customers for dining in. Expect to see fishes being skinned and slaughtered as this is a fish market with a lot of living fishes in tanks. The inner market was a little bit boring, though. Ground floor is packed with fish stalls which allowed visitors to buy seafood for the restaurants at second floor to cook, this however, according to some friends, will be charged extra. "
Fresh Fish and Near the Sea,I walk alongside where there are many fish around. If you afraid of smell you can consider going here. And so many unique sea fish and shell.
Lot of seafood,"Level one you can buy fresh seafood and level 2 is eateries place where you can sit, order food and eat. There are many eateries places and a lot of customers. Food is relatively expensive but you like seafood you will not look to the price. It is tasty and also a special experience."
Winter trip ,If you visit Busan it’s a must to visit the fish market!We had a window seat on the “floor” and the sea view was fantastic. The service and food excellent:)
It’s Amazing and mind blowing!,"Alight at Jagalchi station (Line 1) and exit 10, Turn Right onto samgil street and Walk for 3 minutes, Turn Left and you See the market when the whole place is wet and damp regardless of the weather.All sorts of seafood can be found here. It’s guaranteed fresh because the seafood are handled instantly by the “ajumma”. These ladies are really skilled in handling these seafood. I’m amazed by how skilful they are and the size of the seafood. It’s all so huge and standard, just like factory produced. Dried seafood, live ones, and so Long you make your request heard, they will be ready to prepare the seafood the way you want. Drop by the building and go to level 7F and take the stairs up to the observatory deck. Providing anyone a beautiful view of the port. "
Fresh Seafood,"We only came to browse. There is an observation deck on the 7th (top) floor. The seafood vendors are all selling fresh seafood - crab, fish, octopus, shrimp. You can buy the food and take it to one of the restaurants on the floor above for them to cook. Since we were full eating street food, we didn't eat here."
Fresh seafood and a must visit ,"You must visit it and have a meal in their seafood restaurant. I had my lunch at Jacky's Seafood restaurant - try their seafood hotpot, nakji (live octopus), and other foods. BIFF Square is nearby too! "
Seafood everywhere...,Here you will see all kinds of sealife - albeit almost all of the stalls selling the same kind. We didn’t buy any but just walk around while vendors owners try to sell you their stuffs. For a fish market - it’s actually quite clean. 
Seafood paradise,"If you can take the fishy smell, take a walk at the market, you will find many surprises. If you’re brave enough, try live octopus! Restaurant owners are pretty aggressive towards tourists but try walking further in, you will be able to fetch cheaper price for seafood. Portion is reasonable and seafood is fresh! Try their soju!"
Seafood Paradise,"This place is not an option. You MUST come here for seafood when you are in Busan.There are so many kinds of seafood to choose from.I personally recommend the Snow Crab, Giant Lobster, Grill Eel and live Octopus.You can either go into the market building where you can choose which seafood you like to have and they will prepare for you the way you like.Or you could venture at the individual shops/restaurants just outside and enjoy the same. The only difference is that in shops/restaurants, you can enjoy ur meal is a less noisy environment and the condiments you get is ridiculously endless.Highly recommend to get them to fry their seaweed rice within the crab body shell or the lobster head shell. You will not regret it.Let me know if you want details of the shops shown in the pictures."
great fresh seafood,"This place is definitely an experience. Downstairs-you walk through vendors selling every type of seafood you can imagine (& some you've never even heard of) and pick out your seafood. You can haggle with them on price, especially if you're buying a lot of seafood. You will then go upstairs where they cook/prepare your food. You will get lots of different side dishes as well. There is a small fee to prepare your food and for the sides (less than $10). You can also order alcohol up there. We even had them prepare a stew with the fish heads from our sashimi. The crab is fantastic! Very cool experience-definitely worth the journey and the smell."
Best place to have fresh seafood,I still find this place the best place to have the freshest seafood. However please be very careful when you are choosing stall to have your meal at. Lots of bargain need to be done else you will be charged expensively.
Great view at the back of the Market,"Roaming around the market gives you a good vibe. Although, smaller than Tsukiji Market in Tokyo, Jagalchi is fun and an exciting place to explore the fresh food.It's fun to interact with the vendors and they get to teach you a thing or two in the secret of eating raw seafood.Head over to the back of the Jagalchi Market, nearing sunset, and you get a spectacular view worth clicking your cameras, double time. The view is AMAZING."
Worth seeing,"Plenty to see here in this rather large fish market. Plenty of trading going on, well worth a visit."
Fun and Unique,"Lots of neat creatures all around you. It was fun to try to guess what some of them were. Then, you can walk across the sidewalk, to inside of the building and there are food stalls that will actually cook these creatures for you to eat. Lots of fun and a must see when visiting Busan. "
Worth a visit ,I have attended this fish market many times. You will see fish still live that you can buy and order to be cooked and eaten on site. It is always a fun place to go. Not typically a western market with stainless steel but you will see tubs of fish on offer. Prepare to walk around in a little bit of water. 
Went for seafood lunch,"This is the place that offer best price with best portion of food in our trip to South Korea. You can just visit any seafood place there (the restaurant) and they will give you so much side dish that you can refill! And on top of that, they give the tofu stew as complimentary food (since we only order the fish menu for three person, it turn out that we can eat that for 4 people."
Impressive for a european!),Definitely must do when in Busan!)Both for a gastro tour and sightseeing. Great port view from the top!
Pricey,Foods ok but too pricey. Abalone porridge not nice and can't see abalone inside the porridge it cost 20000won per bowl for one person. We order 4 bowl and separate into 8 small bowl. I think i won't go to any others seafoods in Seoul anymore because i guess the foods about the same and pricey. 
Seafood Lovers Paradise,Excellent place to find the best variety of fresh seafood. You can take it home or select it and eat it there. The restaurants are available on the 2nd Floor.
Worth a visit for an experience......,"This market is probably the most famous must visit attraction in Busan.Jagalchi market is actually a standalone building by itself & not the whole place . But there are few other markets within & around Jagalchi market.Here you get to see various fresh live seafood for sale. The stallholders are always pushing their merchandise to you whenever you are near. Prices seems to be same in every stall.Its not cheap, after adding extra cooking cost at restaurants on 2nd floor.This market is similar to Seoul's Noryangjin Fish market but much smaller with lesser varieties.The live seafood on sale in Noryangjin are much bigger in size & much wider range. Its a good experience to come here & browse the other markets as well. And try the seafood if you don't mind the high prices"
An Hour Here Is Not Long Enough,For the souvenir hunter there are plenty of shops offering all sorts of goods in exchange for you money. There are clothing shops and even tailors to make you that desired garment. For the shopper it's a great spot but for those disinclined to shop it would be the time-tunnel to hell where streets and shops blend into the horizon. Bargaining is possible.
Expensive,We came here for fresh seafood with our private tour guide. Chose seafood on level 1 n went to level 2 to get them cooked. The seafood in the photo cost 90k₩ and the cooking was another 50k₩. A lot of locals eat there but they do not pay such high price. Not worth it as fresh seafood is everywhere not only in jagalchi market. 
A beautiful visit for those who loves markets,"Smaller than the Tsukiji market in Tokyo (Japan), the Jagalchi market is very interesting to visit.The market is divided in 2 parts. In the fresh seefood you can see all sorts of fish, squids, eels, shellfish... and workers preparing the seafoods. In the dried seefood area you have dried fish and seefood.In or near the Jagalchi market you have restaurants and you can eat fresh fish (sashimi for example)."
Get lost and eat,"A busy busy place with many stalls - food, clothing... lots of opportunities to photograph and take in what busan’s markets have to offer. A great few hours spent "
Not as expected,"The food quite over price. We ordered marinate crab (40,000w). It was too salty and we’d got only medium size crabs. In Seoul, you’ll get 4 large crabs (38,000w- Prosoy; taste much better)This is our first time for the red sea squirt. It was sour and bitter. I will definitely not eat it again lol. We also ordered spicy eel but it was a different type of eel. It was chewy and a little bit bitter. This meal is 130,000w( crab,eel,assorted sea shell). However, we saw many local ordered sashimi. I guess we should do more research about the food here."
Worth a visit,"Our tour group stopped here and we quickly walked through. I was greatly impressed at how clean everything is. I even saw an octopus escape the wading pool he was trapped in (just like Finding Dory!) I wish there had been customers so we could have seen some bartering, but I think we were visiting near closing time."
So much fish. A photographers dream,"We spent quite a while walking through the modern building that houses the fish market, on the dockside. Afterwards we found an equally enjoyable outdoor section with even more photogenic opportunities. Fascinating. It goes on for several hundred metres and we have never seen so much seafood and such variety. "
San-nakji!,"If you've ever wanted to eat live octopus (san-nakji in Korean), then this is the place! We chose our own baby octopus and other seafood items on the first floor, then the fish monger walked us up to the 2nd floor where they prepared everything. All decently priced and very convenient experience."
Seafood Market,"It was easy getting there. Took the subway from Busan to Jagalchi, Exit 10. Turn right and walk for 5 minutes and turn left. Visited the market on a Monday morning at about 1040am and it was crowded! The road leading to the market were lined with fishcake shops, clothing stalls that sells fish(!?), salted fish shops, fruits and rice puff stores. Be careful of vehicles when crossing road.The pavement in the market is wet, so tread carefully. Lines and lines of sellers displaying fresh seafood such as cutlass fish, seabreams, squids, shellfish etc.After a while, most of the items are repetitive. One could get a basket of large clams for 10,000 wons. However, that store is unable to cook for us. So we went to search for a restaurant to dine in.Most do not speak English and we found one shop called Chungmu Hoetjip with English menu."
For sea food lovers ,"It’s a market with lot many sea food options. There are places which will prepare and give the food as well. On the opposite side of road is Gakji market which I think is better for someone who isn’t that great fan of sea food. There are multiple street food options there with lot many shops of clothes, shoes, souvenirs etc."
Great place for seafood,Easily accessible by subway. Many restaurants around Jagalchi market. You can eat in restaurants or buy your seafood and have them cooked. Always better if the restaurant has a fresh seafood selection you can pick from especially those fronting the Jagalchi market. Great eats for less than USD100.
Impressed by variety! ,I was impresed by the various types of fish and sea weed but the smell was killing me as I'm not so fond of this tipe of smell . A good experience to have if you visit korea for the first time.
Traditional Fish Market,"I like this place because it's truly authentic even though lots of tourists visit it now. I was here twenty years ago before the tourists came and, despite the new building, it's the same. Enjoy seeing all the food from the sea and don't miss the chance to eat some of the grilled fish outside in the market. Kids will enjoy this place. "
Fish,That was all about I could think at this place. The scene from Home alone 2. It really smelled there like fish rather than freedom.
Tourist be informed,"For people who don't speak much Korean, it's like a tourist trap. Most vendors will speak languages other than Korean English, Chinese, japanese....etc. as you walk by, they will try to usher you into their stall. There is an indoor structure and an outside part. If you want to try some of the seafood, do try to bargain. 10-20% off or a free beer.... Prices will vary from vendor to vendor. Most place will serve prepared food if you buy from them free of charge. I got prepared raw octopus, still moving for 6000 won (they won't serve it to me whole, says that it's too dangerous). I added a steam fish, bbq scallops, some kind of raw clam and a free beer and banchan for a total about 45000 won. Very pricey, but it's the experience. Probably won't do it again, unless I have a local friend that will do the buying. "
One of the cleanest Fish markets,"Walk around downstairs and see the fish, crabs, eels, shell fish and some 'things' that I am not sure we should be eating and then go upstairs with a view out of the bay and eat fish that you know is as fresh as you are likely to get. I was there on a Sunday and there was a street market that extended well beyond the Jagalchi market, looks like it is there everyday. Free to enter."
Awesome experience! ,"Highly recommended for seafood lovers! I went with a group of unsure individuals, but they followed my lead. We picked out a lobster and redfish, then took them upstairs for them to cook a great spread for us. It cost about $30/person and worth every penny. "
See-food seafood,"Right out of Jagalchi Station, one could start shopping and eating even before reaching the market. Anyways, we were early and went to Jagalchi Market building. Ventured to the basement and only a handful of stalls were open. An enthusiastic ahjumma waved us over to her stall and we decided to have bibimbap (rice with mixed veggies and egg) and fried fish with rice set - breakfast of champions.We visited the dried seafood section at 1st floor - bought some dried fish meat snacks, almonds, dried clams, seaweed. Generally the prices were about the same at all stalls. However some vendors were a tad friendlier and gave more ""service"" eg. extra handfuls of food items bought or free tasting. Some were a little light-handed at the weighing scales and some of us ended up with average higher cost :(We skipped the fresh seafood section at ground floor and ventured to the fresh seafood vendors outside the market. Bought giant sized prawns and clams for dinner :) There were other markets around Jagalchi but we didn't have time to visit them - next visit!"
Amazing market,We just loved wandering through this market. Never seen so many varieties of sea life for sale. Some I had no idea what they were. Would have been nice to know what they do with some of the sea creatures I saw! Perhaps a tour? You can eat there if you are brave but we skipped it. The locals have very limited knowledge of English but were very friendly. As for the dried fish market- amazing and very wired things for sale! Go check it out!
Authentic Korean Fish Market,It is so mesmerizing seeing the fresh seafood laid out in the open for the public to pick to eat at the restaurant. Truly authentic and delicious. Had to pick fried fish and grilled octopus and it was the best ! 
A popular seafood market,"We came here using metro line 1, stopping at Jagalchi station (exit 7). Then, its a 5-10 mins walk to the market. We passed many stalls selling fresh seafood meals before reaching the main building. Inside the main building on the ground floor, you can see many types of fishes, octopus, squids, mussels, eels, prawns, crabs, mussels, oysters and other marine life swimming in tanks, basins and aquariums. You can select fresh seafood to be cooked and served in the many eateries on the 1st floor. The market was fairly big and outside the main building in an adjoining shed, you can see many locals buying fishes and other marine products. Good experience walking around here."
Fresh Seafood ,You may purchase seafood on the 1st floor then have a vendor cook it on the 2md floor. The seafood no doubt is fresh. The price is slightly high. Communicating with the first floor vendor could be difficult in English. 
So-called World Class Fish Market,"Probably worth a visit just for its historical value and how it evolved into Korea's largest fish market. It began during the Korean War when mothers hawked fish in order to provide for their families. They were referred to as the ""Aunties."" Of you want to see many species of seafood this is the place. However, be prepared for the odor of fish beyond its prime, but apparently still edible. You'll find many Aunties selling fish camped out on the curb and fish being held in unsanitary conditions. There is also a large hall on pier side with many conventional stalls, too. I rate this attraction poor as similar markets across the Sea of Japan are superior. "
Traditional Asian fish market maybe a little strange for westerners,"My wife and I who grew up in Taiwan felt quite like at home about this place and had a great time enjoying the seafood dishes that were hard to find in the U.S. -- Not so much for my 6 and 7 years old kids who grew up in the states. They were amazed by the variety of sea ""animals"" there were at the market and the hospitality shown by the shop owners but couldn't quite get over the (lack of) cleanliness for a traditional market. Overall it was a good experience."
Great food,This is the biggest seafood market in Korea. It is so huge and you can find variety of seafood on the 1st floor. We went to 2nd floor and enjoy the seafood dinner there. The seafood is fresh and taste delicious 
smells of fish!,"You can already feel the overpowering odour of sea creatures in the air as you approach Jagalchi Fish Market. No amount of deodorant can save you from this. After all, this is Busan, a large port city so it’s natural that Korea’s largest seafood market is right here. Located in the Nampo-dong district in Busan, there is all manner of sea creatures up for sale, even ones I’ve never seen before in my life.There are restaurants in the market that serves some of these fresh seafood. I have a feeling seafood is a staple around Busan, being a port, with water and ocean all around us. The sea of seafood restaurants gave that away too."
Freshest Seafood You'll Ever See!,"Most seafood markets or vendors will have fresh seafood but the extent is limited since majority of the time it'll be packed away in ice unless it was crabs or lobsters. Not here! Jagalchi Market is unique in a way where they keep all their catches of the day, alive and as fresh as can be! How amazing is that?Whether you're looking for fish, shellfish, or even something new and unique -- they can all be found here. I'm telling you, there are some where I have never encountered in my life or know the names of. It was the craziest thing. I loved it.And the people here are so nice. The majority are elderly and probably won't know English but they will still try to be helpful. One man saw me looking at squids and octopuses and he whipped it out of the tank and plopped it on my arm for fun. That was new hahaha. We both had a good laugh.There's also lots of places to get a quick bite or you can even have fresh sashimi right from the vendor. And no worries. The place reeks of the sea but the facilities are all very clean. They have to make a sale, you know? So come by for an enjoyable experience and check out this market! Enjoy!NOTE: Don't forget to check out Nam Port right outside. It's a really great spot to see the city from afar and also all the ships!"
"Lots of shops selling sushi, very interesting",We got a good deal on sush lunch. Lots of sushi or sashimi restaurants competing each other for business. It was an interesting experience.
Unique experience,"The market is located in a main building, but there are also a lot of booths around it. The market is very clean and contains a large variety of fish and seafood. The sellers in the market are constantly busy cleaning and preparing the fish. You can buy fish and seafood in the market and go up to the second floor to the restaurants and ask to be prepared.The place was amazing, and if you go to Busan this is a Must."
Very good service but overprized.,"Went to Jacky's seafood restaurant and had lunch. Fantastic food and good service, but it's the most expensive lunch we had in South Korea. Lunch for 5 persons and we paid 230000 WON (206 USD)."
great fish market and food,"there is a restaurant called ""busan myung mool hoe jib(부산명물회집)"" where my family from grandpa went. Very local but excellent quality of korean style sashimi dish and fish broth(excellent), a bit overpriced. We bare the price since it's very unique and uncomparable."
Big fish market,Here is a big fish market in busan. Everybody said must go there. I surprised because it is a open market with a lot of kind of fish and sea food. If you buy a fish and sea food go to upstairs they can cook for you. It is not free they charge but you can eat a really really fresh seafood at there.
Interesting place,"This is a very interesting place, not commonly for tourists but there you can find souvenirs a very short price just need to walk a lot"
Educational on many levels,"While I would not bring a stroller into the market, I would bring older kids (9 and up)to see this marvel. Every kind of edible sea life to be caught off this coast is pretty much here to be seen in one vast display. This is where food comes from and not enough people are aware of that, especially many of those touring from the West. The rows and rows of tanks and pools are teeming at the start of the day and dwindle as the day progresses.You will see fish killed and shellfish shucked and if you are buying or just lucky, you may get a taste of something totally delicious and absolutely as fresh as it gets.Many of the stalls are run by women; another marvel in itself, as are the restaurants on the second floor. There is even a guest house much higher up where you can book a stay as well as an upscale restaurant.Compared to other Asian fish markets this is the must see in terms of being clean and modern. Be prepared for wet floors and do not wear anything that may drag the ground and shoes that are flat and good for walking, easy to clean. Ask questions because most people are friendly and know a lot about what they sell having had a lot of experience, just wait for a slow time."
Fresh Seafood,Extraordinary the smell of the sea in the mouth. Tried the octopus raw and the freh abalone. New experience and will visit again.
Creepy market! ( on good way),"Im so sorry - i called it creepy market. Its because when i was visiting Jagalchi Market just in front of my feet fish jumps from aqarium to the floor and tried to escape! But this was also amazing! If you are interested in seeing what sea can offer you - here you definitely find something for yourself. Srimps at any possible sizes, mussle, crabs - everything what you know and what you will see first time in your life. It stinks a bit - but i dont think it this kind of stink which wont allow you to be there and walk. "
Massive Fish Market with Live Seafood,"A good place to check out live seafood.... tons of stalls selling live seafood on ground floor. On 2nd floor, there are many restaurants that serve set meals or prepare seafood that u buy for a processing fee. There are also some stalls on 2nd floor that sell dried seafood. Interesting sight to check out live seafood... other than restaurants within Jagalchi market, there are rows and rows of restaurants outside the market that serve live seafood n set meal too. Its up to individual to choose yr dining plc "
Must visit if you love seafood,Jagalchi is a big fish market that houses all kinds of seafood under one roof. Here you can also find snow and king crabs and a variety of seafood which you can buy and have them cook it for you straight away (for some stalls) or they can send your choice upstairs to the restaurants to cook for you for a small fee. Really fresh and delightful. You can even have an opportunity to eat live squid that is still wriggling when you eat it! It is walking distance from the Nampo Lotte Department store or Jagalchi station on the Busan Metro Line 1.
Seafood Galore,"We had a wonderful time exploring the market, we managed to find a store owner who spoke decent English and assisted us with the choice of seafood. A lady from the restaurant upstairs then helped us prepared the seafood, we had a good mix of sashimi and grilled dishes plus a seafood broth. Price was so good compared back home. We ended up paying 90,000 for 6 types of seafood, preparation fee on top but still reasonable."
Nice if you are already in Busan,"The fish market is active and impressive. We went on a Sunday afternoon and it was very busy but most people seemed to be tourists rather than fish buyers. There are many placed to eat, picking from a huge variety of fresh seafood and having it prepared to eat among the tubs of swimming sea creatures. The market include both large outdoor and indoor areas. You could likely find similar places near Inchong if you can't make it all the way to Busan."
Lively and interesting ,"This was a bit of a surprise, it is big, full of colour and life, with friendly vendors selling an amazing range of fish and crustaceans. Extremely photogenic and am sure you will see a new thing or two for sure. My wife says I am an urchin so that did not count!Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful."
Seafood Galore,"The market in itself is interesting with all the live seafood sellers at the ground floor with all the ""resturants"" on level 2. Upon entering, you can checkout all the stall selling about the same live seafood. Prices seems to be uniform even though I don't understand Korean. Once you've pick a stall to buy the live seafood and paid for what you have selected, the seller will process the seafood and bring you upstairs to their ""appointed"" resturant to cook the seafood the way you want. Prices is starts from 4,000won/head, per cook dish is a few thousand won. No charges for raw seafood. Hot pot soup I think is about 10,000 for 1. The best part is free flow of side dishes like lettuce, pickles, kimchi etc."
Great experience to see so many stalls selling seafood,Its an experience for 5 senses! Smell fishy of course. Taste seafood especially the squid that tentacles will be still moving when served in sashimi style. Sight..u will never see so many giant fish n squid at one go elsewhere. 
Fish Fish Fish,Lots and loads of fish.. octopus.. alive or dead or sun dried.You might want to be careful where you step as it will be wet. Be enthralled by the variety of seafood available... and how huge the crabs are.Fruits and vegetables and pickled ones are also sold here.Its quite a stretch so just gotta walk...
Interesting market finds,There are very interesting finds especially the live octopus and alaskan crabs. Some of the sellers would let you touch their merchandise. 
Surprisingly Photogenic Fish Market,"We meant to get dropped off closer to the shopping street, but the taxi dropped us off at the other end of the fish market instead. It was no big deal, because this market was pretty fun to walk through. Some of the little stalls actually had their fish/seafood displayed really nicely which made for some good pictures. There are tons of little food stalls here vying for your business, so this looks like a good place to come if you're in the mood for some fresh seafood. We also came across a lady who was selling lots of dried bulk food and bought tons of candied ginger and dried cranberries from her. She had some dried fish jerky that was really tasty too (lots of other stalls were selling it too, if you see it I do recommend buying some for fun)."
Seafood Market,You can experience the local seafood market here by walking around in the market. There are many restaurants along the coast but all of the have a similar menu and price.
Sashimi,"This fish market is awesome! Go to any of the vendors, choose a fish or two to be cleaned and prepared for sashimi, walk the fresh fish outside across the small lane where you can order cold beverages (beer!) and you will get full service of condiments to accompany your fish! Do not order raw oysters in warm months! Enjoy!"
Good first experience,Seafood vendors may splash dirty water at you when you walk down the aisles and it has a fishy odour in the place. Try the famous octopus and fish (it's brown and flat) at any fish vendor. The vendor offered to sashimi and barbecue the fish. They will bring you upstairs but beware they charge per person for eating in and cooking cost as well if you choose to barbecue and they will only inform you this after you have sat and are waiting for the food. Their barbecue actually means fry anyway.
A sensory experience,Despite the sometimes unpleasant odor this place is alive with many sights and sounds that make it an inviting place to visit. There are vendors everywhere with countless kinds of seafood for purchase. Many of the fish are still alive. Come walk the aisles and street outside and pick out something for lunch. There are many places that will cook it for you. Some even have tables where you can cook it yourself. 
Awesome Seafood Market!,"Not sure what else to add that hasn't been said already, Jagalchi Market delivers exactly what is advertised--lots of inexpensive, fresh seafood.On the first floor of the market is somewhere around 60-80 stalls selling all sorts of live seafood--large varieties of shellfish, flounders, crabs, eels, and sea cucumbers/sea squirts.It would be extremely helpful to speak Korean. We don't, but a few stall owners speak some English. I thought the fishmongers were friendly in general and didn't mind the tourists, unlike some other Asian fish markets. I think the difference is that this market is geared towards consumers and not as much wholesale.Anyways, bargain for some seafood and take it upstairs to be cooked by one of the restaurants. You will pay a nominal cooking fee and also a seating fee, but even with the fees added to the seafood cost, this will still likely be one of the freshest and most inexpensive seafood meals you ever had.For a seafood fan like myself, this market alone is worth the trip to Busan."
you can inspect fishing boats upclose and personal,not smelly fish marketgreat seaside viewsyou can purchase raw seafood heresome tourists are herethis is near lotte gwangbok
Live Sea Animals!,"We came here on our third stop on our Busan tour during a cruise stop. It was pretty cool seeing all the different live sea animals, including fish, octopus, and shrimp. There were a few that I've never seen in my entire life, which was pretty awesome. We didn't eat here but we did walk around the market. "
Lots of fish,We went here as part of a tourist trip. It is enormous and has the most fresh fish and other seafood stalls you will ever see. A good spectacle to see for a few minutes but not somewhere to go out of your way to see.
Seafood market ,After exit 10 walk pass by NH Bank till you see 2nd entrance on your RH. Lots seafood you can find here. For us taste was just so so & a bit expensive.
Amazing,Amazing fish market with all you can think of from the sea you can see there and eat it. A real expirience. 
Amazing Experience for Adventurous Eaters,"The Jagalchi Market is a building, and also a surrounding neighborhood teeming with small markets selling every imaginable type of seafood and preparation. The main market has long rows of live tanks downstairs, each with a companion restaurant upstairs. One can either select what they want from live tanks, or simply head upstairs, choose a restaurant, and settle in for a feast complete with a maritime view of the working harbor.Lunch arrives in steady courses - very fresh sashimi, local delicacies, traditional fish soup, and of course endless Korean banchan side dishes. One very unique and simply prepared dish is sea squirt, a colorful type of seafood which we learned is related to sea urchin, with a familiar briny taste of uni that will appeal to sushi lovers.Less adventurous eaters may prefer the bolied fishcakes and broiled or smoked fish available in stalls around the main market. But for the adventurous, Jagalchi Market will delight with some of the freshest and most authentic Korean seafood dishes you'll find anywhere in the world."
Fresh fresh seafood!,"Came to jagalchi market to get some fresh seafood. Purchased a variety of goodies like fresh abalone, clams, oysters, sea cucumber, native flat fish, octopus and rock fish on the first floor. Then went upstairs to open restaurants that will cook the seafood for you. Grilled rock fish, live octopus, steam shelled seafood and sashimi style rock fish were dished out. Everything was delicious. This was truly a wonderful experience. "
The most expensive meal of our trip,"For anyone planning to have a meal here, know that you will be charged for a few things - your seafood choices, your seats upstairs, and the actual prep and cooking of the food. We had a group of 7 and had two fish prepared as sashimi, a small variety of steamed shellfish, two grilled fish, and one octopus. Add one bottle of soju and a few sodas and our total came out to about $270,000 krw. We enjoyed some parts of the meal more than others, so choose your seafood and cooking methods wisely. Overall an enjoyable experience - use it to try something new or unique."
Eye opening experience!,"The market is very huge and you can find all sorts of seafood there. You can also see the stall owners removing the skins of the eels and the eels would still be squirming. For those of us who do not frequent wet markets, this is quite an eye-opening experience! You can also buy seafood from the stalls and bring it to the restaurants upstairs to get them to cook it for you. There are many restaurants upstairs to choose from. They mostly serve sashimi or grilled seafood at an affordable price. But while the market is huge, most of the stalls sell the same thing so you will probably only need about 30 minutes to finish walking around the market."
Its worth the visit but too many repeatations,I was amazed by the different types of seafoods they have here... but its getting boring a while later as almost all the stores are selling the same fishes. You can buy the seafoods at G floor and bring it to 1st floor to ask the restaurant to cook for you
Ocean village.,"Fabulous traditional fish market which is almost the size of a small village. Countless varieties of live seafood and fish on display floundering around in tanks and containers. We visited with a tour guide so had a fairly quick walk through and some photo opportunities but it is well worth a visit to experience the sights, sounds and smells!!"
Fun experience.,Had an opportunity to pick out seafood from the market and then have it cooked or served raw depending on what you get right upstairs. Fun experience if you enjoy seafood.
Great selection ,"Visited with our tour guide who showed us all the different types of fresh seafood. You basically choose/pay for the seafood downstairs and they then take you upstairs which has seating (traditional and chairs). You can then choose how you'd like the food cooked (Fried, grilled, raw, etc). Very tasty and fresh. "
Traditional fish market,"We have visited the Jagalchi Market during our short stay in Busan. It was a normal fish market near the seaside with many stalls selling fish products. There were also restaurants inside to cook selected fish products for the customers. Overall, the market was clean and tidy. At the time of visit, there were more local people eating in the restaurants while most of the tourists only toured around to take some photos only."
Something different! ,Jagalchi is a mix of old and new! Still retains a lot of traditional fish markets as well as a new style. Some very interesting species that you can buy and have cooked on site and sit down and eat! I would definitely recommend a look! 
Great market and seafood ,"This is a great market with indoor and outdoor seafood stalls. Selling all kinds of seafood. We went to the main building and had our lunch there. The stall at Jacky's seafood at 2nd level was great. It's located right in the middle of the building. Near the staircase. Staff speaks and understand English reasonable. Chinese/ English/ picture menu is provided. 40000won(S) for about 4 or 5 pax if you are going to order other dishes. 60000 won(M) for about 5 or more pax. Most of the stalls sell almost the same seafood. But this is the one that comes with the seafood stall that has both live octopus and abalone cooked in the seafood pot. They recommended us their grilled fish which was full of meat and just a little of salt and lemon, the fish tasted fantastic."
Must visit ,"Visited here on a quick guided tour. Amazing array of live seafood on offer. Just pick it out, they process it straight away and 10 minutes later you are eating it!We didn't have enough time to do this but it's certainly something that I would loved to have done."
Good place to buy dried seafood,"As well as having local style dinner.Lots of eateries inside the big building. Also lots of dried seafood, seaweed places if you are into those things.Be sure to bargain."
Just for sightseeing - not recommend for meals,"You can walk around to experience the fresh seafood market (abalones, lobsters, octopus, crabs,...) but don't go for lunch or dinner here. The dishes are big and fresh (1 S-size dish can serve 4 ppl as appetizers) but it's very expensive and not so tasty. Better have normal Korean dishes in town."
Don't be tricked by the fish monger lady,"We were so excited to go to this largest fish market and try some seafood delicacy. The food is okay. However, we were tricked by the Ajuma in the fish market. There are no clear price tag for everything and the Ajuma hurry us up (e.g. Practically dragged us) to the 3rd floor post selected the seafood without inform us sitting upstairs costs extra 3000Won per person,which is considered an ambient environment. Not only we have to pay for the fish we are eating (I.e. 50000 Won), but we have to pay for the cooking of the fish/seafood (I.e. Another 10000 Won). Another thing makes us uncomfortable is that they charged our card without telling us how much they are and just took our card away. Maybe they want to save time to explain due to the fact we are not very familiar with the Korean language? Anyway, we felt tricked by them given we paid almost £80 for a grilled fish, an eel and 2 scallops plus a bottle of shuju (I.e. Rice wine). What a ripped off. "
Touring Cyclists - Fishy ,"The Jagalchi Market is the largest fish market I have seen. The sights, sounds and smells of this market is something to be experienced."
Interesting but cruel,"This markets outdoor area is definitely interesting if you want to see the ethnic nitty-gritty side of Korea. In that sense it offers lots of colourful views and scnerery. But in terms of sea creatures it is rather cruel. I am a vegetarian and if you have to eat a live creature, then kill it rather sooner than later. The views of half dead fish and crabs and other creatures piled on each other in crammed tanks was hearth breaking. But all Korean kitchen is rather cruel. It is all based on meat cooked in all sorts of terrible ways. I could not find one Korean national dish that did not have some awful kind of meet in it. I do not want to offend Korean culture in any way and in other aspects i liked Korea a lot but i hated their cooking traditions. Having said that i still visited the market because it is interesting and offers small glimpse into everyday korean peoples life behind the polished facade. "
Seafood market,It is huge market to see all kinds of seafood and vegetables. There are also stores which sell live seafoods and cook for you.Take your time to know the plenty of sea creatures in Korea Seas.
rows of seafood galore caught by the locals,"Traditional market selling lots of seafood caught by the locals. A nice place to see the local market scene, that is beside the Busan port. Walk straight along the pavement and you will step into the wooden walkway beside the Busan port. Lovely place to chill overlooking the port sitting at the benches with the locals."
Cruel,"We read all the rave reviews but personally we couldn't stand to see all the live crabs, fish, etc in the fish tanks in every stall, struggling. Too many around and it is all too much for us. "
Seafood Galore,"Tons of different kinds of seafood. You can buy your fresh seafood here, and restaurants in the market will prepare and serve it for you. One stand was skinning live eels, so not the place for a vegetarian to visit..."
Large selection of live seafood,Fresh seafood held in tanks. A large variety and interesting selection of seafood. As the seafood is kept in tanks the smell is not as offensive as a dead seafood market.
Pretty Amazing Experience,The busiest fish market of Busan. Crazy selection of all things that live in the sea. If you love fish there is no better place to get it fresh. There are many restaurants within the market that serve fresh from the ocean to your table.
Good place for dining,"This is a really good place for dining (for seafood lovers). We took line 1 from Busan station and alighted at Jagalchi station. Leave exit 10 at the station. Head straight and take the second right. There’re few restaurants open until late and we found one which served King crab at 65000KRW/kg. Yumy!!! ***The crab came along with kimchi, porridge, noodles, rice…and you will not have to pay extra for the set."
"Below w100,000","Visited here again in same year. We ordered 2 sets of Turbo cornutus, 1 grouper for hotpot, 1 rock bream for hwei(회) in lunch at there and 2 more rock breams for soup to take away. As topic mentioned, cost of ingredients and cooking fee was below w100,000."
Amazing Fish Market--hub of culture and activity!,"A must see in Busan, this market is one of Koreas largest fish markets, with fresh seafood restaurants and a multitude of bars, street food, shops, and of course fish! "
Negotiate negotiate!,"You can buy your seafood downstairs and have it cooked upstairs. The restaurants upstairs will charge a service fee though (cooking, sides, seating, etc). At least this is what we were told. It'll end up being close to just going upstairs and ordering from the menu at the restaurants. We opted for the latter. Be sure to negotiate though! We were able to negotiate a lower price, one free order of seafood pancake, and free beer! Also, be prepared to spend a little more."
Very fresh seafoods,"Had a festive seafood lunch!!! On the first floor is where you'd buy the seafood. We had scallops, clams, octopus, sea squirt, a flat fish (not sure what it's really called) and the famous abalone. Everything is at krw 50k. Each store had a partner restaurant upstairs who would prepare the food however you like - sashimi, grilled. Each person costs KRW 4k which is inclusive of the side dishes (rice is not though). In addition, you have to pay for the cooking fee which depends on the number of dishes.Overall, we spent 37k won each but the serving is really huge!!!! So, value for money is 2 thumbs up!"
"Interesting, but prefer Noryangjin Fish Market (Seoul)","Why you ask both have excellent supply of fresh fish, both have characters selling fish, both have the ability to cook the fish upstairs. Both only have limited English speaking fishmongers and cooks which can add and detract at the same time. I have only visited each once. But the restaurants in Seoul are superior in presentation, whereas Jagalchi market are better described as robust canteens.We chose a 2.5 kg snapper at 30,000 Kwon per kg (total 76,000 Kwon, approx $AUD 76,000) and a live lobster of 2+ kg at 40,000 Kwon per kg (total 100,000 Kwon approx $AUD 100). Grand total for snapper and lobster 176,000 Kwon, approx $AUD 176 for 3 people for lunch in raw materials. Expensive you might say, but compared to Melbourne prices lobster was about half price and whole snapper about par.This is when the fun really started! Fishmongers absolutely delighted with themselves, wanted photos! Neighbouring still holders looking on incredulously! Started to get the feeling that perhaps we were the sale of the week, or perhaps paid top dollar?Escorted personally by one of our fishmongers to a particular canteen. Fishmonger claimed 2 separate businesses, but there must be some reward for the fishmonger, not that it really mattered to us. But our fishmonger was having a bumper day, because with 20 mins he had guided in several groups of Korean women, totalling about 60.But that was after a very animated yelling match between the fishmonger and the cook. The cook wanted to steam snapper and lobster, but we had asked for snapper to be barbecued. Compromise turned out to be half the snapper was steamed, halls was barbecued!!Usual Korean condiments, plus rice and cooking 36,000 Kwon (approx $AUD 36). Expensive for lunch, probably for lunch, but fair value for the quality, freshness plus entertainment value and of course photos for the fishmongers to take home to their families and say ""you wouldn't believe what happened today?! Still for us a great morning and lunch, but would probably prefer Noryangjin Fush Market in Seoul. Recommended!"
Nice market,"Nice market. Lots of fresh seafood products. In some places you can get the fish or what evere you bought prepared for you. Some places are difficult to order at because of the language barrier. But if you have the option to prepare tge food by your self (at your guesthouse for example), then it's the best.We ordered a large shell plater at one place. Was little surprised that tge don't clean the shells and used all of the meat inside. But it was ok. Still, the Belgian style Mousles are a favorite.But the market is worth a visit. Just walk around."
Cheap and fresh Seafood market,"if you find place for inexpentsive lunch or dinner i do recommend this place, you can choose seafood by yourself for good price and they gonna cook for you right away, how cool is that lol p.s. there have indoor and outdoor market i got there for indoor the resturants are on 2nd floor so you can see the harbor and seagull"
Makan Seafood di Jagalchi ,Steamed. nasi putih. cost around 120 ribu won. king crab. and others seafood. sedaaaaaaap. worth visiting
Unique place in the world,This place is a dream for photographer. It's a unique place in the world for sure one of the biggest fish market. If you go to Busan you can't miss this visit
Big market but expensive,"Heard very good review about this market. Yup it's probably true as the freshest seafood could be found here. We had lunch there, looked at several restaurants and found that the food was not so attractive (and it actually was right), not to mention its expensive too. Btw, it's fun to come there seeing people selling and buying, seeing the biggest octopus in my life haha and eating the dead-moving octopus"
"Beautiful view, good surroundings ",This market have so many kind of seafood You can find every seafood at there and can let them cook for you Around market have a beautiful view for you to take a photoHope you guys will enjoy with this place
Most amazing seafood place I've ever seen!,"This is truly a place that one must go when in Busan.. Its the most amazing seafood place ever!The whole of the first floor is filled with live seafood and best of all, they are at the most affordable prices. Abalones, crabs, scallops, eels... you name it, they have it!You can choose any seafood from any of the not-so-pushy sellers on the first floor, and if you want them cooked, chances are they will ring up someone from the 2nd floor and u need to pay a fee to get them cooked.Like the rest of Busan, they aren't very proficient with English, but we chose a Mandarin speaking seller and she helped us with the choosing of seafood and got someone upstairs to lead us to a small restaurant where they cooked the seafood we purchased.We ordered a live baby octopus(it continued to wriggle down our throats despite being chopped to pieces) and it was surprising very sweet and delicious. We also got our abalone grilled and honestly, I've not eaten abalones that were this tasty at this price. The scallops were steamed-cooked and tasted super sweet and fresh! The eel was cooked in some red sauce(I'm guessing it's kimchi sauce) and was spicy enough to stoke our appetite. The seafood stew was served on a portable gas stove and was filled with big clams,scallops and prawns etc.If you're still hungry after all of that, you can ask for repeated servings of typical Korean side dishes like kimchi, preserved vegetables, bean sprouts etc.When you're done with shopping on the 1st floor and eating on the 2nd, do remember to take the elevator to the top floor to enjoy the view of the harbour and the ""stacking"" of buildings on the hills by the shoreline that coined Busan as the ""Santorini"" of Asia.-the roof isn't very big, but is sufficient for one to enjoy the view."
Ok lah.,It's just another market but it is interesting to just look at people's life here. There are pretty much elderly in this area. A place where you can pop by and just take a look.
"Amazing market, amazing city","The market was the most amazing we've ever seen. Most species were still alive - in tanks with running water and oxygen flowing constantly. And there was no odor! Super clean. My research of Busan painted a picture of a boring, not-much-to-see city. We found it to be vibrant and very clean and the shopping options were very upscale. It was a total surprise in the best way, and was a great day. "
Jaglachi Fish Market - great stop for photographers!,"This is Korea's biggest fish market so if you love your fish dishes then this place may be of some attraction. For me it was a Metro stop just before Gamcheon Cultural Village and a great place to take some pictures. For those who don't mind the smell and sight of raw fish! Great to see the vendors preparing the fish for sale and the displays of a wide variety of marine fare - eels, lobster, crabs and some wonderfully bizarre fish. Polite to ask to take photographs of displays of fish and workers."
A new experience of a fish market,"The Jagalchi fish market has everything beyond my imagination. All kinds of sea food on display. Ive never witnessed these much of sea creatures. The market has many small partitioned restaurants within the market where you can choose your seafood and the seller will cook it for you.However, I decided to try the buffet OASE seafood buffet. It may be pricey but its worth the money!"
If you like seafood...,"...This is the place to visit! Located next to Busan Port and very near Biff shopping area, this is the largest fish market I have ever visited. Row upon row of every type of fish imaginable - and many species I've never seen before!Although I love visiting markets and I enjoyed visiting this one, I felt it was very much a place of business rather than a tourist attraction and I was expected to purchase."
One of a kind fish market,"The Jagalchi fish market has everything imaginable. Check out the eel, crab, lobster, and octopus, among many others. You simply walk up and down the aisles and see the vendors and their products for sale.There is a restaurant upstairs."
One of the best a biggest Fish market in the world ,"If you want eating was fresh from the see jagalchi market is the Place Here you can find all kind of mussel , fish , Crabs a Lobster all are fresh & liveMust try steam Abalone maybe is the cheapest One in the world "
"Take a visit if you are interested, don't eat there.","Bought crabs, shrimps, lobsters, clams... We would like to have bbq seafood. The staff on second floor asked us 'steam steam?' 'bbq bbq?' I replied 'bbq', and we have all the seafood steamed (or boiled because the seafood is tasteless)."
Lively market,"We visited this place in the morning, and it was already full of activities. There are all kinds of fishes, octopus, crabs etc. There are indoor and outdoor sections, not sure what is the difference."
Foodies paradise,If you are a seafood maniac - this is your playground!Tons of fresh various seafood for sell.Choose the fish or shells on the ground floor and order the seller to cook it the way you prefere.Then go 1st floor where the kitchens and restaurants are and enjoy your choosen seafood!Open since dawn till 9pm.Credit cards are accepted everywhere on this market!
"Real Korean fish market, absolutely fascinating as a foreigner",Great place to enjoy fish and seafood. Also fascinating to see some of the seafood that is sold here and how they prepare certain fish like the Fugu.
Live Korean Seafood for your pick and eat!,"The place was crowded with seafood from the korea nearby sea (Sea of Japan). You will see fishes, king crab, sea heart, abalone, prawns and many more. Once you choose, bargain with the seller. After you have deal, they will bring you upstair for the gourmet cooking. You can choose what type of cooking style you like or let the chef do the cooking. Of course it will be delicious as the seafood are fresh."
"It's a market, not a tourist attraction","Billed in guidebooks as a must-see, there really wasn't much to see. It's a large market beside a fishing-boat harbour. There are street stalls selling fish and shellfish, and three or four large warehouse-like buildings housing more stalls. It's great if you're serious about buying seafood; otherwise you're likely to be out of there in ten or fifteen minutes.The harbour itself may be quite picturesque if the weather had held up on the day I visited. But it rained all day and the light was poor. Hopefully, you get better weather when you visit.One of the buildings may be more interesting than the rest. I believe it lies at the Northwest end of the cluster. In there, you can point to a fish and have it served as fresh sashimi within minutes. I didn't try it myself for two reasons: I wasn't hungry, but more importantly, the whole place didn't look hygienic enough."
A Must-go spot for foreigners,"If you love seafood you will love this place. I had the one-person seafood pot and it cost around 30000 won. Even if you do not like to eat seafood, this is still worth a visit if you wanna know the daily lives of those who work there or to experience an Asian seafood market. There are really a lot to see both in and outside the seafood market like the HUGE octopus and it is an experience you can only get in this market in Busan. There are also dried seafood outside the market, try them if you haven't. The BIFF Square is just nearby so I strongly recommend you to pay a visit to the market if you have time."
Just a local fish market,It is just a local fish market selling almost similar live fishes across all stalls but the sea view behind the market is worth photo taking. there is a nearby grocery building where you can purchase local products.
Good experience if you wanna see how locals sell fishes,It was an open eye.. it may look abit shocked when u see the locals selling fishes openly and u could see intestines in the fish.. but try not to eat the seafood there as I am afraid u might get chopped.. this is what I feel..
Tastiest and freshest seafood ever.,"Interesting to see the kinds of seafood they have there - most of them are still alive so it would be awesome to have them as meals. First floor is where they sell all kinds of live seafood. Second floor is where the different stalls are.You can opt to bargain and buy the seafood from the first floor and have the second floor stalls cook them for you at a fee. We chose option 2 - which is to just order directly from the stall. We were at one of the stalls with very kind ahjummas. Ordered a 1kg snow crab at 80,000 and scallops (around 10) at 30,000 Korean won. Believe we could have gotten a better deal but this was alright - not too bad. They were really delicious and fresh! She even gave us a complimentary fish soup - with a mixture of different fishes.One of the first floor vendor was selling a kg of snow crab at 40,000 won and king crab (a kg) at 60,000 won (king crab's weight is at a minimum 2kg). So before you place any orders - do read more online reviews so you don't get cheated."
Surprisingly a good place to take young children!,We brought our young son here for some exploring and he had a great time. He was able to see so many varieties of fish and other seafood. The vendors were also very friendly and indulged our curious little boy. This stop doesn't take long. Maybe an hour is enough.
Large sprawling fish market,"The market is located between the Jagalchi and Nampo subway stations - you can use either one to reach the market.The market is huge! It really is an entire area of independent stalls, a large main building (filled with more stalls and restaurants), and more. Most stalls sell similar seafood throughout the market area. The seafood selection certainly isn't as diverse as you would see in Tsukiji Fish Market in Tokyo. However, there are certainly more independent stalls immediately outside Jagalchi than in Tsukiji. The number of stalls seem to be endless, especially those on the western side of the market...The main building is much smaller than in Tsukiji and offers a larger selection of seafood than what you would find outside of the market. It is also quite wet in the main building as well. The second floor of the building contains a number of independent restaurants. The proprietors of these restaurants seemed to be quite aggressive in trying to get your business. The prices of the dishes (mainly seafood) also seemed to be quite high as well."
World of fresh seafood ,Location very easy to find by using subway . Surprised to see all fresh seafood and can be cooked immediately.. price not cheap (ask before enjoy your meal ) that's is another old / tradition seafood market .. setting as same as jagalchi center . Floor a bit wet .. 
Testing,"We wanted to try live squid (at Won10k for a small one). Be sure to chew and chew. First one for me the tentacle suck at my inner lips.Abalone porridge was good, so are the eels.Good experience. "
Interesting fish market ,This is an interesting fish market. You can see a lot of exotic fish that we don't have in America. You also get to see how the locals sell and prepare the unique fish.
Good for a visit but probably not to eat there,"Located along the waterfront, Jagalchi market is large, and consists of a number of buildings and streets. There are two large buildings that house the 'wet' stalls on the ground floor. Here you are suppose to buy the fresh produce and bring them upstairs on the 2nd floor to your selected restaurant to cook them for you (for a fee of course). Alternately these restaurants on the 2nd floor have their own produce. We noted it was mostly tourists that were there.The 2nd floor is also where dried seafood products can be purchased.It would be the same in the few streets around these two produce buildings. There is even an open area, and this is where more locals can be seen buying the produce for home preparation. There are also restaurants all around and some of them serve whale meat.All in the experience is great and the photos will be memorable. Come here via line 1 of the metro and alight at the station of the same name (exit 10). Or stop a station away in Nampo coming out of exit 2."
Average,Tried the seafood in Jagalchi market. Very fresh indeed. Best to be served with soju or beer. Worth a try.
Great Experience to observe the local people,"There are many kinds of seafood, there are a few that I haven't seen before as well. I went here from Gamcheon Village, I took Bus No. 1 (the small bus, I think there is another bigger bus No. 1, not sure they have the same route or not) but the bus is not stopping exactly at the market, need to walk a little bit to arrive the market."
The smell will hang on you for days,"It's a market. It sells fish. It smells like a fish marketNot really sure why this is a tourist attractionSee, but don't stay long, as the smell will follow you for the rest of the day"
All kinds of seafood,"This is the most serious seafood market in all of South Korea. You'll find vendors selling every kind of sea creature from octopuses to sea cucumbers. I even witnessed an octopus escape from a bucket and make a break for it into traffic. It was rescued valiantly by the seller, although it'll soon be someone's dinner. The upstairs seaweed and dried seafood makes great souvenirs to bring back. I bought a bunch of seaweed for soup to give away as gifts. Look for smaller seafood restaurants here that serve delicious fried fish. If you are brave, try the raw octopus that's still squirming on your plate as you eat it!"
Variety of Fresh Seafood,"My friend and I love seafood so, when we visit Busan, we had to go to Fish Market. We stayed in Haeundae area. From there, we took subway green line from Haeundae to Seomyeon and change to orange line to Jagalchi station. It took around 45 mins to get there. From the station, we had to walk for a few blocks to get to the market.The fish market building is on the seaside. It's quite clean despite the water that spill from the seafood tank. The first floor lines with live seafood stores. The second floor is the restaurants. You can either buy seafood from downstairs and bring up to second floor for restaurant to cook or go to second floor directly and order from the menu. We chose to shop around on the first floor. Just want to make sure that the restaurant did not choose too big of a crab or too many seashell, more than what we could eat. As there were only two of us, we had limited number of dish that we could eat.My friend and I chose a snow crab and cockles. The seafood stores on the first floor all have connection to the restaurant upstairs. So, when we told them that we wanted them cooked, the shop owner called the restaurant staff down to take us.We asked them to steam the snow crab and we showed a picture of how we wanted the cockles to be cook (boiled, shelled and topped with some sauce). It was what we saw on the internet and wanted to try. The seafood was so fresh and tasty. The crab meat was really sweet. We also asked them to mix the crab roll with rice. It was so delicious!! The cockles also was so good, fresh with just right amount of sauce. It was a very fulfilled meal."
High energy/loud/interesting,"The energy of this place is exciting and fun. It's fun to see different types of fish and seafood they offer in Busan. Be sure to wear sneakers and not sandals unless you want your feet to covered in fish juice. Don't wear your best/fancy clothes. Go there to experience and enjoy fish. You'll hear people screaming but don't be alarmed. I think Busan has their loud, aggressive and energetic culture in the way they speak and act. And please, it's a bit pricy in the 30,000 won to 50,000 won range if you want to get your own fish and have the restaurants to prepare a meal for you. We spent about 70,000won for two people. I personally don't think it's worth that much for us to spend that much money. I recommend going to Haeindae and try their seafood market. It's not as expensive as this seafood market. "
