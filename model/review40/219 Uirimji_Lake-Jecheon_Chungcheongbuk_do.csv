Nice spot,"Popular spot with the locals. A small amusement park area at one end and you can rent pedal or row boats on the lake. Handful of cafes and restaurants are around, so good place to spend a half day."
A four-season attraction,"Urimji Lake is a good place to visit anytime of the year! Why? It's a good place to take photos with your friends and family. In the evening, there are many amateur photographers taking night photos of the fountain and the artificial waterfall. You can walk along the lake or cross a bridge and walk In the winter, when the lake freezes over, you can go ice fishing. (However, the locals don't recommend eating the fish in that lake.) If the weather is cold enough, the city builds an ice tunnel that tourists can go through for free.In the spring, summer and early autumn, you can ride the swan-shaped paddle boats. There are a couple of cherry blossom trees around the lake. In the spring, viewing the cherry blossoms is a popular activity. In the past two years, summer droughts have caused Lake Urimji to shrink in size. If you do decide to venture into parts of the exposed lake bed, be aware that some parts of it may be muddy. So bring an extra pair of shoes...just in case. The best way to get to Urimji is to take bus #31 heading towards Semyung University. Get off at Urimji Hosu (Urimji Lake). On the weekends in the spring and summer, the traffic to Urimji can be heavy at time."
Fun place to enjoy!,"Fun fair such as taga disco, viking and other rides. Also you can enjoy baseball and shooting games. "
Recommended only in rainy season!,"I visited here in summer, so since it was not raining, there was almost no water. I recommed it on rainy season :)) It would be beautiful then!"
