Nice photo spots!,"It's a long street with tall metasequoia trees on both sides. You need to pay ($2-3, can't remember exactly) to get into the main road, which is about 1 mile. Walking through the main road is a refreshing experience. You will also find some great photo spots. No vehicles are allowed in the paid area. I went to Gwanbangjerim first and lent a bicycle to the Metasequoia road and it took about 10-15 minutres. I think you can directly get there too. "
Road Metasequoia in Damyang,"This road is lined with big metasequoia trees. The lenghth of this road is around 5km. It is not free to stroll along the road. Our feelings are a little hurt to pay to stroll along this road. This place is very good for forest-bathing. You should pay 2,000 Korean Won to get in. But it is free after 18:00. You can see lots of people, especially lovers, to come here. There are shops, cafes, and restaurants at the entrance. It is good to take pictures around here."
Cool street,This is a one of the most famous place in Damyang. You can feel the fresh environment with everyone
Just a road that required entrance fee,Walked along Gwangbang Jae Lim and the views are awsome. At the end of Gwangbang Jae Lim will reach the Metasequoia-Lined Road. Can see the trees from the outside. Not worth paying 3000won to enter the road when Gwangbang Jae Lim is more impressive and it's free.
Beautiful Road for Morning Stroll,I went here early in the morning before it was busy--which meant the road was quiet and peaceful. This is certainly a beautiful road for the purpose of enjoying nature.
NIce trees,The shaded road makes a pleasant shaded walk in the summer. There is another avenue closer to the bamboo gardens which is more accessible
Picturesque tree-lined road,"A very picturesque stretch of pedestrianized road lined with metasequoia trees. There are some quirky statues and features along the way which add interest. The road is not particularly long, perhaps a 10-15 minute walk. There was an entrance fee but it was minimal and the road is flat and suitable for pushchairs & wheelchairs.There is a strawberry farm at one end which sold the most sweetest, juiciest strawberries I've had. Well worth a visit!"
Worth visiting on the way to...,Was visiting Damyang to check Juknokwon bamboo garden and getting Metasiquoia trees road was a good bonus for my trip. Nothing more except for photographers or instagrammers - it will definitely add some likes to your account. There are some good cafes in the area as well. Worth visiting only if you are passing by this area.
Very beautiful,"The Metasequoia Road is simply a walking path lined with trees, however, it is a beautiful place to take a stroll. It is pet-friendly as long as your dog is on a leash. It cost 2,000w per person to get in as well. The trees were still green but I imagine it's even more beautiful once fall is in full-swing and the leaves change color."
Beautiful sight,A beautiful place with fresh air. Also good for couples to visit or even have a picnik. Pictures are also turning out great. But I reccoment only if you like nature.
Great walk between sequoias,"Peaceful, beautiful and great. I was there in winter so the trees had not leaves. Was a nice view and they have some sport space and coffee shop. You can enjoy surrounding restaurants and small european style shopping area. "
Romantic Place to visit,"If you have a chance to visit Jeollanam-do, you have to visit Metasequoia Road! The air was very good and fresh. This place also chosen as the most beautiful places in 2002! For people who like to take picture, I recommend you to take a look at this place"
Good tree-lined road,"C1 ( 2015.05.22 ) This load was consisted of Metasequoia tree, so the air was very good and fresh. About 20 minutes can reach to road's end. It was certain that there had good atmosphere and air, but a little boring. There need to make facility, and something to enjoy. And need to signpost because I searched for start point hear and there. Fresh air was very good."
The Bamboo visit...,"You must visit the place sooo cool. a lot of bamboos with deff. kinds.. my husband and i, love the place so much.. you can see also a lot of furnetures made if bamboos so unique.."
Unique Experience,"I had read about the Metasequoia-lined Road but we ended up visiting completely on accident - one of the benefits of not taking the interstate! Initially, we thought it was just so-so as there was quite a bit of traffic on the main road, however, we then discovered the walking road as well. We were disappointed to find we couldn't bike down there but it was still a majestic experience to be walking down the gravel road under the canopy of these massive trees. The north end where we parked was certainly the less populated end of the walking road. When we biked along the river to the other end we found it packed with people."
Beautful Location for Exercise,"Whether you enjoy walking or biking, this beautiful road is the perfect place. One of the most scenic roads in Korea, if your in the area, make sure to stop. On beautiful days you will find quite a few locals enjoying the fresh air and green scenery.One hopes this ""type"" of road becomes a trend in Korea. Much of Korea's modern road system is impressive, but beauty is rarely (if ever) mentioned. This location has been used in Korean TV dramas, and is surprisingly well-known because of this. If you have ever drove in some of the US National Parks, you may not be overly impressed, but it is rather easy to appreciate this relaxing road."
