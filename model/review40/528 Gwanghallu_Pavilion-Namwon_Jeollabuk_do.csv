go there,"I haven't even heard of Namwon before we actually got there. This park is very beautiful. From what I heard it used to be someone's private property long time ago(must have been someone pretty rich). You can dress up in traditional clothes and go for a walk around, for a fee of course. There's also a small lake with giant fish inside. Not a lot to do but perfect for a relaxing afternoon walk after lunch."
Peaceful ancient garden,"Garden with ancient gazebo and old trees, which are more than 400 years old. It's peaceful garden. There's the house to introduce Chunhyangjeon that is kind of love story composed around 300 years ago. That was interesting."
Gwanghallu Garden,It is a garden with a pavilion in the middle of the pond. There are activities that my kids really enjoyed like Korea giant swing and other Korean traditional games. 
Beautiful!!!,Very nice garden. Peaceful. Beautiful landscaping. Can spend about an hr and half here. Fun traditional korean games in one corner of the garden. You can get your pictures clicked in traditional korean clothes. Worh a visit if you are in Namwon. There is a minimal fee to enter the garden. Also you can send a post card to your loved ones for free anywhere in the world from the Tourist information center in the garden.
One of the best gardens in Korea,"Gwanghallu is a place for traditional party in a beautiful garden.To appreciate the place to its full potential, you have to know about the Choseon dynasty's gardens which can be classified into three different categories: Royal gardens; public (built by local goverments) gardens and private gardens (built by rich aristocrats)Good examples of each would be the garden of Changdeokgung palace; Gwanhalluwon and Soswaewon(Damyang). Namwon used to be an important large town in the southern part of Korea with variety of agricultural goods from Jeolla province. So the public garden built by Namwon govmn't was pretty huge and beautiful with manmade pond and islands. The garden itself was made to resemble the utopia of Taoism. Three islands were made to represent three holy mountains namely Bonglae mt (蓬萊山), Bangjang mt (方丈山) and Youngju mt (瀛洲山). On each island crape myrtle, bamboo were planted along with a small gazebo. The water drawn in from the near by river was representing the milky way and the only bridge that crossed milky way was believed to be Ojkagyo, and the bridge in Gwanhalluwon was named so. (Ojakgyo is from another traditional story)Gwanhalluwon is also famous for the setting of Chunhyangjeon, the oldest Korean romance story and you can find a shrine for Chunhyang and a model of her mother's house in Gwanghalluwon. During the winter time, the park opens until 8 pm. After 6 pm, you don't have to pay the entrance fee which is 2500 KRW per person during the day time."
Tranquil and very enjoyable,"I really enjoyed Gwanghallu. The layout of the area is relaxing and enjoyable. A few buildings on the grounds, but the pond was great (loads of big fish looking for a snack) and I thoroughly enjoyed the ancient and awesome trees spread throughout. Plenty of picture opportunities. Cheap entrance fee, 2,500 I think. Unfortunately we couldn't go in the evening...the website said open until 10pm but the place actually closes at 8. The tourist info guide (in the very small building inside of the gates) was pleasant helpful for Namwon and other nearby towns and cities. Also interesting to try out the giant swing!"
Beautiful in the Early Evening,"We visited Gwanghallu in the early evening as the light was beginning to fade and it was simply idyllic. The pavillions and ponds and the gardens that they are surrounded by were really beautiful and a great place to daydream of days gone by in Korea. I think this spot is particularly good for couples, as the beautiful scenery has a distinct air of romance. Leaving the Gwanghallu park there was a row of well kitted out souvenir stalls too which are run by the local community and sell many attractive and curious Korean goods."
Used in shooting several dramas and also a historical location,"Gwanghallu is a short walk from the bus station and is a pleasant park with a pavillion bridge, and pond. There are several good restaurant to eat in around the park. The park is famous because of the Chunhyang who was a woman in the Joseon dynasty who refused the advances of a local magistrate. You can dress up in hanbok at several locations around the park."
