DMZ tour: Dorasan station & 3rd tunnel,"By some distance, the biggest disappointment of an otherwise great trip to Korea. The UN emailed us 24hours earlier to tell us that the JSA tour we'd pre-booked had been cancelled for some reason (happens a lot, apparently: we were just unlucky). So to salvage what we could from the situation, we joined the Third Tunnel tour instead.Dorasan station: a place where you just have to use your imagination, as there's really nothing to see/do there at present. The border viewpoint allowed a 'Cold War afficionado' like myself to get my fix, gazing across into North Korea, but the supposed highlight - the third tunnel - although it has an interesting back-story, there's nothing of interest once inside it.Don't bother with this tour: book the JSA tour and just hope you get a green-light from the UN. Enjoy!"
Walk the tunnel,"Explore the underground tunnel dug by the North Koreans to ostensibly invade South Korea. A motorised trolley takes you underground, where you walk the tunnel and can see the holes where dynamite blew the tunnel. Not for claustrophobes! "
Great workout!,"included on your tour trip to DMZ, third tunnel is a unforgettable experience, no photos are allowed inside the tunnel and you can’t bring your cellphone, so be ready for a zero technology walking tour, there are lockers where you can leave your belongings, a souvenir and convenient store, then you go thru a metal detector. Downhill is easy, walking back is the hard part, unless you’re very fit, as it’s very steep. You can use the little train and I personally recommend it as there’s really nothing to see while walking. A hard hat is a must and very helpful, I’m 5’2” and still manage to hit my head with the ceiling a couple of times. It’s humid inside and smells like a mine, if you have asthma I don’t recommend it. At the end of the tunnel you can see the three barricades and go back. "
Not for the faint of heart. ,"Before entry to the tunnel all personal effect must be locked away in lockers provided. We were given hardhats because parts of the tunnel were quite low and there were water dripping in quite a few areas. They advised that if you have high blood pressure etc, it might not be the best tour for you. A monorail is also available. It’s the steepest down and uphill walk I have done so far, and Korea is loaded with steeps steps and roads. They were die hards even walking with canes on this tour, they were encouraging me along the way. Staying in the back of the tour group will help if you are afraid of tunnels ( it might prevent panicking). "
Tired but worth it,"Trust me, be ready to go down the tunnel, it was a bit tired. Then you walk further for about 5 minutes reaching the last point and see the other side, i guess that is north korean side. I cannot upload any photos because no camera allowed. It was quite cool down there and you can easily hit your head on the rock above your head. But dont worry, you have helmet.:)So hopefully you enjoy it"
North Korean Tunnel,The Third Infiltration Tunnel is North Korean tunnel found below the DMZ. You have to wear a hard hat to go down into the tunnel. No photographs are allowed down the tunnel. A monorail is available to get you down to the tunnel. A great place for those interested in history and cold war politics.
The Highlight of Our Tour,"Incredible bit of history! One of many tunnels that the North Koreans attempted to build into the south for a possible invasion. But a defector gave the South Koreans the exact location and the South was able to intercept the tunnel before it was completed. It is a very long walk on a very steep incline. Bring some good walking/hiking shoes. Unless you are in very good shape, you will be tired by the end. There is also a very interesting museum right next to the tunnel."
Great to experience ,"Before you enter there are lockers rooms to put all your things. No camera fons or bags are allowed.The tunnel is going downwards and takes total of 40 to 50mins to go down and back again.It is not advisable for old people or with frails legs, or weak feet due to coming up is a challenge.I didnt feel claustrophobic from the few 100 meters, but reaching the end of the tunnel is getting smaller but still ok for me.Inside the tunnel is airconditioned so compared to the hot temperature outside, it is great experience.There are designated smoking areas for smokers and shops for refreshment. We bought the whiskey as it is highly recommended."
Fascinating and Tiring!,"Really enjoyed the visit to the Third Tunnel as oart of my DMZ tour. It gives fascinating Insight into the nature of the conflict between the two Koreas.The North Built this massive tunnel with a view to invading the South. When it was discovered they passed it off as a coal mine! There is a steep descent into the tunnel built by the South Koreans to meet the tunnel. You walk for a couple of hundred metres until you sre only 170m. Away from the Northern limit of the DMZ.You need to be reasonably fit but it's not too bad, a lot of crouching and them a long ascent back to the surface. But if you're able bodied you'll be okay.No photos allowed inside the tunnel and they give you an mandatory hard hat- which believe me you'll need!Theres a good museum and a short 8ish minute film. A brilliant thing to visit."
Side Dish,"This is just a side dish of the DMZ tour.There are two ways to the tunnel. By monorail or walk 350 meter down(return is up). Before the event, you have to leave all your belongings including any portable phone and cameras (you have to walk thru a metal detector) and pick up your safety helmets.  The tunnel was quite low, also due to the metal reinforcement scaffolding the South had put in, so everyone over 5’4″ had to stoop. A tall man in front of us was having some trouble so at regular intervals you could hear the clang of hardhat against the metal pipes. You need to walk a several hundred meters to the three barricades and has really nothing significant to observe. Some of the tour members just skip this event.By the way, here is the northernmost point of tour spot before 2018 October when the Panmumjeom (5 km from 38° N) opened to Public. "
A surreal experience!,"A surreal experience! You can go into the tunnel, which is one of the tunnels that was discovered after being reported by a North Korean fleer, which was build by North Koreans to invade South Korea. When you visit this tunnel, be sure you are healthy and not cluster-phobic."
goosebumps,"this tunnel among many more was built by North Korea in order to invade the south and it is the longest tunnel of them allit was really long and felt so surreal inside the tunnel. its a very easy going down but its a very tiring way up so don't bring weak people or old parents here, but it's very fun if you come with friends! (no cameras allowed)"
Third Tunnel of Agression,"The longest tunnel in DMZ. Be mindful of your footwear selection, walking in the tunnel is draining but worth the experience. Be sure to listen and ask questions to your tour guide, they give you generous explanations and insights about DMZ and this tunnel. Enjoy and take care!"
Keep Your Head Down,"First of all figure out if you are fit enough and interested enough to do this sloping walk down and then again back up. I walked hunched over and still hit my hard hat on the low ceiling many times. It seems that many people were struggling with the upslope especially and didn't really care about why they were doing it in the first place. The tunnel is part of the DMZ tour. Not everywhere has to be photographed to be able to remember the experience of where you are. It's not going to be scenic, it's just understanding what was going on here. This tunnel was capable of a North Korean invasion on the city of Seoul had it been completed."
Interesting story,When the tunnels were discovered the North Koreans denied all knowledge of them but it is said they were creating these tunnels to secretly get into Seoul. You can’t take photos in the tunnels. We were lucky that we got to go on the small train down instead of walking (and walking back up). It’s quite a way underground. You can walk along the tunnel. I had to bend down slightly but it is ok. Really intriguing tunnel. You have to wear a hard hat - thankfully - as you may hit your head. We had a little video before we went down too about the different tunnels.
Interesting story but not much to see,We enjoyed the visit as part of a DMZ tour but there’s not much to see at the end of the tunnel. The walk back is quite exerting
A pity you cannot take photos,"Photos cannot be taken of the 3rd Tunnel (don't know why) so you have to leave your camera / phone in the lockers provided. You mainly come to feel what it was like for North Korean soldiers having to dig through the rock to reach South Korea. It is quite a walk, especially when you walk back up to civilisation. Also the actual tunnel is quite small, so don't go if you have a bad neck or back, or don't like confined spaces.On the opposite side is a movie theatre which shows a 7 minute film regarding the area. It is a strange film - it has the echoes of a 50s American propaganda film but also has the nationalist patriotic tones of Korea in it as well."
"Nothing to see, really","It's interesting. But that's all, really. You're not allowed to take pictures and you have to leave all your stuff in the lockers at the entrance. You have to wear a helmet that's been used by dozens of tourists before you, then you go down the tunnel with a little train. After that you walk through the actual Third Tunnel. At some point there is a wall and that's that. Then you can walk back again. You can't stand upright in the tunnel (at least the average European can't)."
Put your historical imagination to work as there isn't a great deal to see.,"Visiting the Third Tunnel was both interesting and a little disappointing. After walking down the very steep incline you reach the flat part of the tunnel, where the walls close in and head height is very low (you have to wear a helmet). When reaching the end of the tunnel - a wall at the barrier to the North Korean side - there isn't much to see, so you turn around and walk out again. It's a very do-able walk for anyone reasonably fit, but I wouldn't recommend it for anyone with asthma, a heart condition, or suffering from claustrophobia. I got the most out the experience by trying to ignore the hundreds of other tourists in the tunnel and putting myself mentally in the shoes of the people who dug the tunnel in the first place. Whichever side they were from, it's an impressive feat. "
Interesting as part of trying to understand the aggressive mindset,"The discovery of the enormity of the tunnels project, evidenced by the effort expended on this one, was of great significance given the clear plan to attack Seoul "
Waste of time,Please respect the country and do not take photo inside the tunnel. It is a very long slope on your way back up to the starting point. there is nothing to see at the end of the tunnel and u just u-turn and walk upwards back.
A must-do on a visit to the DMZ,"The Third Infiltration Tunnel was discovered in 1978 and ends just 52km north of Seoul. Nearly 2km in length and 2m wide and 2m high it is estimated the 30,000 fully armed N Korean soldiers per hour could infiltrate into S Korea.Do not go into the tunnel unless you are reasonably fit and do not suffer from claustrophobia. Hard hats are compulsory and available as you enter the tunnel."
One Visit Would Be Enough,"History of the Korean conflict would be shown in a short movie. There is the realization that this tunnel was only discovered just lately. Photography is definitely not allowed inside. Personal belongings are to be placed in a locker. Photos of people being carried in stretchers serve as a warning how physically challenging this activity can be. Entering an enclosed tunnel can be a nightmare for claustrophobia people , but my problem begins with my head hitting the ceiling several times despite I'm just on average height and wearing a safety helmet. Then while the descent is just fine with the almost half kilometer , the problem is when going back up . It was a steep climb up with angulation of 11 degrees. Finishing the trail was in itself satisfying. But going back to this historic attraction I would be thinking twice. Just like the Cu chi tunnels of Vietnam, which involves a more narrow pathway, one visit would be enough. No photos since it was not allowed."
Impressive ,"First you’ll see an 8min movie about the story of the Korean conflict. Then you have the chance to go down the tunnel. It’s really steep (360m) down there you can go close to the handmade tunnel but you have to duck because it’s really small (1,70m). Mind your head! If you’re booking another more expensive tour you can take the small train going down and up. "
Interesting,"This part of the visit to the DMZ is probably the best bit of the DMZ trip as you can see how intent the north Koreans were at getting into the South. Imagine the labour and hours that went into the construction of these tunnels. Low ceilings and hard hats mandatory...but why can't all tourists read and stick to the right as it requires..failure to do so makes life harder for the others. Its quite a steep gradient, but doable for most people."
Not ideal if you’re tall but worth it ,"Being 6”4 doesn’t make being in a tunnel with a low ceiling very enjoyable, but I’m glad I saw it. It’s quite a steep walk down (and up!) but at least you can walk upright. The flat part was the most challenging and without the hard hat I would have hurt myself multiple times. You’re not allowed to take pictures in the tunnel and are supposed to leave your phone etc in a free locker "
Low ceiling and moderate exertion required,"For the first time in my life, I'd say it pays to be short as I did not have to duck under the low ceilings of the tunnel. Our tour guide explained the historical significance of the tunnels and I am to this day amazed at how the tunneling was achieved in such short time back in the day with limited technology and having to do so in secrecy. The uphill portion does require some endurance and I would not recommend this to people with mobility issues or claustrophobia."
Fascinating,"What determination the N Koreans had to burrow through kms of granite! Is quite a hike back up...500 metres never felt so long (at an 11 degree rise). Also...if you are claustrophobic, you might think twice. "
Rich experience ,"There’s a train that brings you to the tunnel. Unfortunately, it wasn’t in operation the day I visited and thus, we descended 300m. Very steep. Use good comfortable shoes with good sole grip. Before reaching the 3rd tunnel, you will descend from tunnel made by South Koreans. Once you arrive at the train stop, you’ll fine 2 red lights on its tunnel roof. These two fine holes were bored by Sth Korean Intelligence. The discovery led them to where the Nth Korean army had dug their 3rd tunnel. From this point onwards, you need to be mindful of your head. It’s 2m wide and in height. Despite that, scaffoldings are in place to support the tunnel for 5M people passes through it, last year alone. I’m at 1.63m had to duck down at several points. There are more to see for I don’t wish to be a spoiler . Now, your 300m challenge to ascend to point A. #No cameras allowed. This was my flushed red face after the climb!"
Apprehensive at first...,"... because of the mixed reviews I saw here on TripAdvisor and other places, but it turned out to be an awesome visit. Most tours, I imagine, combine it with a stop at Imjingak Park, which in and of itself makes a nice day trip from Seoul. I'm not sure, but I don't think independent travelers can access The 3rd Tunnel without being on a tour. You see monuments everywhere in this area and going into the tunnel kind of gives you a good perspective on the war environment Koreans live in - whether they know it or not. Check out the small park in the back if your tour guide is not rushing you back on the bus. By the way, today there was a large group of young South Korean soldiers visiting here. The tunnel was quite crowded, and these fine young people were happy and having a lot of fun. I am glad I got to see them enjoying some time away from their training."
The Third Tunnel,"The tunnel is quite big, but not suitable for children or someone had breathing problem because you need to walk for about 1.5KM, you are not allouwed to take a picture inside the tunnel. There is a locker to put your belonging. Good for exercise."
Make Sure You Go Slow,"Yes - this is a tourist attraction and you don’t see anything of the real DMZ; however, it is still worthwhile to visit and gain some perspective on the significance of the area. The infiltration tunnel is very popular and it really is only for those in good physical health due to the 10° slant of the interdiction tunnel. If you aren’t in peak health you need to take this hill very slowly coming back out."
Worth a visit.,"This was the second stop on our tour of the DMZ. One word of warning. The tunnel is quite steep. Due to condensation, the walk going down can get slippery. Watch out for the school tours as the kids will rush past you. While coming up, I had to take a couple of breaks. There is another tour option that enables you to take a ride up. The folks who had signed up for that option had different colored hats and I would have picked that one.It is an interesting experience to see how far people will go to protect/attack."
Did this as part of half day DMZ,Neat experience. You can’t take pictures inside the tunnel but plenty to take outside. Tall people would find this challenging as well as anyone that does not like confined places. The walk down was easy but walking up was an exercise experience. Worth doing fort he experience. 
3rd tunnel,The tunnel is located at N Korea? You have to cross the Border?Hshshhshshsjjejhebbehjajwjjebbehehhebb
Tiring tunnel,Going down was easy peasy but going up is tiring!!! The slope is steep and long. All the belongings must be keep in the locker before entrance to the tunnel. Camera or mobile phone also not allowed here
Tiring Climb,"The tunnel itself is 300m long. Going down is easy. But going up is a steady 45 degree incline. But there are rest stops every 100m. It's a tunnel but it's not stuffy. Ventilation is pretty good. You're provided helmets too. But cameras and phones aren't allowed inside. You will need to put them in lockers provided. They show you the monorail. Apparently there is a difference between blue and yellow helmets. Yellows are limited. You walk through a shorter and tighter tunnel. If you're 5 feet above, you will need to bend to walk the length. The end is a wall and the amendment stone thing. Not much to see there. Only advice: bring water and a waterproof jacket. "
Good example OF The cold War.,The tour includes a short video about The Korean War and history OF The 4 tunnels discovered. There was a small museum at The back to explain The different incidents OF hostilities at The dmz. Then you get to descend down The tunnel UP to The 3rd barrier down about 200 to 300 meters. IT is a steep walk both down and UP. If your claustrophobic IT is not advisable.
As intriguing as it is challenging for those like me who are out of shape...,"A visit to the so-called ""Third Tunnel of Aggression"" is included in part of the half day DMZ tour that I had booked the day before in Seoul. The entrance looks innocent enough. Firstly you have to leave your bags and all cameras and mobile phone in the lockers provided - no photography is allowed in the tunnel. You then pick up a helmet and start a long 358 m deep descent into the earth. Going down is relatively easy - this access part to the real tunnel is wide, well lit and air conditioned. At the bottom, however you reach the tunnel itself which considerably narrower and low. I am 1,85 m. tall and I must have hit my head on the rocks above a hundred times. Thank goodness for the helmet. The walk through the tunnel is arduous. I didn't try to keep up with the more energetic visitors and took my own time. The full length here to the first of three concrete blockades is 265 m which doesn't sound like a lot but when you are stooping the whole time it is strenuous. The blockades are really the only things separating these two divided countries - incredible really.Of course you have to walk all the way back. Well, that was hard. I can only say that the climb back to the surface was a killer. I stopped twice to rest and let all the young kids behind me run up as if this was a breeze. And what a relief it was to get to the surface and sit down, sweating profusely. Well, at least I had accomplished something. "
Flat shoes and fitness advised,"We visited the thrid tunnel as part of a tour to the DMZ and this was one of the many fascinating stops on the trip. The thrid tunnel is one of four known tunnels dug by the North Koreans in an attempt to reach South Korea and attack Seoul.On arrival your given hard hats, as while at first it may look like a huge tunnel when you get the end, there is little space and a bumped head is almost guaranteed. Its approx 1.5 km down to the end of the tunnel and while the walk to the bottom of the tunnel is easy, the trip back to the surface is steep and not easy for the unfit. There is a train you can get to the bottom but that defeats the purpose of walking down and back up to the top of the tunnel, plus you don't get the heart beating and the buzz of having climbed back up. It can also get a bit cramped at the bottom, having to let people pass you, so its not anyone with a hint of claustrophobia.The South Koreans have rightly blocked off the tunnel into North Korea - there are 3 concrete barricades and you can only get as far as the third one, from where you can see through a small window to the second. Despite this you know you are tantalisingly close to North Korea.Back at the top there is a gift shop where you can buy rice grown in the DMZ among a number of other things!? Overall an fascinating stop which gives insight into the determination of the North Koreans."
So tired!!,This is a tunnel that make by North korea. It is hight 2m. long around 1.5km. (only tourist zone) Inside you can walk down to the turnel and becareful your head (Please wear the helmet). But the final is a border inside the turnel between North & South. After that you must climb to the exit ( So tired!!!) Please keep fit before come here
Interesting and significant,Great story about how the South Koreans discovered this tunnel by the north where they would have had unfettered access. The project was thwarted and reported to the UN as a violation of the armistice. The north accused the south of building the tunnel. No photos allowed in the tunnel. Quite difficult walking and much is fairly short so difficult for guys over 6 ft. Very interesting and worth a visit.
Important Site,This is an interesting site and very pertinent for current political climate. The attraction currently seems to be overbooked and very hard to fully enjoy. The intro movie was very bad in not providing an impressive explanation. But I would recommend for any to cut regardless.
Difficult but Rewarding,"This is one of the many tunnels that apparently North Korea digs to find ways to attack South Korea. This is the only one that is open for visitors and tourists to visit. Three things you need to know to help you decide to go for this or not:1. If you are claustrophobic don't go. It is very narrow in some places and lots of people passing to and from.2. It is a relatively steep slope going down and somewhat difficult climb walking back out. So you need to be prepared for that and wear good shoes. We saw one gentleman whose shoe's sole came out.3. If you are tall, you may have to bend almost all the way through as the tunnel roof is not that high.The good thing is that the tunnel is air conditioned so it is cool inside."
Not for the faint of heart!,"Walking down the challenge is not to go too fast... it's steep! Walking back up is a killer! If you have any physical challenges, recommend against doing this. Not really a lot to see, more the fact that the North Koreans were tunneling (and bragging rights that you made it down and back!).Understand you can pay extra to ride down and back but not aware of it when I visited. If it's running, spend the money!Displays are very interesting, as are the grounds."
Narrow,Interesting! But 30.000 soldiers in an hour... yeah right. An the strict no picture.. didn’t get why. The movie they show in the exhibition hall is like 9 minute b-movie trailer...
"Enthralling and educational, if not somewhat frightening","I have been to the third tunnel twice, and apart from being hard to traverse (at 184cm and 80kg; closer to 90 when I was last there) I had to do a lot of ducking and crouching and squeezing. Then again, anyone over 160cm will have to. It is very scary to think, as someone who lives in Korea, that throughout the country there may be dozens of hidden tunnels that the North Koreans can use to simply invade. "
Warning: Steep climb up and low ceiling,"It was a bit exhilarating visiting the 3rd tunnel knowing that there are only 3 concrete security walls separating you from a North Korean invasion. However, for those taller than 160 cm, it can be straining to be always stooping, and that steep return climb - good luck to those not so physically fit and with knee problems!"
Very strenuous walk up and down to the tunnel,"I’ve said in review of the tour group I went with (joint JSA/DMZ tour) that the physicality of the third tunnel is hugely underplayed by the tour guides. There’s a 450m steep incline down to the tunnel which you have to walk back up and it is a really challenging walk! If you have any mobility issues at all or are perhaps not as fit as you’d like then I wouldn’t go down. There are no resting points on the way up and the incline is incredibly challenging. There is a train but our tour guide said it has to be booked two weeks in advance and they hadn’t done so. Once in the tunnel there isn’t much to see and I’m not sure it’s worth it. No cameras/mobiles are allowed in the tunnel, you have to put everything into lockers at the top and you have to go through a detector to start the journey down so it’s a crouched lunging walk with a yellow hard hat on (blue of your allowed to get the train) for about 200m to the end then back again. The tunnel is quite tight (but nothing like the ones in Vietnam) so if you are claustrophobic or above 5’10” you may want to give it a miss. There’s some great monuments outside and the air conditioning in the gift shop and seating area is amazing. If I was to make a recommendation then find yourself a tour company that books the train down and back up otherwise I would probably give it a miss and use Google Images instead. "
No Cameras Allowed in Tunnel,The building containing the entrance to the tunnel is just across the DMZ Pavilion at the DMZ site. Cameras and phones weren’t allowed in the tunnel. There are free lockers in the building to store your camera while you’re in the tunnel. You’ll need to wear a hardhat while in the tunnel. It’s a downward slope to the bottom then you have to turn around and walk uphill back.There’s really nothing significant to see at the bottom but a concrete wall. It’s not recommended if you are claustrophobic or have mobility problems. It did remind me a bit like walking down into one of the tombs at the Valley of the Kings in Egypt but a much longer distance. There is a mockup of the tunnel outside near the “Unifying Earth” sculpture at the DMZ site.
"Tiring and scary to visit, but definitely worth it ","Would say this is a must visit area in the DMZ as you'll get to see the actual tunnel dug by North Koreans until they were discovered by the South.Word of caution though, as the tunnel is equivalent to 25 floors of a building underground, assessing it and coming back takes quite a bit of work. You'll need to walk down a steep tunnel, about 400m, to reach the place and back up, which can be quite tiring. Put yourself in comfortable shoes and bring water. The actual tunnel itself is also quite narrow and low, allowing only 2 line of human traffic and is around 160cm to 180cm in height. You'll need to bend a lot when down there and it can get scary for claustrophobic people. Still, the experience of walking in the tunnel and experiencing it for yourself is more than worth it. Makes you amazed that people actually dug through that scary tunnel. You cannot go out from North Korea side from the tunnel sadly as the South blockaded it, but you'll get to walk about 200m of the tunnel to and fro which is quite amazing itself.Strongly recommend it. "
Intense Experience!!!,"Not for the faint hearted or physically impaired! A bit of shopping and history at the entrance to the tunnel, no cameras, phones etc. allowed in the tunnel, they have lockers. A steep incline tunnel down but level footing and high enough ceilings that the South Koreans built to make the uncovered North Korean tunnel a tourist attraction. Once you get to the North Korean dug tunnel it gets crazy. About 1/4 mile long, the tunnel has extremely low ceilings, averaging 5 feet, so be prepared to stoop the entire way. Only a couple places for me to stand up straight (I'm 5'10''). The end might feel anticlimactic to some, but it is about the Journey!!!You have to wear helmets because to ceiling is so jagged and low. The walls are covered in coal dust because after the tunnel was discovered the North Koreans abandoned it and tried to disguise it. After the Korean war it is thought the North Koreans hand dug tens or possibly more infiltration tunnels with prisoners to reach Seoul and overrun it with troops. Several have been discovered so far over the years. A really interesting historical experience!"
Not worth the effort!,"I’ve done all the DMZ sites, so PLEASE heed my advice and DO NOT make an extraordinary effort to visit the Third Tunnel.Dorasan Station is worth seeing and the Dora Observatory is the best view into North Korea. Panmunjon is the ultimate site, where you can actually stand in North Korea (if you take the right tour). But the Third Tunnel was the biggest disappointment here!After a long, painful walk crouched down in a small tunnel, you arrive at the end and see a barricade that resembles a fake display in a cheesy museum. Through a tiny window, you see a second barricade roughly where the border between North and South Korea would be. But staring at a barricade turned out to be far less interesting than one would think.If your tour group is forced to make a stop here, your best bet is to walk down the long incline and stop at the bottom. There, a display indicates where the North Koreans stopped digging before the tunnel was discovered in 1978. DO NOT make a left hand turn and follow the masses stooping into a long, low tunnel with a painfully long walk to nowhere. The barricades are of no interest, especially if you are continuing to Panmunjon, the ultimate highlight!!!"
How devestated the korean war,This tunnel is the symbol about how devestated the aftermath of the Korean war. You can see how the tension between north and south during the cold war
"Neat to see, but nothing but a whole in the ground","The third tunnel, is just what is to be expected, a tunnel. You need to wear a hard hat, which normally is overkill, but in this case is needed. Being a bit over 6 feet tall, I was unable to stand up straight in the tunnel and hit my head (hard hat) on the rocks several times. It is interesting to hear the history of the tunnel, but once you are inside, you simply walk to the end, peak through a whole in the cement wall (supposedly looking towards North Korea) and then turn around. The history and meaning of the tunnel is great, but the visit itself is mediocre."
Insightful visit and a great trek,"We learnt much from this trip, and the walk was amazing. It’s a good healthy activity - had to stop a lady from tripping over as she gained too much momentum going downslope!!"
Unique and Adventurous Site,I enjoyed visiting the 3rd Tunnel and venturing down into it. A reminder of the continuing tension between the two Koreas long after the armistice. Definitely a steep climb coming back up so not recommended for the elderly! There’s also a museum on site with an enjoyable 8-minute film.
The 3rd tunnel,This was our 2nd time marching inside this tunnel and again the monorail is out of commission. Am again all sweaty as the half km walk i needed to bend. This is a must when visiting DMZ
Not for the tall!!! Interesting.,"The longest of the 4 tunnels found to date. The guide warns about coming in the tunnel if you have claustrophobia, asthma, etc. She didn’t mention how stooped you have to get to walk thru the tunnel if you are tallI Even someone of average height has to stoop somewhat. I. banged my head, fortunately they make you wear a hard hat, dozens of times. I was not a happy camper and sorry I did this tour. I didn’t mind anything - just the stooping. BTW, we were told it was 10 degree temperature in there. Some employees were wearing heavy winter parkas! I’m not sure what the temperature was but I never bothered to even but on my light jacket. It didn’t seem cold at all."
Never Again!,"So claustophobic , narrow way down 350m, than tunnel 158 cm height, no air, no emmergency way out, completely unoleasant experience. On the end after additional 260m you just come to concrete wall and need to go back same way. Just good workout without fresh air :)"
"The Journey, not the Destination","The Third Tunnel is definitely a fascinating thought for its intended use. The tunnel itself is not very big and I couldn't imagine troops passing through for an attack. Getting down and up from the tunnel is very challenging, even for those that are fit. There is a monorail but I don't know much about how to access it. Travelling through he tunnel gives quite a perspective but as you get closer to the end you spend a bit of time hunched over waiting your turn to see through a little hole in the wall to the other side which is NK.It is certainly interesting but make sure you are physically prepared for the journey."
Interesting but hard work for little reward,"I think the stories of the tunnel were actually better than the end experience! The walk down is easy but the flat part to the concrete walk is hot, wet and cramped. At the end there is a tiny window to look through, which you get about 5-10 seconds in front of. As there is a large line waiting behind you. Definitely not for the claustrophobic. The walk up is ok, if you have any level of fitness. For some it was a serious struggle."
Not for disabled or claustrophobic,"My friends went down this. They enjoyed it, but not much to see. They were glad I didn’t go as they had to stoop and it would have been too much for my knees. Not to much to see. Better to read the history in the museum."
Not worth it,"The trip down on a straight way 300 metres, then another 150 metres with a bend down head because you would knock your head... not my thing at all. In the end you look through a little whole to see a wall again. Not worth it"
"Much effort, little payoff","Toured the Third Tunnel -- so named as the third of four infiltration tunnels discovered under the border between the two Koreas -- as part of a larger tour of the DMZ and Joint Security Area. As a part of history it is fascinating to learn about the North Koreans apparently blasting through granite to create these access points to the south. As a site to visit the payoff is less enthralling. Visitors hike down a 45-degree incline about 300 yards to the tunnel, and then about another 300 yards in the cramped tunnel itself. The tour ends at the first of several concrete walls the South Koreans installed well short of the Military Demarcation Line. It's a workout, to be sure, especially coming back uphill, an uncomfortable experience for anyone taller than 5 feet 8 inches. You are likely to hit your head (helmets are issued), or strain your back or knees. No photography is allowed. There is some sort of tram option but that wasn't made available to our tour. Of all the things we saw this day, the tunnel had the least impact on me. All that said, I am glad I saw it. The more I think about the audacity of the North Koreans the more I wonder what else they've tried?"
A must of the DMZ,No doubt if you go to the DMZ you need to visit the tunnel. No pictures allowed inside but a great experience of true history.
Just see the museum,"Really, going in the tunnel is a very long walk, in a very narrow space and there is nothing to be seen quite honest"
Stupid,Nothing to see. You walk a steep slope down and up... and have to bend while walking into a dark tunnel intona dead end before turning back
✌️ ,"There are 4 tunnels discovered by the SK. One of these tunnels you will be visiting is the 3rd tunnel. However, please pay attention to your medical conditions should you want to see the edge of the 3rd tunnel. So sad NK built these tunnels all in the name of imperialism. Glad the SKs’ discovered these tunnels. It is believed that there are more tunnels unearth. No pix allowed."
Long decent but worthwhile- ,"The tunnel itself is not much to see but the whole concept from information about the tunnels, the decent, walk in the tunnel and final ascent was really interesting. Given that the boarder is so close to Seoul, it gave me lots of thoughts about the effect of a new real conflict in the area"
Long hike on return,"Getting to the end takes a while, but you're downhill the whole way. Just before the last stretch is some spring water (you can drink from your hand or a cup that's been used many, many times). The last stretch when I went was cold, wet, and a claustrophobic disaster (definitely require the hardhat). Looking through to the other end was neat, but not particularly exciting. The hike back up is /very/ good exercise."
"Historically interesting, but not as ""wow"" or impactful as initially thought","If you book a tour make sure to have all major sights included. This tunnel is one of them! You learn to understand how fragile this truce has been in the past and still is. If you have some handicap and walking is hard, take the train. Else -> walk! Feel how steep it goes down and how deep it is below the surface. Be prepared - the tunnel is narrow and low. If you're above 1,80m you'll be grateful for the mandatory helmet. "
Interesting place,The place requires you to have comfortable shoes to allow you to walk as you have steep slope that you might need to climb. It has quiet an interesting fact behind it on how north Korea built it to infiltrate into south. The pre tunnel tour takes you through a story of how north built various tunnels the to infiltrate into south. 
3rd Infiltration Tunnel,Recommend to take an english tour for this one as when iw as there we had an english translator with us. Also for people who are scared of small and dark space not to go on this one as you will go down underground via a small tunnel and walk quite a distance inside to reach the end of the tunnel. Ot was a great experience for me! 
Intriguing ,To think that NK was so close to attacking SK through tunnels. Lots to learn at this stop. If in Seoul you must go. This stop was part of tour we booked through USO at Camp Kim for $41. The tunnel is really hard for some people to walk out because it was steep walking. 
Not for the weak!,"Going down was okay but the hike up almost made us lose our breath! It was a hard climb and I wouldn't recommend people with weak knees, shortness of breath, etc. to go down. Also, those whose height is 5'6 and up will have a hard time going in as the tunnel is quite small. The hard hat doesn't really help much."
Unexpected excerise,"Man, it was quite a trip going down and definitely hiking up from the tunnel. At my height of 5ft7in. I had to crouch quite a bit while walking through the tunnel, so if youre any taller, you might have a hard time. Go during colder months as it would make hiking it easier."
The first time at ,"The third tunnel. It was a fun trip. You cover about a 5th if the tunnel. You walk down a fairly steep incline to get to the tunnel. Once you get to the tunnel, if you are 5 feet, you will spend the entire time hunched over to avoid hitting your head. Hard hats are provided as well as free lockers to lock up your items as no electronics or back packs are allowed in the tunnel. An hour is about all the time you need. The walk back can be taxing but there is a train that you can ride out on if you pay more money."
It's a tunnel,"Literally you will just walk inside the tunnel and at the end of it is a door with a small glass window for you to look at dimly lit part of the tunnel. I already forgot what I was supposed to see there. What made it exciting is the experience itself.How often do you walk in a significant tunnel? Tall people would tend to make some a loud noise when they hit their head in that tunnel. Vertically challenged people like me felt like it was just a normal underground tunnel except this one has a scary history and a reminder that threat is there. Also, at that time there was a platoon of young trainees. It made the view awesome! When my friend is slowing everyone down as she had to walk slowly due to health reasons, these guys were queued right behind her and did not overtake. Amusing and interesting view. When we were back outside of course ladies took pictures of those young men. Yes including us. I think for those who did not take the full day tour that is where their trip ends. Those who bought special tickets they had a different hard hat and got to see whatever is on the other part of that tunnel."
Not for the faint of heart,"This is not an easy tour. The downhill section to the tunnel is steep and longer than expected. The actual tunnel is very short, the helmet proved very helpful as we spent most of the time bent over at the waist and did hit our heads several times. There were a lot of people in the tunnel so we had to wait in line to get to the end, but there we were 170 meters from the boarder. Coming out was strenuous, but doable. My father is 72 and in relatively good shape, he felt that short hike for the next two days. I did see a woman with the cane and I'm not sure how she made it out, it probably took a while. Anyway, a great workout. It was very interesting."
DMZ,I went with a tour to visit the DMZ third tunnel. The tour was worth the price because we saw a lot of places. First it was the bridge and we took photos with the railway miniature train. Then we went into the third tunnel taking about 30 minutes to reach the end (about 256 meters) and then we peep through the hole and that’s it! We just got the experience of walking for half an hour through the tunnel and 20 minutes back. We also visited Dorasan Station. For $60+ AUD it’s worth the money to see lots of places which we don’t get to see often. In conclusion I recommend this tour because I think it’s value for money. 
Better wear your hard hat!,"This was another stop of our DMZ full day tour. First, you take a small open air tram ride down deep into a tunnel. Better wear the hard hat that is provided because a few people hit their head on the walls. Then you get off the tram and walk through another tunnel. When you walk you will be kneeling or hunched over for most of the walk.After you tunnel visit you go into a building and watch the history of how and why the tunnels came about. It is a short 10 minute film. Good history lesson. Tips:The tunnels are very small and confining. If you are very claustrophobic, you might want to pass on this one."
"Interesting to see, but overall just a tunnel","This particular tunnel was only discovered due to a defector from the North helping the South locate the area where it was being dug. The North dug hundreds of meters of rock to attempt to build a means of gaining entry into the South. This was done 25 stories below the earth. A very impressive feat.You have two options at this site - walk down a very long and wide tunnel that the South added after discovering the North's tunnel or ride a trolley down. If you're not in good shape, you should REALLY consider the trolley. Once you reach the bottom, you can walk a hundred meters or so of the North Korean tunnel, which is rather small and will require any tall individuals to bend over for most of the walk. There are a few areas where you can stand straight along the way to stretch your back and legs. If you make it to the end, you'll see where the South put up security barriers to prevent the North from using the tunnel any further.While this is an impressive display of manpower and it is estimated that the North has many more of these tunnels yet to be discovered, the overall location is just about walking or riding into a hole, seeing another hole and then departing. Good history, but not an all day affair."
Great experience,"Highly recommend visiting the third tunnel if you can handle the physical exertion. There is a fairly steep incline that you must go down for ~300 m to get to the actual tunnel. The tunnel itself is not very large and if you are tall, you will have to bend over. Be sure to wear the helmet they give you as it is easy to bang your head. In addition, it protects you from dripping water overhead. Be sure to wear running shoes as it can be slippery. The walk out of the tunnel is steep and requires quite a bit of physical exertion. If you can't handle actually going down into the tunnel, there is still plenty of information to look at as well as a small gift shop."
Better be in shape,"This is a passage built to take visitors down to one of the multiple tunnels NK built to get into SK. The trail takes you to the edge of the third tunnel, and you can observe but not enter the third tunnel. No pictures are allowed, you must check in any bags or cameras before you begin the descent. The return climb is steep, and they have several warnings about how strenuous it can be. In the same complex, they have a museum and several monuments about unification."
Quite an experience,"Going down is easy, coming back not so much! Wear comfy shoes and deodorant! And wear the helmet they give you the whole time! I banged my head like 5 times!!!"
Bring your running shoes,Requires a lot physical exercise. Definitely wear comfortable shoes. You are given a hard hat when you enter the tunnel. Quite a steep decline towards the bottom initially. The flat part towards the center has a low ceiling and the hard hats come in handy! Lots of people hit their heads. Worth the trek down and back up to be within 170m of the division between North and South. There are benches to rest on the way back up. 
pretty interesting but the hike back up is tough!,Overall I enjoyed the third tunnel but it is a taxing hike back up to the top of the tunnel. Crazy to think of how much time it took to build that.
"1,346 meter walk (of which 400 meters, upward) inside The Third Tunnel proved my recovery from kidney transplant!","Our walk inside The Third Tunnel is a very good experience and exercise for me. It was 400 meters downward, with aircon system and wood benches provided along the way. The facility was also provided with sturdy rubber matting for safety in walking downward. The hard hat became useful as we continue walking inside the tunnel proper (273 meters) as you'll get hit by the irregular rough edges of the tunnel. Despite my medium height at 5'4.5"", I needed to occasionally stoop down to avoid getting hit in the head (thanks to the Hard Hat). The challenge is going back along the same route with 400 meters upward. Praising my Great God for making it thru sweaty (despite aircon) 1,346 meter tunnel walk. "
"Cool attraction, very long walk!","Unfortunately photographs are not allowed in the third tunnel since you cannot bring anything with you into the tunnel other than the clothes you are wearing and a hard hat. The tunnel is 73 meters underground so the tunnel leading to the third tunnel is quite the walk down and and even harder walk back up. Once you begin going through the actual tunnel it's very low so you'll be crouching most if not all the time so be prepared to have a sore back. Once you get to the end you're able to look through 1' x 6"" hole into a lit area of the tunnel where you can see the North Korean side and their viewing hole. After that you walk back up and you're able to browse the gift shop from there."
Experiencing 3rd tunnel..,"By going inside the 3rd tunnel, there's not much to do, if you have heart and knee problem don't bother to go inside because it's a long walk. And if choose to go, ensure that you are wearing comfortable shoes."
The tunnel,"A little strange! No photos allowed! Why? It's a tunnel! North Korea dug it! They know what it looks like! Anyway, you put everything in a locker , put a hard hat on, hop onto the monorail and descend into the tunnel, about 350 meters. Once there, you walk about 200 meters to where the tunnel is blocked off and you turn around and walk back! Then back into the monorail and up you go! I think you do it just to say you've done it!"
Inside the tunnels,"Part of the tour to the DMZ was a visit to the third tunnel. We took the train inside, walked in the tunnel and I walked out of it. An historic place to visit which I enjoyed very much."
Unimpressive,Clearly doctored information concerning the discovery of the tunnel and misguiding information about the tunnel itself makes this part of the DMZ tour a bit lame.Walking the tunnel is awkward a leads you to a tiny window you can briefly to see... another concrete wall.Do cos you are there but don't expect much.
Good visit ,Walked the third tunnel. It's interesting to see how these tunnels were dug. Very iconic tourist site.
A workout but interesting,"You can walk down a 350 meter tunnel to the base of where the North Koreans tunnel ended. This hike is tough as it is 11 degrees, so be prepared for the hike back up. Once at the base you can walk to through the original tunnel for 250 meters. It is not very big so be prepared to walk bent over and wearing a hard hat that is provided."
semi-interesting underground experience,"Thank goodness they supply hard-hats. Almost everyone hit their helmet on the ceiling at least once during our tour. All the information is outside the tunnel. We took the train (or maybe it is a funicular?) into the tunnel. At the bottom, we followed a tunnel to a spot that was supposed to be below the DMZ. There was a barrier there with a window that one could peek through, but there was nothing to see except another barrier. For us, this was part of a larger tour, so I cannot speak about the value of the attraction compared to the price."
Great place to walk in history but No pictures 😩,"We did this as part of our DMZ JSA tour. It starts with an 8 min movies. You then walk across the parking lot. You MUST put all your electronics, phones cameras in a locker. Pass through a metal detector and walk down a steep 11 degree tunnel 378 meters down to the tunnel then prepare to hunch over and walk to were the tunnel was blocked. Behind the wall are mine fields and additional one meter think walls"
"Deep Tunnel, Train To Bottom, History Area","This is the much hyped tunnel that was dug by the North Koreans that went well past the DMZ line and against the treaty. They claimed they didn't do it. Well today they take a bus load of tourist past the 2k mark to the this tunnel. To get here, it is on a bus only and you pass a military checkpoint. You can walk the 250k plus meters down or just jump on the small train that looks like it came from a carnival ride. It is a long way down and nice and cool. At the bottom you can see the whole they found the tunnel with. It took them 3 years to find it after they learned about it. They say 30k soldiers per hour could have used it but I question that number. The tunnel is fairly small and you have to bend down to walk through it. They tell you not to take pictures and one of the workers follows the group to the end, but we were behind him. Not much else but a small tunnel and granite rock. After the tunnel you can walk through the history area. That is more interesting. Good photo opportunities at top also. (To Travel Is To Live)"
Seoul in a Day,Booked a half day DMZ your due to unexpected government cancellation of some points in full day. History of constant threat of war is a must see. The pain of a nation devised by tyranny of an oppressive regime in the north is evident by measures the south has taken to open ways for family to heal. 
Surprising ,It was surprising to know how the tunnel(s) came about. The walk in the tunnel was great. The fact that it is about 27 storeys deep was mind boggling. It was well preserved and in good condition for visitors.You might have to stoop if you are tall i.e. above 1.68m in height.
"Great experience, no photography, pay for the shuttle ticket if you find steep slopes hard!","Seeing the third tunnel is a unique experience. Walking down there is a steep slope and it is extremely tiring walking back up! If you may have an issue with this or simply just don't want to walk up and down there is a shuttle available. When you buy your ticket at the beginning you will have to buy either a shuttle or walking ticket. There isn't much to see walking down so you won't miss anything if you take the shuttle. At the bottom of the tunnel there is a fountain to drink from. Take your own water bottle to drink it. There are two metal cups there but everyone uses them and they are washed! Walking through the tunnel is cramped so I suggest you take the helmet as I banged my head a couple times. Photography isn't allowed and there is CCTV so I wouldn't risk getting caught. There is a photo station located outside where you can take a picture that looks like you are in the tunnel. Be aware that it was advised to our tour group asthmatics don't go down due to less oxygen at the bottom of the tunnel. Great experience, definitely worth a look!"
Take a tour of the tunnel,This tour involves physical activity. There is a long downward incline of a moderately steep angle that goes on for a couple hundred meters; therefore you will get quite a workout when walking up and out. There is a rather slow tram that runs at intervals. It costs about $3 extra to ride it. The walk through the real tunnel down below is fairly flat but with some uneven surfaces. Much of the lower tunnel has a low ceiling (if you are 5 feet tall you will need to crouch is many places). They provide hard hats to everyone and you'll need it. It also keeps the dripping water off your head. There are no photos allowed on the tunnel so they provide free lockers for your backpacks and cellphones.
Steep Slope -beware,The slope down and up the tunnel will be very challenging for the aged and adult with small children. do request for the monorail down and up if theres an aged individual in your group..me and wife were sweating and panting when we got out the tunnel..
Don't go if you are very Tall or Claustrophobic,There is a 300 metre train journey down to the actual N Korean dug Tunnel and it is very closed in but reasonably well lit. The 200 yard walk to the Concreted Tunnel blockage at or about the N Korean side was hard if over 5 foot tall but luckily they give you plastic hard Hats which saved me back injuries quite a few times banging my head on the ceiling. Fortunately no lasting damage. 
A great experience for those interested in war history!,"We went to the 3rd Tunnel with a group and had a lovely experience. Of note, the standard tour has A LOT of walking up and down hills and through tunnels. At 6'1"" I spent the entire length of the tunnel bent over and my back/neck feel it! TIP: There is a tram/train available and this can save you time and energy while visiting. Enjoy!"
Good experience,We took small train to get there. Helmet is absolutely necessary. I hit the ceiling by head at least 5 times. 
Part of the DMZ,Part of the DMZ but realy not impressive as you go down the tunnel that the north dug into the south in order to invaid. 
Not for the unfit,"This has been made very tourist friendly - but don't try the walk in the tunnel itself if you are not reasonably fit. It has a steep path, about 700m down to the actual tunnel, well paved and lit and some rest stops but it is a challenge coming back. Clean toilets and food and drinks. Outside a lovely little garden with a ""tree"" covered in messages to lost/separated relatives."
"Extremely interesting - steep hike up and down - wear the helmet, you will need it!","This was very interesting. You can't take cameras into this facility, and you are outfitted with hard-hats -- which you will DEFINITELY need. It was a pretty steep grade, so coming up was pretty strenuous. There are benches along the way where you can sit and rest for a minute and start the hike again if you need to. The number of holes they drilled before coming to the right spot was amazing. They never would have found this without the help of a North Korean defector"
Part of our trip to the DMZ,"As part of our trip, we were taken to the site of the third tunnel found in the 70's. It is set up for tourists, and unless you are very fit and able, don't go down the tunnel, as you need to get back up and we saw even young fit people panting when they returned. No bags allowed down, but lockers available at the beginning. You need 1 hour to trek to the bottom and back up. If you don't go, there is plenty of pictures and explanations at the top which give you as good or better understanding and view of what is down there. "
Highlight of any tour,"If you have the chance, visit the Third Tunnel. It clearly shows you what the North Koreans are capable of doing. Only one of a few discovered, it's rumored that dozens more exist."
Worth a visit!,This was part of our DMZ tour and it's a hard hat tunnel tour. The incline into and out the tunnel is crazy (equal to 10 storeys) and if your over 6 foot tall you will walking in the tunnel at a 45 degree angle (it's tiny!!). It's great for the experience!!
Amazing,"You ride down through parts of the tunnels, then you have the option to walk through part of it also. You definitely need to wear a helmet which is provided and bend over not to hit your head. The tunnel was built by North Korea with the intention of invading the South Korea."
The North Koreans were pretty sneaky!,"1 of a few tunnels, this took a lot of tenacity by the North Koreans. The tunnel is very long and through solid rock. It is difficult to walk through, you are bending over, but it is worth it. Definitely a work out. It is a learning experience that underlines the fact we learn very little about the Korean War in school. Definitely worth the visit."
Scary,Until we made this tour I had not realized how close the demilitarized zone is to Seoul. This is only one among the several tunnels the North Koreans dug with the intention of infiltrating South Korea. It will give you a mild shiver up your spine. 
Man-made tunnel,"You will learn a ton about the Korean conflict well at this location. I'm warning you anyone over 5'4"" will have a hard time walking this tunnel. I'm 5'9"" and I had to duck down walking a big portion of the tunnel. There is a lot of uphill walking as well. I would still thing you should go see the tunnel and learn about what happened here."
Tunnel,Tunnel is like 2 miles. Like 5'5 tall so is a nightmare for tall people like me. Still very cool and unique with some real history involved
A must-visit,"This is definitely one of the highlights of my trip, and is one of the main reasons why I signed up for a DMZ/JSA tour. No photography is allowed and you must leave all your belongings in the lockers provided (don't worry its free). Helmets are provided but still, watch your head as the ceiling is quite low. The walk down and up is steep but its totally worth it."
Of historical significance,"I gave this 4 stars though I could understand much lower scores too. This tunnel isn't overly exciting though the sheer manpower taken to dig it is extraordinary! As you make your way down the four-man width tunnel, think about the North Koreans who were forced to labour day and night to dig this by hand. The tunnel spans about 1.7km, though you will only walk 270 odd metres down it. It does get very low and your back will hurt from stooping over but wear the hard hat to protect your head! Honestly, what makes it amazing is to get to the end and peer through a small opening into what once would have been North Koreans digging away and North Korean soldiers preparing to attack Seoul. "
interesting experience - tall people be prepared to crouch,as part of the DMZ tour this was an interesting trip. a lot is made of the physical effort to do this but it's not a big effort and I saw people of many levels of ability - if you're unfit you just take your time.]there are video's of the tunnel before you commit so anyone with claustrophobia can make an informed view. You get hard hat and you'll need it if you've over 5 ft 7. the sound of bumping heads accompanies you the entire tunnel walk (although you can stand upright on the decline/incline! the video about the DMZ is very odd - going between tragedy and celebration is too short a time - interesting nonetheless.the area surrounding the tunnel has some beautiful statues/scultpures too
Best part of the short tour,"Eerie reminder that life in glitzy cosmopolitan Seoul is not all that idyllic. The war has not ended, the threat of Communism and a N Korean invasion is an uneasy reality for South Koreans. A tangible reminder of the evil of Communism, authoritarianism, and the high price of freedom. The film was well-done. My 9 year-old daughter said it was ""sad but nice."" The actual visit of the third tunnel involves a tram-type ride underground, and walking underground to see a part of the tunnel actually dug by north korea, ending in a view of the wall/ end of the tunnel that signifies the start of N Korea. One can see the blast marks of the dynamite that was used to carve out this tunnel through stone. "
A must visit,I visited here as part of an area tour. The tunnel is quite striking when you realize the significance of its discovery. The walk down to the tunnel is steep and it is hot and damp along the way. The tunnel itself is very low and you must wear a hard helmet which they provide. The walk back out may be strenuous for older or disabled people. I did see a train of sorts that people can ride down but I am sure you need to coordinate it. No pictures allowed in the tunnel.
Part of the DMZ tour,This is definately the best part of the DMZ tour. Be warned that you walk down over 300 metres to get to the tunnel and then need to make your way up - a very tough trip back up. I only noticed afterwards that you could book to go up and down with a sort of elevator cart - not sure how much you need to pay though. Worth it if you have difficulty walking
Not much to see,"If you are pressed for time, I'd suggest skipping this. We did it as part of a package, but I would not do it again. Basically you walk 300 meters down a really steep slope to the main tunnel and have to walk about 200 meters while stooped down the whole way if you are tall. Then you get to the third of 3 concrete walls the military installed to seal the tunnel. That's really about it. The trip walking back up the steep incline will leave you short of breath unless you go extremely slow.."
A CHILLING REMINDER OF THE CONSTANT THREAT OF NORTH KOREA,Hard to imagine the detailed tunnel schemed built by the North Koreans and makes you wonder what else they may have in place.
Spine-tingling experience,"This is one of the tunnels built by North Korea to iinvade South Korea. Its existence was reported in 1974 by a North Korean defector. The Third tunnel is arch-shaped with a total length of 1635 metres, 2 metres in height and and lies 73 metres below the surface. The tunnel is sloped 0.003 degrees towards the north so that water may be drained to the north. The wall of the tunnel has dynamite holes to explode base rock, facing the south. Traces of coal are to be found on the walls to disguise the tunnel as an abandoned coal mine. You can walk only 265 metres as concrete barricades have been erected. Those with back, knee and heart problems are best advised from entering it. Helmets are provided to protect from trauma. Free lockers are provided at the entry point to store cameras, mobile handsets as photography is prohibited inside the tunnel. There is a mock third tunnel entrance in the complex where one can take photographs. Nice experience! "
The Third Tunnel,"You can get a feel for the tensions between the North and South without going in the tunnel, but it does make for a more interesting tour if you at least go some of the way. There are a few places to sit and rest, and it is wide enough for people to go both directions. What is most interesting is that this is only one of many discovered, and how many from the North (30,000 troops an hour) would be able to move into the South from one of these tunnels."
Fabulous,I really enjoyed this and found it fascinating walking 'towards' north korea underground. It was quite well done and interesting story. It would have been good to see the other tunnels as well. 
Pretty interesting tunnel,It is quite a bit of a walk to the end and it is quite a steep climb back up so I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has issues walking. You get up to the demarcation line and see how the North Korean soldiers tried to dig their way to the South. 
good hike,"350m downwards and then a few hundred meters along in the tunnel with your head down. Although it might be scary for some on the first sight, the tunnel is very well ventilated and there is always space enough to turn around and walk back. The end of the tunnel is wired and blocked, with a see through window to the next blocked part - but worth the experience. It can be done with kidds/toddlers. Just mind your head (helmets provided). "
Very good with extra info,First you go to a small museum where they tell you about the tunnel. This combined with some history of the tour and the actual walk inside the tunnel makes it worth your trip.
Worth the Visit,It was interesting to walk through the 3rd tunnel and to tour the museum adjacent to this facility. The museum is well done.
Awesome,Very cool attraction. A must do if you go to the DMZ. It's a bit of a work out but not too much. The tunnel is small so it's a bit challenging for us taller people. 
"Well worth seeing, not for claustrophobics","This is one of several tunnels the North Koreans built to try to get an infiltration route into the south. It was discovered in the 1970's and a tunnel was dug to intercept the North's tunnel. Of course the North denied it was an infiltration route and said it really was a coal mine! However the tunnel was dug through solid granite, which my geologist friends say is not where you look for coal. It is about 250 feet deep and you can access the tunnel either by walking down a long sloping ramp, or by taking a bobsled-like cog railroad train up and down. The tunnels are quite low, and you have to wear a hard hat and try to avoid hitting your head on the irregular ceiling. It is cool, but not cold and the floors have a mat as there is some water running downhill (towards North Korea) You can walk, bent over, about a long block almost to the demarcation line, where the first of 3 barriers the South have erected to deter the North Koreans from using the tunnel in the future. When you are walking if you hear a sound like ping pong balls that is just some of the tourists hard hats hitting the ceiling, Because of the security, cameras and photography are not allowed in the tunnel."
Down to north korea - why am I doing this?,"Because its crazy....we couldnt take pictures unfortunately. Everything needs to be left in the bus or locked up in the available lockers.Helmets needs to be reused without desinfection, that was the only downside.But you ll need them for sure. Height is sometimes arounf 1.50 m only.If you dont like elevators this is not for you!First a short but intense propaganda movie is shown. Then your guides bring you down a newly built tunnel to the actual infiltration tunnel which is old and much smaller. Trainride down and up is possible if you pay extra (blue helmet).Walking is manageable but though. Its a 352 m stretch with 72 m decline. So its steep. After doing the round down there for 10-15 min in a uncomfortable half-bent position you need to walk all the way up again. Like some gym class....sweating garantueed."
Better Be In Shape...,"The Third Tunnel was part of a planned invasion scheme by the N Koreans that (fortunately) was discovered before an invasion could begin. The tunnel starts out as a fairly mellow walk down a wide cement incline. when it hits the N Korean tunnel, the walls are jagged, it gets narrow and you have to stoop pretty low - they give you a plastic helmet to wear and it came in handy as I banged my head twice on the metal beams on the ceiling. I did notice the people coming back up were dragging... After 15 or so minutes, you get to a strip of barbed wire and a cement wall - and that's it! You have to check your camera and cell phone in a locker before the tunnel, so you don't even get a photo of said cement wall. And then comes the long, hard slog back up. My feet and knees were throbbing by the end. If you have ANY back, heart or breathing issues, do NOT take this tour! If you wind up in trouble, it would be really hard to get help to you. The JSA is super interesting, this you can give a pass to..."
Trek to see a cement wall,"An entire infantry division can move through the tunnel in an hour. It took our group of around 20 close to that time because most of us were tall and we had to stoop. It was a hot day the day we went, so it was a pretty sweaty experience! The walk back up the tunnel was a bit of an exertion. Great little souvenir shop at the end of the walk, where ice cold drinks were available. No photos allowed in the tunnel. There is also a rail trip you can take - but it was booked out on the day we were there (takes around one hour). Walking or going by rail, you have to wear a hardhat. Strange experience to see a cement wall (first of three) to stop the North Koreans entering South Korea. Not a ""must do"" experience."
Not for the claustrophobic and physically fit,"Before we went into the tunnel, there was an interactive video showing the history of the Korean war and how those tunnels were discovered. Apparently there are a number of tunnels dug by the North Korean government to infiltrate South Korea, and this is the third tunnel discovered. After the video, we went into the tunnel, no photos allowed so we kept our cameras and cellphones inside the lockers provided. The tunnel is quite steep and for tall people, they have to bend their heads as the it is quite low. Along the way, there were several benches for the visitors to have some rest before continuing their journey. Do wear comfortable shoes."
Not as bad as expected,Yes its a long easy walk down but not so on the way back. I must have hit my head a few dozen times on the roof (luckily I had a helmet on). So envied those little grandmothers not even having to crouch !The stories about this tunnel and the others give an idea of the mentality of the North leaders.
"Long, steep, tiring walk just to see a tunnel.","Going inside the Joint Security Area (JSA) is a thrill. The rest of the DMZ tour attractions are not. This tunnel is close to the DMZ but not within it. If you can find a tour that is only the JSA, then take it.The other DMZ attractions are not within the DMZ. That said, the JSA is ""so worth it,"" having to do the other DMZ stuff is worth it.Please note that the United Nations has a dress code to enter the JSA in recognition of its importance and dignity."
Tiring and not much to see ,"You walk down a 350 meter tunnel ramp toward the bottom, where you have to crouch another couple hundred meters to see a concrete wall. Pretty tiring if you are not in good physical shape and a sweaty experience on hot days! The story behind the tunnel is interesting but I personally wouldn't have minded skipping it on my tour."
So worth the effort,"I read the reviews before we ventured out to the DMZ and the climb for the Third Tunnel. Many people lament on the exhaustion and physical exertion. Now I’m overweight and I have a bad back and I even helped my mother in law up the steep climb back up. If I was able to do it, I’m sure you can too. You are obliged to wear a hard hat as you will often hit your head with the steep overhead earth. It’s dark at times, it’s crowded but it is so worth it. How often can you say you walked through a tunnel that was prepared for an invasion of a country by a lunatic leader? You live once, it’s tiring but you gotta do it and afterwards you will feel proud of yourself."
Interesting,An interesting place to understand how North Korea has been trying to invade South Korea using the tunnels. 
Unexpected workout,You hike down about 300 feet below ground and back up again. Tunnel and exhibits are interesting to a degree. 30 minutes here is plenty.
Not for the faint hearted,"When they say that people with breathing difficulties, pregnancy or physical ailments should not do the walk, they mean it!Whilst there is man-made airconditioning for the most part, the air gets thinner and harder to breathe as you reach the bottom.The walk back up is not easy either, very steep. Several tourist buses arriving at the same time caused our walk to be incredibly congested that just made it even more claustrophobic!"
Tricked!,"The third tunnel is a tunnel that the north koreans dug towards seoul and was subsequently discovered. Interesting history, but not advised to do the third tunnel walk. you walk a few hundred metres long to a dead end and turn back laughing, ending up with a back ache as the walls are pretty low and everyone is walking in a prone position. HAHAHA!"
"Tough walk, totally worth it","One of my favorite parts of the DMZ tour, being able to walk down into one of many defector tunnels underneath the two Korea's. What a cool experience. It is a long steep walk and then you have to walk hunched over so this may not be a good fit for everyone."
Interesting Piece of History - For the Physically Fit,"The Third Tunnel is an excellent example of why South Korea must always be vigilant when dealing with the North. To make the walking journey down from the surface requires a fairly good level of fitness. The grade is 11 degrees, which make it difficult both going down and coming back up. Once you reach the actual tunnel, you must navigate the low hanging ceiling and support beams. You will be glad you are required to wear a hard hat because you willing probably hit your head at least once.At the far end of the tunnel is the first of 3 walls built by the South Korean Army to keep out visitors from the North.If you really must see the tunnel, I would recommend descending to the start, have a look, and then head back up to the surface."
Cool,We had an interesting time learned a lot and actually enjoyed the long walk down and back even though having to duck down for a long stretch of the tunnel but feeling part of history made it all worth it.
