Calmness in the city,Lovely parc. Perfect for an afternoon strolls or a day outing. It is filled with historical tombs and history. 
Images from Lotte Tower Observatory,Looking forward to visit this park on my future Seoul visit. I just would like to share the pictures I took from Seoul Sky of the Ancient Tombs of Seokchon-dong.
Relax place,Very calm and peaceful place. Entrance is free. Not much to do or see. Walking distance from Seokchon Station Exit 7
Amazing place to visit,I was lucky enough to visit when it wasn't raining (mid July). It has so much history and you can get a glimpse of all the history that this country has. Recommended if you have spare time!
Nice Park in the City,"Songpa-gu is one of the sections of Seoul. It is busy, but quiet. The Lotte World Tower is being built here, slated to be finished next year at 555 meters. The 1988 Olympic village is in a back corner, and looks like it would make a nice background for a gruesome video game or b-rate horror movie. Sad, and fascinating to walk through at the same time. Kind of like Chernobyl. But the Ancient Tombs (cough), mmm yes, the park in the middle of this part of the city is really nice. I liken it to Central Park in NYC. It is freshly mowed mounds with a low stone edifice in the middle, and a wide winding walkway all the way around. I went at night when the whole city was lit up around me, and I found this to be a quiet, moonlit stroll along with couples and people walking their dogs. Plus the history is fascinating too."
