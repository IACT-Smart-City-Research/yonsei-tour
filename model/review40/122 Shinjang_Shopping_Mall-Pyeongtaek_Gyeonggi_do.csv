Not as cheap as the 80’s,"I love to hate this place. I enjoy the shops and seeing all the clothing and Knick knack options, I hate that things are over priced and that you can hardly ask a question without the store owner thinking you’re going to buy something. The underground purse adventure is scary as sh!t but once you get out alive you kind hope it was all just drama for a tourist trap. The streets are smelly and dirty...typical for places like this, but they’re really trying to clean it up with new walkways and bringing new stores in. So if you can tolerate all the above then the food is totally worth the trip down here. You’ll find some unique places that make the shop haggles worth it. You won’t go hungry here. Also make sure to check out all the side streets, there are hidden gems to be found in ceramics, art, and furniture and it’s these places and the food that make the eating higher."
OK at Best,"I don't think there is much you can find here. Not much to see, little shopping and what there is you can find at each shop. You can find everything they sell here at the train station. A good walk if you have nothing better to do but I would not go out of my way to visit."
It has changed over the years,"On my first visit in 1992, this was still and active street and quite dangerous for a bar district. It's been ""cleaned-up"" since those days and now attracts families with their small kids. It is very quiet by night, but pretty rowdy on Friday and Saturday nights. choose your visiting time wisely; depending on what your looking for."
During a visit to the area,"It is outside of the main gate at Osan AB, lots of places to eat and shop. Be careful of the prices when shopping. Barter. You can also check the prices of many items that are also sold in the main train stations for cheaper. The vendors are used to people not knowing with the prices should be so be careful."
Shopping,"Lot of stores around of all types! Jerseys, shoes, furnitures, souvenirs, you name it. Couple restaurants around as well"
Days Gone By,The Shinjang shopping mall is mostly about shopping now. 20 years ago and before it was mostly a place to go to the bars and get just about the best time you could have if you had a little sense. Don't go there at night looking for so much fun anymore. It's all cleaned up and shined up and toned down in fun.
A hidden gem,"A great place to spend a lazy Saturday or Sunday Afternoon. Lots of touristy shops, restaurants, and bars. Hurry before this becomes Itawon South. New construction seems to pop up every day."
Blast of the past. ,Itaewon is overplayed and got too expensive. This area still retains its old school charm. Hurry before all the construction makes this Itaewon South. 
A lot to eat if with family. A lot to do if with friends. Good party area too.,"There is always a new place to eat or many places to go get drinks with friends. There are plenty of choices of restaurants from around the world. Mostly Thai and Turkish. But a little bit of everything. If you want a place to have a drink, all types of bars from kinda classy to borderline seedy. But it is well monitored."
"GREAT LOCATION FOR SHOPS, TAILORS, FOOD, BARS","Directly outside the main gate of Osan Air Base, this shopping street offers food of all types from around the world; shops such as handbags, blankets, tailors; and countless bars."
America land of sorts,"This little strip is the best thing right outside the base. Lots of stores for nice trinkets, luggage, and food. Food selection from McDonald's, Indian, Korean, Vietnamese to Turkish. Street vendors come out later in the day but also offer tasty snacks. The bars get quite busy late at night and there are plenty to chose from. "
Nice to simply walk through in the evening.,"This little gem is where I spent most of my evenings during my month stay at Pyeongtaek. Many food choices (even a McDonald's if you're desperate) for one to select from. I had my favorites, but ate at many. The shopping is nice and you can find something for everyone back home. It's busy, especially on the weekend evenings, but still an enjoyable stroll."
Everything packed into a small area.,"Small shopping area the caters to tourist and service women and men. Lots of international and local cuisine along with McDonald's and baskin robins. Numerous bars and night clubs playing American music at all hours. Shopping a plenty! Clothing, Beauty products , motorcycle gear, custom tailored items and souvenirs."
Really wakes up in the evening,"Sinjang or spelled also Shinjang Shopping Mall starts right outside the entrance to Osan Airforce Base. It consists of large indoor and outdoor area, main street and alleys. It is a busy place that gets even busier around 6 PM. It naturally caters to foreigners but it is also frequented by the Koreans. There is a great selection of restaurants and fast food places including Mc Donald's, Popeyes, bars, ice cream places. You can enjoy Brazilian food, Mexican, Korean. Many kebab establishments are run by Turks. Custom tailors, souvenir shops, small food vendors are everywhere. The indoor section looks like alleys covered with roofs. It houses also a food market which is very interesting. The entire area appears reasonably safe and friendly. There s something to see for everybody."
Two worlds,"The shopping and night club area are tangled in a strange mix. There is still a bit of the seedy nightclub scene catering to the US military nearby. If you want a huge variety of clubs full of 20 and 30 somethings from the US, there is a lot of that. Especially in a few of the back alleys. On the flip side, there are quite a few shops and retaraunts that are also frequented during the day by locals. If you want more lpcal flavor, skip this area and go on the other side of the subway tracks. Its cheaper and there are no bars pumping profanity filled music into the streets. If you are young with no kids and want to party youll love the night scene."
