"It reminded me of Antalya, Turkey",A very beautiful and peaceful place. If only the food was cheaper... You can walk along the long beach. At night the light up the place so you can still see the sea to some extent
Mudfest,Came during mudfest and had a really nice time. There are several facilities along the way to grab snacks or drinks. View was nice and the summer is def worth a visit with or without the event.
Beach trip ,"It’s a nice beach, I enjoyed my time there. I loved that you could rent tubes and float in the water. There was a lot of trash as the tide came in but that’s that same for most beaches. There wasn’t many rocks in the water which was good for my feet. The sunset there was beautiful. "
Famous Beach of the MUDRUN!,"If you are visiting Korea especially for the first time then this is a must see Beach. There are just a few Beaches in Korea with fine white sand fro long stretches. This is one of them. It is located off Hwy 15 south of Seoul around a 3 hour drive. There are many great hotels either right on the Beach, or within a 2 minute walk. Mudrun plaza is where you will find the MudRun festival during the last weeks of July. This festival is a must see if you are a student or expat living in Korea. The festival lasts an entire week and draws half a million to million plus crowds. There is usually a large expat presence at this festival, and it is considered one of the best festivals in Korea. If you plan on going there, book your hotel room around April or May. If you cannot find a decent priced hotel, stay down the road at Muchanpo Beach. It is only a 10 minute drive from Boreyong South and the hotel prices are cheaper during the festival. Taxi fare from each beach is around 12,000 KRW ($11.00 USD) each way. Hotels are 20% to 30% cheaper than Boreyong, as it is less crowded and packed. "
Daecheon beach rail bike,Is this dangerous / suitable for 4 year old? Not sure if he might be scared. Is there a safety strap on the seat? 
"Nice Beach, Food and Activities!!","We came here with the intention of trying out the Dacheon Rail Bike!! It is nice and the scenery is awesome as it’s oversees the Sea. A Tip, the ticketing counter opens at 9am when they issue you a number. At 10am sharp, they will call for the number and sells the tickets.Having a shrimp burger at the beach is also a nice thing to do!! For the night, we had great shells!!! It’s just awesome and keeps coming :)Enjoy guys!!"
Best beach in Korea,"West coast beach is the best. Stay nearby in motel etc and enjoy great seafood.Water is clean, beach wide with nice sand and lifeguards.Lots of young people around. "
Home of the annual mud festival,"I visited this beach while in town for the mud festival, a unique and recommended event if you find yourself nearby. Lots of delicious seafood restaurants (among others) line the beach. "
Clean,Nice if uninteresting beach tainted by the smell of the fish restaurants nearby and the fireworks ( poor ones ) at night.
Good beach and many restaurant,"CY ( 2016.11.21 ) I and my wife visited this beach in vacation. Because of visiting November, so there was not many people and quiet. The seaview was not bad, and along beach line, there was many clam and sashimi restaurant. We were satisfied with winter beach and quiet atmosphere. There was good place to enjoy in summer, but there was good in winter, too."
Spacious and beautiful,"We visited this beach in mid-September and, if in the area, would certainly consider returning. It is huge and had plenty of space for everyone. If you lay on the grassy area at the back, you can have shade all day, and of course lots of room on the sand too. We arrived around 9:45 in the morning and it was virtually deserted, but by the time we left around 3:30 PM there were lots of people there. It was peaceful, happy and lots of food options nearby. Definitely recommended. I hear we were there in low season – might be a lot busier if you go in July or August."
A great place to visit,"I've been to Dacheon Beach several times over the years and it's always an enjoyable outing. It's a great day trip from where I live in Pyeongtaek-si and it's also a nice place to stay overnight. There is a wonderful pottery shop on the road to the right just before you get to the beach (maybe a mile or two away) that we always stop and visit. Finding non-seafood food can be a challenge but everything I've had has been delicious. The only drawback, if any, is the ""sand"". It's kind of like getting egg shells stuck on your legs with egg white - it does not brush off easily!"
This sea looks beautiful but..,"Actually, the sea was not beautiful and it was taste like awful. When you got tons of mud, you will be able to wash your body in the sea. You gotta try it!"
Paragliding near boreyong beach,"It's an awesome experience. Fly to the sky team conducted paragliding. We had a great experience. View is superb. Team is very friendly, speaks very well."
Korean MT Trip,"It's a good beach, always some children with their parents at daylight. Some couples near the sun set , and some old guys walk at the end of sun rise. All in all, this is a nice place to take a break from big cities. "
crowded during holiday & really dangerous off season (swimming impossible due to aggressive wave riders),"We often visit. Crowded but OK during summer vacation. However off season had very bad experience with aggressive wave riding young man.Weather was beautiful , mostly foreigners were swimming including children and were harassed by wave riding youths. They went very fast and close chasing swimmers out of the water even in 10m distance to shoreline. After some time no swimmer in the water anymore. My Korean is good enough so I asked to further out but I got the finger. I complained at tourist site who called police. Police said to me that swimming off season is illegal for safety reason (no lifeguard) so it is OK if people are chased by wave riders."
Excellent place,Its a great beach where international mud festival takes place. It is maintained well. You can enjoy the sunset peacefully.
A totally different and awesome experience!,"Boryeong Mud Festival is an annual festival which takes place during the summer in Boryeong, a town around 200 km south of Seoul, South Korea. The first Mud Festival was staged in 1998 and, by 2007, the festival attracted 2.2 million visitors to Boryeong.Its an amazing opportunity to have fun with friends and enojoy yourself. For the period of the festival several large attractions are erected in the seafront area of Daecheon. These include a mud pool, mud slides, mud prison and mud skiing competitions. Colored mud is also produced for body painting. A large stage is erected on the beach, which is used for live music, competitions and various other visual attractions."
Nice & Clean Beach!!! Not at all crowded and Private!!,I liked everything around Daecheon beach its a mesmerizing beach!!! Its where the famous Mud Festival happens in July. Best hotel in boreyong are located near Dacheon Beach.
Great for a fun day in the sun.,"Not the best beach, but good enough if you're in the area! Go for swim. Nap in the sun. Try some streetfood, or one of the local seafood restaurants in you're up for a treat. There are separate men;s and women's restroom and indoor (but cold-water only ) shower facilities near the beach too.Daecheon is also where the famous Boryeong Mud Festival occurs in July. (The mud at the festival isn't from the beach, it's a gray matter of unknown origins.)"
Long clean sandy beach good for swimming,"We have been going to Daecheon beach for years since we moved to Korea, first as a couple and now as a family. So I can estimate it from different points of view. My overall rating is somewhere around 3.5/5, as the beach is good, and one of the best we've been in Korea, but a bit overdevelopped in some ways, but underdeveloped in others.In short:PROs: - close to metropolian area (around 140 km, 2-2.5 h by train to Daecheon station or by highway 15 from Seoul/Incheon/Suwon)- long sandy beach (shell sand), no rocks, no seaweed, no silt- warm and clean water- OK slope for swimming even at low tide- good facilites (toilets, showers, parkings)- large choice of acommodation (hotels, motels, pensions with kitchen, minbaks - rooms in private houses for rent etc.)- beautiful sunsetsCONs:- (any season) limited choice of food: basically, it is only seafood and raw fish- High season: VERY crowded - High season: annoying safeguards will not let you go into the water deeper than your waist- (any season) noise at night from fireworks, especially if you stay in the 1st rowNow in more detail:What is good for everybody: the beach is really long and sandy, it has, of course, low tides, but it is so so much better than at other beaches of Korean West coast! At low tide you can swim all right, and you do not need to go miles through ankle-deep water and stones and seaweed. Best time to visit is June and September, when water is already/still warm enough, but Korean ""high season"" has not beagun/ended. The water is clean (at least as clean and clear as it gets at Yellow sea). And it is warm, the temperature in September may be around 28C.SOUTHERN PART - Singles/Couples/Friends:The beach is long, and the atmosphere of various parts is somewhat different. If you come by train/bus/taxi from train station, you will probably land at southern tip of the beach where most nightlife is. There are many karaoke rooms (norebangs), nigh clubs, a concert scene, a water park and an amusement park etc. For somebody it may be good, but all this entertainment also means a lot of noise into the night, dirtier beach and roads, drunk people around etc. Accomodation in that part of the beach is mostly inexpensive motels (there are at least 2 high-end resorts, but at northern part you will find more hotels and pensions). We used to stay there to save some $$, but not anymore, as we now travel with our baby.NORTHERN PART - Families:This part of the beach is much more quiet, but still noisy at night from fireworks being set off at the beach. Less people, less noise, cleaner beach. There are many hotels here with nice sea view rooms and nice parks with sculptures. There are also pensions - more family oriented places with kitchen. Still, the more lively southern part is not far away - it is just a mere 15-20 minutes leisury walk along the beach. Also, you can take a nice seaside stroll north to the Daecheon port. On your way you can round a hill overgrown with thick woods. And there is a pension with nice view on that hill.DOWNSIDES:1) Limited choice of foodthe area is huge, but there is no place to eat anything but endless seafood bbqs and raw fish!! If you are not a fan of this stuff, and of fast food either, than bring your own food or cook it if you stay in a pension!! It is really really frustrating that ""standard"" Korean food is hard to come by,and no western food is available. Honestly, I don't understand how they survive, those seafood restaurants with exactly same menu located side by side! It gets better, as there are now a few caffes, and one place called Orange with a really nice terrace to admire the beach and some western- style food, though, of moderate taste and expensive.2) Annoying safeguardsThey will not let you go into the water deeper than your waist. This is really annoying, what is a purpose of coming to a beach if you can not enjoy swimming?? But I believe they are on duty only at high season.3) Very crowded at high season/Mud festival timeI would avoid it at these times as it gets VERY crowded, dirty, noisy, full of drunks etc. Also at high season, hotel/motel/pension prices go 2 or even 4 times up!! It is not worth it. Mud festival may be fun, but may be too much for some people, so be prepared! Other option to experience the mud is a Mud center at the southern end of the beach. Otherwise, you can find the mud at low tide just poking out of sand (tip: search in front of Mudrin and Mud beach hotels). 4) Very noisy at night because of fireworksIt is nice to stay in a room with seaview, but at Daecheon beach it is not nice to sleep in such a room! Because people set off fire works all night long and it gets very noisy. Bring ear plugs if you want to stay in a 1st row hotel.Have a good time at Daecheon beach and hope it helps!"
Good,"Though the beaches are muddy and not a crystal clear one, this beach is famous and happening one. Defintely one time visitable place."
Mud Festival tops the beach!,"Actually, before I came there, I had known there is such a beautiful beach. Firstly, I came there for Mud Festival 2014(with admission fee). Beside the exciting amusement facilities all about mud, I noticed the beach. When I approached it, I was called to enjoy the sand and sea. Especially when friends come together, I believe you would have an unforgettable experience like mine. There were some street vendors selling official mud-related makeups or swimming wears near the beach, and I suggest they keep staying there."
The Setting of Mud Fest.,"If you're rating the beach itself, it seemed pretty good. The area is definitely pretty. I went for Mudfest, as you may have noticed from the title. If you choose to go, go on a saturday. We went on Friday and there wasn't enough people really. The have a bunch of big inflatables, which that add this water like mud to. I don't know the self promotion rules on here, but I wrote a long review on whiskeyandwanderlust.com that covers my thoughts on it if you want more detail."
