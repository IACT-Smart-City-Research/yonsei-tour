A nice place to enjoy the view,"We stopped at this nice city park to enjoy the overlook of the Aneseong River estuary. While we were there, we had the great fortune of listening to a solo guitarist playing Korean folk songs. The very tidy park is adjacent to a maritime museum/dock with WWII warships, and is adjacent to a large fish market. The kids got a kick out of watching the vendors hawk crabs, clams, and eels. It was a nice cultural trip."
