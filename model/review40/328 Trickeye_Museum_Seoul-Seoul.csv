Fun!,Weather wasn't the best when I arrived i Seoul so my Daughter suggested us to visit the place. We had so much fun and giggles.
Loved it,Loved everything about The Trick eye museum i would highly recommend this to all my friends and family..love it
Highlight of Seoul,This museum was one of my most memorable place in Seoul. It was very interactive in that you can be a part of the art and take lovely photos. I would advice going with friends in other to take photos of each other.
Tacky Fun!!,"This place is so incredibly tacky that you can't help but to have a good time! It was well worth it for the laughs! There's an app you can download to ""enhance"" your experience but it didn't work half the time. There's another tacky Love ""Museum"" upstairs that's very graphic but hilarious...don't bring the kiddos! We had a good time in this cool college neighborhood. Found an awesome craft beer joint around the corner. You can definitely make a whole day checking out Hongdae!"
"Fun, but not a ""museum""","First, this is not a museum in the conventional sense. It's a series of wall paintings and mirrors, and other things where a participants can sit, lie, stand, etc in designated locations, and it appears you are flying, being eaten by something, are cut in half etc. It's more like a well organized carnival fun house. Overall it was enjoyable. Not something you can do repeatedly, but it's a good way to spend a couple of hours and take some fun photos. You NEED to come with someone else to help take pictures or else you are constantly asking people to help you. The images / illusions are big, so you can't really do it via a selfie."
So-So,"Considering this place is top rated amongst tourist. I feel that there needs to be some kind of guidance. There was a language barrier and no one could assist us on how things worked. Also the space is very limited. Too many people going in at once, no room to take pictures and the locals had no sense of awareness of other people taking photos. Nonetheless once we got some infoFrom another tourist and the place cleared up. It was good experience.**tip- maybe have some control the flow of people coming in and give some kind of time limit. Also for couples- we wanted to pics together but non of the staff could help us out. Maybe have staff members walking around offering to take your picture."
A different and fun experience,"Trickeye Museum??? Who knew!This is an experience not to be missed if like us, you have no idea what to expect.I’m not going to say much as I don’t want to spoil it but it was the best few hours we spent in Seoul.....lots of fun! The “love” museum and an ice museum are in the same complex and all 3 are good fun.After the ice museum you can also have a nice latte with your picture printed into the cream topping too!!!"
An interesting experience,Had a lot of fun and took some crazy pics. There were indeed some eye bending displays that wow'd me. Was definitely worth it for me.
1st time in Trickeye Museum,"I had a fun time here, it is highly recommended to anyone visiting Seoul. Everyone would have a guarantee unique and satisfying experience. Two thumbs up. "
Amazed,I have truely enjoyed my visit here. The staffs were welcoming and atmosphere was fun. Next year's round 2. Thank you trick eye. 
Amazing!,"Such a fun experience, would 100% go again. Lots of good photo opportunities! Cheap for what you get, great fun. Before taking photos/videos spend a little time practicing! "
Not a museum ,"I’m not sure why this place has received so many positive reviews. It’s a gimmicky place that is reminiscent of a Fun House at a County Fair. However, it is not at all suitable for children. "
It was fantastic,I had such a fun with my three young kids.There are so many photo spots and it's a perfect place to visit with young kids.I will definitely visit again!!
Trip to Trick Eye Museum (& Love & Ice Museum),"The trip to the Love and Trick Eye Museum made me and my friends laugh the most. It was fun trying out the different illusions in each museum. And both museums have suggestions on the sides on how to pose and markings on where to stand to make sure you take the best pictures possible. However, the love museum is definitely for adults only. But the trick eye museum and ice museum is for practically anybody! It was really cold inside the ice museum so I suggest bringing something warm to wear if you want to last longer than 10 minutes in there. Overall 10/10 would recommend."
"fun with the kids, better than expected","a little crowded, but fun to take funny pics. definitely get the app to play with the vr pics. near the new harry potter cafe so a good two activities with lunch in between"
Trip to Trick Eye (& Love & Ice) Museum,"I went to the Trick eye museum with a few of my friends. Trying the different poses was surprisingly fun. I had always wanted to try the height illusion and had a blast seeing the pictures of the illusions. Of course finding the right position takes some work but they have some example pictures on the wall that make it easier. The moon landscape was so beautiful, those pictures came out so pretty. We also did two of the virtual reality games and that was so fun. We all had a good laugh. 10/10 I recommend.The love and ice museum are also in the same building so we did those too and I was pleasantly surprised. Ice museum was really cold so we didnt last long in there but going down the ice slide was fun. And the love museum was a laugh but definitely for adults only . Overall, had a great time."
Really fun! Lots of picture options,There’s so many backgrounds to take pictures on so no doubt you’ll get great pictures. They even have certain place marks to stand on to get the best picture and to truly capture the illusion. It was a great opportunity to get some fun pictures with my friends. Highly recommend!
Trickeye museum ,트릭아이 인생샷~!!!!친구랑같이 같는데 엄청 이쁜 포토존 많고 커플들도 찍을수 있는 곳도 많고 돋보이게 혼자 찍는 곳도 아주 재밌거나 이뻐요 .나와서 있는 VR은 방탄(BTS)도 탄거 같에요!! Trick Eye's life shot!I'm with my friend. There are so many pretty photo zones. I think we're on BTS too!I prefer 100%
Good stop and fun if you have the time,"It is a little time consuming and tedious sometimes, but it is definitely a fun experience. The photos are better without the AR sometimes and the AR APP really drains phone battery. But if you don't mind looking silly and getting down and dirty for pics, it is a lot of fun"
Good to experience,"This is a place for selfie lovers, photographers... the technology is really cool to experience, can get a little frustrating as some people walk into your frame right as your about to take the pic. Note the ice section is absolutely freezing and very small. I was in and out of there in 3 minutes. You are required to download an app that allows you to experience the AR.Be sure to bring a power bank because omg, it drains your battery...."
Love Museum,"It was a fun place to be, hilarious jokes. Can't be serious when visiting the attraction. Very simple, old school jokes. Was a great start to our Korea trip!"
Dated museum,Only some art pieces are 3d. the rest are normal. this is the 2nd time i come here. Feel so old the place has become.
Lots of fun!!!,"We had a great time, lots to see and very well laid out, we are an adult couple and highly enjoyed ourselves, it is also a very reasonable price and includes admission to the ice museum. "
Get the full package! Trick eye museum + ice + one VR game,"Trick eye museum was pretty fun, definitely need to download the app for the best experience (which is free and there is free wifi there as well). Spent around 50min in the Trick Eye museum, great for all ages. Staff was extremely friendly and helped out a lot of things that we were (quite stupidly) having troubles with. Best part about it is it is in the heart of the Hongdae area, surrounded by street shops and food! The museum is only around 10min walk from Line 2 Hongki University Station, but was a fun walk with all of the shops around. Get the ticket that includes the ice museum and one VR game! Love museum also one floor above that looked pretty fun."
Great experience at the Trick Eye Museum!,"This is a great place to visit with friends and take some time out from shopping in Hongdae. The museum has free wifi so you can download the app on entry and take AR pics. It was a lot more fun than I expected it to be and I would highly recommend.Also visited the ice museum which was a really cool experience. There is an ice slide there that you have to try out. Would recommend taking a jacket as it is quite cold!Overall, fully enjoyed my experience in both the trick eye museum and the ice museum and had a lot of fun."
A lot of fun!,"What a fun morning we had here! We bought the ticket that included the Ice Museum and Virtual Reality ride. As we were warm we went into the ice museum first. You are given a plastic poncho to put on because it is very cold. It has ice sculptures and a slide you can go on. We then had the VR ride (chose the rapids ride) before heading into the trick eye museum. This included lots of pictures and sculptures you could become part of via photography. You could download a free app that when you held it in front of the pictures turned them into 3D and made them appear to come alive. We had a ball and laughed heaps. It really was fun! If you are open minded, as we were, I recommend you go the the Love Museum upstairs on your way out...very eye opening!"
good place to have fun with friends,a good place to have fun with friends in Hongdae. the museum has a lot of 3D arts to trick your eyes and you can have more experiences via the application of the museum.
Great experience with AR services,"I visited the museum with some friends during chuseok. Never expected to have so much fun in here, the place is divided into 3 sections: ICE, TRICK EYE AND LOVE MUSEUM. The trick eye museum has so many places to take great and fun pictures. PRO TIP: Bring some friends for extra fun."
Love it so much!,"I visited Trick Eyes Museum and loved it so much! It is really good program with your friends too. I went there with my husband and he really loves the Love Museum hehe We took more than 100 pictures there. I recommend to wear a nice, but comfortable dress :)! It is crazy hot in Seoul nowadays so the Trick Eyes Museum is really good indoor program.I recommend for family too, I am sure children loves colorful pictures and the atmosphere!"
Fun With Augmented Reality! ,"Trickeye Museum Seoul went up the next level by being the first to introduce augmented reality in its photo attractions. We had lots of fun here. You can also purchase a combined ticket to the Ice Museum, VR arcade or Beauty Inside Exhibition too. Good to spend an hour or two here with your loved ones and friends. "
Fun place in Hongdae!,"I went to the Trick eye Museum with a friend, they have a lot of various interactive pictures thanks to their application. It really feels like you are getting inside of the pictures and they are very realistic! Got a lot of fun staying there. we staid there for around an hour to do everything. A must if you go to hongdae!"
Unique Art,Being in the Trickeye Museum is like being transported to different places at one time. The 3D art were so unique and I had so much fun taking pictures there.
good experience at an affordable price,"two people for $22, very reasonable, and the experience was great. We took some of our favorite photos of the entire trip at the trick eye museum, especially the portrait handing the flower and the giant fish-monster (it'll make sense if you go)"
"Fun place, very reasonably priced","For $11 per person this was a fun experience. We got some pretty memorable photos, probably our favorite on the trip. Worth checking out if you're in the area."
Super fun,They have an app that you can download that makes the art come to life. I've never seen anything like it and I imagine that we will soon all over the world. It was really fun (even as two adults). There's also tons of great street food near the venue. Bring change for the lockers. 
amazing museum,"use the app to take animation is funny, can spend at least 2 to 3 hours playing with the animation, during our visit (morning), there was not so many people, it is important, so that we can take photo freely anywhere "
Worst experience ever!,Do not visit this museum when you are alone. You just loose your money. People working there are extremely unfriendly and not helpfull at all. They refuse to rake even a single picture for you. I payed a lot of money just to be there alone. It has absolutely no meaning visiting this museum if you cant have pictures. I left after the first room. I lost a lot of money for nothing. This museum should get rid of the present people “working” there and start over with a staff that enjoys working with people. Really my worst experience in 3 weeks South Korea!!!
download the app for the best videos and pics,"so much fun and unique. you can download an app that will activate an interactive scene with audio and video, like a dragon roaring and breathing fire with you in front of it. there are some risque scenes of nudity but nothing you can't laugh off with kids. there's also an ice museum you can pay in addition to this."
Amusing but quickly crowded,"The visit was very interesting, some optical illusions were quite impressive and funny. However, you need to download the museum's app to use the proper camera inside ; it makes your phone heat up and lose battery quickly. I would recommend going right at the opening hour or during lunch because the rooms get crowded easily and it doesn't help you to make the most of the exhibit.Tip: we bought a ticket that included the entrance to the Trick Eye exhibit, the Ice Exhibit and the ""Beauty Inside"" exhibit - it's worth it!"
Fun place,A very good place to enjoy taking nice funny pictures. It’s good for ppl of all ages who just want to have fun.
Hilarious,We had such a fun experience here! Kids enjoyed it just as much as the adults. Make sure to download the free interactive app while you’re there. It will make your pictures come to life! Fabulous and well-worth the visit!
Fun For Teens,My family of eight visited the Trick Eye Museum June 2019. It was very underwhelming. First you download their app onto your phone and then take videos of friends moving in front of a picture. The app allows animated action to take place and when you play it back it is fun. The museum is in the basement of the building which also includes a giant freezer with a slide and ice sculptures. If you are looking for something that takes about an hour you might enjoy this. Personally I would skip this - not because it is bad but because it isn't great.
Waaaaaaaaay too crowded and not all that great,"SOOOOO we thought this would be a fun way to kill an hour or two---- it was absolutely stuffed with pushy tourists who have no sense of personal space, so any chance of getting a cool pic was totally ruined. Would not recommend. "
"new corner for photo shooting, many people in there","I had a great time with my friends in the museum. I recommended them to go for taking photos and there is still the supermoon that can take beautiful picture. Friends were surprised to see the AR effect in the APP and it's new to my friends. Also, new corner is added near supermoon which can take pretty photos too."
Fun place in Hongdae,It's a cool place in Hongdae to have fun with family! It's good to download the Trickeye carema apps to get 3D effect for the picture!
Great day out,"This is great entertainment for all family members. You download their app onto your smart phone. Point your phone at an image and it comes alive...If in Seoul try your best to bring your family or friends to this, you wont regret it..."
Fun place to visit,is a fun place to visit for everyone~ strongly recommend to download the camera apps to capture photo or video
The place was fun and interesting,"Using 3D augmented application, photos and videos get interesting and live. Fun place if you go with someone together. With one ticket you can visit both Trick eye museum and Ice museum, and it is worthy enough for 15k won. Ice museum was pretty cool, but make sure you have warm clothes in hand. 26 degree outside, -2 degree inside."
"Fun, make sure to take friends!","I had such a fun time here with my wife and sister-in-law. So many cool and interesting backdrops to take photos with. It took us about 1 1/2 hours to walk through everything. There was also free entrance into an ice museum within the same building, which was small but still pretty cool! Definitely worth it if you enjoy these kinds of things!"
Very interesting for both young and aged,"Very interesting using a 3D Augmented Reality App , you can film a short video as you become part of the action. It is worth a visit if you have a couple hours to kill especially on a rainy day. Also, included was the Ice musuem with some interesting ice sculptures in a giant freezer. "
Fun Attraction,We visited the Trickeye Museum in Seoul and spent a few hours there. It has a downloadable app which activates special effects in most of their displays like a fire-breathing dragon. The app acts as a camera which you use to take photos with the special effects. The Ice Museum was basically a cold storage with ice sculptures which was even too cold for a Canadian! All in all it was great fun for CAD 20.
great fun,a wonderful few hours at this museum. full of illusions. they have free wifi and an app that helps you fully enjoy it so don't forget to download it for great pictures
Great fun,This is a great day out. You will need to download the trickeye app to take full advantage of the various optical illusions they have here.
TrickEye and ice museum,"TrickEye museum was good! With the TrickEye app, it was fun clicking pictures and recording videos. Ice museum is a total waste of money/time. "
Family time during Spring Break,"At first I was a bit skeptical as to the level of fun to be had. My family and I were pleasantly surprised. We laughed a lot and giggled at many of the resultant pictures and effects. Downloading their app was a bit annoying; however, the annoyance was quickly replaced with ""oh wow"" and ""so cool"". The video game section needs to be expanded, plus only one game is included in the full pass. We went into the ICE museum which is nothing more than a poor replica of a piece of a room from the Ice Village in Sweden or Canada. We could only stay for about 10 minutes. It would have been nice if they provided coats so that more time could be had trying to enjoy the ice room. Overall, it was a good afternoon activity. It works for families and friends. "
Fun Place to use up a couple of hours,"The museum is one of the 36 places of interest with free entry with the purchase of the Seoul Tourist Card. We took the Green line on the Metro arriving at Hongik Station. About a five minute walk should have got us there, but the street signs and the building blocks confused my Google Map and it was a little bit hard to find the single entrance with no real shop front of this basement museum.To activate the AR program, the museum provides free WiFi to download the AR App.It became quite fun and exciting (us being first timer with AR) to watch the action coming from the static paintings. We took lots of videos and photos. With limited time at each painting, and lots of tourist and families moving through the art as well, it was impossible to get the timing right to fight with dragons, surf with two sharks, etc.Still, we enjoyed the visit.The ice museum was cold, really cold, with quite a few ice sculptures, but not as exciting as the AR side."
TrickEye and Ice is innovative!,"Cost is 15,000/person and covers only TrickEye and ice museum. The whole thing lasted about ~2 hours. There are a ton of different pictures with cool effects in the background using the TrickEye app. Some of them are cool, some of them are bland. It’s very creative an different. Be prepared to take lots of pictures and casual waits here and there. Most of the people there are quite oblivious and will lack the common courtesy of letting you take a picture (they just walk in front of the camera). The ice museum and small and quick. Quick because it’s very cold, -6 C. There is a cool slide in there as well as intricate decor made of ice. "
Fun!! ,"Well, it's fun and all but there isn't much to do in there. You'd literally be done exploring in 15 minutes. I'm being charitable with my review just because I loved their interactive 3D app. Ice museum was boring though... "
Fun!,Your ticket gets you access to the truck eye museum and the ice museum. After downloading their app 2-d paintings have 3-d movements. It was a lot of fun
great experience & had fun in the museum,Many photos has been taken and it was fun in the museum. And using the app to see the trickeye picture is a fresh experience in 4D museum. I 'wow' many times while using the app to see picture. Also there is new comer that has a supermoon for people to take photo. it is beautiful too.I recommend to go with friends rather than solo because one person can't take many pictures and always ask help from others.
Even cooler pictures/videos if you use their app!,"I have been to several museums of this kind, but what made this one special was a dedicated app that made the art move or added some elements to the picture. Take someone along so you can take pictures of each other. The entry costs 15,000 won and includes the tiny Ice Museum on the same floor. And while you are here, make sure to go to Love Museum upstairs too!"
Trick Eye,"Lots of fun--my husband and I are in our 50's and were probably the oldest people there. BUT it was lots of fun, well worth the cost and the pictures were lots of fun. Lots of laughs, and fighting dinosaurs was adorable"
Not worth it!,"Bit of a con. Nothing special, actually pretty weak. You have to do the experience using an app which annoyingly runs off your smart phone so drains the battery and definately not suitable for kids. The only interesting part is the VR arcade and they charge extra for that. Avoid!"
A fun afternoon,"A nice place to go to if you enjoy taking pictures. At the time I went it wasn't too crowded, so pretty easy to take a picture. I believe if I had went at a busy time of the year it would of been difficult to take any pics since people tend to stand around forever and they tend to be in big groups. I also went to the ICE area where you can take pictures of objects made of Ice. It's a nice tourist attraction to spend a few hours."
"Great place for kids, teens and those who love to take funny pics","We really didn't know what we were getting into when we decided to visit the Trickeye Museum and we came on the recommendation of a friend who visited with their two kids earlier this year.Be sure your smartphone is charged as your whole experience and the memories you take with you will be captured on your smartphone. A traditional camera is useless here.When you get arrive, there is wi-fi available for you to download their app which is needed to create the special effects in the pictures and videos you take with your phone. Lots of neat optical illusions and you can get creative with your poses. And bring along a sense of humour."
Did not live up to the hype.,"There were a few pictures which were neat, but several were confusing. It was crowded and made taking pics difficult. Would not recommend."
Know what you’re getting in to ,"So, I went here alone as I was in the neighbourhood shopping and didn’t want to drag my coworker along with me while I browsed 100 beauty stores. I quickly realized that was a big mistake as 98% of this attraction is basically posing with different scenes and taking photos through the museum’s app to create an “optical illusion”. This was quite awkward being alone as I didn’t have anybody to take my photo, not to mention the scenes are quirky and people really get into it (lay on the floor etc.). I’m honestly the kind of person to stand beside a landmark and smile (with a bad fake smile and awkward hands) so all in all not really my cup of tea. But if you enjoy that sort of thing, check this place out! The sample photos were pretty cute. I liked the mirror maze at the end, and the ice museum was a cute (albeit short) experience. This is what I wished I knew before going, so I hope it helps you make your decision!"
It's quite okay~,"It's quite okay, but I think the place is kind of over priced just for you to take unique and 3D photos. But if you're the type who love to have tons of photo updates in your social media, then you might love the visit to this place."
Great!,I went here and it was nice. There are many different attractions to see and do. Go here for some photos and fun time with your family and friends.
Definitely the worst experience ever ,"What ever you do, do not visit the Trickeye Museum. It is cheaply constructed and there are barely any optical illusions. All of us in our group were highly disappointed. "
So coooool!,Me and my wife went to the trick eye museum and ice museum. There is an AR to download for free. With the AR app things looks much more realistic and I highly recommend you to check this museum out if you are in Hongdae!
Very funny:),"It's interesting and I enjoyed my visit there. It's really only for photo taking so if you're not a fan of having photos taken, then don't go, as it's not much fun only looking. I went on my own and I was lucky visitors there were happy to take a photo of me when I asked them. There will be a lady who tells you to sit for oil painting photo free trial. However as with everything what's for free, this isn't for free. You will only see the oil painted photo for free, the print outs must be paid then of course. But overall an interesting experience. Make sure you download their app prior to the visit - it's even more fun :) Someone mentioned here the love museum entry is included in the Trickeye Museum ticket. It's not. You need to pay separately for both museums despite they're in the same building only on different floors."
Interesting concept,This was a very unique experience. The interactive displays automatically link to your phone once you download their app. Recommended for a few hours.
An OK way to spend an hour of your time.,"The trick eye museum is great to take pictures in with friends, but it isn't overwhelmingly fun. It is only a small distance from Hongdae exit 9 which is handy - but I would only recommend it to kill 45 mins to an hour of your time if you are doing something else in Hongdae. "
Great Experience,"Visitors can enjoy taking tricky pictures/videos using a mobile application, the photos seem so real. So funny place"
Must to go,"Really fun and you can spend more than two hours to take the photos. Please remember to download the app before you take any photos and also put your backpack to the locker, just 500 won. Just take your wallet and camera is good enough."
the tackiest thing i have ever been to,"Its just awful. Do i regret going? im not sure, Its so bizarre. I was embarrassed in there and left with in 5 mins. The photos... well i won't be showing them on our holiday pic slide show. Was it worth it? It was different, fairly cheap hilarious to watch others and just a bit disturbing."
Amazing!!,"Great place! A lot of fun, its incredible that this is the first on america! Bring your hole family and a full loaded battery so you can enjoy it properly."
So much fun!,"This experience is so much fun. My husband and I visited this place. We will be visiting again and this time, with the kids. They will surely enjoy this. Get ready with your acting skills. "
Fun,A really fun place. We took our kids and they loved it! Great technology makes it even better! Would definitely go back again!
LOTS OF FUN,Really fun and LOTS of pictures plus you meet others who are willing to joke around as you take pics!Tons of variety when it comes to the pictures and creativity is involved heavily. Vr is amazing!
Fantastic 4D App of Trickeye Museum,"The technology is better and better now. The Trickeye Museum provides fantastic 4D app that allow taking wow pictures and videos beyond your imagination. We did have pleasant surprises from using this fantastic app. By using this app, dinosaurs are moving, angels are flying, pictures are blinking and more surprises going on ..."
Nice place to visit. ,"It is a nice place to visit especially if it's too cold to do something outdoors. It's pricey (much more expensive than the pass to see all palaces) and you must bring your own smartphone to ""see"" the CGI on the screen. Internet connection is sometimes slow, so you must wait some time to download the illusions to the smartphone. I think this place is more targeted for children. "
Cool activity,Nice experience. We had a lovely day at this wierd museum. We took a lot of great photos we can post on social media
Very entertaining,"The museum is very funny. You gotta download the app to properly enjoy the animations. If you are in a group, would vê better to take group pictures. It has a Nice mirror room at the end!"
Lots of fun!,"Had a really great time with my wife, lots of pictures to take and the AR portion is pretty cool. Should try atleast once."
Unique experience,"This place was a very unique and cool experience. My only wish is that it would be a longer expierence, but it definitely is something to not miss."
Cold and fun,Nice museum. Ice museum is especially impressive. You should really check it out if you have some time in Seul
Great fun!,I had a great time with my friend. Definitely recommend this museum for groups. Fantastic opportunity to take an unusual photo.
Interesting activity ,This is a must do in Seoul. You can easily kill an hour here with friends. It’s a very interesting experience to have with the augmented reality 
Interesting activities,Definitely worth going. You can use the augmented reality app to take some really cool pictures. The ice section was very cold but realistic
A must do in Seoul,A once in a lifetime experience best enjoyed with friends or family. It is definitely worth the price
Must do when in Seoul,Great place with lots of interesting things and definitely something different that is unique to Korea. A must visit when in Seoul!!! 
Interesting and fun,Nice to see some takes on classical pieces in the museum. Fun place to go with a good fun group of friends. 
Got kids with some Spare time????,"Wet/dry, got( kids) a bit of spare time, drink coffee with your image on top, visit an ice attraction, and a TrickEye Museum... all in one place!!!!Photo opportunities abound. Order your coffee, your image is imprinted atop of the milk froth.. drink yourSelf!!!!Bit weird, but good gimmick.. coffee not great...rate. 6/10Then go to the Ice factory entrance.. some sculptures of Giant Panda, Korean children’s characters, chairs, slide..etc.. good photo opportunities for children etc Nothing out of the ordinary....Rate: 5/10Trick Eye Museum... entrance across from the Coffee shop!Inside are of different scenes, that with the installed store “photo app”, will make outthat one is actually taking part in the “supposed “ photo shoot”, whether it’s swimming with two sharks to riding with Pegasus and other scenes... quite realistic...Rate.... 7.5/10. Trick Eye for adults and/or kids..photo shots of differing aspects, with different positions, same scene.. can spend ????? Time!"
Fun-filled experience,"It was one of our bucket list when in Seoul. Fortunately, we were lucky to have guided by two students to reach Trick Eye Museum by foot from the train station. Then we had the best experience inside it. Somehow it amazed me on the 3D walls and floors....it was an unforgettable experience."
Fun place to explore,Have visited this museum with my family and it was fun and enjoying. My kids like it very much and they were having lots of fun.
Trickeye Mseum review,it was a fun and interesting place to visit with family. My kids enjoyed very much. i strongly recommend this place.
Amazing experience,Spend over 2 hour taking photos and checking the 3D animations. The mirror maze could be a challange as well
Amazing Place,Trickeye Museum is very interesting and beautiful place for visiting. I really enjoyed so much even more than other places.
Amazing museum in seoul,It is really nice place for tourist in seoul. I would like to strongly recommend to the visitors for visiting this amazing place at least once. Don't forget to visit Love musium and Ice musium too because these places are together with treckeye musium and very beautiful places as well.
It is really good i like it .I will visit with my family again.,"I will advise my friends go to visit this place at least one time you can see many things which will in your life, observe and enjoy a lot which is memorable and you can enjoy a lot."
Our 4th date ,We came to take a few pictures for our 4th date and we were impressed by the special effects. It was such a fun experience. My favorite was the huge piranha. Totally recommended if you like pictures with friends. And you must try the app.
Amazing and unique experience,One of my unforgettable experience in Seoul. We took amazing pics that were really appreciated by friends and family.The 3D effect is super cool and the displays are diversified so all of my friends find their favorite spots! Don't hesitate to visit that unique museum .
amazing place,trick eye museum is really a nice place that every one coming to Korea should visit for taking photos
Good place to while away the time,We had fun re-creating photographs. You can blend and interact with the paintings. The Ice museum is an extra treat.
Mind-blowing art that defies gravity and tickles your your senses!,"Make sure you bring camera, as there are plenty of photo ops in here for sure! Spare at least 2 hours To fully enjoy this one-of-a-kind experience. It’s 3D art and optical illusions at its finest! I’ve never seen anything like it. As an added bonus, the same ticket also gives you free access to Ice Museum and Carnival Street (all in the same building). It is definitely worth the price of admission!!! By subway: get off at Hongik University Station (Line #2), exit 9. It’s about a 5-10 min. walk from there."
Companion is needed,Long walk from Hongik Station. They have apps for a much more realistic picture. You must have a companion to take your picture or bring a tripod to take your shot
AR photo was so real! Don't miss to have a cup of coffee with your photo,"The street is a small street. At basement of a old commercial building.You will be asked to download a trickeye app. Then whenever you stop at the camera sign of each spot. Hold your camera the image became alive.Explosion of volcano with fire, shark and fishes swimming to you, all the amazing effect become so real. Good family actitvites. Iceland location oppisite corner. A big commercial refridgerator with ice scrupture similar to what saw in Hokkaido japan in a much small scale. Suitable for children.Get your own image coffee at KRW8500. Firstly you take a selfie with the staff phone. The staff will prepare the coffee and foam with your photo. I ordered a hazelnut latte super thick cream! Good experience! Tips: Fully charge your phone. AR photo experience is very common in Seoul, 3D effect make your photos becone alive. "
Great place for taking photos,There are lots of 3D wall paintings for selfie and group photos. The mirror maze was quite tricky and some paintings would become animated with phone application. Highly recommended
Neat and cool illusional art! ,"The illusional art paintings are pretty nice! The app which makes the art animated is also neat, but if you try taking photos, it’s a bit blurry (doesn’t focus). The only recommendation I’d make is at least have one or two staff around so they can help take photos for you? Cause it’s nice and neat, but would be neater if you can actually be in the photo, but it’s difficult if there’s nobody to take photos for you! "
It's a trap!,"Ok, so the only trick here is that they Rob you of 15000 won. We thought it was gonna be a illusion art exhibition, but it's silly bad animation all through an app on your phone, and it's all done in like 15 minutes. If you don't wanna be tricked for your money, stay away!!"
Just the most enjoyable experience,"It is very hard to write how much fun this place is, you enter a world where you are part of many 3D experinces its so real so when you are with dinosaurs blowing flames it is so real.We spent a couple of hours there and enjoyed every minute.Entry was about £12 best value ever"
"Super Fun, Something Different!","It was somewhat busy when I came here, but the rooms are big with a few different paintings per room. I opted not to download the app, just to focus on pictures, I think you'll have a great time with or without the app. Make sure to come here with friends, the whole point is to have a good time and get creative with photos. The wide range of paintings was fabulous, they ranged from everything to scary and funny to gross and weird. If you have time while on vacation and looking for something creative, give the Trickeye Museum a try!"
A bit of fun,"If you have been to one, it is the same everywhere. Can still be fun. Location tucked away in an alley, very hard to find. Will not spend more than 3 hours here, at the most"
Now you see and now you don't ,"A good place to chill out. They will recommend you to download their trickeye app, and please do so. The app make all the portraits come to live, but the only downside is the app doesn't support wide angle and the picture quality is not as good if you use your own phone camera. Sometimes we use both alternatively, which cause the app to lagged and not responsive. Overall good experience. "
"Fun, but expensive","What fun! Make sure you have a full charge on your phone. They provide free WiFi and you need to download their app. Not all the exhibits were working, and those that did were mixed, some were fantastic and some boring. If you have used green screen at school then this type of thing will be nothing new. You pay for entry to the trick eye and the ice museum. Wrap up warm for that as the temperature is -4 degrees. There are just ice screens to take photos with, and an ice slide to come down. It's not very big.Worth a visit if the weather is poor or you have bored kids in tow."
Fun way to do silly things,"Get caught by two sharks, breathed on by dragons, filmed alongside Hollywood stars and look into your phone by dowloading the trick eye app and watch the pictures being brought to 3 D life. Combine with a shopping exercise around the famous streets of Hongdae. Cant find it - ask the Seoul volunteers close to the train station to give you some guidance. Fun place. There is also an Ice place and a bit of a kinky Love 3D version - all in the same place. "
A fun place to visit!,"I went here with a friend. It was fun to take pictures in the crazy scenes and there were a variety to choose from: fantasy, scary, kitschy, fun."
Interesting place,"Saw this museum by walking in Hongdae with my friend, and we decided to go inside. Prices for tickets are reasonable, because we had a lot of fun in there. I was very surprised and happy that they created an application for the museum, and with application everything looks more realistic and in general museum is really worth to go to feel something unusual after a day routine. The corridor with mirrors in the end just made my day. Highly recommend!"
wonderful 3D Pictures,"Great place in a wonderful location, you can take your friends and family for a visit out with great time and amassing pictures"
Lots of fun!,Found this museum by change while walking through the area and decided to enter it spontaneously. It was really cool and a lot of fun! Its recommendable even when the weather is good... I will go again when being back in Seoul
Awesome Experience in Hongdae,"Me and 4 other friends from University decided to visit the Trickeye Museum in Hongdae. You have to download an application that is called ""TrickEye"" in order to see the illusions and special effects. Free Wifi is provided. We had a lot of fun, it was a different experience seeing dinosaurs, sharks and artists coming out of the wall and interacting with its surrounding. It took us about 1-2 hours because we really enjoyed the special effects and made a lot of video and photo material."
Very fun experience,Super fun museum to visit with friends and to take funny pictures. It's very interactive and there is also an app that adds VR effects. So download the app before you go.
"Nice AR experience, fun museum.","With the application they provide, you can get a lot of nice AR effects, illusions and also nice photos. With the AR technology, it's definitely worth the price to go in and have a look. But it will be more fun to go with a bunch of friends."
Sucked pretty bad,"Overpriced and pretty boring. There wasn’t much to do or see compared to the price. The ice museum was alright but the trickeye in itself was boring, old, and cheesy "
funny interactive museum,"Illusions, statues, VR, canvases - all you can find here. Better go with somebody if you want to make photos. I have never seen anything like this before. You need to download an app in order to have the complete experience. My phone was out of battery when I came here, but I could charge my phone directly in the museum, so at the end I could enjoy it :)."
"Great fun for the family, neat app!","We had the Discover Seoul Pass (DSP) & made a trip here after one of our day tours (most tours stop at Hongik Univ stn). Easy to find & redeem as it's one of the attractions under the DSP, together with the Ice Museum.The counter staff was not friendly as we had questions how to download the app. Service was curt & no smiles from the staff there. They appeared impatient, maybe because it was near closing time.U need the app to enjoy the museum. It's kind of small & u can get through within 1 hr.It's definitely something different from the usual 3D places, and we were happy to have experienced the fun!"
Trickeye and ice museum,This museum was super enjoyable. Me and my son really really enjoyed and liked it. This is a recommendable place. Really loved it♡ want to go again&again
trickeye museum,4 days agoloved it! Will be going back. Can spend all day enjoying the museum.My son loved it so much he kept asking to go there again 
Fun night at Trick Eye Museum,"Went with my friend after dinner. The staff were friendly and explained everything to us before we start the tour. We downloaded the AR app and had so much fun seeing the eye-popping effects! Love the illustrations as well, colorful and meticulously drawn. It's definitely worth a visit!"
Great place,"Plenty of fun, nice and helpful personnel, creative design and good value for the price. Thank you very much"
Unexpected highlight of our trip! ,"We didn’t really plan to come here, but came here on our final night before leaving Seoul! It was only such great fun and made us feel like kids. We had a great time taking photos and checking out all of the effects for each one. We arrived at 7pm and left just as it was about to close at 9pm. We also had fun in the ice museum, especially going down the slide. The ice museum is really small, but you can’t stay in there for long anyway as it’s so cold! "
The most interesting AR experience,"I went to AR museum with my friend,we took many interesting photo using illusion period, the effect of AR make the picture much more lifely, it was a very unique and fun experience."
Bad value per price. 나는 차라리 영화를 보겠다...,"About 14 USD for the Trick Eye and Ice Museums. Fair price for me is about 7 or 8 USD which is the price for a movie in a theater in Korea. This is very good for kids... and that's all. Not that special. I don't know why it has good review rate. In the ice museum, it's so cold. If you are sensitive to the coldness, it is not good idea to go inside. And the art work made of ice... I don't know it's worthy... seeing... It's very for the kids... not for adults.....트릭아이와 아이스 두 곳 방문하고 1만5천원인데, 영화 한편을 2시간 감상하는 것(8천원 정도)과 비교한다면 난 '영화'를 선택하겠다. 그리고 이 박물관의 가격은 7~8천원 정도가 적당하다고 본다.원래는 트릭아이 미술관이었던 모양이네... 이제 돈독이 오른 거냐... 홍대 주변 건물값 상승과도 관련되어 있겠지만....착시 효과를 일으킬 만한 작품들이 많이 있긴 하지만, 이게 정말 신기하거나 흥분을 불러일으킬만하지는 않다. 이런 작품 한두개는 이미 경험한 사람들이 대부분일 것이다.이건 결국 가격이라는 견론에 도달한다. 너무 비싸다. 아무리 봐도 7~8천이 적당해보인다.그리고 아이스 뮤지엄은 정말 춥다. 냉동고에 들어가는 느낌 그대로다. 여기 유지하는 유지 관리비(전기)가 정말 많이 나올 것 같더라. 뭐 굳이 가격이 비싸다면 이것때문이 아닐까? 그러나 그 정도로 아이스 박물관이 볼만한 가치가 있다고는 말 못하겠다. 얼음으로 만든 조각품 감상 정도다...."
3D museum worth checking out!,Very fun 3D museum that uses their mobile app for augmented reality in your pictures. App was so-so but fun none the less. Love museum (R18) is above this.The place is worth checking out if you havent been to a 3D museum. You need someone to take your picture so going solo is not recommended. The more the merrier.Its quite tiring to get the right shots so do not rush through them.Also some murals may contain some mature content so please do not bring small kids.
Fun Place,Venue is well done with both pictures and an app for your phone that adds moving graphics. It's a pretty good size and a good time. Best with friends that don't mind acting a bit foolish in pictures. 
Worthy visit,Free admission with Discover Seoul Pass (24/48/72 hours) value cardDownload the Trickeye Museum APP and enjoy your photo shots!
"Fun, but not ideal for solos","I found out about this place while trying to think of something to do to kill time before my flight home. I'm glad I found it, as it was quite amusing. However, I wasn't able to embrace the experience fully as I had no company with me to take those tricky pics. hahaha. If you download the TrickEyee app, you can use it to see some animations for several of the artwork. It's definitely worth going a next time with friends or family. Also, brace yourself for the Ice room."
Fun,"Great place for Pictures and fin with your friends, small place it will take you 20 min but it is worth it, make sure to go with your phone and friends to take los off vídeos más Pictures."
Loved the place,Download the Trickeye Mobile App to take 3D videos and pictures. We enjoyed taking pictures and videos. Be sure to bring extra clothes if you plan to enter the Ice Museum. It was so cold there.
Was One of the Best Experiences In Korea!,"I heard a lot about this place from other people and was so excited to visit this place. Recently visited this place and jaw dropped. The three hours I spend there wee full of fun, Laughs and lot of picture taking.Their Trickeye app on your phone is the Jem and adds a lot to the fun.To all the people and foreigners out there do visit this place at least fun. one of a life time experience"
Amazing date spot for cute pictures!,It was really cool to be able to take fun pictures in the trick eye museum. The pictures come out some cute and it’s a really great date idea or going there with family!
Give a try for an exp. ^^,"- Price: 15k KRW/ ticket for: Ice and TrickEye museums.- Location: Ok, near exist number 9 - Honggik university station.- English: Very good Iam not that one that really into some art like this than 15K won is a little expensive to me.Any, it is really good to take ur kids to. ^^"
"Fun, only if you cant plan any other activities.","It's a fun experience, But do this only if you cant plan any other activities.if you need to be indoor due to rain then it's perfect. Pros : 1. Fun if you are a couple.2. Photo areas are marked.Cons: 1. Not many items for group inclusion."
Wonderful place to go with friends,It's so funny to go with friends.Use your imagenation and you can poste as intersting as you do. Enjoy it!
Neat photo effects,Came across this museum hoping it was more 3D and optical illusions but it’s more of a staged photo background. Granted the resulting photos are really neat it’s not for the selfie. The effect is lost. It’s fun to pose with friends da and family and laugh at the resulting photos. 15000w gets you in the TrickEye and the Ice museum which are cute ice sculptures in a freezer. It was fun to visit but bring a friend so they can take pictures of you. 
A place to shoot spectacular pics and vids,"If you wanna record yourself fighting sea monsters from Jason's quest for the golden fleece, poisonous snakes hanging from the ceiling or dinos from Jurassic Park, this is the right place to go. The app is easy to download and use, and the results are astounding!"
Very Vivid 3D effect,a must place to visit in Seoul! highly recommend download the TrickEye app and it will totally blow your mind how vivid the 3D effect is!!! I enjoyed it a lot and the pictures will surely become very popular in your Instagram!
A must if you're in Seoul,The place is amazing. It's suitable for all ages and it's a super fun experience to enjoy with friends or family. You must bring a phone otherwise you'll be missing a lot since there's an app that you can download to make the experience even more fun. Very cool place! Totally recommended!
Good 3D effect,"The place is amazing. I would suggest you to go there for sure. You can go with you family, friends and with anybody you want. It is a complete fun place. You can do lot of activities and use different tricks with 3D effect to take pictures. The museum his own camera app, which is great. You can use the app by which pictures come out with more 3D effect. It was a complete fun!"
SUIT FOR ALL AGES,"This place can be visited by young people, children, or elderly people. The ticket price is not pricy compared to the view we can enjoy :D make sure to bring your phone or camera or you will regret! There is also ice room you can visit anyway!"
VERY FABULOUS 3D EFFECT,"This is my very first time coming to the 3D Museum and I was amazed with the QR code from the admission ticket which can be linked to Trickeye Apps. In that apps, I applied a lot of photo backgrounds in the museum and there are several effects coming from the screen when we put the camera in front of the selected photo background. 5 out of 5!"
My dream as a ballerina has been fulfilled :),I went with my friend last weekend and we had so much fun! It was so interesting to pose in various ways and we had lots of laughs. My favourite display was the one in which you could be a ballerina on stage!
Fun for family,This is an interesting place with 3 attractions in one place. However please note the Love museum is for adults only not for children.
A MUST visit place!,"It was superb, have been there 2 years ago and still lots fun during my recent visit. The renovated facilities with AR techniques impressed me:) definitely will visit again!"
Fun Date !,"A nice a fun place to go for a date, you will laugh a lot for sure ! The VR experience is also really nice and even though you can think that it’s a enjoyable place for kids, but believe me some adults had more fun than some kids while posing with the interactives brackgrounds ! Go with a fully charged phone and enjoy some fun time with your family, lover or Friends !"
Hongde Must See place,"Interesting to visit place for families and couple/groups. I was there by myself and had no problem to enjoy the place. THE NEW VR section was a most amazing for me. Literarily tried out every attraction. If you are in Korea, In Seoul and around hongde the this place is must. "
Trickeye Museum Seoul Korea,This is kind of one of the fun place...You can take a lot of great pictures with the back drops if you can pose and capture the right angles.... 
Fun museum in Seoul,"Go there and get some funny photos while in Seoul. Also, like the Ice Museum next door, one ticket, you can visit 2 museum. where kids and adults all enjoy, all made out of ice. "
Absolutely go to this place ,Honestly one of the highlights of the trip. It is just pure unadulterated bizarre fun. AND your ticket includes an ice museum which I won’t say anything about because it will spoil the shock when you enter...
Definitely Worth a Visit,I came in the fall of 2015 with my mom. We both had fun taking photos and definitely recommend this place. Of course it's best to come with at least 2 people for the purpose of taking photos. I think it's fun for both kids and adults.
Good Time,This place is definitely worth a visit. The trick art shows a lot of talent. There are several cleverly done pieces. Make sure you have your camera or your phone. Should only take you a few hours to leisurely go through the museum. It’s perfect for a rainy day.
What an experience!,"Something absolutely out of the ordinary, you download their app and you enter this magical world of illusions and eye tricks. Our 9 yrs old daughter loved it and so did we! "
Fun place,"Place to bring teens and pre-teens who are bored of the history museums, temples, and palaces of Seoul. Fun place for adults also. It was 90 degrees farenheit outside but below freezing in the Ice section of their museum so definitely wear the poncho."
Fun fun fun,Great place to take the kids. Make sure u download the app and charge your phone. It’s kinda hard to find because it’s in the middle of nowhere. Once inside it’s just amazing. The art and illusions are fun to experience and they even had a ice museum which was perfect for the summer heat. 
Fun Acticity,Fun thing to do. We found it through TripAdvisor and paid a visit. Good place for optical illusion photos. Perfect if it rains.
Cool!,This place is amazing. The tricks your eyes play through the camera are amazing. lots of fun. There are 3 museums in 1 although one is adult only. The ice portion is a great way to cool down on a hot day.
overrated,"went with some friends. honestly its cool for the first few minutes but at the end of the day all it is is lining up, taking pictures then moving onto the next exhibition. honestly its overrated an . kinda pricey for what it isl,..."
Beautiful place ,"Very nice place and amazing.. good for all ages .. everyone visit this museum will enjoy and fun .. .Ticket price for adult 15000 KRW and for child over 3 years 12000 KRW, Child below 3 years free "
Just for kids,"Limited areas to go around. Location of museum is a little bit difficult to find. The ""walking dead"" area needs to improve. "
Funny,There are not only taking 3D photo. Using the apps can take the 3D video which the picture is look like alive. It was very funny to take the photo and video. It is a great idea for the 3D picture. I was have fun with my friends
A nice visit in trickeye museum,The museum is located in hongik university station which is a hot spot for tourists. The museum provides lots of interesting painting for us to take photos. We spend a nice day in the museum!
Painting gallery & Mirror Maze,"I visited Trick eye museum, in the heart of Hongdae (artistic and youthful district) for a day tour. It is a 3D Painting gallery of optical illusion and augmented reality. The paintings are regular and the 3D corners are average. I really enjoyed the Mirror Maze on the way out. You will be lost and dizzy trying to exit the maze because your reflection in the mirror is haunting you, making you believe that you have found the way out. You might be terrified in a fun way. SEE photos."
Trick Eye Seoul,"Fun place to when it is cold for an hour. Except the Ice Museum its cold, be careful not slip like i did. Very busy come early."
值得親子或朋友一起相伴玩樂的好去處,"Trickeye Museum and Love Museum在同一棟,所以很適合在Trickeye逛完後再到Love Museum遊玩,Trickeye 裡面有很多場景看到時覺得應該沒有很真,但其實拍完照片後覺得很像身境在擺設的場景裡,在照片裡的效果呈現出來特別好."
Hilarious,"We went there one and a half hour before closing time and there were no people - we had so much fun and took millions of pictures. Although it might sound a bit stupid, I am sure everyone will enjoy it :) "
It was fun !,"Together with the ticket to TrickEye Museum you will get an Ice Musen ticket included, which is located in the same area. Additionally, this ticket will give you a discount in case you want to visit love museum, which is located one floor higher. In trick eye Museums you can download an app that animates images/videos, quite cool :) it is also quite big, we have taken tones of funny pictures!"
Nice pictures,"We got our ticket for trick eye and ice museum at klook. We enjoyed the different sceneries and taking lot of pictures with our camera and their APP. My android phone isnt supported for video, only pictures. At one time, my phone got too hot, so I had to let it rest while we just used our camera. But the effects were nice as well.For the ice museum, we brought our winter gear - jacket, hoods, gloves. So we were able to stay there a bit longer than others around 30mins only.It was sad that the korean costume shop in the facility has already closed. But still, we had fun. "
Interesting Place,"You need to download the apps on to your phone to get the full 3-D effects to take pictures at the various stations.The area around this museum is very lively full of young people and interesting cafes, restaurants and shops."
bring a powerbank!,"grab their app, and run your batteries out with how many pictures and videos you will take!!! oh and bring a coat for the ice museum"
"Cheesy, but surprisingly fun!","Subjected to a heavy rain day, we decided to try the museum - for two adults we had a remarkably good time! We were fortunate that it was not very busy, but having other people there would likely provide additional amusement."
Not worth the money!,Rubbish in every aspect and well over-priced! The museum is situated in an area of Seoul that is smelky and dirty. Don't bother!
cool app!,"It's our first time to be in a 3D museum. I thought it was just for taking pictures. But in Trickeye, they have an app that makes the exhibits ""come alive"". Some of the signage where you should take your pictures to have that 3D effect needs to be replaced because some of it are already blurred."
Best unqiue experience,I would like to first of all to thank my girlfriend for taking me to this amazing place. It was very fun moment for me especially when I discovered that i could use a special app to have the unique visual effect background for each images. I really recommend this place to people from all over the world! 
Unlimited Fun,The place is amazing. There are lot of cool stuffs to see in there. I visited the Ice museum which was really cool. All the things inside was made of ice. It's really a cool place. Couples are highly recommended to go. I had lot of fun with my friends. Amazing experience.
Most amusing and fun place in Seoul: must-visit!,"I went to Trick Eye Museum with my boyfriend last weekend and we had SO much fun! We started by experiencing the new 3D option available through an app to enjoy even more the trick-eye paintings and it was super realistic and beyond our expectations! Then we visited the Ice Museum which was super interesting (we loved the iced slide!) even if ""of course"" really cold. Then we ended the visit by the Love Museum and that was just a whole bunch of laughter !!! The trick-eye paintings are just amazing and we really loved this part even more. I would say the ice museum and trick eye museum can be visited with family members or boyfriend/girlfriend and of course, the love museum is a great ""couple activity"" :)"
"Super funny, must must must visit place","Don't skip this place while in Seoul! We had really nice time taking hilarious pictures. Everybody who visit this place can't stop laughing, so funny it is. Download Trickeye Museum App, it adds animations to the picture."
Hilarious and super fun,We visited the museum because of the hype of other friends going AND IT WAS COMPLETELY WORTH IT! The photos you will get are super funny and laughing will be ensured. Absolutely recommendable.
Great experience!!,"Very interactive and interesting museum. You will be surprised by what the museum app does. Great to visit with frinds, family or as a couple; it a good brake from traditional sightseing and gives a glipms of korean society likes; also is located in a fun and young neighbourhood, so i would definitly recomed vsisting."
"Interesting views, but needs a bigger screen","Trickeye museum has interesting pictures and animation combined, but needs a phone or tablet with a camera and bigger screen, and you need to download and use their app to see the animations. From the same floor you can also go to Ice museum or try out some VR stuff like shoot some zombies etc. Above this museum is also the Love museum. The ideas in the rooms were great, but the rooms itself were a bit small for most of them, so it was impossible to grasp them fully."
Fun Photos,The tickets here was included in the Discover Seoul Pass. We had entrance to the ice display as well as the museum.The ice museum was in a giant freezer and had carvings of different things like a throne or a bear. They also had a huge slide which was quite fun to slide down.The Trick Eye museum itself was really interesting. It is way more enjoyable with other people as it probably wouldn't make sense if you're alone. One person stands at the photo spot and other people just do what they want and the outcome is generally a hilarious photo. Some were a lot easier to understand than others but there were plenty of photo ops.It wasn't too busy when we were there but I can see how it can get really busy as people try to get the perfect photo.They also had a virtual reality area where you can play some VR games but it is extra to the museum tickets.Quite an enjoyable experience but I think it depends on who you go with.
"A little pricey and trashy, but fun",A silly place to take your kids to break up the cultural stuff in Seoul. Lots of funny scenes to be photographed in. Great position for shopping and food once you have done it. A little pricy in my opinion.
This place is hilariously fun!,"Some friends and I spent about 2 hours taking photos and laughing like crazy as we toured this super fun ""museum."" I've never seen anything like it! If you enjoy puzzles, mazes, or optical illusions, you will adore this museum! Make sure to stow your stuff in the lockers before entering the museum - you are going to want your hands free! This would be a fun place to take a date, too."
Great Experience To watch ....,It was great to Experience a New thing in my life and i enjoyed a lot There And I don’t wanna come back But my friends pulled me to go back I go very deeply And enjoying....The AR Experience Hope to visit again With my Family and Friends....yippeeee
amazing experience,came here with a couple of friends and had an amazing time at the museum! You can take many great pictures and videos in the different rooms and the ice museum is also included in the price. I'd definitely recommend visiting!!
Great place for a fun afternoon,"Came here with friends on a gloomy afternoon and had a lot of fun going through the exhibition!! All the rooms are differently themed and you can take some great AR pictures/ videos. The Ice Museum is also included in the ticket price.. really beautiful, just remember to put on a jacket before going in :) Perfect for a rainy day or when you just wanna have a chill time with friends or a partner!"
Amazing experience,"I went with a couple of friends and it was really amazing! Definitely would recommend to anyone looking for a great time and great laughs! Plus, the ticket gives you access to the Ice Museum, which adds to the fun! :-)"
Review,Awesome museum experience with very friendly staff! Also the ice museum is in the ticket price included!! Definitely a must visit!
"Fresh concept, not typical 3d art, but AR","I liked the museum especially the application. Augmented reality is high technology which is used in here to entertain customers like myself;) was a feeling of sort of futuristic entertainment !For sure you do not want to go alone since selfies will not work well in here.VR space and Love Museum are good bonuses, we had fun as a package ."
I Don't Get It,"I'm so glad that many people seem to have had a positive experience at this place. Then again, I'm noticing that many of them are mentioning great Instagram photo ops and I'm not much of a proponent.The attraction is a self-guided walk-through of about 10-15 rooms of loosely-related murals painted on the walls and the ground that cause optical illusions with you the main subject when photographed from the right angles.When my friend and I visited it was very crowded with people falling over each other as they tried to take shots of their friends/family in the various corners of the rooms and kept backing into one another. It was quite humorous to watch actually.I think this is a great attraction for families with young kids or Instagrammers that want a fun shot. If one of these two categories doesn't really apply to you, you're not missing out on much and you'll have 15,000 Won more in your pocket."
One of a kind museum in Seoul,"This museum is definitely one of a kind! I had so much fun with my friend here, and furthermore with the aid of the app, it just made the experiences a whole lot better! I've always wanted to go to a trickeye museum, and i glad that i finally decided to just go for it! Definitely a must place to visit before leaving Seoul."
Perfect place for Instagram pictures,i loved this place. Its so fun. Went with 1 friend but i wish we were more. Dont forget to take aomething warm because the ice museum is cold.
Not ordinary museum,I didnt know that museum can be so interesting and funny! Moreover this museum has its own app which makes you believe in 3d reality through the special app camera. 100% of enjoymen))
Best Experience in Seoul,"Amazing option to escape from all the saturated ""historical & cultural trips"". The children loved it.Funny pictures, memorable time and a repeatable experience. Definitely I will come back with my family and retake the same pictures in a few years to compare and relive our family history."
It is Fun and Mindblowing,"The Trickeye Museum is in the heart of Seoul City, Hongdae. Get ready to be thrilled with all the paintings and images that pop up from the AR. What is unique about the Trickeye Museum? The AR effects. It offers free wifi to enable you to download the app and use the AR effects as you explore all the awesome sections.It is best to visit with friends. Aside from that, take a quick tour of the Ice Museum and the Love Museum as well. It is extremely cold in the Ice museum, but worth the visit. Best to visit on a weekend that you seek to have fun."
"A fun day with for couples, friends or families","The day in the trick eye museum was wonderful. We went on a weekday around 10, so the museum was not busy at all which was perfect to take pictures. We had so much fun taking funny pictures. A day not to forget."
Fun place,"Had a good laugh with my friend! When you download the free app, the paintings come alive, which makes the experiences even more fun. Definitely worth a visit if you enjoy taking silly photos and have a spare hour."
Entertaining,Fun and quick visit to this museum located in a lively neighborhood. Great to do with friends and good for all ages. Make sure you have a full phone battery and download the app in advance to save time and take full advantage of the AR offerings.
Fun for pictures and videos,I went with a friend and had a blast! the illusions are a mix of AR and 3D which makes it really interesting and fun to make short videos of yourself. I also visited the ice museum which was a mix of cute ice sculptures and my fav an ice slide. If you like making a fool of yourself and taking pictures this is def the place to check out.
An awesome place!,I had a lot of fun! The illusions are amazing and there are a lot of spots to take awesome pictures. I really liked an app that makes pictures “move” and you can make videos with effects. This place is definitely worth visiting!
Fun with friends,I really loved to go there with my friends. I had lot of fun and is a place where i will definitely want to go with my boyfriend also. I love the AR thing and i took funny pictures.
Smaller than I thought,"It was fun and an escape from the cold outside during my visit. But, it was smaller than I thought. I was surprised when I have already reached the exit."
Good for a rainy day!,"Even though the museum is quite pricey, it’s still fun for a cold or rainy day. You can take tons of (admittedly cheesy) photos and their app is quite cool. "
Fun and enjoyful,"I visited the museum with my friend recently and it was really fun. It's really innovative and they even provide a special smartphone app for camera so you can take even more interesting photos, with a lot of animations for the main part of the museum, Trickeye museum. The ice and Love museum are also interesting and creative."
Great experience in a mesmerising museum!,"I have visited the museum with my friends I'm so happy I finally decided to do it! All 3 parts of the museum are so fun and interesting. I loved how every picture had instructions with how is the best way to take photos and I don't regret I went through the cold from Ice Museum. My favorite one is the Love one, we had so much fun and really made our day. I am glad we went and had so much fun since soon enough the exams period begins! "
creative and fun stuff!,"Have seen pictures taken here a million times on instagram, always wanted to visit, and it was totally worth it! Really liked the app, too, got some crazy pictures! Memorable and lots of fun, you gotta use your creativity to get the best possible pics, really liked all the options."
Great for a date!,"Even if you're not at the ""Love Museum"" level yet, this is a great place to come with a significant other. Ideally, come on a double date, so you can take pictures of each other together in the many interesting displays. Make sure to charge your phone first! ^_^"
A really fun experience!,"I went to the Trickeye museum with my friend and it was so much fun! Had a good laugh in Love museum, and Trickeye itself has many awesome illusions! Highly recommend visiting it, especially with friends!"
Instamoment,This place is GREAT for Instagram / Facebook pictures !!! They also created an app so you can hace great vidéos too !!! I recommande this place 100% ! It's a place To visit with your friends and To have fun pictures!
A thrilling experience,"If you are looking for cool activities in Seoul, make sure to visit the Trick Eye Museum (also Love Museum and Ice Museum - all in the same location). You’re going to take lots of photos and amazing videos with your friends.Remember to bring extra battery because you will want to keep it registered in your social media."
Awesome place in Seoul!,"I've recently visited this museum as part of my bucket list for places to see before I leave Korea.It was a lot of fun and overall a great experience. There was also a helper who would kindly take pictures of me and my friend whenever we needed one. And there are A LOT of spots to take awesome pictures! Definetly a place to watch out for if you're looking for a fun day out. I have visited the main museum and the Ice Museum, which features a room made entirely of ice!"
Coolest place in the city! ,I didn't expect this museum to be this good!! Really loved all the effects and the originality of each one of the attractions!! The augmented reality app is just incredible! 
So fun!!! Must go!!!,"I loved it! Before you go, make sure to download the app and take an extra battery because you will be using your phone a lot! The more friends you take, the more fun it gets! We spent about 2 hours there between the Trickeye, Love and Ice museum so make sure to have enough time and I recommend going during the weekdays when there's less people so you can take good videos!"
Fun and Enterteinment at its finest!,"It is a completely different experience from any other place in Seoul, the place is just amazing, Nice Effects on the Museum app and constantly improving!, It's my second time going there and I was surprised by a lot of new effects in the Augmented reality app! I was able to spent a great time with my family!"
Fun Place,This place is a fun place for family and friends. You can spend a couple of hours taking 3d pictures. You can also download their application to enjoy the effects better. Worth the visit. This is for the young and young at heart.
Fascinating and amazing Place at Seoul.,"Itis very amazing to visit Trickeye Museum:you can try to come here and you can also do some of these things:1. you can take a photo (with trickeye application) and get the amazing result in your photo. beautiful photo with powerful motion of anime.2. you also ca get experience and know about some history from this museum.3. you can bring your child and play with him around this museum.Thank you for amazing experience, Trickeye Museum^^"
Extremely funny,"Recommendations: Recharge your phone power before visiting. I did the mistake of taking my phone without battery and I regret. The place is funny, curious and interesting! I'm very sure you may take at least 20-30 pictures all around the facilities~~ the designs are cool, the time is nice, and the experience is simply funny. I definitely will go back with a better camera "
Great 3D Experience!,I was so surprised how amazing is Trick Eye Museum with the application! I had a great time taking videos with effects. Definitely worth to go there! A museum is bigger than I expected so I take plenty of pictures! My friends love them hahaha
Gets old very fast,"Totally overhyped. Boring as can be after the novelty of the first few exhibits wears off. Need the app to see most of the ""tricks"" which are basically just CGI overlays. App will drain ur battery too. Was looking forward to actual trompe l'oiel art, which can be very creative, but this museum had only pokemon-go type facile tricks. Absolutely disappointing."
Great experience for everyone ;),"Really fun activity basically for everyone! I've been there 3 times and it only gets better. Now, when we can use the trickeye app, it makes the whole experience really unforgettable. I highly recommend it!"
Fun Time with Family,"I went to this museum with my family and all of us thought that was a very fun place to go. However, it was a bit crowded when we got there so I guess it'd be better if you could go as early as possible to avoid the crowd."
A must-go place on your trip to Seoul!,"I visited the Trickeye Museum with a friend and we had so much fun! Especially now that they have the Trickeye App, our experience was even more exciting, as we were able to take lots of amazing photos and videos in Augmented Reality!"
Favorite place in Seoul,Trickeye museum is a an amazing place to hang out. The trickeye app made our experience even more amazing. Special tip: the museum is fun no matter what age you are! :)
OMG,"So apparently the Trickeye Museum is a whole AR paradise. You got the trickeye app that brings everything to life AND the themes change everyone. Then there is the ice museum, love museum and trick adventure?? Well I loved every single minute of it."
Fun Time,This place is worth visiting with the family. We had fun taking the 3d pictures. You could also download the app to enjoy it better. Fun place for the young and the young at heart! 
Too many people no time to take photographs,It can get very busy and you do not have the time to take photographs very people are very pusy and take their time which causes problems very disappointed 
It was fascinating amusement place that I've ever see.,"First, I live at Korea a round 2 years ago, I just know Jeju and Nami island.but, after I get information that there is some another amusement place a round, that was Trickeye Museum,directly I go to there and check it. its very fascinating place:1. you can take a photo with image motion in trickeye museum. its can be captured by application named trickeye.2. you get experince to know about some history at that museum3. you can play with your children in ice museum and etc.its very good recommendation."
A must go place,"I am glad I took some time out to visit this museum. Amongst the three museums located in the same place, Trickeye Museum is my favorite. What really surprised me was that the when you look at the art with a naked eye or with any camera, they look just like any normal beautiful painting but when you use the Trickeye App Camera, they come to life. I will definitely recommend my colleagues to visit Trickeye Museum"
Nice Place to Visit,"The Place consists of three separate museums, 1) Trickeye museum 2) Ice museum and 3) Love museum. All of them are good but The Ice Museum is a must visit place, especially if you have Children."
A fascinating experience with Art,"I've been always wanted to visit this museum because I saw many nice and interesting photos of my friends before. And finally last weekend I had a chance to go with my friends.I would recommend this museum to someone who1. Likes to experience new things: There are 3 sections that I went through including Ice museum, Trickeye museum and Horror. You would appreciate the nice and arty walls, lovely atmosphere. Seems like immerse yourself into another world2. Interested in art and creative : all of the designs in this museum is in 3D so you can appreciate such nice pictures and models which you can actually be in. Tips: remember to wear something without hat or neck cover, dress comfy so you can fit in.3. Love taking photos: yes you're gonna have a whole album after getting out lol4. Find somewhere to spend the weekend with friends or partner: This is a pretty cool place to hang out. You would have good memories and photos here.The ice museum didn't very impress me because I've been to bigger ones in my home country. But I love the horror section ^^ Scared me a little bitI love the mermaid one because it just matches my jacket color haha. Will recommend it to my friends who visit Korea in the future"
"Fun for the kids, just okay for the parents","Kids love this kind of stuff. Situated in a bustling University neighborhood, this place is full of young people, college students and tourists. They recommend you download the Trickeye App which makes the photos you take become 3d videos. I'd rather be sightseeing but it was nice quirky diversion for the kids. It doesn't take long to go through it, less than an hour."
Trick eye museum,Hongdae is a famous shopping street. There is Trick Eye Museum here. Especially love room is only for adults. It is very interesting.
A garden of wonder,"It was kind of difficult to find, but once we did it was amazing! Interactive pieces of art. Truly brings out the kid in you. Also the ice house is super fun be sure you bring a coat! Would definitely go again"
Bloody awesome,"We spent hours here perfecting our acting skills and photography. I recommend trying to go there not on a public holiday or a weekend. Lots of people. Many pictures you need one or two takes to get it right. It’s actually best to go with al least 3 people as many of the trickeye you need 2 people in the picture and one person to take the picture. Make sure you bring your mobile as you have to download an app and use that to take picture to bring your picture alive.We got a little lost walking from station to the place. Directions aren’t that good but there ar signs as you get closer to the place.If you go to the ice museum which is next door, bring a jacket and gloves. It’s freezing in there. I lasted 10 mins and I was out of there.Love museum is another exhibit upstairs. Extra admission fee."
Was fun,"Looking for someplace to go when it’s raining looking to just have fun . You should check them out . The location is a but out of range you stopped to ask questions a few times but when you get there it’ll be fun . It’s actually a make of 3 sections , the love museum which is explicitly for adults based on the content , the trick eye then the ice museum . But you choose which you wanna do first that’s totally up to you . However the ice museum during the winter you will just wanna pop in take a few pics and get out as it can be quite cold but very creative . Overall experience great tons of fun and surprises that’ll have you laughing ."
Amazing time,I already went twice. First time wasn't enough to see and take pictures of everything cuz we got tired (kind of a big place) but it's so fun that we went back. It's good to go with friends and even families with kids. Loved it. 
"So much fun, good for a few hours. ","We had a few hours to kill before heading to the Olympics and I found the cool museum in the Hongik College area. The pictures online intrigued us so we thought we would take a shot. For 15,000 won, you could visit the Ice and TrickEye museums...both worth it in their own ways. The Ice museum was freezing, no pun intended. I think the sign said -15C and with a jacket and gloves I was only able to hand in there for 15 minutes. The had chairs, igloos, trains, an ice slide, living room, even a toilet. Most were interactive in some way (sitting, standing, sliding). But like I said, my hands were going numb and we had to get out. The trickeye was a combination of ground/wall at that looked like you were standing on walls, bridges, sharks for instance as well as interactive statues. The cool part was the trickeye app that made you pictures come alive with exploding volcanoes, swimming sharks, pouring water. It was a bit crowded on a Sunday but well worth it. "
Fun for a pair or group!,This place is awesome and is great for days when the weather is not. It is best to go with at least one other person so you may take pictures of each other interacting with the art. 
Unique place,"A museum of optical illusion. It as fun, but at times too crowded (trying to take pictures while people walk in front). I would recommend if you are looking for something unique, to spend an hour. Going once is enough. "
Super Fun with AR Technology with Trick Eye/ 3D Pictures in Hongdae,"It's the 1st Trick Eye/ 3D Museum that has AR Technology to make you feel more fun when you are watching & posing with a lot of nice 3D pictures. It's better for you to download the App ""Trickeye"" in your mobile phone in advance. (If you did not, they also provide free WiFi for you.) Do not forget to charge your battery full and bring additional power bank along with you."
Do it for Instagram!,"Out of all the attractions in South Korea, this was the one place I was super keen to visit. I thoroughly enjoyed all the illusions and it made for super fun imagery!! Looking through others photos, there were lots of displays there that isn't there anymore, I wish they could extend the museum and make it longer as it was too short walking through. Their AR options are so much fun too. Lockers are available too which was great as I wasnt keen on carrying heavy jackets into the museum.The APP made it COOLER! Definitely download it as its free, as others have said definitely make sure you have a full battery. It brings the illusions alive.The ice sculpture museum was a nice addition. I enjoyed the ice slide!!!!Great place and I would so visit again!"
So much fun,"The Museum did not look much at the outside, but we had so much fun inside! Climbing up down the pictures or statues, swinging and walking and taking all sorts of funny pictures. Bring out the children and actor/actress in us! We look at the pictures again. They are certainly the one of the highlight of our trip to Seoul. You really have to try it!"
Great place for kids. Fun experience.,"Fun for 8-10 year olds. Big room for virtual reality. You could spend lots of time there, depending on how many pictures you want to take. Exciting for a group of children, not just one. Requires you to download an app, to take pictures with special effects. Wouldn't be the same without the app. Staff is friendly, helpful, and speaks english."
Trickeye with the Family. ,We visited the trickeye museum and it was a great experience for a family with kids. There is a free app to work with the museum but it will drain your battery. I highly recommend!
Tricky!,"This was a pretty neat experience. There is the Trickeye and the Ice Museum included in the ticket price of 15,000KRW approx. $15 USD. The Trickeye museum has several different themed rooms. You can download the app and have ""special effects"" in your photos. Some of the lighting and spacing was not adequate for good quality photos. The ice museum was just that ; Ice sculptures and an ice slide! They have lockers available for you to lock up your belongings before going in for 500KRW. Overall it was a fun and silly time!"
Fun experience,"The trickeye museum was really a funny experience and people from all age seem to enjoy it. The price is around 15,000 W / person and there are a series of stops within a space to pose and make pictures. As soon as it gets a bit crowded it gets hard to make the pictures from the desired effect angle, or you have to wait a bit until the next spot is free. So I went there around lunch time (12) and that was perfect, only few people were there. However we saw larger groups upon entering and exiting the museum."
Ok,"It is a fun museum to visit, but it is not looking that good. A lot of visitors have made the painting worn and it does not look that nice anymore. But if you haven't been to a trick eye museum before, it is worth a visit."
"Fun, but crowded ","As with most things in Seoul, this place was a little more crowded than we would have liked. It is especially apparent because of the small space in which the museum is located. All that said, we had a blast and if you download the app, the pictures have a whole new life to them! "
Wholesome family fun,"Kids and adults will love this place. Enjoyed all the AR experience except for the zombie street. At certain stops, you need to be patient for the AR effect to appearDon't forgo the ice museum. Has an ice sled inside which the little ones will enjoy. Word of caution... it is extremely cold inside.Do stop by the Tourist Information center for discount coupon worth 35%. Keep the admission tickets. It has AR features too on it too."
Great place,The Museum is located down a flight of stairs in a basement of a building in Seogyo Plaza. I found the Museum an enjoyable and fun visual experience. Would be good for a family outing as children can enjoy the interaction with the paintings to become part of the artworks. Toilets are clean and medium/large lockers are provided at a fee.It's a good and funny place to visit~ :)
Simple fun,Amazed by the creativity. Kids had a lot of fun posing for photos. You can download an app to add some augmented reality (AR) using the free wifi available. 
Loved it!,"This museum is one of my favorites! The museum is an interactive one, so you need to pose and get the right angles for the illusions to work! There is a lot of illusions to choose from, so anyone should be able to find an illusion to take a picture on. There is also a small ice museum across from the front desk, but it's nothing special."
Only if you Go with Kids.,"Not a Museum for me. It can be fun, but this is not a museum, this is a place where you go to make pictures with your kids or friends. I dind't like but maybe was because i went for myself and it doesn't have nothing to see."
Awesome ,"This place was so much fun, my brothers and I enjoyed going through and taking unique pictures. Def make a stop here "
Read before you judge,"This is a unique museum. You will use an app to create a 3-D images. I can say that this museum is perfect for teens and young adults. if you have time to spare, see it."
Too fun not to Try!,"This place is fun no matter what age you are. Family, friends and couples can have fun taking photos at different stations. App download is ness. to make some of these images come to life but both photographer and ""model"" can have a blast bringing these art pieces to life. Go online to see if you can get a discount. There are 3 different museum areas to check out AND a big ""kid"" arcade. The love museum is for a MATURE audience only not for little kids."
Modern Trickeye!,Love that their museum is now equipped with an app that makes your pictures go live! Worth a visit when in Hongdae
Fun Place,I really enjoyed coming here to kill some time while it was raining. It has all these 3D props for pictures and they give you ideas and examples how to do it.
Not good to go solo,"It's a cool museum, but pointless to go by yourself, cause the selfies are extremely difficult to get, you can't even take selfies with a majority of the scenes. You kinda have to have someone with you to take the cool pictures. "
Just for lols,"The trick eye museum is located in Hongdae, and is worth a visit if you're looking to kill some time. We spent less than an hour there as a before dinner activity and came out with at least 30-40 photos. "
Awesome fun!,This place does exactly what it says on the tin and is the perfect attraction for selfie-lovers - although do go with a friend who can help you take those pictures and do remember to download the app to see your selfies come to life in sometimes quite amazing way!
Role-play!,This place of illusion is the ideal place to play out some fantasies. Want to strut Hollywood's red carpet? You can do it here. Want to ride a dragon? Absolutely.The app which you can download and use to enhance the pictures even more is welcome bonus.
Fun Place,My mom and I really enjoyed this place because we love to be silly and take photos. It's fun to really see the effects after and it was something new to us. Go only if you like taking pictures and are easily pleased :-) This came with a free entrance to the ice museum too but we only stayed a short while there because it was too cold!! 
Crazy,"What will they think of next??!!! The app is a bit hard at first but all in all, it was pretty neat to check out."
Lots photo opportunity!!,"The Admission: 15,000 won (about $15)The Subway: Line 2, Hongik Univ. Station, exit 9So much fun!! Artistic techique that fools our eye into seeing three-dimensional objects from flat surfaces.Definitely fully charged your phone because you will definitelly want to take pictures at every setting!!It is kids friendly place, absolutely a great family outing spot."
FUN,it was so much fun being here took so many photos and they have an app you can use to take live 3d videos. they also have an ice museum. Lockers are available to store your belongings definitely a must do.
OMG,It was amazing! My daughter makes IMovies so she made one about this trip because she had plenty of pictures and videos. We stayed in a hotel for three days near it and went two of the days. Just saying if you stay near it don't go every day. It was really cool though and now everybody in my family is begging to go back. If you haven't been there I tried not to spoil it to much.
"Worth the time, especially on a rainy day.",I had suggested this to my wife as a wet weather activity - and the opportunity finally arose. While a bit of a trip from central Seoul it was initially a bit under-whelming when the taxi dropped us in a narrow laneway outside a building that looked like it had seen better days. But inside it was much better. Watched a group of Cambodians having fun and then we let our hair down and had a great time! The ice museum was a bit bland...
Mrs,Wow wat an experience it was my first time at a 3d museum and u throughly enjoyed it just wanted to keep taking pictures it was so awesome.. please note you are to remove shoes here so be prepared for that . ...
so weird and fun <3,loved this place! so much fun to take photos and some of them look crazy real in photos when you look at them later. It really is a tricky eye haha.
Make it a photoshoot,The place is really interesting for people that a little bored by the normal. The painting are 3D based and make a diffrent world. What should you do when you are in another world? Takes some pictures of coursr :) all kind of pictures can be taken and every painting or figure can make some enjoyment. I recommend going their with some friend for increased enjoyment
Excellent Museum,We had such a wonderful time here. Only wish we could have stayed longer. So much fun and easy to navigate
Fun museum ,Price are not expensiv. It's a bit difficult to find. The woman at the ticket box speak english and explain you everything with a smile.The museum is actually 2 different museum the trickeye museum and the ice museum. You can't choose. It's better to have a smartphone with you to enjoy the special effects after downloading a free app. The ice museum was really cold and the girl at the entrance of the ice museum is even colder as she stare at you without saying or explaining anything. 
"A bit pricey, but it's fun","Even we are no kids anymore, we had fun there. It's a bit pricey, but it is a really nice and funny thing to do, we took lots of pictures that make me still laugh. The price also includes the ice museum which is tiny, but fantastic when you go there in summer - it was the only time I didn't sweat like crazy ;-) "
"Super fun, Interesting and trripy experience","I vistied trick eye with my boyfriend during the summer and It was one of the memorable experience that my boyfriend and I talk about all the time. Since it was a really hot and humid summer in Korea, we both wanted to escape from the heat. This Trickeye museum was a great escape. All the pictures that we have taken are super fun and Instagram worthy :)) The Ice museum next to the trckeye museum is also super fun!"
We Loved this Museum,"I took my father to the Trickeye Museum on our last day in Seoul because it was raining and the Government museums and closed on Monday. What a surprise, We Loved this Museum! My father said if he knew about this museum earlier he would have spent more time there. You can put yourself into the artwork and take a picture with your camera, now your part of the artwork. For the elderly of disabled, the downside of the museum is going down 2 full flights of stairs. No elevator."
Our Summer July 2016,We went here July 2016 and it was really fun! Our daughter love being here with great photos. Prepare your mobile and camera! Great for traveler with child and we also can go to ice museum. 
"Good fun, ideal for kids",Great way to spend an afternoon! Download an app onto your phone and watch the AR come to life when you look at the paintings on the wall and floors.Very well done and clever AR. 
Trick Eye Museum Fun Place,"It was our first time to the Trick Eye Museum. It's a fun place to visit, especially if you like to take photos. The ticket included the Ice Museum next door."
My first disappointment in Seoul,It is not fair to call this a museum. It is just a playground for kids and no tourist attraction at all in my mind unless for people with kids up to about 10 y.o. Can not recommend it for the regular tourist. Do something else.
"Very cute place to visit, not the norm. Fun photo!","The Trickeye Museum is an interesting place to visit and it's free. There are several areas where there are distorted drawings on the floor, but when you take a photo of the drawings at a certain angle they turn out looking normal! They have a virtual ride, where you put on what looks like an oculus rift VR headset, where you can choose what type of ride to go on. I don't recall how much we paid, but our kids enjoyed it and that's all that really mattered. On the opposite side of the virtual ride there's a camera that takes a photo of your face which then crops your face into a Kpop music video on the TV next to it. We had a good laugh. We looked really funny doing the Crayon Pop and Gang Nam Style dance! At the end of it all, we headed for the restroom because we didn't know when we'd get another chance to go. We were surprised at the images of people staring back at you while you are sitting on the toilet. It was surprisingly entertaining. This is a really cute and fun little place to visit once."
Not for single travellers ,"See title. Good if you are in groups ( one or two friends maybe), even better one of you like taking photos and posing for pictures! Had great fun here as it wasn't crowded:) but need to choose a time to visit as it lost its fun if there are groups of people~ so be aware! Price? Oh come on! If u come from Europe to visit Korea, the ticket price is nothing! So cheapp! There is an ice museum too... and games. Worth to go "
Good place to take pictures,Trickeye museum is a good place to visit for both couples or friends. There is alot of different themes to take pictures off.You can walk through the museum in about 1 to 1.5 hour if you want to take alot of pictures.Entrance fee is 15 000 won for adults if you download their free app.Otherwise it is 18 000 won.We would recommend to go to this museum if you have some sparetime.
Directions to museum and tips,"Directions by subway: Take Line no. 2 green line and exit Hongik Station and walk out of exit 9. Keep walking straight for about 3- 5 mins depending on your speed, you will cross the first traffic light and you will see SPAO a big clothing store with red sign. Soon you will see Tonymoly, a beauty cosmetic store on the right corner, turn right and keep walking. You will see the vertical museum sign on the building on the right hand side in about 3 minutes. There was a horse carriage in the front of the entrance but I don't know if it belonged to the museum. Tips: 1. Must download the Trickyeye museum app before you go for maximum effect. You will not regret it. 2. Use the restroom so you don't have to come out plus there are some funny paintings inside. 3. There are small photos of suggestions of how to pose next to the props, take advantage of them. 4. Be patient as it may take more than a few tries to get the pose right. 5. I printed a coupon off the official Korea Tourism website for 12,000 wons per ticket. 6. There were probably 20 props so if you want to take a photo with all of them, it may take more than a couple hours."

Hard to find,"Visited here and took us a long time to locate the place and the people around d area dnt know much about this place. Though we were able to take some tricky photos here (the only thing u can do for the money that u spend), it felt awkward posing since some people watching and waiting for their turn to pose. "
WOW!,"I had always wanted to go, so when my friends (and their kids) were in Korea, we thought we's check it out. Its not cheap (if you have a lot of kids) but when you download the app and experience the augmented reality-- wow! Be sure your phone battery is fully charged-- and preferably, bring an extra. Very cool, and something all ages can enjoy. If you can go mid-week or off-peak times, it's better with less people as you are taking turns, and people can walk in front of your camera."
Fun for everyone,"If you take yourself too seriously you may not appreciate how amazing this museum is, but maybe if you do take yourself too seriously you should come here and it'll help you loosen up! It's such a one-of-a-kind experience, but you do need a smart phone to properly utilize the augmented reality experience. 10/10"
Plan to spend some time,This was a long cab drive from our hotel but worth the drive. Plan to spend a good amount of time exploring the museum and taking pictures. The museum was clean and well attended. 
Fun thing to do,This is a great thing to do with friends regardless of the weather. We had fun going through the museum taking crazy pictures. 
Very cool,"A very clever display of 3d artwork and AR video imagery overlaid to make some impressive video and photos. My teenage children really enjoyed this place, especially the ice museum scupturing, though it was freezing. Well worth the visit."
Mediocre,"It wasn't as exciting as I had anticipated. It was a fairly high price for a bunch of rooms that people were crowded in. We used the app to make ""3D"" pictures and it wasn't until we left that I realized not a single one saved. This place isn't really a museum so much as just a place to take pictures in a giant room. The Alive museum was much more interactive!"
"not really good, repeated stuff.","not really good, repeated stuff. you can click only some picture on predefined spots. Nothing to explore or fun, just click click and click"
Still the best trickeye we have been ,We last visited in 2013 so it was nice to see that they have added new exhibits. Takes about an hour to an hour half and be sure to bring a jacket for the Ice Gallery. 
Fun for All & Cute pictures to bring home,"Our family spent two hours there. It's fun for everybody. We got there early around 10am when it just opened. So we had plenty of time in each spot. It's app was downloaded at the entrance and the special of effect will pop out when you took pictures. A small ice castle is the bonus attraction. It's freezing inside, we couldn't bear the chill. We walked in and out right after."
Great Place to Visit,"If you are in Hongdae, Don't miss Trick Eye Museum. This Museum will trick your eyes. Haha. I had fun!"
An interesting and interactive experience with the app,"We went to Trickeye, Love museum and Alive Museums in Seoul. Trickeye is the best one among the three museums of similar nature, as it is more well-maintained and advanced. We had been to different Trickeye in other countries so we were not expecting much until we tried out their app! We were really surprised by the great effects created by the app and enjoyed a fun afternoon there. Tips: Downloading their app is a must!"
Amazing museum,Have been to trickeye few times. They surprise me every time i go there. They always change new theme and introduce cool stuff. I like taking pictures so i would recommend people who likes photo taking and posing funny pose to go there. 
"Very fun and entertaining, recommended for group of friends and family","Came here with my family. The art is very amusing, overall we had a really fun time at the museum and took tons of pictures! We bought the tickets online through an app, which sometimes offer promotions! "
Great eunique experience,Brilliant interactive experience. You will get amazing photos and videos when you download their app. Well worth a visit. 
Great Spot but not best for solo travellers,"The trickeye museum was a lot of fun but it's difficult to enjoy as a solo traveller. It gets tiring having to ask strangers to take photos for you (and more often than not, having those photos come out poorly). I would recommend that they maybe have staff throughout the museum that can take pictures for visitors. "
Trickeye a real trick of attemted theft of belongings!!!!!,Went to the trickeye at Seoul Mapo-gu on 7-5-2017 at 7.57pm approx. What was supposed to be a pleasent event turned into a nightmare! Went at night and they wanted to check my ticket and took my phone. Then distracted us and my phone was stolen. The lady at the counter pretended she did not speak any english as i asked where my phone went. It was taken and never returned theft!!. She played dumb and she clearly spoke english to a european lady. They sent me running through the ice museum three times where it was so slippery nearly slipped. Also i whacked my head hard on the ice overhead on the level up onto the overhang no clear safety signage at all. Another staff later on found the phone apparently and decided to hand it back. Then it was not even closing time and they were shutting lights at around at 8.30pm of displays. Then they proceeded to lock us in the museum and the staff left. We were stuck in there not even told how to get out in the dark!!! NO APOLOGIES!!!!!RUDE!!!! CRIMINAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
BEWARE of THEFT BY STAFF!!!!,"Upon entry to Trickeye Museum, we showed the girl at the front counter our online ticket, she didn't return the phone to us. Only less than 5 minutes later we realized the phone wasn't on us and asked the girl for it. She pretended she didn't understand although she spoke English very well when we first arrived. We frantically looked in our bags and around the place for about 10 minutes. Another staff then came to us with the phone they found on THEIR SIDE OF THE COUNTER! There was no explanation or apologies. The girl who took the phone avoided looking at us and did not say a word.At the end of going through the ""museum"", we came out and all the staff had left and locked the front door. They did not bother to inform us how to exit but just left us in there. We had to find our way to the back door of the building locked in for close to 10 minutes until we escaped!. Obviously trying to avoid speaking to us after what they did. HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. DO NOT GET TRICKED INTO GOING THERE AND GETTING YOUR BELONGINGS STOLEN!"
So much fun!,This museum was sooo much fun for my husband and I. We had a lot of fun taking pictures of each other and exploring this place. I have two tips. Don't follow the directions on the website. They are not well written and you will get lost. We did. While the directions are accurate they are vague. Its difficult to find because its tucked away inside a building with no obvious signage from the street. The museum is inside on a lower level. Ask for directions or just walk around shopping until you stumble upon it. Thats how we got there otherwise Id write some clearer directions. Look for a giant brick building is about the best tip I can give. This is the only reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5. Otherwise this place deserves 5 stars. Definitely worth the price of the ticket. My second tip is do not bring a DSLR or nice camera if you have one. Its a waste of space in a bag or backpack. To get the full effect from this museum you have to download the trickeye app on your phone for the photos/videos to appear to come to life/3D.
3D,Interesting photos you can take. Lots of fun trying to act out the photos. You will have a lot of fun.
A fun place,We had a good time here with our kids. Using trickeye mobile app is a must otherwise you won't experience all the great effects with fantastic creatures and scenes. The children liked it especially much. My son could not figure out why a fire-breathing dragon or a grinning shark became alive on my mobile's screen :))) Funny photos will be a great memory about your time in Seoul
So Real!,"This is a great activity on cold and rainy days. We visited Trick Eye Museum during our stay in Seoul. The place is about 10 minutes from the nearest subway, however can be a little hard to find, as its not located on a main road. Trick eye is wonderful for all ages. You'll have a lot of fun here taking photos with the art work. If you download the trick eye app, your entry fee is discounted. "
Amazing 3D Photos You Can Appreciate,"A Seoul must-see attraction is a visit to Trick Eye Museum. There are so many paintings that one can pose to get the 3D effect, depending on the photographer's position and angle. It leaves to your imagination and some acting skills on how you want the photo to be presented realistically.There are sample photos at the sides you could copy to get the 3D effect. With also the Trick Eye Apps that you can download the photographer is able to record a movie with creatures like dinosaurs, dragons moving around the subjects. He is also able to see on his phone screen special effects like moving fire, rain, bubbles, etc in the background. For only 18,000 won (SGD $23) you also get to see the Ice Museum where you see sculptures of igloos, trains, beds, toilets, pianos, bar counters, etc all in ice. By the way, it's icy cold inside, about -10 degrees C, as cold as the delivery container freezers trucks carrying meat. Not recommended for young children & the elderly. Something classic and extraordinary if you can withstand the cold. The sculptures are fantastic and realistic!."
This Museum will Trick your Eyes.,"Enjoyable fun filled afternoon at the Trick Eye Museum. Wasnt expecting much but the experience really surpassed all expectation. Really had a great time taking pictures with 3D effect. The only problem is the trick eye app, it gives you unclear images compare to the phone camera. This is a must visit place for both kids and adults alike"
Amazing Fun!! ,We had a great time here.. Me and my wife spent an hour here after roaming around the hongik university area . The new AR app is amazing for pictures and some cool videos. We got 30 percent discount after downloading the app. Overall one of the most fun museum we had been to. 
Fun and worth a visit if you have time in Hongdae,"It was fun for the kids with a great app you can download, which transforms the still artwork into animated masterpieces. The staff were great and the optical. Illusions funny. There is also a small ice museum.at the bottom which was very cold."
So much Fun,Went there after the Nanta show as the entrance ticket is included in the package. We weren't interested at first but since its included we just decided to give it a try . Glad that we visited as we had great fun doing silly things .
Very realistic and my kids loved it!,This is my 3rd visit to Seoul and my first overseas adventure with my kids! It was during December 2016 and I thought it would be good to have some indoor activities as the weather was really quite cold :p I think I made the right choice! The place is easily accessible (we took a taxi there) and there are a lot of small eateries located just outside the building. The paintings are so realistic and my kids had some much fun taking pictures! The price of the ticket also include entrance to the Ice Museum which is located within the same building but we didn't stay for long as it was near to dinner time and it is really small and nothing much in there for us to see.
Loved it!,Plan to stay here for an hour or more because they have some pretty cool stuff here! The paintings are so realistic and you'll have so much fun if youre with good friends and good company!
"Funny, but too expensive","First: We payed 18.000₩!!!There are funny scenes, but it looks pretty run down, so that's a bit disappointing. It's not really worth the money, but we made the best out of it and it wasn't that bad. For the best experience you need the trickeye app (they have free WiFi access, so you can download it there, it's not that bad) Ice museum visit is included in the ticket price, but it's pretty cold! "
"silly, but fun","This place is just plain ridiculous, it definitely is not a museum. With that being said, we went with a group, and we all had fun taking photos. So if you're looking for something different to do, give it a try. "
"Easy to miss the entrance, but a ton of fun!","The entrance is on a busy street, and is easy to miss if you aren't careful. Takes about an hour and the love museum is right upstairs. Great time especially since it was raining. It was a little crowded, but that was only because we went on a holiday."
Funniest museum I have ever been to,"I had never been to a trickeye museum before and I loved it. It is something out of the ordinary and if you never have been before, you definitely should take the trip."
Overprized and overrated,An indoor place to take fake photos. Totally corny. Perhaps I'm spoiled having seen ice sculptures at Chena Hot Springs. These were sub par to me.
"Fun, fun, fun","I love this place and have visited on several occasions taking friends along with me. A fun day, with many different pictures to put yourself into. love it"
Semi amusing way to spend an hour or so,"It was a cold day, I had read about this place, so thought we would take a look. It was 12000krw to get in, so not expensive. Some of the exhibits were cool, some were a bit lame. Some required some flexibility to get into the right spot for the photoWe had a laugh, and it was a cold day so we weren't upset to be inside for an hour or so.They have storage lockers for 1000won per locker, but it's a ""once open"" deal. You store everything you can, put 1000won in and it locks. You can't go back and grab anything without paying an extra 1000. (It's about $1 Aussie, but just a heads up to save every dollar possible)."
Funny place,"Funny place to visit. Good place to take photos. But not to go on public holidays as too many people, not only tourists but local people as well"
Funny Place,"Location is convenient in town.But if you play creative expression, you can shoot very interesting photos, although the moment put some action when there is a little embarrassing, because a lot of people next to see, but after returning to see The photo feels like a nice remembrance."
Hard to enjoy when it gets busy!,"We turned up just as a large tour group also arrived. It made it difficult to fully explore all the exhibits as there were long lines for each one. I think if you were to go when it was quieter it would be much more enjoyable. The ice museum (also included in ticket price) had an ice slide, which was fun (would be great for children). The VR rides were an extra expense."
Entertaining,Really fun day with friends to take pictures and update your Facebook profile pic. Bring a full battery on your phone/camera and a little bit of patience because you'll probably have to wait to jump in on the exhibits but it its totally worth it!
Entertaining,Its a must have experience when visiting Korea. It is available for all ages and anyone can have fun. Just make sure you charge your camera before you go. A minimum of 2 hours of fun awaits you and for adults there's also another 30mins of fun.
Adults can have fun too!,I wasn't too excited about visiting this museum since I thought it was for kids. Well guess what?! My sister and I ended up having too much fun and stayed way longer than we expected. It was a bit crowded in the afternoon so we had to often wait for our turn to take pictures. Prepare to be silly and take funny pictures! This museum is so much fun that I want to go again. :)
Offbeat entertainment,"Overall a simple museum, but we got some funny pictures we shared with friends and family. The staff was very helpful, there are tricks to lighting and because we were a single couple, it was great that she was able to take pictures for us and show us how to light our faces with our cell phones.A bit difficult to find since it's on the 7th floor of the Sunshine building."
So much fun,"My fiancé and I went here on a rainy day and it was perfect to spend about 2 hours in taking silly pictures, as well as experiencing the ice room and a face latte... "
Siilly fun,"Some of the paintings are showing some wear but they are well done and fun to play along with. This ""museum"" was somewhat crowded but people tended to wait there turn. We got a bunch of silly pictures and had a good time."
An amazing day :D,It is a fantastic place. If you wanna be child again you shoul go there. Don't forget your camera or clean your phone memory cuz you will take hundreds of picture :) Have good time from now...
Great for Families,"Our 7 year old had a great time posing for all the photos, and it was larger than I expected. There is a bit of nudity in a few of the displays, but nothing obscene."
Loads of fun,The paint and artwork is so well made. You can take the funniest pictures there. Really awesome 3D attraction. We had a blast. A fun place to visit!
Picture...Picture.,Trickeye Museum is best for taking awesome 3D pictures.Just outside are korean restaurants where you can dine after taking a lot of souvenir pictures.
"Small museum, immense fun!","I visited with some friends and I have to say that for such a small museum, the fun was huge. Lots of awesome murals to take some convincing photos. The ice museum which was also included on the ticket was also fun, cold, but worth seeing. I recommend It. What I love the most was that there was something for everyone to do inside the place. The museum is also in the heart of Hongdae and so there is always something fun to do after the museum visit. Rosie"
No words to describe!,The museum is really small but the paint is really impressive! You can easy spend 2 hours inside taking really convincing photographs!
A good laugh,"We had a great time here with all the different places you can take photos on. It wasn't too busy, we were able to get a photo on all the pieces without waiting too long"
Fun place to visit,"If you have some spare time and you are roaming around Hongae around, it is a good place to visit. Typical place that you will take lots of photos. "
Funny place,I can have funny photo in this place and also get the idea how to take amazing photo.There are also have Love museum but have to buy another ticket.
Overrated,"This museum has some fun illusions to take funny pictures, but it definitely didn't seem worthy of the high ratings it has on here. I also found the price (15,000 won) a bit much considering how much in Seoul is both more worthwhile and cheaper. It wasn't bad, but I would have rather kept my money."
A good experience ,"Trickeye museum is some distance from Hongik University station. It is at the basement of a building with the love museum which is not accessible to children. Some of the paintings at Trickeye are faded due to people touching or leaning against them. There is no clear sign on the floor to show the photographer where to stand to take the photos. However, there were photos on the wall so that we could figure how we should take the photos. There is no reentry after you exit the museum. However you should visit the Ice museum which is part of the ticket for Trickeye museum. Make sure you are warmly clad. Even with our winter clothing, it was cold. Not a big museum but nice to see an ice living room, kitchen and toilet, all carved from ice. "
Awesome fun stuff,First time I came a cross something like that. Really fun. Can take fun photos and burn some time with fun. Recommended. 
Lame,A pretty lame collection of tired back drops for visitors to take cheesy photos that create optical illusions. Bit of fun for the kids but overall not worth the effort in a city with so much more to offer. 
Not the most impressive 3D illusional studio,Have visited other similar places before. I would say this is not the most impressive one . The place is also quite old.
Trickeye Museum,Great combination of visual trickery. Easy to find and cheap. At this time of the year it was empty. Told that in high season it is very popular and busy. The ice area is also quite good
Cool for photos,"The Trickeye Museum and Ice museum are in the same building, and the admission tickets include both places. The place isn't big but packed with people when we're there.You can really do some cool photo/illusion pictures. We had fun."
Amazing family fun together,"Definitely a great place not to be missed if you are travelling with family with children. Just need to let your hair down and have fun taking all the fun shots with family members. We had lots of laughter together throughout the tour. Entrance ticket was 15k₩ for adult and 12k₩ for 3 to18years old, which has access to both Trick eye and Ice museum. The ice museum comes with a slide that is a small thrill for both child and adult. The room is -8°, so definitely can't stay inside for too long. As we are with our children, we did not go for the Adult museum, which requires separate entrance ticket. A must try if you are planning a visit to Hongdae."
show your creativity,It's better to go here with your friends to have fun taking pictures of each other. You can't help but act on each display. We got tired since we tried most of the displays here. Now I'm reminiscing and it leaves a smile on my face.
แนวคิดดี Good ideas,เป็นพิพิธภัณฑ์ ที่ไม่ใหญ่โตมากนัก แต่มีภาพ 3 มิติ ที่เกิดจากความคิดสร้างสรรค์ แล้วบรรจงวาดหรือขีดเขียน จนเกิดศิลปะที่สวยงาม เหมาะในการถ่ายภาพเก็บไว้อวดกันThis museum is not a big one but has many 3D painting that created with good ideas suitable for photograph.
Pretty cool!,Haven't visited a trick eye museum before and found it pretty fun! We went quite late in the evening on a rainy day and the place was empty - literally no one but us and the staff were wondering around! Spent a couple hours going through taking photos. A cool experience!Tip: buy tickets in advance for cheaper!
Fun!,Interesring place with trick eye and love museum. Good for a short fun time and getting some memory snaps of Seoul )
Fun AFternoon,A friend from Seoul took my husband and I here for a great couple hours of entertainment. We have some awesome photos and loved all the displays. We came at the right time and it was not crowded at all. Would be great fun with children too! 
Taking a break from the hustle and bustle,"This place is a bit of a gimmick and be prepared to take it as exactly that. It's a little over priced for what you get, but one ticket allows you access to the Trick Eye Museum, the Ice Museum, and this carnival themed area. It was pretty crowded while we were there so it became difficult to get good views for the photos. Also, some of the scenes were a little run down and not all that exciting. I will say it was a fun way to spend the hour if you are board and need a break from the endless shopping in Seoul. "
Quite interesting,I came here on my first visit to seoul in 2014. It was my first experience in a trick-eye museum. Lots of funny things to do inside especially for creative people. There's also an ice museum if I remembered correctly. It was really cold inside. An activity that you might want to consider when you are at the Hongdae area. 
A few good laughs,My friends and I had a few good laughs posing at / with various displays. The museum set up is inviting and colorful. They give you lots of ideas how to best take advantage of the optic illusions. Admission fee is nominal and we spent a couple of hours. Of course the laughter scare extended when we shared our pictures afterwards. 
Don't know what's the fuss about this place ,"Compared to the love museum the ""tricks"" in this museum lack realism.... kind of boring in comparison..."
Worth if you've never been to one like it before,Not easy to find it since it doesn't seem like a museum at all from the outside . It's inside a regular apartment building. Got some cool shots though :)
Interesting place,"Our first trip to Trickeye Museum. We went there early and there was no crowd. Hence, we do not need to wait for our turns to take pictures. The place is rather small and we finished within an hour. The cleaner lady was so friendly and she even helped us take family shot."
Fun with a Camera,"Spent an afternoon here and fun with the kids. If you enjoy taking pictures you will enjoy this place. Its fun, creative and sometime even challenging as you try to get your position just right. "
Take a lot of pictures!,"Good fun taking pictures! It was just crowded when we initially got there about 10:30-11 in the morning, since 2 tour buses arrived at the same time. It was hard to take pictures and it was warm with all the people. Admission was 15,000KRW and you could go in the Trickeye, ice and carnival museum. Their ice and carnival museum were small, but still fun. You had to pay extra to play the games in the carnival museum. As we were done going to the ice museum, we noticed that there were way less people. So maybe it's better to go around lunch time to early afternoon. They also have lockers available for 50KRW, it's very helpful since you only need a camera and you don't need to keep putting your things on the side when taking pictures."
To Kill Time...,"This place has an entrance fee of 15,000won? or 20,000 won? I forgot... probably the first one. It will give you access to their Trickeye 3D museum and their small Ice museum. I found this place to be just a place to kill time. If you're a solo traveler, this wouldn't be good as you won't be able to take a picture of yourself hahaI enjoyed a stall's VR zone. It is 5,000 won a pop."
Must visit when in Seoul,"I visited this museum with my friends and we had a blast going thru the whole musuem. It also comes with an ICE MUSUEM, and LOVE MUSUEM. It one of my facorite places during my recent visit in Korea. Its a must visit place."
Great way to spend an hour,"This museum is a good, fun way to spend an hour or so. There are plenty of opportunities for some fun photos as well as a games area and a whole section made of ice which is also nice to see. "
Nice place to do some fun stuff with your friends,It was a wacky day at the Trickeye Museum where nine friends of mine and I spent about an hour or so doing all kinds of poses to come up with some spectacularly fun and funny photos. Visit the Ice Museum as well as the Love Museum too. Be aware that the temperature at the Ice Museum is minus 2 degrees Celsius. The Love Museum is NOT appropriate for children. 
Shouldn't go here alone,"Mostly for photo-lovers, you can made interesting shots with all this ""3D"" stuff and some of them look really pretty."
Gimmicky but fun,It was a fun little trip to take all the wacky pictures. Definitely would recommend that you come as a group of at least three. There are a lot of set ups where you need a third person to take pictures of the other two.
Stoopid Funny. Silly Willy. A place of Laughs. Dorky? Yup! Fun? Oh yea.,Lighten up people. This one is all about having fun. Westerners often have a hard time being silly; this is the cure- IF you can let yourself get into it. Are you too old for it? Is one ever too old to laugh? Heck no! So go!
Funny.,It is not a museum...it is a gallery of interactive art. Sculptures and paintings you can take pictures with. It creates 3D type environment and the photos taken make it look like you are part of the art itself...really funny outcome.
More fun than expected ,I was a bit skeptical to go but my girlfriend wanted to see it. And I have to admit we had a fun afternoon there. I'd recommend to go there with more people so posing together and taking pics in turns is even more fun
Tricky Tricky,"This was surprisingly fun experience. It's not very cultural but all of our friends and family enjoyed the photos we posted because they were hilarious. The staff could've been a little more friendly, and the admission included two other sections of the museum but they weren't as much fun. It was a good indoor place to go on a rainy day."
Place for Goofing Around,"Trick Eyes is a place that you can take your picture with 3d effect on it. It's very famous, and have lot of branches in Asia cities.The place is kind of small, but it's very fun. We have lot of laugh when taking a picture and especially after looking at the result. They have a good explanatory with pictures in how you supposed to take the picture.In admission ticket, they also include admission to Ice Museum.Direction to this attraction : stop at Hongik University station (line 2, exit 9) > go straight 150m, cross the road, and turn left onto Hongik-ro Street > go straight 120m, and turn right down the second side street (in between TONYMOLY and Holika Holika) > continue going 100m to arrive at Trickeye Museum on the right.Instagram : @adjimantoro"
Good fun for the kids (and the kids at heart),Great fun to take silly photos. My kids loved posing and cropping and pasting to Social feed - always get lots of likes.
Loved it,"My husband and I visited here. We loved it. Must admit it is a bit cheesy but lots of fun. Took loads of great pictures but we found it a little difficult taking photos not knowing where to stand. Some displays had ""stand here spots"" but many didn't. Ideally it would be great to have a staff member walking around helping people take photos as a lot of displays you could take couple photos but with only 2 of you that was a little difficult. Your ticket includes entry into the ice museum so go in, it will cool you off before going out into the heat again.A fun few hours and some great pictures to be taken"
Not a museum. An indoor carnival attraction to take silly pictures in.,"Not a museum. An indoor carnival attraction to take posed silly pictures in. Maybe fun for teenagers and preteen and the instagram obsessed selfie taking crowd. Really just a bunch of perspective paintings and props. ""Ice museum"" included in the price even more lame- the highlight is a toilet made out of ice with a plastic turd in it. Hard to imagine why this place gets a ""trip advisor top 10 places to must visit in Seoul. Skip it unless you have a rainy day in town with the kids."
Fun to do,"We managed to locate the place from street signs and asking at the tourist information. Buying the tickets was quick and easy and we were able to put our back pack in the locker for 500Won. The place is a bit of fun and allows you to do silly poses in front of the paintings. There are pictures available to guide you on where to stand for the pose. It is very clever and looking back at the photos taken is funny. It wasn't too busy when we went so didn't have to wait for most of the photos. We went as a couple which was ideal for taking the photos. However we would have to ask other people to take photo for us for certain pictures. The entrance fee allows you access into the carnival section although you have to pay for certain games. Also the ice room which we didn't want to go into as we were in shorts and tshirts, and we didn't want the camera to fog up. All in all a fun trip to while away an hour or so. There are discounts available if you come across them. "
Unexpectedly it was ALOT of fun!!,"We had a Seoul pass and decided to go see what the trick eye museum is about. it is a definite MUST for all ages and all people. I would recommend going early in the morning when it opens (9am) to avoid crowds and also NOT to go alone. Ideally 3 people but two work fine. Also there is an ice museum we didn't anticipate so had to run in and out quickly due to the cold, would have been nice if we wore long pants at least or if we had some warm clothes. All and all, favourite museum! Great pictures ;)"
Trick your eyes,Trickeye Museum was a fun place for us to visit and take pictures. There was quite a lot of optical illusions and other picture backgrounds for us to appropriately pose and get photographed. Recommended.
Cool museum in a cool neighbourhood!,"Funny museum, not that crowded when we were there. The ice part of the museum was well made, but freezing cold!"
Funny.,My friends and me went to Trickeye museum since Sep 2015. I got some discount for fee entrance. That's so funny and good experiences! Have a many 3D pictures for take a photos. Moreover there're have ice town too. I will recommence to another people for visit this museum.
Great place fornpictures,Go there for sure if you enjoy optical illusions and specially pictures to go along with it. Kids love it the most as it also gives them a different learning
More for photography ,"I thought this was a museum for optical illusion, but it ends up being more photography orientated. Unless you like to take photos, I do not advise you to go."
"Fun, interactive museum","3.5 starsI like the idea of interacting with the murals. It's a cool place to go be silly and take pictures with your friends/family for a couple of hours. If you go alone, you can ask people to take pictures for you. We also got access to the Ice Museum part but I only lasted a minute because it was freezing cold and I only had on a t-shirt and capris. There's also a games/arcade section. You can also check out the Love Museum next door. "
Fun,"I thoroughly enjoyed this museum! Initially, the idea of taking pictures with optical illusions didn't seem huge, but when you're actually there, you'll realize how amazing these paintings are.Figuring out how to pose as well as taking the picture from the best angle is super fun, and I really recommend you go here with goofy friends and family.With our package(?) ticket, we also had access to the carnival area and the Ice Museum. The Ice Museum is super cool, literally.Such an interactive, fun museum experience!"
Very good Museum to visit (especially with Children),"Conveniently located museum, reasonably priced. Try to go early in the day, as it may get crowded later on. Many interesting exhibits and do take as many photos as possible. Can combine a ticket with the Ice museum which is located within the same premises"
Very nice,"This was an amazing trip with a family with kids 2yrs, 9trs and a teenager and grandma.Amazing tricky way to have a unforgettable pictures."
It's something to do,"I am sure when this place opened it was great, but it seems pretty run down. It was dirty, sticky, and there were pieces of the maze that were broken or missing. I felt like I needed a shower after I left. The kids enjoyed it of course. Just bring hand sanitizer!"
Out with my wife and we had a wonderful experience. Everything was fun and everyone was friendly.,"Awesome Place to visit, my wife and I really enjoyed everything. It was fun and entertaining. Just an awesome time. "
Fun,"The Trickeye Museum is located in Hongikro 3gil, Mapogu, and it was fun. It would have been more fun if it weren't for the other inconsiderate tourists. But all-in-all, it was a fun experience. The Ice Musuem area (was it called that?) was really cold. The most we stayed in there was just like 2 minutes and we were out. The love museum was also fun, but of course, only for adults. Also, it would be best to have your DSLRs or phones with good cameras to have great pictures with the illusions."
This is a hoot!,"This was a fun, and cool way to spend a hot afternoon in Seoul. We took lots of pictures that we enjoy looking at now that we're back home. The price includes entrance to the Ice Museum too!"
Have great fun!,I found this museum is very interesting and awesome. We took lots of fantastic 3D photos with numerous posting. We really have great time here. Strongly recommend those families with kids to visit this lovely museum.
Funny,"The Trickeye Museum is an art gallery, the 2D paintings are painted by special techniques which make illusion of being in 3D. Depend on each of viewer, who may interact with the paintings in many different way. The activities were very fun and the picture look as real and emotion fully."
Lots of fun! Be sure to wear warm clothes and bring a jumper for the ice museum,"We had a great time posing for photos with all of the different things. Fun for both me and my boyfriend. There's photographs displayed around to show you how to get the most out of each shot. It's not just for kids either, there are many things there to entertain everyone.The ice museum is great, there's an igloo and an ice slide you can go on. Plus there's all kinds of sculptures to photograph with. But it is VERY cold, especially during summer because it's so warm outside and you're not used to it. So make sure to wear warm clothes (long pants) and a jumper because otherwise you won't be able to stay in there for very long and there's no re-entry. Also our camera lens fogged up because it was so cold and it was difficult to take good photos.There's a carnival there too which has games and other stuff you can pay extra for. There's a tiny mini golf and a Xbox Kinect sports screen. There's even a ball pit for the young kids (or young at heart).We went at around 10am on a Monday in August 2016 and we had the entire place to ourselves. When we left at around 11.30, several large groups of people arrived and it started to get quite busy. So I'd advise trying to go between 9-11.30am. Then you can go for brunch at some of the nice places nearby."
Fun!,"This is a must see place. Take lots of photos and your kids and you'll have a blast!! The ice city is very cold, though but a must see, too and part of your price. Get your tickets at a kiosk outside of the subway and save $2"
okay to pass time,its small you can finish it under 30 mins but its entertaining. make sure to check out on your hotel if they have a coupon. they usually have a coupon for tourist. we found out just after going back to the hotel since one of the staff from trickeye asked.
Super fun,Like everyone elae already wrote it is definitly a museum to visit. It is a museum with just 1 goal: make you laugh! 
Perfect!,Unique and fun. Take many pictures. It is the BEST. It is amazing and fantastic. It is marvelous. It is spectacular!!!!!
Super Fun,"Very unique. Never had so much fun like that before in a museum. Kids would definitely love it. Both, adults and kids will have a good time. "
Great fun!,"Not that informative, but a lot of fun for not that much money. You get to do the Ice Museum and the Trickeye Museum - great for all ages!"
"Bizarre and unique but fun, grab a partner to help you take selfies","This place is unlike any museum I've ever seen. It gets top marks for uniqueness alone. The best to describe it: it's just a whole lot of pictures on walls that you actually enter and become part of, and then have your photo taken as if you're part of the art! Well worth the entry fee, which from memory is only about 10,000 won.It's not easy to take photos by yourself or without a selfie stick, so take someone with you so they take take your photo while you pose.The ice museum is also part of the entry free which is quite fun for photos too, and the ice slide is worth a go as well."
Trickeye museum,"Awesome place to visit in seoul. I would like everyone who are searching for a place to visit in seoul,visit once and i am sure u will refer back others to visit this place. "
Average!,"Although, it was fun to walk around the museum was crowded with people crazy for pictures! Its open until 9pm so it might be a better idea to go later in the evening!"
Crazy Fun!!,"Perfect if you need a place to cool off in the summer, warm up in the winter or get out of the rain during Monsoon season! Bring your camera and take photos at all the exhibits! If it gets busy, you might have to wait in line for photos so be patient. It only took us about two hours to get through and we took photos at almost every spot! Great place for kids and adults!!"
Fun but can get busy,"The entrance fee is KRW15,000 and includes the ice museum but you can get it for KRW12,000 if you download or print-screen a discount voucher (easy to google). We spent an hour taking photos and having a laugh but it was reasonably quiet while we were there, which made it enjoyable. The rooms are small-ish so it can get quite crowded. On our way out, a massive coach party got in - it would have been a very different experience with 50-odd people queueing up to take a photo!"
Not worth the money,"Whilst this place is entertaining, it is definitely not worth the high entrance fee. It is made up of about three rooms with painted walls where you can take photos. We went on the middle of the week day and it was still busy enough that we couldn't really get to some of the pictures. There is a small mirror room and that's it. It's so small you will get through it in 15 minutes. The main reason for the negative rating is that the price is ridiculous at almost $20. It should cost 10% of that price. Very disappointed. "
Must visit Museum in Hongdae!,Had some much fun as whole family taking cool tricky photos with cool backgrounds. Spent about 1 hr in the museum taking funny pictures. The ice museum was ok( Long Beach Queen Mary Ice event is lot better). This one is very small and tight when you have bus load of kids screaming inside.
g r e a t,u will love it their are 3 museums together trickeye/ love / frozenu will like all of them please bring a camera for trieye + take many pictures. 
interesting place for photo shooting,"you need to be quite precise with angles but the end products are definitely quite interesting. It is not a very big place and sometimes full of tourists. However if you have not been to a similar one before, this one is worth the experience."
Take a tripod and dress pretty!,"Never been to anything like this before so went to check it out. Not that easy to find so swat up on location first, also pick up the 2016 Seoul Summer Sale map pack at the airport which gives you a 20% discount voucher (bringing the price down from $15 to $12pp). Basically you just go round taking photos of yourself (or other half) in some cool eye trick situations. Great concept and so much fun. However you need an extra person to be your photographer, or bring a tripod which is a little awkward. And since I didn't know what the museum was about I wasn't the best dressed so reluctant to take too many photos of me. "
"It was ok, not worth the money.","If you have nothing to do after a long trip, then Trickeye Museum could be good to be added to your Things To Do only if you love taking photos of yourself or your friends. It's a bit pricey. Otherwise, hanging around the area (Hongdae) is good enough."
A tourist trap,Tourist trap and way over priced! My 13 and 15 year old went to it and they said some of the things are inappropriate. Might be more suited for adults.
Fun place to make use of yr cam,"It's a fun place to make use of yr camera ^^ if you hv free time & tired of shopping, then this can be a place for u. They hv 3 museums in 1 place ""Trick eye, Ice & Love museums"" (only love museum, u must be 18 above). I hv been to a few similar museums, this (is not) one of the best to said highly recommend to everyone but it wasn't that bad either. Two big issues i find really annoying are 1. not all scene comes with ""standing spot for you to take a proper shot"" 2. A few scenes are too close to each other, meaning u hv to crop a few thing out. Anyway like i said the overall isn't that bad, i would still recommend if u comes with young kids but don't put yr expectation too high. ^^ "
interesting experience and good for kids and family,"the museum is hidden in a busy shopping street. Sometime you may pass by without seeing it. I have a good time there. Beware that lots of children in this attraction so try to avoid the peak hour during the afternoon if you would like some quiet time. Beside, i recommend that you go there a later time of the day may be one or two hour before the closing time. That way, you may have a better surrounding for your photo. One last tips, try to get the ticket online to avoid the line. I booked from TravoAsia, u may download the app or go to their web site. they have discount tickets for many attraction, but they also update quiet often on the discount, Good luck and have fun."
Take a friend ,"The trickeye museum is worth a visit and have some very interesting things inside. But I recommend to take a friend or not go alone as I did as u need someone to take a photo of u or someone. It's a 2min walk up a busy Street where cars cannot go. A little hard to find but worth it. It's fun, the love museum is above "
Fun but clearly a tourist trap,"We had a lot of fun taking silly pictures, but it was quite crowded and clearly a big draw for tourists. We got some great photos out of it. One thing - there is a photo setup that is offensive (posing with an afro with a pick in it) that I think Trickeye should remove."
Fun to do when you have the spare time,"To me, this museum was brilliant because I had never done anything like it before. Placing yourself in situations make images come alive and give the impression that you're actually within them. It's an interesting concept. Not something to cancel all your plans for, but if you pass one and happen to have nothing to do or a few hours to kill, go have a laugh, you won't regret it."
An average facility in a mediocre setting,The museum is located in a very moderate location with no parking facilities and without wheel chair access. It is not a proper tourist facility
Enjoyment from Illusion,"Love, love this place! The illusion tend to make you giggle as you see their effect in your pictures. Recommended, especially if you have great amount of time to kill!"
Loads of Fun,I had the opportunity to visit the Trickeye Museum my last day in Seoul and I am so glad I didn't miss it. We laughed and laughed until our faces hurt while taking pictures. I would suggest to go with another person for this museum. I was on a solo trip so I was going to skip it but I was fortunate enough to meet a great friend and we went together. 
Fun,Entrance looks cool. Lots to see. Lots of discounts on the wall before entering so be sure to check it out before paying 
Trickeye Museum,Excellent place to visit and create you own posture with each of trick. Full of fun and happiness all the way.. don't miss it.
Not stroller friendly,"When we visited the museum, my son was still sleeping in his stroller thus my husband did not enter the museum as advised by our tour guide it is not stroller friendly. There is one mirror maze which stroller could not enter in the museum. "
Interesting and fun experience,"Got to know about Trickeye Museum while we were in Seoul and took time out to visit on the last day. Definitely worth it! Its a quirky, fun experience that made for some great holiday photos. "
must go when you in Hongdae,"there are 2 museums there , Trickeye Museum and small ice Museum. you can buy ticket for both Museums. The eyetrick Museum is fun and take up to 2 hours most and the ice Museum is really small and take 10~20 minutes"
Had so much fun and laughter,"This place was seriously hilarious... I went with my parents and two sisters and my jaws were aching from laughing so much. The entrance fee was 15,000 won and it took us about 2 hours or so to see the whole place. It was lucky we went early because when we came out there were crowds (of mainly students and young kids). The ice museum was ridicously FREEZING!! It was minus 11!! We literally ran round the place and took as many pictures as we could possibly manage, went down the ice slide and was out as quick as a flash. For those (like me) who use DSLR cameras or even those with compact cameras, be aware of the fogging on your lenses when going into or out of the ice museum.There was so much variety of imaginative paintings, sculptures and other exhibits that were amazing and looked great on the photos and videos. There were lockers at the entrance of the museum that costs 500 won, which was a blessing because we carried a few bags.We kind of got lost trying to find this place and when we eventually finished at the musuem and were on the way back to the subway station, we realised we took the longest detour ever. So here's the easy way to get to the museum from the subway...From Hongik University Station, take exit number 9... walk straight until you get to a big road, with McDonald's on one side and Forever 21 opposite, turn left into that road. Take the first right (next to theTony moly shop) where there's a street of shops and keep walking straight, the moment you see a colourful statue of a man in a carriage, then trickeye museum is on the right hand side."
Awesome way to spend 1-3 hours!,"TICKETS/PRICING: 15000 for adults (18+), kids are lower.The ticket includes both the Trickeye and Ice Museums.TRICKEYE: I honestly expected only a few photo ops here and there, BUT MAN, THERE WAS A LOT OF EXHIBITS! I don't want to spoil anything, so I'll keep it simple- there are lots of sculptures and paintings that are amazing, hilarious, and gorgeous. There are a few inappropriate ones, so take caution when bringing kids! When I went, there were waves of Chinese tourists coming in, so I had to wait to take a picture for some of the spots (just beware if you're going in the summer). Spent about 2 hours.ICE MUSEUM: You're given a blanket-poncho before going in because this place is super cold; negative degrees Celsius. It's a small exhibit, which is okay because my family just wanted to snap a picture and get the heck out of there! If you can't handle the cold, this isn't for you! I had some fun as there was a mini icehouse and a slide. Overall, quick but fun experience.OTHER: Before entering the actual museums, there are lockers (500KRW), restrooms with multiple stalls, a bubble tea shop, a dining area, game room (like a mini carnival), caricatures (15000-25000), and hanbok dressing (20000 for renting the dress and using the background settings for photos, 5000 for hair, 15000 for makeup). Personally, I enjoyed wearing the hanbok and taking pictures!- just another touristy thing to do! My sister got the caricatures and didn't like it because it didn't resemble her, so that was a downside. Overall, my family had a great time taking pictures with these amazing optical illusions! Afterwards, you can visit the Love Museum (adults only) or go shopping right around the corner!"
Most fun ever,"We had the best time on a recent visit to Trickeye! My hubby and I went with another couple and we spent hours wandering around trying to get the perfect pictures. There are lots of different scenes that you pose in front of, behind, on top of.... And the ""trick"" comes in when we download or print your pictures. It will appear as if you are hanging off a cliff, jumping from a building with a parachute, putting your head in an animals mouth.... So much FUN!!!!"
Enjoy and have fun,"Good for family , solo, group travellers. Fee applies for entry into the museum and the ticket is used also for entry to the adjacent ice museum. Trick eye museum has the spots earmarked from where the photographs are to be taken to get the tricked photos. Ice museum temperatures are near to -7 deg C. Those who have allergy to severe cold are not advised to go in there. "
Nice illusion place,"Great place to enjoy with your friends and loved ones. We took many pics and had great fun. there was 3 parts :trick eye,Ice area, carnival. firstly the ice are was -4 c and was really cold but we enjoyed it.The trick eye is a must see attraction."
Good time for family fun,"Take your camera and get ready to have fun. This museum was fun and had quite a bit of variety for all to include an ice exhibit. The ice exhibit was extremely cold and would have been better if they had coats or at least a warning, but it was part of the fun. It wasn't too large, so we weren't cold for very long. The remainder of the museum was fun and I recommend it. "
Memorable,Lol. Lotsa 3D stuff and painting where you could actually be in it! Great for memorable moments and good for photography.
Great place to fool around and enjoy!!,"It was an awesome experience for me. I got to visit this place after a hectic week at work. I could unwind myself in few minutes after entering the museum. The greatest part is you can make a fool out of yourself and pose for photos and enjoy yourself without feeling self-conscious about it as that is what everyone around you will be doing.Those were moments to cherish and I'll definitely remember this experience all my lifeDon't miss to fight David with colours. Its great fun!! :)Also, bring warm clothes, especially cap and gloves with you if you want to enjoy the ice museum without letting your face and fingers go numb, as this part is maintained at very low temperatures."
"Fun, creatively made ;) ","My sisters and I had fun taking pictures and laughing at the same time. This museum is very creative and well thought of. I hope that they 'll create more illusions in the future :)The staff were very helpful, friendly and accommodating. Because I enjoyed this attraction/ museum, I plan to visit the other branches as well :)"
Trick Eye and Ice Museum,"It was a fun and unique experience I guess. Wife wife and daughter enjoyed it. There are many different places to pose, take photos, etc. There is a little mirror maze to exit. Don't forget to check out the Ice Museum. It was different. Ice cold sculptures and a little slide just for kicks LOL. The girls had fun so I had fun as well."
Trickeye museum- Seoul,The kids loved Trickeye museum and taking all the photos. Ice sculptures on the same floor was nice too. 
Fun,Go early. We went an hour before closing time and we were not able to see the carnival museum. Fun for everyone especially kids. 3D paintings are average; its really up to your drama skills to make the paintings alive and more interesting. 
So fun!!,"I enjoyed everything about this museum. I had so much fun in it and it had a 50% discount! If I travel back to Seoul, I will visit I this museum again. "
New experience ,I liked the idea of the museum it was funny tricky and we enjoyed our time but we faced little difficulty to know how to take the right photo if there is a guide or better instructions will be easier 
Cool trick-eye things - kill an hour or two,"The trick eye museum is a cliché place to bring some visitors. The outside looks like a dodgy apartment building and the trickeye museum is located downstairs at B3.Some of the ""trick-eye"" photos are really great. The little boy peeing - hilarious! The trick room where you look like a giant and a teeny person - wonderful! The sharks? Panda, Teacups? Boring!Your ticket gets you into the ice-museum as well, which I didn't really enjoy.Still do it to kill some time and amuse yourself."
Photo place,Fun place to get some interesting photos! There is also a love museum on the second floor for adults.
Fun!!!!,"Keen on getting some good snaps taken in Korea? You should visit this place. it was a wonderful time pass for our family. My daughter (11 months at the time) clearly enjoyed every bit but hardly understood anything. Extremely creative place, one is sure to be amazed by the artistic skills used within,,,,"
"Good, silly fun!",This was a fun diversion! I had never been to a museum like this before but we had a ton of fun taking photos and admiring the clever 3D optical illusions!
Cool and fun,Lots of trickeye photo spots. A good hour or 2 of photo taking. Hardest part was probably locating the building. Its within the alleys of Hongdae. 
Passed away a couple of hours,The trick eye museum was a fun way to spent a couple of hours. It basically is taking pictures of yourself in the trick eye sets. We also did the ice museum we where only in there for a couple of minutes took some photos and got out because it was freezing.
worth every penny spent !!!,if you love to pose then this is the place to be... u can spend good 3-4 hours here clicking all kind out tricky pics.. Prices at 15000.per person it gives you entry to trick eye + ice house + carnival..a must visit place
Very funny,"The trickeye museum is very funny to do with friends. You can take great pictures of you (flying, being giant, being eaten by a shark,...). Just next to the museum is the ice museum and the love museum. I would definitely advise this museum."
Great for families,Took my granddaughters ages 11 and 13 and they had a great time and have great photos to remember their trip to Seoul
A Different Kind of Fun...,"This was definitely a cool place to visit. There are so many photo ops with quirky and fun subject matters, so don't forget your camera! We were with a large tour group, so it made stopping to take pictures at the ones you wanted to difficult at times because there were too many people waiting. I'd recommend going here on your own with a small group instead. Otherwise, it's a fun and entertaining time!"
Fun but go with a friend,It's super fun but only if you go with another person to take pictures for you. Fast to go through but the ticket includes this the ice museum and the carnival section. 
A lot of fun,Trickeye puts you inside unbelievable settings from classical paintings to fantasy locations. Set after set gives you lots of photo ops. Everyone likes posing and then instantly seeing the pics.
Fun photos,"A fun place to go with friends. Make sure your camera is fully charged and has room for lots of photos because you'll be taking a lot. You pay for 2 museums in one: ice museum and the trick eye. The ice museum is really small and REALLY cold. We didn't want to spend much time in there because we already thought it was too cold outside and had stores our jackets in a locker we rented in the museum. There is a small ice slide which was fun. Then after the ice museum you can go through the trick eye museum and have fun! It's in the basement, but there's a love museum above which looked fun (adults only)."
Extremely funny and interesting museum!!!,I loved every bit of this museum. It was so funny and our pictures turned out to be extremely hilarious. They have so many funny 3D images inside and you can get yourself clicked at every step. Don't go there alone as you would need a companion to get yourself clicked. There was an ice museum also which was perfect to go and have a look at. It was quite cold inside so we were simply in a hurry to click the photographs and come out soon. But it was definitely worth a visit. It took us about 3 hours to cover the entire museum. I would highly recommend this museum if you are seeking for some super fun in korea. I already have such lovely and funny memories captured with me. Go have fun guys. Good luck!!! :)
Great for the young and young at heart,This museum was a fun surprise. It was included in our combo ticket and we thought we would give it a try at the conclusion of the Seoul Tower (since it is located at the base of the tower). Photography is encouraged and visitors become part of the artwork. Allow 45 minutes to visit both exhibit halls. 
Best two hours for the kids,A fabulous place to pop into with kids. Make sure you wear something that will blend into the pictures and you'll have some fun! Leave your coats and bags in the lockers.
try to look for special dates that offer free entry!,"when a friend was visiting around halloween, I learned from their website that they were offering free admission to those who came in costumes -- definitely fun and a great way to spend a few hours (if you take pictures at every station like we did), but i'm not sure if I would have been as satisfied if I had paid full price to get in. recommended especially in the winter when it's freezing outside!"
Fun trips and do funny captures ,Good places to make funny and good captures. Our Ticket including ice museum.You must come with friend or family to do the perfect angle-shoot. Solo travel maybe will little bit difficult and confusing. 
FUN FUN AND SO MUCH FUN,Very good for all sort of age. U can have fun by taking photo that look so real. Kid definitely love this place with so much activities and fun. 
A Must Go,"So much fun and a ton of picture opportunities. You get all three for the price of one. Ice, Carnival and Trick Eye. One of my favorite museums. "
Don't forget the camera phones!,"Entry costs around 15,000 won but you won't be disappointed (children under the age of 18 pay 12,000 won). I know of some travel websites occasionally give way promotions where you print the e-voucher, you are able to get about 10-15% off. Located in the lively and youthful vicinity of Hongdae, it's no surprise that this is one of the most talked about attractions in Korea. Tucked away below ground level at Seogyo Plaza in the university town of Hongdae (subway stop: Hongik University), this museum shares the same location with the Love Museum, the Ice Museum, and the Carnival. The ticket enables you to go for the Trickeye Museum, the Carnival (where additional charges apply if you play the games) and the Ice Museum. The Love Museum which is restricted to visitors over 18 only require separate charges. Within an hour and a half to two hours, you can take picture with murals, statues and wallscapes which come alive through the lenses of your cameras. You can become part of the artwork once you are captured in the photo. Always have your cameras on standby so you are able to see how they look on your screen before taking the photos to get a more accurate look at how the picture will turn out. There are some photos on the wall to help you get some idea on how to pose for your pictures so that they'll look more realistic in 3D. Go on, pose and act the part! This is quickly becoming a not-to-be-missed attraction when visiting Seoul. Highly recommended."
Awesome emotions in Seoul,"Not surprising that this place has become so famous in Seoul. You'd wanna come here for bright emotions and laughs. And, of course, the photos are mind-blogging. Definitely worth checking out."
Fun place to visit,This is a great place to visit though a bit difficult to find. plenty of photo opportunities that made you worth your while coming here. 
Physical photoshop ,"Yes, its really fantastic the way they art it and placed the things. Those makes you feel you did things in real if we look from camera."
Fun place to take silly photos ,"Be sure to get your camera ready! It's fun if you come along with your friends/family and do all sorts of weird and silly poses. The only thing is you have to queue and wait for other people to take their photos, meanwhile you can roam around freely. As for foreigners, remember to check out the visitkorea website and print out discount vouchers (if there are any)! "
fun!,it was indeed a fun activity for everyone. one of the kind and i guess a pioneer in this kind of activity. we went here around late afternoon... i guess it is their peak hour... but it doesnt matter... we did enjoy our time and a must for anyone who will visit seoul.
Don’t make a special trip unless you’re near Hongdae,"The entrance ticket cost 15,000KRW and that includes the Trick Eye Museum, The Ice Room and the Street Carnival. It is located very close to the Hongdae Nanta Theater and there are signs around there letting you know it is in the general vicinity. We went in and took some pretty cool pics but the route wasn’t very extensive. We made the mistake of going around 4:00pm which was about the time many high school kids were out of school and decided to go at that time too. Thus, we had to often wait for a chance to take a pic. I imagine you should go earlier and you’d probably have the entire place to yourself. The Ice Room was actually very cold as it is a tiny place set in minus 7 degree weather. I think they are trying to replicate the real life Ice Museum. You can finish the pics there in about 5 minutes. The Street Carnival was very lame with half of the games broken and the other half are carnival games for a fee. It was pretty lame so we left. The entire experience is about 1 hour long and the bus ride took longer for us to get out here thus I wouldn’t recommend you coming out just for the museum and only come if you had planned dinner or a walk down Hongdae Shopping Street."
Young at Heart,"This museum is loads of fun. We took about 150 photos of us interacting with the 3D art. It made us feel like youngsters again. As we were a couple traveling by ourselves, everyone was quite nice about taking photos of us together. And we reciprocated. The museum was a bit tricky to find but well worth it. The museum is located in the trendy Hongdae Neighborhood that is home to many universities. Great for people watching, street food, shopping, and visiting cafes/bars."
Good Experience,"It is a trickeye museum cum ice museum. Many photo opportunities. Quite alot of tourists. Discount vouchers are only valid for adults, not valid for children. The museum is not very big, we exit within 1 hour. We find the price more expensive than Alive museum. "
"A bit out of the way, but a good place to kill an hour or two","Took the kids here after walking around all day. Got there about an hour before closing. It is not the most obvious of locations and needed to use GPS to find the building. The building is set back in a section of streets filled with cafes and bars. But it's seoul, so we felt comfortable walking around in there late at night. Once in, go to the basement floor. The fee is a bit steep and you really need to work with the comers angles to make the pictures look like its intended to. "
Fun for two hours,Its quiet funny to go there with friends and to take some funny pictures. But we went there when it was quiet full and this is just annoying to wait hours until u can make ur own trick eye effect pictures.
"Selfies ""museum""","The ""museum"" is 3D selfies backdrops with a 15000 won entry fee for it and the ""Ice sculpture museum"". Not the kind of business model that would work outside of Asia, I think.... but twenty-somethings here love it."
Kids loved it!,Trick Eye is a good place to kill an hour or so. The smallish space is packed with optical illusion backgrounds. We had lots of fun posing with these and took heaps of photos. We also visited ice world (same building and part of the price) which was very good. We visited Trick Eye on a cold winters night. The street shopping in the area are awesome but it was a welcome relief to be indoors.
small not much pictures,It's not big and doesn't have many pictures as I thought. Went there only if you don't have anything to do.
Good time,"It is a nice place to go as a couple, friends, or with your kids. But definitely not alone!Bring your camera with you and try to get the best shot!Worth the visit, and can be a good alternative to spend your day if it's raining.Could have been a bit cheaper."
Fun,"It's really worth it, So if you're in Seoul, you should go there! It will be a great experience and you'll enjoy it all the way. I still check my pictures from day day even afer one year, because this kind of museum is rare. "
Nice with new designs,"Visited this museum again for the third time with different group of friends each time. This time round they have new and different designs (for trick eye museum and ice museum). It is so sweet and cute. Managed to pose with some of the new designs. As usual, there were a lot of foreigners at the museum. So we have to be patient and wait for our turn to pose and take pictures. When you purchase the tickets, there is a discount ticket (printed at the back of the ticket) for singapore trick eye museum (as well other trick eye museums from other countries - but I don't remember which countries). You can keep the ticket and use it in singapore if you want to visit the one there in the future."
No harm visiting,"Fun way to spend an hour taking pictures of all the exhibits. Be prepared to lay on the floors for good shots.Also, there are tourist discounts if you print the voucher online."
Why not,"It was our first time visiting this place and fun it amusing. The pictures were funny and we,made some good memories."
Kids Enjoy The Trick Eye Museum,"The museum consists of many backdrops where visitors can pose and in photographs it will look like they are floating on a magic carpet or in the mouth of a giant fish. The kids (ages 8 and 11) thought it was hilarious, but it was sort of expensive."
Lots and Lots of Photos,If you like to take photos & post in social media then this is the place to be!!! It's a different kind of experience. 
nice,"A nice place to visit. Your ticket to the tickeye is bundled with the Ice museum ticket as well. here, it seems like you're part of the paintings. There are marked photo spots that will help you get a better shots. The also change the paintings. Most of the paintings that I saw the first time I visited the placed was replaced with a new one and also, they have added some interactive activities as well. "
So so if compare to Singapore's Trick eye Museum,"I am surprise to see this museum is quite small if compare to Singapore's, One very significant different is there is an adult trick eye museum beside it, only for 18+, other than that I would prefer Singapore's one, there are bigger and more.However children will love this. Inside there are still a lot of funs.Outside the trick eye museum is a shopping street, lots of thing on sales."
Craaazy !,This was one of my dreams to see in soul. The art scene is so hard to find or originate the pieces because they always steal everything but this place is original
Not that great..,"Considering the high rating and feedback for Trickeye Museum I was definitely disappointed. Once you have paid and get in and see what it's all about, you just have to make the most of it. 30,000 won for 2 adults to walk around and take silly photos for 20 minutes was just a bit too much for us. I can see that this may be a fun thing for those with children but then perhaps the art isn't suited towards children necessarily. I personally do not recommend this attraction. "
Creative & Imaginative,Visitors are able to express their imagination by being a photographer taking the most creative photographs or become an object of a realistic masterpiece.
Strike your pose!,"You will be surprise how creative you can be to have your photo taken... this doesn't apply to kids but also to granny! I can see almost every visitors will try their very best to pose for their picture to be taken... and most of the expressions are really creative!.Ice Museum is about -10deg inside and there is a slide made of ice where the kids will not get tired nor they will feel cold as they run up again to slide down... excitement and running up the ice-stairs keep them warm :)Nonetheless, do note that they do not allow re-entry for both Trickeye and Ice Museum."
Fun!,"It's not usually my thing to pose in this quirky kind of way, but it is pretty cool and I had a lot of fun doing it! If you're in the right company it will definitely enhance your experience."
Tricked! 😉,"Nice gallery but few of must sees are no longer available. However, the place is well maintained and still tons of fun, specially if you are traveling with friends. Check out some discount coupons from the Korean Tourism website. "
Fun place for kids and adults,"It was really fun for my son. We went during a semi-busy time. Lots of photos and even people helped us take them. The ice museum comes with the package and also the carnival, however you get one game and then have to pay. They are rigged like most carnival games, so don't waste your money. Also, they only had one person working so it was really a bust becasue she was running around to assist with the games. Poor girl. "
Fun worth going,The package comes with ice museum too. Print out discount coupon that offer to the foreigners. Hongik university street is just nearby too
Creative Photography Templates,It was interesting and fun place to spend time with children and young couple. Essentially it is a 3-D templates that was designed such that you can use your imagination to create interesting photos. You need a creative mind to see all the angles and how it will turn out on photographs. Few samples were given but the challenge is for you to find new angles and ideas. Overall the place provides a lot of fun times with your camera and hand-phones. It is also I think better to go as group as certain props require more than 2 person to pose.
Amazing Experience,"This museum has an amazing ideas for someone to take some great photos! It was a little annoying pushing through the crowd of people to get out of the subway,but once you cross the street its all clear. You get 3 attractions for 1 price. Then if you don't have the kids with you, make sure you check out the Love Museum. A must see!"
Interesting place to visit,"It was fun. Spent a few hours, 1 floor, many rooms to see. Lots of interactive exhibits. Good for families or bored airman....15000 won ( $12) pretty good price. Once was enough to visit, but for families good to go back."
Let Your Creativity Run Wild!,"The Trickeye Museum is pretty cool. If you are in the Hongdae area, I would definitely recommend a quick visit to the Trickeye museum. This place allows for everyone to get creative and have some fun!"
Fun,"We went as a couple, which is fine, but it would probably be better with a group of people. There are a lot of pieces that need two people and we had to keep bothering others to help us take a picture. Good place to goof around and be silly. You go to the ice museum (complete with ice slide) first, which is also neat. Make sure your camera/phone is charged for lots and lots of picture taking! There is a locker that you can put all your stuff in. It's not free, but I can't remember how much it was. Just a few hundred won."
What a hit!,There is something for all ages here! Great fun! Easy to find and well worth the entrance fee. Make sure to bring a good camera and plenty of memory. Children and teens will enjoy this the most.
"Cheap fun indoor activity for friends, family","This is in the Hongdae district/neighborhood. I went with a group of friends and had a fun goofy time taking photos with the art works. Coming from a day of palaces and temples, this provided a fun night activity."
It is good for enjoying ice museum together. ,It is at Hongdae (=Hongik University street) and togethet with Ice Museum. You can enjoy the funny picture which you shoot. After the photo the picture looks funny because of the illusion. Good to enjoy indoor. :) 
Fun Fun Fun,"As soon as Got in the museum, you can see loads of people with big smile and laughter on their faces, definitely recommend to people who are seeking for good time!! "
A good bit of fun,Went here in the late evening about an hour before they closed. It was very quiet which made it easier to take the pictures we wanted to take. I would recommend a visit if you have the time and funds but not a necessary stop in Seoul.
Fun for all ages,Amazing art and so fun. Best stop in Korea for some unwinding. Bring a camera and prepare for some laughs!!!
Childhish place,"Many recommended this place but I found it fairly childish.Some of the tricks are a little funny, but most are either silly , or rude, or simply boring.I ended up walking through the place fairly quickly.Not recommended."
Awesome!!!,If you are in the seoul area and want a quick laugh with friends or family... this is definitely a fun place to check out sober or not!!!
"If Eyes Were Made for Seeing, Then Seeing Is Not Believing !",A good place to experiment with your photography and test your creativity. One has to invest a few minutes in order to compose a shot that will look so real when viewed on the screen.
Fun for the whole family,"Just a joyful place with lots of to try. Don't forget to bring your camera with you. It could be adviceable to prepare for a cold...very cold experience, too...if one likes to do a visit."
Fun Museum,"The name says it all, definitely bring your camera as you will become a part of the ""trick eye"" artwork. Very fun place to be, entry was 15000 won (ice museum included as well)"
Really good for min. 2 people,"Went to the museum alone and initially it was difficult to experience the museum without people taking photos of you as that is the main point. Luckily managed to find some people to go together with, which helped a lot.The images are very innovative and it was great fun!"
Rainy day fun in Seoul!,"Great place to kill a few hours in a trendy college neighborhood. Take your camera and have some fun with the backgrounds and props. When you've had enough inside, stroll through the neighborhood shops and look for trendy, inexpensive items or duck into one of the many cafes and restaurants for a delicious meal."
"Fun, Fun, Fun","You should come here to break up the stress brought on by shopping, shopping, shopping which is what most tourist end up doing in Seoul. This is a fun escape that gets everyone, no matter what age, into the act. You can just take photos of recommended poses by the museum at each station or use you imagination to create new ones. Everyone is smiling and laughing inside this museum and I'm sure you would end up doing the same. Highly recommended...."
Fun museum if you've got a few hours to kill,"Although I probably wouldn't visit the museum again, it was certainly a fun way to spend a couple of hours in Seoul. There's around 20 exhibits on display for you to interact with. Some are really great while others are just so-so. Your ticket will also include admission to the Ice Museum which is a fun little side-trip in itself. "
Great place to visit..,"Was taken by my customer whilst in the area during my recent business trip to Korea, well worth the visit if you happen to be in the area!"
Lots of fun,"Nicely designed place not too big, lots of interesting props that you want to be pictured in. You must go in without an hang ups to enjoy, I suppose the young would enjoy very much but me at 61 together with my Wife also enjoyed it too."
Entertaining!,"We found this activity hugely entertaining. For a $15 fee you walk around and take unusual and funny pics of your friends. This is not an activity for a lonely traveler. The streets around are lively with the students, shops and restaurants. "
Fun,Something fun to do and take pictures. They have amazing artwork ❤ make sure to take your time to look around. They also have an Ice museum make sure you wear warm clothes as it is very cold. 
Don't forget your camera!,"Lots of fun with optical illusions. Get creative. Lots of laughter involved..Most importantly, don't forget your camera!"
Great place to visit with kids or a first date.,"The kids had a blast and so did we. Take your time and get the photos/shots right. Make it fun. It will be a photo opportunity that you will never get again, and you will share them forever. Be creative, dont just do what the given opportunity provides... improvise and have fun."
Quite dissapointing,"When we reached, saw a banner stated that this is one of the most recommended attractions in trip advisor (if I am not mistaken). However, I am quite disappointed cause there is not much pictures. Not sure why. Maybe we took short way. And there were so many people at that time. I rather spend the money to go to other places."
Interesting and fun pictures,"This museum was very fun for taking funny photos! Don't go there on your own, take someone with you or with bunch of friends :) There was also ice museum inside"
Small but awesome.,"I have not be to a trickeye museum before and we loved it. Really fun and there is a small ice museum at the location, included in the ticket, which is worth a visit. There are different rooms so if one is not quite up your thing another will be. It is a little hard to find but most hostels and hotels have promotional leaflets with a very clear map on. The outside is clearly marked."
Amaze 3D,Super awesome museum. We weren't sure what it was when we got the ticket for Seoul Tower. We didn't really get it until we realized you take photos. We saw the camera signs and realized what to do and then we had a blast. They should have staff provide some sort of explanation in English. 
Fun and Cute,"This is a museum which is easy to find (located in Hongdae) and you can spend hours inside it.Apart from Trickeye, you can also visit the Love Museum (B1, just above Trickeye which is at B2) - but this is for adults only as it is a sexual theme museum."
Only if it's your first time,"The 3D museum is in an out of the way, hard to find area but if it's your first time to the 3D museum, it may still be worth the trip. I had fun though."
great fun,"Do you need a fun activity to keep the kids occupied, or are you looking for a fun thing to do with friends? The Trickeye museum is a great place to do both. The museum has many interactive pieces that allow you to interact with art and become a part of it. "
Good trick,"Trick Eye uses an art technique called Trompe-l’oeil (Trick of the eye). It turns two-dimensional paintings into three-dimensional images through the use of optical illusions, in other words, 2D paintings on the museum walls, floors and ceilings appear to step out of the surface and come to life. "
Trick you Eye,I was dragged here by my friends who are crazy about taking photos. The experience was nice and you have to be a bit creative to be in the picture.
Great museum for photos!,"This was a funny museum. Great for solo photos or with friends. Make sure you bring your selfie stick if you plan to visit alone. Included with the Trickeye museum ticket, they included a free admission into the ice museum which was pretty COOL (pun intended). Make sure you have at least a jacket on before you enter the ice museum otherwise you'll rushing to leave. They have an ice slide inside which was fun but make sure you use the butt pad before you slide down to avoid injuries. "
Need more than 2 person,Go as group of 3 or more as many things you meed the third person to shoot camera for the other two. One of the nice places in seoul one of the must to be seen.
Snap happy,"Time to get interactive at this museum. Silly, fun scenes to take photos with. Quite imaginative. Based at the artist village just outside the city. Nice spot."
"A lot of pics, a lot of laughs","I LOVEDDddddd this museum. I took so many cool photos, got creative and laughed a lot. Got tired too of taking so many photos. There are two things you have to remember though: make sure you take a map when finding the place since its location is kinda hard to find specially if you don't speak Korean. Also, make sure to go there during the week. I heard weekends are crowded and you will have a hard time taking photos since it is a small museum anyway. But it worths the money. Definitely recommend it. They gave us coupons for restaurants near there too!"
Trickeye Museum in Hongdae,"Busy on weekends, but nice in the summer since theres an Ice Museum component. Its a fun alternative to historical sights in Seoul. I think it costs about $15 and took about an hour or so to go through!"
"Photo mania and selfier should come , recommended.","First time for this kind of museum, one of a funny moment for selfier and photo mania person. I liked this place very much.They had artist who drew your picture. I had family pencil drawing in cartoon style here."
Pose and take photos!,Mind tricks! The museum made use of parallelax errors and tricks on the minds! It was a fun day posing and taking photos!
Lots of Fun! Worth Visit!,It's my second time to visit Trick Eye. I have been to Trick Eye's hong kong branch before. The museum is an ideal place for photos and creating memories with friends and family. Good Artwork quality! 
AWESOME!!!!,We had an absolute blast at the museum!!! It was a highlight of our trip for sure. You could spend hours there. The museum has 2 parts (trick eye and ice). You should definitely bring a camera!SO GLAD WE WENT!!! We have some amazing pictures 
Do not miss this place!,"This was one of the highlight of our trip. We had so much fun, we laughed our heads off. Use your imagination for your poses. Definitely not kid friendly. some objects are PG 18."
Poorly maintained. Not at all interesting ,You can take a few interesting photos. But overall this museum is in desperate need of an update. you walk through the whole thing in about 10 minutes. We were surprised it was over so quickly. Carnival was poorly maintained.. Lots of the games were broken. Ice museum is cool though!
Awesome photo taking experience,Went with my friends when we visited Hongade. Really fun place. And the photos are just hilarious. Nice place to hang out with friends.
Fun and different,It's a fun and creative museum that is geared more towards teens and young adults. It's a great place to visit for anyone who wants to take amazing photos.The only downside is that the museum may be quite crowded.
Tricky photos at trick eye! ,I heard so much about this place before and i finally had a chance to visit last month! It was absolutely amazing :-) i had so much fun taking photos and enjoyed showing off these photos to my friends afterwards. Strongly recommend for those who are planning to go to hongdae/ seoul! 
Fun and silly! Go early.,"This is a fun museum that we enjoyed taking pictures of ourselves throughout with our two daughters, ages 20 and 22. Our recommendation is to go very early. We seemed to have the place to ourselves, but noticed crowds as we were leaving.We were there on August 19, 2015 when Korean schools were still on summer break. In addition to the photos/art that you can become part of, they had a very cold room with sculptures, furniture, and very fast slides all made of ice!"
Go in the evening during the week to avoid busy times,It's way more fun when you don't need to wait a long time for each picture. It's a very fun place if you're willing to be silly. 
Very funny place!,Amazing place to visit with friends. You will certainly take great and funny photos! Take a long time (2~3 hours) to enjoy each part of the museum.
This is for children not adults!,"Totally crowded, not a fun place for adults at all (and we are not old and are up for a laugh) but the obsession with technology in this country causes selfie mania and it makes it impossible to enjoy this. Its for children, we couldn't understand why it would be marketed at adults!"
Not that suprised,"In my eye, it is not that suprised. My fiance had a good time but I am not. I have seen few times before in internet. It was very similar."
Not a good place.,"I think I wasted my time being there. Some people say it is funny, but I found it creepy. Adult and such things should not be a part of museum I think"
Would be great if the Staff did remind me about their change of setting,"It was not an enjoyable experience as they were changing the props when I went there, and the staff did not remind me that they are changing the setting, which makes me feel not worthwhile to pay for the entrance fee but didn't see much well-set props."
More interesting than I had expected,"I had no plan to visit this museum before this trip but it turned out to be more interesting than I had expected. There were lots of trick-eye photos and hours easily passed. Would recommend this attraction to families with children and teens, a group of friends as well as couples.We also got free entry to the Ice Museum. The Ice Museum was just a tiny room with a few ice sculptures and a slide."
Nice Break from Touristy Spots!,"This was a nice break from going around to all the touristy spots in Seoul. Granted, there are a lot of tourists who come to this museum, it was nice to just relax and have some fun taking silly photos! We picked up a flyer for the museum at one of the information centers around Seoul, which gave us a little discount. The ticket included entrance to the Ice Museum (Same building), which was cool too (but very cold!). Here's the best part - we thought this place was randomly in the middle of nowhere... only to realize afterward we were right next to Hongdae Collegetown, which is FILLED with awesome street vendors (food, clothes, accessories, etc.) as well as bunch of restaurants, cosmetic shops, clubs, and bars! So be sure to check it out!"
Hmm,"This is small museum, if you have 15000₩ just laying around somewhere and 5 minutes to spare this is the place to be. Not very much interesting stuff. "
Worth the experience,I really enjoyed the creativity of this museum and don't think I've had this much fun taking photos! Very fun place to experience and I had lots of laughs with my cousin. We spent about 2-3 hours weaving around the museum which would probably take longer if you took photos with every picture/background. We also went on a weekday afternoon so it wasn't that busy and didn't have to wait much. I would suggest going with at least 2 other people so there's always someone to take photos for you and for anyone with long hair to have it tied up or you'll give away a few shots. 
Expensive entry ticket,"The museum offered a trick of 3-D photography for any photography lovers. It is located inside a building, not in a stand-alone building. However the entry ticket was quite expensive compare to the 3-D photos that you would get"
