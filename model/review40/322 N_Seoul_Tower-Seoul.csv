Must see ,The hike up the park alone was amazing although there are many ways to get to the base including a very scenic cable car. It was so unexpected with interactive virtual reality and light shows before you even get to a 360 spectacular view of Seoul. If you don’t do anything else do the Tower. The price wasn’t bad and using a Visa card we received a few dollars off 
Its quite a hike,We went there upon arrival so we not dat familiar with the subway and bus - we kinda took the wrong route but ended up at the entrance near the library. It is quite a hike to go up so we wud recommend you to take the shuttle bus no. 3 or 5 which wud bring you up to the tower It is true that the best view wud b at night but you wud want to be there before the sun goes down for photo purposes. We took the bus to myeongdong after our trip to namsan. 
Fantastic views,I have seen this tower so many times in dramas and couldn’t wait to see it in person. I was not disappointed. The fabulous views from the top were amazing. The locks and hearts were just as I imagined. I’m so happy I got to experience this.
Brilliant views - no need to pay to go higher,"We got off the hop on, hop off bus at this stop on a whim and had a brilliant visit here. We spent a good two hours wandering around and taking pictures of the fantastic views over the city. We didn’t bother to get tickets to go up the upper tower as the views would only have been more distant. We did however take a return trip on the Namsan Cable Car and got some good views from that. A very worthwhile visit. Unfortunately we weren't able to visit at night to see the skyline lit up but I'm sure it would have been brilliant."
Enjoyed the visit,"N Seoul Tower was on our list during our travel.Usually people recommend to go Seoul tower during evenings to watch City's neon lights.But due to time constraint,we went there in the morning.We took cab till foot of the hill.From there we chave chosen Hiking.You can also go through cable car but we captured many awesome pics during our hike.It was easy and took around 1 hour for us to reach there.We just went to foot of the tower and returned through cable car as it was difficut for my 4 yr old son to hike down.Pricing is as below₩7000/pax- 1way₩4500/child-1 way₩9500/pax-2way₩6500/child-2way"
Iconic Namsan Tower,"I visit towers in every city I travel to, so Seoul was no different. However, it took a lot of effort to get up there. The easiest way is to take the metro to Myeongdong station, walk 10-15 minutes to the Namsan Oreumi elevator to get to the cable car station. Even once you get off the cable car, there are about 100+ stairs to climb. There are separate entry tickets for the cable car and the tower. Get there before sunset, to get great day and night views of the surrounding city."
Observatory Tower with great view of Seoul,"Perched on a hill accessible only by a town bus or the cable car, this provides a great view of the city of Seoul!We went by cable car - and it was easy and fuss free. Climbing up the stairs you’d be greeted by a stall selling snacks. Try out the soup fish cakes... divine especially in cold weather. A little further up you will see the locks and love messages... there the Hawkeyed would Spy “abandoned” phone cases but these have handwritten (presumably love) notes scrawled in permanent ink... we didn’t get a chance to do this ☺️. Perhaps next round! We purposely chose to go up later in the day just to see Seoul’s night light. If you are the sort who’d like to spot landmarks, please go before sundown. Layout is very much like the observatory tower in Shanghai though! A good experience all in all! "
Great view,"We brought an infant in stroller and it was smooth to go to the tower through the cable car. However, as we had reserved ticket to the top of observation there was no way for ppl with stroller and ppl said it was repaired so the only way we had to use the stairs which was ridiculous and we had to miss the opportunity and the ticket to go to the top."
Great on a clear day.,"It was only about $10 to go to the top of the tower. You get a great view, you will see just how huge the city is. You have to check out the urinals in the Mens' room! The best standing view ever!Make sure that you take a bus up the hill. It's a long walk uphill if you don't!!"
A good afternoon out,The view from the top of the tower is spectacular. The walk down is pleasant and provides more views. Once down continue to the market
good time in the morning,"visited this place before but didn’t appreciated it much because too many people and long lines.. but this visit is so magical, 10am just about it opens, you can appreciate the place and better view, weather also cooperated, bright and clear sky even at a very cold temperature of -4C "
Loved it,Honestly loved everything about this place..N-seoul Tower is probably the most beautiful place ive been and I live in NEW ZEALAND..Seoul is my favorite country 
Exciting!!,We had a beautiful day here. You could see the whole city from the top. It has super clean restrooms too.
Great View,"The tower offered great views of Seoul, even though it was a smoggy day. Ticketing was easy and relatively inexpensive.Just a warning, we used a bus to get here, and it was a pretty steep (though short) hill to climb from the bus stop to the tower "
Great View of the City,"Great place to have a 360 view of the city. There is usually a long wait so depending on when you get there, you might have to get a ticket and you'll be told the time you can go up."
Up and away,Good place to visit.Suggest a taxi to the cable car station for a great view over Seoul.Just be aware that if you have anyone affected by flashing lights they might not want to go up the tower.Good post office selling postcards and stamps plus you can mail right away. Remember in SE Asia you have to use the glue stick provided to affix the stamp to the card!Enjoyed our visit and the views.
Expected more...,"Well, it’s a landmark and yes you should see it but I felt a bit let down as I expected more... it’s not bad, but surprisingly little things to see or do for the schlepp...."
Very beautiful in autumn!,"We took a ride till the tower. It cost 7000 won for one way and 9500 won for round way, but we had to wait about 45 min for a ride, so if you can, just walk there. The way up ist beautiful. The tower stands in the middle of the park, so you can enjoy amazing view. Sometimes there also performances and we saw one with traditional warriors of Joseon - was a surprise for us. Totally worth it!"
Sunset is best ,Make sure you get here around 5pm so you can see the sunset! I walked up here via the extensive paths around the park
"A little hokey, great views! ","We stopped here as part of a tour, so we had our own usher who guided us to the elevators. The grounds are pleasant and parts of the old city wall can be seen in various places. The light show at the elevator was a bit much. The top floor with all the windows was filled with souvenir shops. Great views of the city, however "
Nice scenery,Cool weather and very nice scenery at night at the top of the tower.There is a Japanese restaurant which serve nice and delicious foods too.
Nice scenery but tiring walking,"It is better to use cable car to go up there because walking is not suitable for OKU, old folks less exercise people. The way to reach N Seoul Tower is too deep.Unfortunately, the day i reached N Seoul Tower, the cable car is on maintenance so we need to go up and down by foot.Luckily, the weather is good and cooling. The scenery is undoubtable and very nice.One thing that need to take note is to reach the observatory floor, there is only one lift and the only way to go there. Please queue at the right floor as we experienced queueing at 2 floors but the lift isnt stop and always full. To advise, just wait at ground floor. The love locks area is full and we decided not to lock because seems no empty space to put on it.The view from top is very good, worth to pay a visit."
"Great view when taking the cable car to the top, even better view from the N Seoul Tower","Rode the cable car to the top, fun ride and such lovely view. the N Seoul Tower experience was even better, unbelievable view and a great experience. Took the seoul city tour package"
Favorite Stop in Seoul,We stopped here as part of the hop on/hop off tour so the cable car and trip to the top was included. I recommend doing all of it! The views were stunning. We travelled with a toddler and she also loved it. 
Good view of city,"Went up and down on the cable car and had the buffet dinner. Went at dusk so got to see the night lights too.My hubby likes towers so every city we go to, we go up any tall building that allows us to. Lotte tower was another good one."
Worth your time,Had a great time on a not bad day when visibility was okay. Lots of walking even with a lift to the station then cable ride to to the tower. Buy or bring couples lock and add to the collection.
Sight Seeing,"I went twice during the trip, one night trip for buffet dinner and food is not bad and view is awesome. One day trip close to sunset. Both day and night trip is awesome and I love the view and Seoul is under your leg. Do not miss this scenery."
Worth a visit and cheap ,"Very cheap to go up and worth it. We walked up (more strenuous than you think!) in about an hour, and got the cable car down. "
Excellent Views All Around ,The views from the tower were excellent on a bright sunny autumn day.... ! The elevator ride took less tha 15 seconds to the top. There is also a Hello Kitty outlet and walkabout at the lower level...
wonder view of the city,"Not far from metro, a quite place in the city. good for slow walk to the cable car to the top of the mountain. Wonderful view of the city from the view. Worth visiting and the price is reasonable."
Great for those who love the outdoors ,"This is a great place to go if you love to walk and don’t mind a little steep hike. Once you get to the top the view is amazing! They’ve got food and beverages at the top so don’t be too worried about that.. chicken and beer and coffee of course. Inside the north tower there are also restaurants however, they are very expensive. Once at the top of the north tower you get a beautiful view with clear windows that go around in a circle that also includes a candy shop and a place to write and send post cards. Interesting yet fun fact, the restrooms in the top of the north tower have glass walls! Yes , you’re read correctly! Glass walls. So you’re doing your business as you enjoy the view! On a nice day this is a fantastic place to visit. "
Pleasant landmark but know when and how to visit,"Background: get all your information from the N Seoul Tower website. Gettting there: most convenient is to catch the shuttle buses described in the website. They drive a circular route, so if you catch it at the beginning of the circle just after it has descended from Namsan Hill, it will be quite a lengthy ride of over half an hour before you get to the top of the hill. The best part is that it terminates at the base of the Tower. All other public transportation terminates at the base of the hill. Cable car: most directions will lead you to the north base of hill where the cable car is located. It will transport you up the hill to the base of the tower. It is a pleasant ride but reputedly has long lines. If you are staying in Namdaemun or Myeongdong, it is an easy 20 or 15 minute walk respectively to here.For the mountain climbers: 1. walk up the stairs adjacent to the cable car. 2. walk up the LONG road that the shuttle buses drive up. 3. search for typically unmarked nature trails that will take you up the hillAt the base of tower: splurge and get in the VIP line by having lunch at N Grill.Best time to go: avoid the teeming masses by going at midday on a weekday.So we caught a shuttle bus on a Friday, zipped up to N Grill for lunch. Enjoyed a serene and delightful lunch with a view, then took the elevator down to the observatory for the touristy stuff. A wonderful 2 to 3 hours. Thereafter walked down the steps, continued north which dropped us right into Myeondong."
Absolutely fantastic view! A must see!,"Like many other big cities, Seoul also has its own Tower, and the view from the top is fantastic. As in other places, such as the Tower Eiffel in France, you first travel to an intermediary platform about half of the height of the tower and then you take an elevator to the upper floor. There were lots of people but going up and down is very well organized. Upstairs there are shops, the same as in many other towers."
Beware of the steps,"We went up the tower and have a look at the love locks. While looking around, I failed to see a 15 cm step down which caused me to fall down. So always look down as well while you are enjoying the view!"
Tower,"Long queues and poor visibility due to the weather, a far better viewing platform can be found at Lotte World Tower."
Worth A Visit Even With Limited Time,"I took a night tour bus to here and we only had 30 minutes to take pictures at this place. I was not able to get to the top of the tower because of the time limit, however, the view I did see was fabulous. The mountain is steep and it is best to walk up it slowly if you aren't used to walking up mountains. Though I had no time to get to the top, I enjoyed the view I could see. There are many tourists on this mountain and everybody is camera and selfie happy, so you may have to wait to take photos at different sites. This was worth coming too, even if you cannot make it to the top. "
Beautiful,Can enjoy beautuful whole seoul city view!recommend for evening time . but verrryyyyy long waiting line for cable car ticket(almost one hour). 
Great views but a bit tacky,"We visited on a Sunday morning and there were pretty long queues for the cable car so took a while to get up. Queues were small to get up and down the tower though. There are great views of Seoul from the tower, but the whole experience is a bit tacky with lots of food outlets & souvenir shops around the base, plus all the locks on the fences.Enjoyed seeing the beehive beacons and city wall, and the wishing pig. Also the rainbow ice creams are lovely."
Night time adventure ,"I went after dark to see the lights. The Seoul skyline is impressive. There are some food shops in the observation desk, candy, gift shop etc.There is a pretty long line coming down so be prepared to wait.We took the cable car up and back. At times they jam 40 people in the cars depending on the day so if you hate being a sardine, wait .Overall, worthwhile trip."
Must see place,"More than the tower itself, how to get to the top is the most interesting part. Based on what you prefer, you can do a 3.5 K rolling hill walk, combination of flat walk with some decent hikes - some through steps and rest through single lane path, series of steps all the way to the top or take the cable car to the top. If you are staying nearby, good area to go for a morning walk or a run"
What a lovely place,"There are so many ""LOVE"" lock place everywhere down the Tower, make u feel full of love before go up to the Tower. I like to pick candies and sit inside the tower to enjoy the view. I prefer go there before 3:00p.m. otherwise you needed to line up to get uphill by cable car."
Great views and shows,My family enjoyed going up on the tower and seeing the views and the also the interesting exhibits inside the tower. My kids particularly liked the cable car that took us up to the tower and also the shows outside the Tower. They had a sword show and a talent show. 
AMAZING tower,It's an amazing tower in SeoulYou can see all Seoul from the topNice places ther is restaurant and coffee shop
Excellent,"You have a very beautiful view from the tower . It 's a magical feeling to be so high in the sky with al the clouds. The view of the city is very beautiful. It gives you the feeling to stay for a very long time up there. The more than a million love locks there, shows the amount of visitors going to the tower. A number one, must see for everyone visiting Seoul ."
Nice view from tower,Took a bus from Seoul station to tower. Must visit place in Seoul as you can have the 360 degrees whole city view. Bought ticket from klook and redeem it at kiosk outside the entrance with ease. 
N seoul tower,Best is go there in the night. And I alway stay at Myeongdong area and make sure that my hostel or guesthouse can see N Seoul tower view :)
A fun morning out,"I had tried to go to N Seoul Tower on a Sunday and the queue was so long it would have taken at least 2 hours to get up, plus it was rainy. Instead I went back the next day and not only was it better weather and almost no queue, but they didn’t make me buy a new ticket and even offered to refund my ticket from the previous day. I went up the little elevator to the cable car, where there was free entertainment I did not expect to see. From there I visited the Hello Kitty museum which is small but so cute. Then I got in the elevator to the top of the tower. There are cool projections on the way up, making it feel like you’re shouting into space. The view from the tower is incredible.A super fun day out, and really reasonably priced."
"Great view of Seoul, beautiful way up","Namsang tower is a great experience, from the cable car drive to the walkways with thousands of ""love-locks"" and the stunning view from the top.We find the view late afternoon is the most beautiful, and no need to pay to get to the top of the tower."
It Was part of my tour,"Its better for me, take the hop of hop off, so they in a way explained historic places, the other just take you at their time, at the end goes to a natural antiaging shop "
Essential,"Well worth it. Awesome views!A short walk from Myeongdong, where I stayed. I took the cable car up and walked down."
Beautiful view,"Was a good relaxing environment to catch sunset, they have different areas to enjoy the attraction. There were gift shops restaurants... we enjoyed the candy shop at the observation deck"
Total waste of time (lots of time!) ,"Huge disappointment.Went to the cablecart to get there but it was closed due to strong winds (s**t happens) so we had to take the bus.The line for the bus was massive, took 60min of waiting.After the bus drive headed to the tower, took the elevator up, collected our tickets and was informed that there was another 40min wait before we could take the elevator up to the observation deck.After the 40min wait you take the elevator up to a room with 360 projectors showing random animated movies on the walls, to distract you from the 30min addition waiting time here.When you finally reach the observation deck, you can barely see out the windows as the lights from all the souvenir shops there are reflecting in the glass.As a result of this the windows were full of finger prints and nose prints from people trying to see anything, and the windows weren't cleaned.After this disappointing experience we decided to head out again, only to find another 30min wait to get down! Summary of time waste:Bus 60minEntrance. 40minEntrance 2 30minExit 20minSpend your time on something else. "
Seoul Icon,"Nice walk up the hill. Good scenary. Visit the Ryan cheese ride, taking cute bear photos. and Hello Kitty Island also. Lots of peoples."
AT THE TOP of Seoul,"The hiking till the tower is absolutely worth it.Once you reach the top there are several shops and resturants, typical stuff for turist.I really advice to pay the fee to go at the top floor of the Tower!! Beautiful experience."
Tourist trap?,"Every travel guide to Seoul recommends you to visit the N Seoul Tower, but after queuing up in the long lines to take the cable car up, you are faced with another long queue and expensive tickets to head up to the observatory. Way too crowded and too much lights from the sign to get a nice night view of the city. You can give it a miss if you have other things to do on your itinerary."
A very nice place to visit,I went during the day so I could see the area clearly. The views were very good and the windows on the observation deck showed what major city was in that direction and how far the distance is from there.
Spectacular view,"One can walkdown,by bus or cable way to reach to the bottom of tower.the surrounding is natural,picturesque.Observatory desk not too high and view also not clear.The speciality is one can bind a lock to the fencing and take photos.But its not a big tower than shanghai,tokyo,sydney and burgkhalifa of dubai."
Night time,"I went at night time and bought a 1 way ride to N tower, there was a kpop band doing a concert their which you got to watch for free, the views of seoul at night were amazing. If you give during the day you can enjoy the park aswell. There is loads to do at N tower. The walk back was stunning. Just be careful on some of the stairs as they are close together"
Fabulous view,Do go there if you get the chance! The drive to the top of the hill is through a beautiful park.Cars have to park at the bottom but buses are allowed to drive three quarters of the way up.There is a steep climb at the end but well worth it! You are taken into a room with a picture of cars travelling along on the floor which was quite spectacular.The ride in the lift up to the top was spectacular with a visual experience.Outstanding views at the top with great photo opportunities. Loved it.
Seoul must visit destination ,Awesome location and must visit activity. Go there prior sunset and stay there until sunsets to view sunset
Trust the bus announcement,"we follow google maps. and we missed the stop. better listen to the announcement in the bus. since we missed the stop we walked to the Namsan Library. From Namsan library we chosed to walk steep 1,6 km..not to hard in autumn since the cool temperature. it was beautiful and crowded especially during the sunset time.everything trying to find the perfect spot for taking video/ pictures during sunset. there are some cafes down there, food not bad but the service is quite long. Going down no problem there were some busses that would take us downtown."
What a disappointment!,"We're not gonna complain about the hours it took to get to the observatory because had it been a good experience we would've forgot about the hasssle; but it was not! Once we reached the observatory, we couldn't enjoy the view as the reflection of the food and drinks' station light on the windows ruined the view let alone how dirty the windows were! AVOID!"
Could be better,"Too many lines. No sign posts. View of city was not clear since the glass was reflective. The view from nearby Signeol Seoul was much much better. If in Seoul, one could consider going to tick off the list but this one's quite average."
Great view,"Was a big walk up, we chose not to take the sky lift, take plenty of water and good shoes. Its doable though and worth the good work out. Great views by the time you get to the top the tower is more like a lighthouse, so don't be worried if issues with heights. Beautiful views, worth seeing!"
Great views of the city,"The tower gives a great opportunity for fantastic views over the city. Even at base level the views are great but the 360 view from the observatory is better. However, its not the cheapest of venues to visit - so make sure its a clear day, else it's an expansive cloud view.There ate various floors of food stalls & kid activities"
Namsam Tower in Seoul,"Namsam tower is a must go not only for locals but visitors alike, especially I you're looking for a romantic scenery. Although it can get a bit crowded sometime, it is well worth the travel at least once in your life. It's not only for couples so don't feel left out if you are alone. If you are a couple, bring a lock with you to ""secure"" your love on a rail fence at the top. My suggestion is to go right before sunset instead of daytime, the city lights is very beautiful so you can observe both day and night while you're up there."
Lots to do,"Lots of development around the tower over the past several years. My favorite way to get there is walking one of the many paths through the woods. I get lost every time I go so I will not try to give directions. Other options to the tower are cable car and bus. There is are shuttle buses that regularly circle loops between popular tourist destinations - this is easy and convenient. The tower now has many little shops, restaurants, coffee shops... plenty of snacks and trinkets to buy even without buying a ticket to go up the tower. This is nice in case you are there on a cloudy day when it’s not worth the $$ to go up the tower. Also plenty of photo ops and opportunity to get a love lock or leave your cell phone cover on the fences (not sure what this is all about)... visit the hello kitty island, etc. a trip up the old radio tower is quite spectacular - they have a neat light display before the fast elevator ride to the viewing floor. On the observation floor there are signs to let you know what you are seeing, pretty amazing views on a clear day, and (of course) shops to buy snacks and souvenirs. It’s been ages since we visited the restaurants up in the tower. It was a nice experience however, limited vegetarian options and not really great for little children. Overall a good place to visit, better on a clear day, wonderful to get a little exercise if you have the time and ability. Something for everyone at the tower - I would go again and absolutely bring friends/family when they come to visit. "
Namsan Seoul Tower,"Arrived at cable car station only to find it was cancelled due to winds. Advised to take a No.2 bus to tower, but could not find it. Decided to take short cut up the steps!. Ascended with sensible pace and forced stops !! Bought tickets and lift to top floor.The 360 view was breathtaking of Seoul, had enjoyable refreshments and returned to base after an hour.We went on a Sunday pm , no queues and all staff very helpful."
Waste of time,We spend lots of time waiting in line to go up and even more to go down. The view from the bottom of the tower were maybe even better than from the top. Really overrated site. 
Love the tower grounds,Even before you go up to the tower the surrounding grounds look pretty. Lots of selfie time with beautiful backgrounds. The love locks area..the love archway when lighted up. Go there during the evening time and you can have both the day and night time photos. A few eateries like mainly drinks...snacks..cafes..can be found there. View from the TOP of tower was so so to me..but the elevator ride up there was swift and interesting because you were asked to look up to view the show about the tower I think..think it was done so you will be distracted and not feel nauseous when climbing up at a speed to the TOP floor.
Impressive with great views of Seoul,"Recommend coming here in the evening for a great view of Seoul lit up. I didn't go on the observation deck, but managed to get good views of the city from down below. There are a few reasonably priced restaurants on the lower floors of the tower. Bus no 2 goes here from the Chungmuru area."
Great view,As usual the tower Is a must if you wish to see the city from the top.Great view and location around is also interesting.
Brilliant views,"One of the best viewing platforms in Seoul. Only costs around £4 compared to £16 at Seoul's Sky. Although the observation deck is lower the view is much more beautiful than Seoul sky and you can see all the sky scrappers which are especially nice during dusk and at night when everything lights up and there is an outdoor observatory too. Forget Seoul Sky, do this instead.Recommended"
"Good, but oh-so-crowded","Well, you gotta do it when in Seoul, right? Trouble is, everyone else had the same idea, so it was 'rammed' at the top. Terrific view, though, as you'd expect, although the glare from the gift shops reflects a bit too much on the windows at night-time, spoiling photos a little. I'm glad we went; but it was just ok, and didn't 'wow'-me."
Wow cool place ,Very good to visit but if possible avoid of the weekend as it can get quite busy. Be prepared to wait for at least 1 hour in the line each way. 
Freezing...,Too bad that we were not able to go inside the tower itself only a distance from it since it was too cold. We were just at a village tourist attraction down below. It looks nice from afar.
Hike of Hell! Take the cable car.,"We made the mistake of trusting Google Maps to get up to the tower. It took us to no man's land and our curvaceous Tongan bodies had to hike up the mountain certain someone would have a heart attack on the way. Though it seemed like a bad idea, once we finally got up the mountain we felt like Rocky Balboa or that we had conquered the world and we got much needed exercise. The view on the Sky Tower was as expected however the highlight were the toilets with a view. Wish I had needed to go at the time because that would've been a memorable 1."
A Tower versus Lovers Padlocks,"It is a tower located on the hillside, you need to take a cable to go to the hill top, you need to walk around the square where you will see lots of padlocks. But, you have to pay for 11,000 won to go up the observatory to see the whole country view. You can also have a meal at the top before you come down. "
Namsan Park,"We were there on a Korean holiday so it was very crowded. So much so, the line was too long to up up into the tower. We went by cart as far as we could and walked around Namsan Park. Even from there buildings below looked liked a ""Legoland"". Great perspective of the highly populated, dense city."
N seoul tower !!,"There are 2 ways to visit N seoul tower, by cable car or to hike up. My siblings and i decided to hike up as the cable car waiting time was 1 hour. It was a long hike with stairs and its tiring. So I recommend to take the cable car if you are with kids or if you dont plan to exercise N seoul tower itself was nice, the view was great !! its mostly just enjoying the view and also chilling around that area ! So if you love looking at the views and take photographs then this is for you otherwise there’s nothing much to do."
A nice getaway from the busy city,The view of Seoul city is beautiful to see from this place. I recommend to come here by sunset. There is an area where you can leave locks of love so don't forget to bring your own locks and write a message if you'd like to leave one. There are also shops and food shops. It's easy to get there by bus as well. 
"A must do, on certain nights expect to wait","Seoul Tower is iconic, it is a must do attraction while in Seoul. One thing to keep in mind is if you go on a Saturday night and do not make a reservation at their top tier, expensive restaurant you will wait a while to go to the top. When we bought our tickets it was going to be a 50 minute wait until they called our ""boarding number"" after the 50 minutes our boarding number was called and we were escorted into a light show room to get in another line and wait. Once we got to the end of that line you're escorted into another room to wait in another line. I thought we were being punked. Then we finally got to the elevator to go to the top. We did eat at the lower level restaurant which was great! You order a meat and there is a buffet style of sides and other meats cooked to Korean style perfection! If you make a reservation for the expensive restaurant you don't have to pay the fee to go up, as it is included in your meal price and you are fast passed through to the elevator.To leave the tower it was a 20+ minute wait as well. Overall it's a must see sight but go on less crowded times to ensure maximum fun!"
Namsam Seoul Tower,"Make sure and scout out the hot spot times. I went at a very busy time and the hours spent waiting to get to the look out, not the observatory tower, was excruciating. Beautiful and worth it, nonetheless. Seoul, especially is full of lovey dovey photo ops."
Birthday trip,"Seoul North Tower was the final stop of our first day tour in Seoul. I can truly say that we were not ready for walk up the steep hill/incline/mountain (lol) to get to the tower. Of course. there’s easier way to via Tram. But we decided to be brave, it was a real workout, but worth it. Our guide took care of tickets and other requirements for us to get into the Tower. What an amazing view. What was most noticeable to us was the cleanliness of the place. Well maintained (in comparison to my experience at the Tower in Paris). Although, it was crowded, walking around was easy. An highlight for me was the toilets in Tower. Our guide suggested that we should see it even we didn’t want to use it. (Pic below). There also other attractions on the grounds of the Tower as well. Well worth a visit, but be sure you are rested and ready to take it all in, ( they do have comfortable sitting areas). We spent approximately 1hour and saw most it had to offer."
Spectacular View 🎋♨️✈️ N Seoul Tower,"♨️✈️ N Seoul TowerSituated near Mount Namsan, or Nam Mountain,nestled in Namsan Park,this was Korea’s, perhaps the first integrated transmission tower and Seoul’s first broadcasting tower. How to get there!? Well for the sporty kinds, one could hike, for the rest,one could take a bus or hail a cab to the cable car station. From the cable car station one could continue hiking up the steep hill or take the cable car and breathe in the breathtaking view of the city. Best time to visit, is late evening, so that one could capture the twinkling lights of the city below.After demounting the car, there is a walk up a few stairs to a landing with ice cream shops. The landing is indeed pretty, with cartoon characters constructed around benches and love birds locking the locks around the railing as a tribute or a promise to each other.Once you move towards the second landing or the terrace, you see a beautiful sitting area surrounded by trees and yet again you see, beautiful locks attached or lovers attaching to a padlock to the, “Locks of Love Seoul Railing”. As One could also buy heart-shaped coins to throw into the Wishing Pond in hopes of finding eternal love.The terrace has a sitting area, an eatery and a shopping center. The upper deck of the terrace has a huge heart shaped structure. You can click a romantic picture or two with it as a background.The ride up the elevator to the observatory gives you an awe inspiring panoramic,360-degree view of Seoul.The revolving restaurant and Grill at the tower’s top story without doubt gives you an imposing and magnificent view of the bejewelled sprawling city below."
Hike up the stairs,"There are a few ways of getting atop the mountain to access the tower but the ways are not really explained or marked properly including the time it will take to reach the top. This is my second time hiking up the hill. This time I took the stairs which were packed and it it is around an hour to get to the top with a multitude of breaks for taking photos. The hike is moderate but those with knee pain might find it difficult. I wish we had taken the other hike, not up the stairs but we couldn’t remember how to get to it. The views were nice and sunset beautiful. We took the cable car down. "
Not the first to visit,Not the first to visit and of course be sure that you will enjoy a clear sky otherwise you will loose the reason to go all this way up to the hill.. the breathless view of seoul...
Great View of Seoul,NSeoul Tower experience is something that a traveler should not miss when in Seoul. It gives us a breath taking 360 degree view if the Seoul metro.
Fantastic View of Seoul,A lovely way to see all the landmarks of Seoul once you reach the top. The best was before going to the top there was a 3D room with some amazing 3D animation. We were not able to enjoy and we were in a rush. I recommend you keep half a day so you could enjoy the surrounding area of the tower in the ground level.You can find the centre of Korea in the garden.
Too busy to enjoy,We planned an afternoon visit. If you are hard of walking like my partner or pregnant like myself this is not recommended. The queue to get tickets for the cable car is extremely long and in this Seoul late summer heat is was unbearable. The queue moves quickly however there is no coordination and it seems people just stand everywhere. Once tickets are bought you queue to get up to the cable car. As My boyfriend has a walking issue and I am pregnant we got the lift up however if this wasn’t the case you had to queue round the stairs of the building standing whilst waiting. The cable car itself is a nice experience if you enjoy heights and it has a nice view. Once you’re at the bottom of the tower it is equally as busy. We bought tickets to go up the tower at 6.40pm. We did not make it to the observation deck until 8.30pm.The boarding system is amongst all of the shops and cafes and it is a SHAMBLES. It’s very very very busy with very limited seating and as I say in this heat it is not enjoyable. You then queue to get to the observation deck once you have boarded and this again takes forever. Once you reach the observation deck it is just so busy you cannot enjoy the view. We spent maybe 10 mins before trying to make our way down - only to find the queue for the elevator down was roughly 45/60 mins long.Overall a wasted day.
Great view of Seoul.,Beautiful bird's eye view of the city. But the waiting time is very high. Better to visit during summer.
"Great views, lovely walk up.","Lovely walk up instead of the cable car, lots of steps but shaded through the trees, some squirrels and birds to see on the way. Great views over Seoul without going up the tower. The usual coffee and restaurants in the buildings below the tower."
Ok but not a Must visit,"We went up by cable car and when we arrived we found the whole area looked very dated. Admittedly, there are very good views from the top of the tower but we thought there are much better places to visit than here, unless you've got plenty of time in Seoul. By all means, go and have a look but ensure the sky's clear because you'd only go up there for the views, the tower itself and immediate surrounding areas are a little underwhelming, and that includes the Hello Kitty Island experience which I can only recommend if you are a die-hard Hello Kitty fan. Even for the likes of us, who find Hello Kitty quite cute, it was not worth our time."
Very beautiful at night,Best place to rest and enjoy the view of seoul. Full of light at night and many places to take photo
Great view,"We came here as part of our bus tour, so it was a quick 1 hour tour and we had to get going. Place has several coffee shops and restaurants if you have more time. The view was spectacular from above. Well worth the time. Easily spend more time if you can spare. "
Beautiful ,Overall this place are superb. We took taxi from Myeongdong to Tower. We took cable car and reach to the top. Such a beautiful place and very huge and clean. Must visit 
"Amazing views, had great fun with the family but very busy","So we recently visited the tower and I thought I might write down how we went about it and some suggestions. ---------------------------------When to go:So we visited in early August and found that the best time to to go was the evening (of course this will depend on weather and month etc) . I would suggest you arrive at the tower by 7.00pm and be on the viewing platform by 7.30pm, as by 8.00pm it will be dark. This will allow you to view Seoul during the golden hour, sunset and night (when the whole city lights up). This will probably be one of the more busier times though, so beware. If you want a less busy experience maybe go early morning or around lunch and be don't visit on a weekend but a weekday. ----------------------------How to get there:We were staying in myengdong area which conveniently had a bus that takes about 15 mins to go directly to the entrance of Seoul tower. It comes every 15 mins and costs around 1,200 won without a tcard and 1,100 with. For those staying in myengdong the bus stop is to the right of myengdong Station entrance 2. The bus you will need to catch is the no. 5. Those staying in chongmyeong can catch either the no. 2 or 5. There are other methods of getting there. You could taxi or get the train to the bottom of the park and get the cable car up. I would suggest that if you want to walk the hill/ Park area to get to the tower, that you should walk down instead of up. It is a step climb up, with quite alot of stairs and steep slopes. It would take you a good 30 mins plus to get to the top and you will be tired. -----------------------Seoul tower Park:So beneath Seoul tower is a sort of park area with a few viewing platforms, one of which is covered in love locks. I would recommend getting some of your photos group photos here. Its a little less busy and the view is almost as good. Beneath the tower there are many places to eat and shops.---------------------------Seoul towerThe tickets can be bought online and at the tower. We bought at the tower and don't encounyer much of a queue. Tickets cost 10,000 won per adult and 8000 won for children and seniors. They are open tickets which mean there are no time slots allocated. You can enter the tower when you please and stay as long as you like. There is one main viewing platform and it will be busy but the views are stunning. If you find yourself needing to get away from the hubub I would suggest you go down to the next level (sub viewing platform) and go to the toilet. Each has its own private view and the facilities are very nice. I saw quite places to eat on each level with lots of different choices e.g Italian, Korean,  Chinese etc. I don't, however, know how much it costs. -------------------Getting down:When finished there are multiple ways to get down. The bus which you took to go up, the cable car and the walk. The cable car costs 7000 per adult and takes about 10-15 mins to get down to the bottom where it will drop you off near myengodon, where you can get to myengdong Station or just walk home.However, if you are feeling up to it I would suggest walking down.  The path is well light, nicely paved with great views all the way down. It has a great view of the tower and its a nice stroll through the park area. The path is just left of the cable car when facing down the hill. I think it took us about 20 mins to get down. You will just about the reach the same area that the cable car will drop you off at. From there its a 10-15 min walk back to myengdong main street. ---------------------Worth it? I believe so but I am a sucker for a good view and a relative payed for most of the trip. I can see how it may fall flat for many as it is very busy tourist hot spot which is arguably overpriced. I believe families should see this is as one of their big nights out. I still think those on a budget should go but maybe limit there spending by walking and taking snacks up with them to eat in the park. While Seoul tower is arguably the most iconic, there are still other platforms you can choose from. Also, if you were just viewing during the day and wanted a challenge then instead of observation decks go to some of the mountains that surround the city. We went to bukhansan (1/2 day quite hard hiking) which has amazing views. Hope this helps people out. Sorry its so long, thought the detail would be good. ---------Protip:For those who do go in the evening (who are treating this like one of their big nights out) and finish the tower looking for dinner I would suggest going to woori Garden korean bbq in myengdong. Amazing stuff."
Overhyped,"N Tower has great views from the top of Namsan, yet the facilities are old, tower gets very crowded and is a little bit overpriced."
Great views!,"Great views of the city. Not as tall as the Lotte Seoul Tower, but set up on a hill which gives it almost as much of a commanding view. Several coffee shops and restaurants as well as gift shops at the tower as well. Spend an hour for a quick look around or spend longer and enjoy the view while drinking coffee or grabbing a bite to eat."
N Seoul Tower (Namsan Tower),"Not to be missed for korean drama enthusiasts! This famous landmark is seen in a lot of kdramas. It is great for a lovely stroll, date night, and sightseeing. Best to go just before sunset during the summer season to avoid the heat and to have a great sunset view. If using the cable car to get to the namsan tower grounds, get a roundtrip ticket as this will be cheaper rather than getting a one way ticket going up and then deciding to get another one way ticket on the way down. You could, if you’re trying to save money. But you would probably be too tired to hike down that you’re most likely going to end up taking the cable car on your way down again anyway. There is a separate ticket to get in to the namsan tower itself. It is not expensive so we did it. I was glad we did, as it gave us a 360 degree view of the city. It was really nice, as everything is lit up at night and you could see the view in a very colorful setting. "
Glass Floor!,What a superb view! This is the tallest building in S Korea and 5th in the world. The glass floor will give you a fright and if you are brave enough you can walk out onto the floor and have your picture taken. Looking straight down through the glass is amazing. On the floors at the base of the tower you will find restaurants. I thoroughly enjoyed this sightseeing excursion and did it at the beginning of my trip. From the observation floor you will get a 360 degree view of Seoul.
The day of the Typoon,"Despite it being extremely windy from the typoon, we still had a good visit. Amazing views. We had lunch at the restaurant which was amazing. You cant beat dining with a view like that. And for something different definitely use the toilet facilities, it's worth it. "
Worth to visit ,Great place a must to visit.. kids and adults... been to other observation decks but this was the best.
the City goes on forever,"Seoul lies out there like 30 big cities, all so close together that they've become one. Great view but it can be crowded.The view from the actual tower is impressive but you have to pay for it and the view from the bottom is just fine as well."
Worth it!,"The smooth, safe ride up, love locks, beautiful views of Seoul city, and an experience a lot like TeamLab Borderless in Japan once you go in to the tower. It's on a much smaller scale than the TeamLab Borderless one but amazing nonetheless. You will have to pay more to go up but so worth it, the observation views are gorgeous and you really get a unique view of this special city. There's even a post office box up there that you can send postcards to the USA and other countries from. Great experience!"
Nice experience and nice views of Seoul.,"In the Namsan area, we visited this site in order to see the city view and were surprised for the better then our expectations. I recommend to go there and use the cable car to get there."
Great View from Above,I have visited this place in Feb 2019. Located near Myeongdong Subway Station. We reach there by walk. Best time to visit is in the evening. There is one place on the tower where couples tie locks.It's really cold during winter. Definitely will visit this place again ^^
Namsan tower,"It's a popular place for both tourists and locals. Especially,at night, many tourists go there to look around the Seoul city with the beautiful light. "
Could have been good if it wasn't so foggy,"Visited in the evening but the view was marred by fog/smog. If you get clear weather, the view would be great. Took the escalator lift to the base of the cable car tower and then up via cable car. The wait on a weekday evening was reasonable for such a popular place. Quite a few eating places, be prepared to pay tourist price though."
Nice,A new style of getting out and about. Very interesting place .never seen anything like it..enjoyed very much
Best view of Seoul City,I have visited this place in Feb 2019. Located near Myeongdong Subway Station. We can reach there either by ropeway or by walk. Best time to visit is in the evening. There is one place on the tower where couples tie locks like Pont des arts Paris. Try to avoid this place on weekend as it will be crowded.
Smog / haze,"Took the trip up to the base of the tower by the cable car, however didn’t go up this time due to the heavy haze.I have been up before and the view is good however there is a lot of reflections off the glass.The base has cafes and tourist items available however I noted the price was well above city prices.Great view even if you don’t go up the tower"
Totally awesome,"Is a Must! When visiting Seoul, great place to spend the afternoon or the whole evening, shops , restaurants, coffee shops and lots of entertainment"
Too expensive and too many reflections,"To be honest, I found this tower to be way too touristy. We went there in the evening to enjoy the lights of Seoul, but we were kind of disappointed. You have to wait in line for quite a while to take the elevators to the observation deck of the tower and when you eventually get up the reflections of the candy and souvenir shops in the tower spoil the view. You can buy and write postcards that get stamped in the tower itself, but the view is better, when you stay outside on the hill.Not worth the money."
My favorite place,"We tried to go at night but much too crowded. By day, it was fantastic. There is so much to do including the trip to the top. There were performers and restaurants and shops. It was the best day with my daughter of my entire trip to South Korea."
Long lines,"We were staying just a short walk from the tower cable car, so we thought we'd go one afternoon.We got there around 16:30 and I was glad we did.The ride in the cable car is reasonably priced, around $10:00 AUD, for a return trip.The longest part of the journey was the 3 flights of snaking passenger line that we waited in.The cable car offers a pretty good view, the car gets loaded to maximum capacity so try and get in first for a good window position. Once up on the tower area, the views of Seoul just keep going.It's very popular with locals, and we saw plenty of local sports teams during the night.Plenty of places to eat, ranging from street cart style, food court to restaurants. There is a padlock area that was supposed to be removed some months ago, but I think there may have been a lot of resistance to that move. You can still buy padlocks of various prices and write your message of love.It was really nice watching the views change, this time of the year it didn't get dark until after 20:00 hrs.We didn't stand in line for as long to go back."
Be prepared to queue!,Went on a sunday night - the queue for the cable car was huge! We waited about 40 minutes. The view from the top is amazing though - we were fortunate with the weather too.
Beautiful view,"I love Seoul, Korea. N Tower gives a breath taking view of Seoul. It has the ""locks"" bridge, souvenir shops, cafes, Hello Kitty shop, cable car ride. Can't wait to see this place again. "
Stunning views ,The view was incredible and it was not too scary for someone with a fear of heights! Ticket price was cheap and so was the restaurant next to the tower. There was even somewhere to write and send postcards inside! 
Sights over Seoul ,"Make the hike up if it’s not unbearably humid/hot, it’s a nice walk up from Myeong-dong, doesn’t cost much to go up, and has great views of the city! Personally I’d avoid any cafes/restaurants at the tower and head back down to Myeong-dong for food. "
What a wonder Seoul,"Greater after renovated. The tower has many gimmick along the way to the top. - star ocean room- the 360 angle projection mapping room- even the ceiling of the elevator have the vdo while it elevating. Make you feeling excitement.- great view, of course- great air"
A great view of Seoul,"This is probably the best overall view of Seoul. It has four different floors available for viewing. You can watch the Sunset and get a good picture. There is a gift shop where you can buy a souvenir and a lovely French restaurant. We went to the Tower on a holiday, so the observatory was a little bit crowded ."
Not bad,Fairly busy place. Take a bus 02 to get there via line 4. Easy to get there. The main issue is getting to the entrance as the lift is full most of the time. Once you enter the tower you will be entertained with visual lights. Remember best place to take photo is in the observatory deck toilet 
Love locks,"Seoul toweris situated at the top of the Seoul. There are love locks for the couples. So many locks were locked at this place, thousands of them. The beauty is awesome. Must visit during nights. "
Beautiful Seoul,Beautiful place but there is a big long walk hill that needs good fit body and not recommended to go on summer really hot.The place is clean and perfect for souvenirs they have the best collection for the tower 
Mandatory visit,"Its a must on Seoul beautiful view, you need to take a cable car (which is full) and seems shuttle are also available. Once up you need to buy another ticket to get to the top, can take another 20 or 30 minutes.There are restaurants souvenirs. Before getting to the top of the tower theres an awesome video mapping show it worth to stay and watch them all, excellent job.On top of the tower crowded as any other landmark, will auggest to avoid on cloudy or rainy days"
N SEOUL TOWER LOCKS,10 minute less taxi ride from Myeongdong. No long line ups. Locks and pens can be purchased at the location relatively pricy. 
Amazing views!,"Amazing views of Seoul and the mountains. We took a hop on/hop off bus tour to this delightful tower. The views were well worth the trip! I wish we had gone back in the evening to see the views from that time as well. The day views are amazing, and there are quite a few things to do and eat there as well. A little something for everyone!"
High above Seoul,"I love this place. Situated about 480 meters above sea level, you can see the whole view of Seoul. There were interesting places to see...food to eat....things to buy...Surely a great place to visit. I hope to be back!!!"
Must do. And use the restrooms for a unique experience,"We hiked up to the tower. A bit strenuous but worth it. There was a show at the base which was fun. Lots to see and take in at the top. And the food was great. Took the tour to the top. Gift shop at the top along with a panoramic view of the city. And the bathroom stalls have windows from floor to ceiling - hilarious! And they were very clean. Ice cream, churros, beers, treats, everything for everyone to be satisfied."
Incredible views!,"If you're in Seoul YOU MUST go to the N Seoul Tower. The view of the city is incredible. It is the perfect instagram photo spot. There is food at the top, and it is fun to hang and people watch everyone at this tourist hot spot. "
A must place to visit!,"Must visit in any time of the day.The Hello Kitty shop is super cute, the ""love"" locks and basically all the area around is Amazing~ oh and of course don't  forget the once in a lifetime  view of the tower's last floor Simply a must ♡"
Soooooooo!!,"High with a beautiful sight over the entire city! We loved the signs on the windows that took us ‘home’. I personally do not like all the souvenirshops, but a lot of people do, so it seems to be a ‘thing’ fot lots of us?But the view is great, go there when the weather is bright! "
A distinctive hallmark of Seoul,"A tower located on the Namsan Hill. You can get here in various ways. We went by cable car, which station is located about 15 minutes' walk from Myeong-Dong subway station (line 4). The tower top is reached by an elevator. From above there is a great view of Seoul, you can also eat something in the restaurant at the top of the tower."
Absolutely magical. Bring comfy shoes!!,"This is one of the top rated things to do in Seoul and for good reason. The views from the top are absolutely unreal. That said, there is quite a hike from the bottom to the top of the tower. No cars are allowed in the area, so you take a shuttle bus costing about 1200 won per person from Myendong Bus stop 3, and a few other locations. It takes about 30 minutes to get there. From the drop off point, you have to walk up a steep hill for about 5 minutes to get to the lift to get to the top. Once there, you buy your tickets. They offer a student discount and also a senior discount for people over 65 and also a handicapped rate. Make sure you have some documentation of the disability as Japan and Korea are really tight about this and will not take your word, which is really stupid. Last week, we had to wait about 40 minutes because of the amount of people there, so we spent some time in the gift shop, capitalism amirite. Ended up getting to the top eventually and was blown away by the sheer scale of Seoul. This and Tokyo just make every other city feel like small villages, even LA and NYC."
Nice Communication Tower,"I wanted to see this communication tower as it is on the Lonely Planet's Ultimate Travel list. The Seoul City Tour company took us to see this tower as part of their N Seoul Tower, Hanok Village and Korean War Memorial morning tour. This tower has very nice landscaping and gardens which I enjoyed walking through on the way to the tower.The view through the windows are hazy as the quality of air is not great in Seoul. The most fun was the view from windows in the toilet cubicles in the ladies room, as it was the same as the main observation viewing windows. I also liked the padlocks on the deck of a lower area. (Borrowed this idea from the Paris bridge.). In all a pleasant way to spend an hour."
Seoul View,"The top of the tower shall show you the view of the City of Seoul. You will see the buildings or the ""industrial"" part of the city.If you will go via train (Myeong-dong) you will still need to walk a little bit,uphill. Lot of energy though is needed because it is uphill and the stairs for the cable car. After riding the cable car, you can walk and look at the love locks place. Walking further you'll arrive at the observatory. You will need to have the passes and ride the elevator by then.The place is popular for tourists so expect queueing for cable cars and elevators."
Dinner at the top restaurant ,"Magical place!I arrived at 8PM and lift at 11PM. So in daylight and night and the twilight....The restaurant turns so you see all of Seoul from a bird point of view.It is expensive like 100 euro. But so worth it.And very good as well. Small portions, so if you have a big appetite......It is very quite and lots of privacy."
Its not about tower its about the walk that leads to it ,I loved this overall journey of going on gondola n cuming back by foot loved those love locks its beautiful n nice views of city from top of mountain dono why this place have bad reviews kids loved it 9 n 5 years old n its very easily approachable from local bus 
Fun hang out spot ,"Lots available. Would be a great date spot where you could spend most of the day. Different food options, good little hike, can opt for a cable car ride, fun love lock location, a kids area, and just some nice nook and crannies to sit and enjoy."
Buy Tickets in advance at Klook Apps at Discount,We walked from Myeongdong area to the cable car station (20-25 mins) where we took (W35000 for 3 adults 1 child) to the tower ground floor. We booked tickets at the Klook apps in advance for entering the tower which are much cheaper. It gave instant confirmation with QR code. We just need to take the physical entrance slip at the kiosks with the mobile confirmation. There are some shops and restaurants/eateries at the Tower. It's a popular place and must visit. We spent 3 hours here in late afternoon. I must be back in one autumn as it will be full of maple leaves 
The top tourist destinations in Seoul.,N Seoul Observatory Deck showed us an amazing view of Namsan and Seoul. It should be visited by tourist as it is known as one of the top tourist destinations in Seoul.
My kids enjoyed the N Seoul Tower,"My kids enjoyed the N Seoul Tower and the Hello Kitty Island, especially the latter. The only really disappointing thing was that the grand piano did not work! Maybe there should be a restaurant in the Hello Kitty Cafe."
One of the best view points in Seoul.,I think it was worth the line and wait to go up to the to. There are lots of fun things to see and do as well. The tram up and down is such a unique experience highly recommend for anyone visiting Seoul
"Always magical to visit it, in every season.","Glad I visited now as the leaves of the trees are so green..my favorite time to visit is at twilight, the changing of colors outside while I'm up there is really magical"
amazing view,We had amazing view through N Seoul Tower and I love that you get to choose riding (with fee of course) or going through the stairs
Beautiful scenery especially during sunset.,"Nothing much to do up at the observatory level, just enjoy the scenery and have some twosome coffee."
N Seoul Tower,"good experience, top building , good service , good manner , good prepare , fast , quick , beautiful , amazing view"
We took the cable car up to the mountain,"We took the cable car up to the mountain, the views were stunning, there was much to see and the waiting time wasn't as bad as i expected took only about 5 mins on a Tue at 3PM, highly would recommend, the voucher redemption was easy as well the machines present had an English option."
Nice view at the top!,Nice view at the top! Stayed there for longer than expected! Very good experience and easy to redeem redeem
More fun than expected.,"I didn’t expect this trip to be so much fun for my children. There were Cartoon characters everywhere which they loved to spot. There was a Cablecar ride to the top (not as hot as I thought it was going to be inside the plastic box full of tourists) they have bars/restaurants/ice cream parlours and the view is stunning on a clear day. The cost doesn’t get you to the top which I do find disappointing. You have to pay an additional cost of 11,200 at the half way point to go the all the way in an elevator to the “top”. 3of our party did and 3 stayed behind. They enjoyed their extra trip which had an exhibition at the top. The cable cars were larger on the return journey which I found very reassuring. Taxis and busses are at the entrance if you don’t want to walk back to your apt. It didn’t feel packed with the amount of people actually up there. There is an amusement arcade half way which entertains the kids no end. "
Great,"It’s one of the most famous spot in Seoul - must visit.We walked from the Namsangol Hanok Village, fresh atmosphere, nice weather. We really like it.It only can be reached by the cable and it’s worth. You can see full view of Seoul city if you go to the top of the tower. So 2 tickets: cable from the bottom and other ticket to go to the top. There are some ice-cream shops and cafes. But do not try Churos, its really bad hahaa."
I Seoul you Korea! ,"N Seoul Tower, what more can i say? It has a certain romantic feeling to it, yes also known to be the hotspot to get engaged , it really is a sentiment, the facility caters for all ages and all walks of life, the N Seoul tower has tons of restaurants, and gift shops up in the tower and also out, there is also a game arcade, restrooms and of course, accommodating the most beautiful veiw and prospect of Seoul, getting to the destination itself was not a hassle depending on where you stay in Korea, you can always catch a bus at Dongguk, but getting up to the tower requires abit of foot work and good old hiking shoes, or any type of shoe that won't have you slip on it's inclined path, but the little hike is all worth it!! The entrance fee is reasonable, about 10000 won and you'll always be entertained in the towers elevator, the tower assistant were helpful, friendly, organized and structured, it can be abit overcrowded up in the tower, but it still IS A STUNNING VEIW"
Lovely place for Love-Locking😍,"There are two ways to go up to N Seoul Tower, using a cable car or walking. We chose to go with a cable car. The cable car was pretty expensive,and a little long line, but we're okay with that. It was a beautiful view from the cable car. We can see the city view. When we arrived, we bought a love lock and hang it there. Overall, it was an excellent experience "
N Seoul Tower: Second Time Around,"My second visit to N Seoul Tower was tons more comfortable than my first one as I didn't have to spend hours finding my way to the tower (brief recap: we got lost, walked for almost an hour, and ended up riding a bus). This time, we rode a bus and alighted at the tower's lower entrance, which meant that we had to hike uphill to reach the ground floor of the tower. It was a bit of a climb but it provided for a beautiful view of the tower and its picturesque landscape. We arrived just before sunset so everything was highlighted with a gorgeous golden hue background. We were fortunate for clear skies during our observatory tower visit; however, the views you get as you climb uphill or descend downhill prove to be more breathtaking than the one you get on the tower."
Visit in a clear sky day or night,"Cost for a combo for two is ¥24000 Korean Won , this included 2 adults, 2 large soft drinks and 2 large pop corns with choices of 4 taste. Beer combo cost a big more. Very popular place with tourist and local, we took cable car up there , cost ¥9500 @ for return , not a very long ride, but a walk to the escalator before you reach the cable car station. Too much for elderly. Better take a bus to cable car station . alternatively you can take a circle line bus from the closest subway station cost about ¥1250 @ way to the tower and no cable car . You may order the entry ticket online and get ¥6000 which most people do. Try out some websites. The view is authentic especially the night view but the viewing deck is relatively congested. The snack bar lighting is too bright so the reflection blocked your view . Seoul is large city but not as many high raise than inHong Kong. So the night view appears less impressive than in HK. With the price is value for money . Can’t miss. Highly recommend. Even you don’t go up the tower , the ground level five storey decking is still good enough to have good view if the city . Remember go when the weather is clear."
Best way to see the city skylines!,"A beautiful and inexpensive way to discover the city from above! We took the cable car up to the tower as the walk can be a bit difficult and long, particularly in the cold winter so I would recommend the cable car which is cheap and very frequent. The tower gives you a time to enter the observation deck and while you wait there are little shops, food sellers and museums to look around. It's a very interactive day out, be sure to bring a marker and lock for the railings outside the tower! Buying ones there can be a bit more expensive but it's a great way to mark and remember your day"
Views and shopping!,"A must see for the sights as well as sounds (on the path we spotted interesting birds and spiders). Bring enough drinks, stay hydrated. Stop at the shop, some cute crafts and stylish earings!"
"Great walk, good view of Seoul","We opted to walk from the nearest metro station all the way to the top and were pleasantly surprised to find that the road up is not actually that long. It is steep for sure but goes quite quickly and I am a slow walker. The tower itself was impressive and we opted to go up onto the paid-for viewing levels. It was quite busy but not too bad in comparison to the free lower levels. The view was great and it was a nice clear day so we could see quite far. The tower had a handful of restaurant options including a great fried chicken place but don't order the ""seasoned"" chicken unless you are aiming to clog your arteries because WOW, there was a lot of sweet sticky sauce on there. Apparently ""seasoned"" in South Korea does not been herbs, it means sauce - we found out the hard way. The Starbucks on the lower levels where you get the tickets has a nice outdoor seating area that we enjoyed as well."
Seoul Tower,"An early dinner on 38th floor of Hotel Lotte and we were off to the N Seoul tower .We could see the tower from the hotel .After a mini bus ride to a little hill , we had a cable car ride to the hill top to reach the base of the tower.A swift lift took us to the observation floor, which is circular all round the tower giving magnificent view of the city .The are nic e write ups to describe the sights and also major cities in each direction with distances - very nice info."
The pictures will never do justice to the experience,"I have to say that I have a profound love for korea so coming to the famous N tower was a must. The view is just magnificent and there are many places to take cool pictures. If you go in cold weather seasons go well covered because if chilly up there. Also I don't think is necessary for you to pay the ticket to go up in the tower, the magic is outside. Is crowded as hell too and it took ages for me to leave the place so i would definitely recommend you to just go to the outside part, the pictures inside aren't good anyways because of the glass. Stay outside."
Good to walk up...,"Want some fresh air and exercise? A good way to do that is to walk up one of the many trails or paths/steps to the top. A nice walk with good scenery. At the top.... well, not so great and very touristy with inflated prices for everything. I highly recommend that you forget the cable car or bus and just stroll up... a nice way to do some aerobic exercise!"
Very nice attraction ,This is where you can get a nice view os the whole city. I decided to go up walking and there are many nice tracks to get there if you are motivated to walk more than an hours otherwise take the cable car.Plenty of restaurants and shops. Very popular place.
Super crowded during weekend evening,"My mistake is to visit this popular attraction on a weekend evening. When I arrived on Sunday at 9:40pm and got the ticket, it showed the estimated waiting time to take the lift is 40 mins. Examine the crowd. Well, the city view on top is nice, with all the buildings and streets lights. There is a small Hello Kitty museum (separate ticket) and a sweet shop on top. The next pain is to queue and wait for the lift down. I took a public bus back to Myeongdong around and was super tired by the time I reached my hotel past midnight.There are sites such as klook and kkday which offer discounted admission tickets to the tower and Hello Kitty museum."
Best place for city night views,"This is the best place for Seoul city night views. However, the waiting time for the cable car is quite long as it is crowded with locals and tourists. Overall, it is worth a visit if you enjoy night views.p.s. speaking personally, I think that paying to go up to the viewing tower is not really worth it as it is not much differences. "
"Steep walk, a bit of a letdown","Yes, there's a great view at the top - just like in the Empire State Building or other tall buildings in the world. But I actually found the (free) view from places like Namsan hill to be even more spectacular without the crowds, the cost and the hoopla. Steep walk from bus area to get there if you're driving up - otherwise the lines from the cable car or the regular elevator can be long on weekends. Once I was up at the top I didn't need to stay up there very long. If you feel you can't visit Seoul without saying you were there, or you have no other means to see something from a high view, knock yourself out and go - but if you can climb Namsan Park yourself or see a high-floor view from a hotel, skip it!"
It is a must while in Seoul ,"Although it is the landmark of the city (somehow), the idea is bigger than the realty, nice steep walk to the tram or cable car, not far from the main avenue. Price might be slightly higher for what you get, once up there, it is wide and open, lots of rrom to roam around, shops and restaurants available and options for video and photos as well. Good place to visit. "
A must go to see a ,We really enjoyed our time there. We went up by hiring a private taxi from Klook along with the ticket to enter the tower.If you wanna partipate in lock with your partner. I recommend not buying from there it cost to much.You can chill out in the twosome cafe and have fun.Generally a great place to chill. If you have elderly please consider using the cable car. 
"Highest peak of Namsan Area, full of love locks. . . hahaha","We rode a bus going up the peak. It was a busy day in Namsan Tower..When the bus reached the parking lot, you still have to walk about 10 minutes in a steep slope to climb to the tower itself..The place was full of people and stuffs being sold.. We were told it was nice to go up the tower in their observatory but we didn't.. There are toooo many people and very loooong lines.. If you want to go up you need to be early or stay longer.The old ""shed"" in the area has a sad story behind it, ask your tour guide (if you have one) because im not spoiling..There is an outside observatory deck which they call the love locks deck with scopes that will aid you to view the entire Seoul Landscape..And speaking of love locks, they are literally everywhere..In the park, near the tower, on the observatory, and you can find love lock trees..You can buy one if you want to leave locks there.The view is spectacular, and even more beautiful with sunset and evening."
Wonderful Night View of Seoul City,It was very nice night view of Seoul city. People was not that croweded and could see the fantastic view of the capital city.
Great panorama of Seoul,"The tower offers great panorama of Seoul. I didn't go to the tower during my previous visits. This time my hotel was in a walking distance, therefore I decided to visit the tower. I went in the morning and walked, instead of using the cable car. Surprisingly, there were many facilities that offer food and drinks, including draft beer. Based on my experience, I would suggest to go late afternoon to have a dinner, see the panorama in daylight and after dark, and enjoy glass of beer. I usually walk a lot, however walking to the tower was too much exercise and I had sore muscles even three days after. So some people should consider cable car."
Spectacular views,Definitely worth a visit if just for the Seoul views. You go up by cable car. There is a whole collection of ' lovers locks' tied to each other and to whatever it can be locked on. Largest collection I have ever seen. The views from the top are mindblowing and give a fair idea of the size and plan of Seoul. 
What a view,"The tower has great views of Seoul. We took the cable car up and walked back to the bus for our return to the city.Lots of options to get there, things to see, coffee and food available to enjoy while you take in the view, even the toilet as a view:)"
Great view ,"The Seoul tower is more than a great view. It's great fun for the whole family, there a park in the area, hello kitty mini park, cheeseball adventure and plenty of wal trails to catch a view before the view. To top it off you can get there by cable car that has it own wow view."
Completely Touristy Attraction,"They seem to think this tower can compete with worldwide tall buildings. It’s laughably short, but compared to the other buildings in the city, it does provide a nice view of the city. We did a beer and popcorn package, but if you don’t get it to take up (we wanted to sit and enjoy) you have to take a long trip back after the ride up and down"
Afternoon trip in N Seoul Tower,"After getting off bus no 5, you have to walk 5-10 mins of upwards landscapes to reach the N Seoul Tower. You can talk a few photo of it’s famous lover lock on the wall. And you can take close up look of N Seoul Tower. You need to buy entrance ticket to go up to the Tower. The view is good and worth a visit. I attach the bus no and it’s route . So you can know which places for your next stop. Hope I can know the bus schedule so I don’t need to wait that long for the bus. "
Worth the walk,"Walked over to the cable cars from the hotel. Took me a little while to find. Only 10,000 KRW ($8.66) to go to the top. Cheapest tower I've ever been up. Thursday afternoon, and although it was not empty, I certainly would not call it crowded. Views were okay. Difficult to find a clear day in Seoul this time of year. I would definitely recommend it. Lots more to do and see than just go up in the tower. Best I can tell, it is free to go to the tower. And there are lots of great views and restaurants and shops at the base of the tower, without paying to go up. Several degrees cooler up there than it was down on the streets."
Fun Place to Visit,"While there is a cost to go to the top, the mid-levels are fun, with nice views and lots of entertainment going on during the day."
"GREAT VIEWS, BUT LOTS AND LOTS OF PEOPLE","N Seoul Tower provides great views of the city (on a clear day). This is not our thing; ergo the rating. There is a lot of activity in the tower, and there are lots of people--both tourists and locals. We suspect that it might be better to visit in the evening."
Day in the memory,It was nice day to see all Seoul in the sun sunset time.we have fun day with my family good few from up
the view is amazing,"We kind of got a bit lost going up there because we had a misunderstanding with the bus driver. So we took the cable car instead and fortunately it was not crowded and the ride up was nice.You had to wait for a while for the elevator though, but the view was really good. You get a 360 degree view of the city lights. There were lots of food stores below too if you get hungry. And of course the there was the famous love lock. Definitely worth a visit."
Fun but prepare to wait,"I feel like a trip up the Namsan Tower is a highlight of visiting Seoul. However, make sure you are prepared to spend a long time waiting. There is a wait if you want to take the Omni elevator to the cable car station (or you can choose to walk up the stairs like we did), there is a wait to buy your ticket for the cable car, there was a 40 minute wait after that to get on the cable car, and then you have to walk up more stairs and buy your ticket for the tower and wait for 30 minutes until it is your turn to get in line and wait to go up in the elevator. The view from the top was beautiful. We had hoped to go up while it was still light and watch the sunset, but it was dark by the time we made it to the top. The only downside of this is that the lights inside the tower reflect on the glass so you can't take pictures of yourself and see the city very well. There is also a 30 minute wait to go back down the elevator. We did enjoy the view from the deck at the base of the tower and got some good sunset pictures."
Namsan Tower,Namsan Tower AKA N Seoul Tower. Great place for a all round aerial view of Seoul. We took a walk up to the cable car station from Myeongdong Station. Takes around 15mins. Remember to bring along your locks or you can get one from the shops there. Locks are pretty expensive there though. Nice and beautiful place overall. 
Beautiful,"There are many beautiful spots to see on the way leading to the tower. There are the Locks of Love which are posted in and around the various fences of this area. You can even buy your own padlock and leave a message on it and then lock it onto a post or wherever there was space. There is also a kids play area, stores for souvenirs or snacks, obviously the observation tower, statues and figures to take pictures of, and many rest stops along the way. Although the observation tower is a good view of the surrounding area, you can also get the view when just looking from the view point areas from outside the tower which is free."
Good views,You can get great views from here but during peak times of the year it does get overcrowded. But definitely worth going to at least once
Good experience,"Went up by cable car, was a very interesting experience!There are LOADS of locks couples put everywhere. They put it on stair railings, poles, anywhere they possibly can. Bring your own lock!We didn’t buy a ticket up the tower. The view from below was already amazing!"
Great landscape,N Seoul Tower is one place you must to go when you are in Seoul. What Amazing view is ! Take a bus number 5 from Myeongdong Market. Bus stop locates in 3 exit of Myeongdong subway station. N Seoul Tower is last stop.
Holiday,Get an uninterrupted view of Seoul from the tower. The whole place and gardens below are beautiful. From the bus stop the walk up the hill is reasonably steep but it takes only 5 minutes to reach the ticket office and elevator. Wear good gripping shoes as down is as hard as up. Worth a visit for sure. 
A landmark in Seoul worth visiting ,"The N Seoul Tower is such a prominent landmark that you will just have to see it, and the best time to go is before sunset. The light on the Tower is an indication of the current air quality: from blue to red. It was green (normal air quality) during our visit.We’d visited the tower as part of a half day tour. From the bus station to the base of the Tower there is a steep slope going up leading to a viewing platform.The view from the observatory was stunning - you get a all around view of Seoul. Even the men’s toilet get a “framed up” views."
Great views ,We visited busan tower and didn’t think this was as good...if per chance you plan to visit both then do the photo challenge and if luckily you’ll get a buy one get one free ticket for the other tower! We got to the tower from the cable car. There’s restaurants and shops at the bottom of it. The lift wizzes you up. The views are great. The skyline I think is wonderful and the views to the river are great too. There’s a shop up there. There’s also a Korean buffet restaurant and then higher up is a fine dining French restaurant. I heard someone say to a traveller not to bother going up the tower but I certainly would - the views are great and you can’t experience it anywhere else.
Worth it for the ciew,"Like any other tall building/attraction, you go for the view. I found N Tower to be less of a rip off than most of these types of places. It was cool to ride the unmanned tram up a small hill to the cable car. Views were great. They do charge for the cable car as well as to go onto the observation deck and for photos but the price was reasonable. It’s a hike even with the tram and cable car so it was nice to do this towards sunset on a cooler day. "
Go at sundown,"This was great to find. First get off at Myeong-dong and take exit 1. There is a free shuttle to the tram. You can Google 'free Namsan shuttle bus' and you will get the site with time schedule. I think it is hourly. Go up the tram, or if you want walk to bar of tower. Go up tower before sunset and enjoy the view. Be sure to visit the toilets, the view is one of a kind for a restroom. After taking the tram down, I then walked to the Hoehyeon station on line 4. It was an easy walk. There is a Cafe up the tower were you can get a coffee or sweet as you watch the sunset. "
How to go to nansam tower,Use google map to take bus 402 etc. Then alight at namsam library beside namsam park. Go to namsam park and go walk towards Seoul N tower.
Spectacular night views!,Went up by cable car during the evening. The cable car ride was quite worrying as there were 20+ people cramped into a carriage and some of us were wondering aloud if this was our last day on earth lol. There are places for you to place a love lock at the summit with your significant other. The view from the tower itself is superb. We were there to watch the sunset and the night cityscape and the silhouettes of the mountains surrounding Seoul makes for a breathtaking sight. Expensive but still a must visit in my opinion. 
360 Degree of Amazing View of Seoul,Arrived the N Tower with our group after our great lunch in the financial district of Seoul.What a spectacular 360 degree view of the city. Luckily we were able to watch an endorsement photo shoot by a well known K-Pop artist of a Nissan Car. We have wonderful tour of the city that day.
Kids are always excited with heights,"It is always exciting to see the landscape of Korea, Seoul in particular on top of the tower. You can see the big buildings."
Well worth a visit,"After going up countless towers on a tour of Japan and Korea, perhaps this was a ‘tower too far’. So I accept that this may influence this review. We had to wait 30 minutes at the cable car before we could get up. The Q down was even worse, so it’s quicker and more fun to walk down. Once at the top the views are great, but it was a little rainy when we visited so the view was not as good as I’m sure it is on a sunny day - so keep a look out for the weather forecast before deciding which day to visit (on our second day in Seoul it was completely enveloped in cloud). Well worth visiting, none the less....how can you come to Seoul and not say you’ve been up the tower?? "
A great view of all of Seoul,"Stupidly I agreed to walk with my friend from Myeongdong to N Seoul Tower. It took an hour but don't worry, there are several buses which go to the top. Out of the 3 towers you can have a view of Seoul, this is the cheapest and buying from Klook is 40% cheaper. N Seoul Tower has a great view of Seoul, especially of Myeongdong. There are several activities you can do - have a photo taken with a green screen and insert different backgrounds, send a postcard from the observatory deck or have a coffee or meal. The men's toilet has a great view as well."
Go for the experience and to see the city,Best to go a little before sunset to fully enjoy the view from the o observatory. We went on a Friday late afternoon and there was queue for the cable car rides. There are many choices of food available. Do take time to enjoy a coffee and savor the sights. What was terrible was the very long queue for the elevator ride down from the observatory. It took more than 30 mins waiting time for the elevator aftet spending 15 mins in the observatory. Place was packed to the brim and we could not fully enjoy the sights.Perhaps would be better to visit during weekdays.
Lots to do!,"We hiked up the mountain using a stairway path. It was a hard hike! But once we got to the top there were lots of things to do. I think the coolest part was seeing all the ""locks of love"" at the top. There's a lot of restaurants up there and we went to Tokyo Steak which I highly recommend.If you go, try to go on a clear day. We went when it was overcast and a lot of pollution was trapped so the view of the city wasn't good at all."
Not blown away,"I caught the cable car because it was easier for me to get to.When you make your way out of the station at the top, you're greeted with nice views and lots of the famous love locks. The view so far is really nice and you can see quite far. I thought ""The view from the observation decks will be so much better!"" I was wrong.You head down some steps into a concourse area where you can buy drinks and trinkets. I purchased my ticket for the observatory and waited in line for the elevator to the observation area.Essentially I paid 10,000 krw to ride a lift and look out of windows covered in the handprints and faceprints of small children, all the while getting barged out of the way by impatient tourists.Personally, not worth the money. Catch the cable car or walk up the steps to get nice panoramic views. Don't bother with the observation decks... I'm giving it 3 points because I quite liked the views from the hill below."
Good weather makes the panaromic views exciting,"We were lucky we visited on a good weather, and we could see the views clearly. The toilet cubicle is so interesting too, with a big mirrow reflection in front of toilet seat and the glass panel at the side of it, so we could either look out to the view outside or look at ourselve in the mirror. "
Nice View of Seoul,"If it is your first time in Seoul and would like to enjoy an aerial view of the city, this is the place to go. I would recommend going there late in the afternoon so you can enjoy the view when there is light until after dark so you get to see the city both during the day and at night. There are several restaurants should you feel hungry and want to eat. There is a convenience store for your basic needs. If you are travelling with very small children and elderly, it may be a challenge walking up the steep hill leading to the tower. There is a portion there where there are trees where you can attach your lock as a remembrance until the next time you visit the tower. The best way to reach the top is by car, if not, bus. Taxi's are not allowed so it's a longer walk by cab. If you go up there during the colder months of the year, bring a jacket, the cold is felt very much at that height."
Disappointed,We made the journey to the tower giving ourselves plenty time but disappointed to find the ticket booth had closed early. We were also ushered away from a viewing deck despite it being quite a bit before the displayed closing time. We did have a bit of a wander about where we could including the love locks so it wasn’t a wasted journey. 
Not bad ,Good view of Seoul but mostly building. Went up observatory and came down to the car within 30 minutes. 
Great vantage point,"The N-Seoul tower is located close to the town centre and so provides a great vantage point to see ‘greater’ Seoul and gain an appreciation of its size. We visited during the day and (apparently) were fortunate in that the air was relatively clear, which allowed us to see more than is normally the case. Nevertheless the atmosphere seemed misty and objects in the distance are observed in a haze.At the base of the tower is an open area with a small shopping complex and open space which was busy with families and tourists. There was also a small market which according to our guide was unusual. Access to the tower us by a pair of lifts which were not busy so we didn’t wait long to get to the viewing platform. This is on two levels, the upper having an external area. Souvenirs and snacks are available including a self serve sweet shop which was very popular.Well worth a visit and I imagine the night time view would be even more spectacular."
Visit if you have time or travel with children,"it's a nice tower, but personally not a must place to visit. facilities is good, the view the the tower is great, but since this is no Iconic thing you can see from the Tower, so make it less interesting. T"
Exploring Seoul,"Great views of the city all around. Take the Namsan cable car from the Hoehyeon-dong platform to Yejang-dong platform at the top of Mt Namsan near the N Seoul Tower. The cable car is about 605m meters up hill over the road & forest with scenic views of Seoul below. You then exit and walk up to the Tower level where they have many gift & food shops. From here you can buy tickets to go up and view the city, hopefully it'll be a clear day so you can see North Korea in the distance. Interestingly around the observatory are the names of many world cities with the distance to each one, depending which direction you are facing. The atmosphere is one similar to going up the CN Tower in Toronto but with the added excitement of actually doing it in Korea. The city is truely amazing & full of life. "
Beautiful,We took the cable car up to the tower. It was a lot bitter than I imagined. It has few restaurants and many sites for photos. We loved walking around the tower and taking in the view of the city. We ate at the restaurant at the tower and it was surprising really good. It was well worth the trip.
A Seoul must! (But avoid weekends),"We were here on a tuesday afternoon and it was perfect. Stunning view over the entire city. The cable cart cost about 10,000 won, and so did the entrence to the observation deck. The restaurant on the observation deck is very pricey, but there is a great Italian restaurant on first floor with an AMAZING view."
Great view,I was using cable car to reach this place. And it's so amazing. You could see Seoul from this place. This place is so romantic . 
Lovely views,There was a slight uphill walk to get to the base of tower. Some lovely views of the city from the Tower.
Love this attraction must see for Seoul visit ,I love this place getting there was as much fun as the attraction lots to do great views and plenty of great pictures The lines can be very long depending on the time of year you visit You can walk but we took a cab and then used the cable tram to get to the top.The lines for tickets and tram can get long just keep that in mind.We spent about 4 hours at this attraction 
Fantastic views of Seoul.,"A bit of a uphill walk from myeongdong' but so worth it once you make it to the top. There is a tram that will bring you to the base of the tower, then take the elevator to the viewing deck of the tower, for a charge for both. "
Spectacular View at the Top,"We visited the N Seoul Tower in April 2019, and were not disappointed. The surrounding was beautiful with cherry blossoms all around it. The view was spectacular, especially at the top of the tower.We bought the tickets the day before on Trazy.com, and got a 25% discount. It was easy to exchange e-vouchers for tickets at the kiosks at the Tower.My recommendation is to take the bus (cheaper than cable car), which drop people off near the tower - only a short walk to it. Be prepare to walk uphill a little bit."
Pleasant surrounding,"We were advised on which bus to take. The view at the foot of the tower was beautiful.Bought ticket up to Observatory floor on 5th floor which included lunch at Hancock restaurant, cost 50,000 won altogether. The view was nothing special."
Seoul Tower was good but not the cable car.,"If you intend to take the cable car to and fro to Seoul Tower , please dont as it is not worth it , More than 35, were sardined in and with hardly any place to move , there is nothing to enjoy. Its just a waste of money. Take the bus."
"""Nice but...""","I really had high expectations of this place since I had read so much about it and being a K-drama fan, I thought it would be a wonderful and a romantic place. Well,maybe it would have been different if we went up the other way with the cable car but we went up there as past of a half-day tour. First of all, you can't get up to the tower area itself without walking up or taking a city bus or being part of a tour. No cars are allowed. That part was okay as we did go up by bus. What was disappointing was that it seemed very commercialized. There was a fee to go to the top of the tower. That was understandable but then.they take a photo of you when you enter which of course comes with a price tag. And it was extra to go into the Hello Kitty area which seemed like a promo store??? We didn't go in. Don't get me wrong, the view was nice from the top and outside where you have the love locks and park area. I guess I'm just a bit jaded because of my disappointment. Maybe it would have been nicer to go in the evening with all the lights. But to me-you do it once..."
Get a Combo Ticket,"The views from the tower were amazing! The walk up the hill to the cable was not but it’s South Korea and its mountainous. I highly recommend getting a combo ticket. My friend and I got one that included two tickets up the tower, two popcorns (1 regular flavour and 1 special flavour — we chose caramel) and two drinks all for 22,000KRW. A single ticket up the tower for an adult was 10,000KRW so if you are with someone, get the combo, it’s such a good deal!"
Nice,Beautiful view and relaxing up here!! On the way up here they have many cute coffee ☕️ shop and some good snack too !! Best way to come up here from your hotel is Taxi !!!
Nice views,"Well, pretty much what you'd expect - some great views, some tacky but fun souvenirs etc. Cable car ride is fun, as is expected. Nice territory to walk around as well."
Peak of Seoul,"Went here because I skipped it my past 2 visits to Seoul. It was quite a hike from Myeongdong to the cable car station to bring us up the tower (I forgot how much but around 9000 won roundtrip), but it’s manageable. After getting off the cable car, you can already see colorful “love locks” all over; you can place your own. (If you don’t have a lock they sell it there.) You can also take photos of the Tower from that area. Then there is an option to pay to get up the N tower itself. Since we didn’t want to eat another buffet meal, we only got the tickets with pizza and pasta meal for 2 (not at the top of the tower though), but the pizza especially was superb. At the tower itself, we didn’t need to stay long; 15-20 minutes was more than enough. It was fun to play the interactive booth game though, where you can say hi to people at the Busan tower. :)"
View from the top,"While the tower itself is like most viewing towers, the whole experience is unique. You start from the walk up to the cable car centre. Then there is the joy of taking the cable car up to the base of the tower. Once you arrive on the other side, there are lots of picture spots and also an area where couples place locks with their names written on it (like in Paris).On the top of the tower, you have a 360 degree view of Seoul from viewing platform. There is this machine which is linked to the viewing tower located in Busan (southern part of South Korea), where you can interact with visitors who are there."
360 view,The view from observatory deck is fantastic.. It worth to visit.. It easy to access from itaewon by bus no 03 and from myeongdong bus no 05..
My #imightSeoulyou trip,"South korea is truly bless by nature. You can ride or hike going to namsan tower. It was spring when i came so the scenery is superb It best to travel during spring,summer,atumn"
Good garden and small tower,Good view on mointaintop. But the Seoul Tower is smaller than Tokyo Tower and Shanghai Tower and 101Taipei.
City views nature walk,We walked up to base of the tower and back. Pleasant climb in a natural setting. The top on the hill has some shops and food and some public seats so you can spend some time. 
All stairs ,There are very few elevators. Once ypu get off the cable car it is nothimg but stairs. The veiw is beautiful but not worth the hike. Getting on and off the cable car there was nothing but stairs. Not sings letting us know. There is an elevator from the main road to the cable car stand. If yoi have no mobility issues it is worth the trek. If you have mobility issues best to stay clear. 
Worth paying to visit,My first trip there. Good eye opener to see how this being built and its concept. The weather was not good during our visit. Could really see the outside view. But with visiting. The ticket price cheaper will be good.
so so,"Other than the steep steep walk towards the tower where the padlocks are, there wasn't really much to see here. The food at the top were limited and pricey. Our trip here could have been replaced by another place but what the heck; a check mark for you now that we've seen it.Note the treetops with LARGE bird nests and the walk path that abound with beautiful flowers including tulipsThere are many stalls at the top selling assorted merchandise - all pricey :)"
View!,I went here wanting to go up to the top but it was a very hazy/polluted day so I don’t go to the top as you can walk around and see Seoul for free. Great views on a clear day! 
Afraid of heights ,Visited with a good colleague and he talked me into visiting on a day with good views. It was fantastic; what an experience. On the square at the foot of the tower there are lots of activities. 
Ride the cable car,Awesome site to see while in Korea. It’s a must see. We went to the top and took pictures. There’s even the little lock thing that people do. You can’t miss it they’re everywhere. They sell them there so no worries about bringing your own. I was told they’re love locks.
Was nice place to see!,"I came here because I saw how popular it was in the Korean drama. I was a little disappointed because I thought that the outside was the elevator that can go around to the top. Well, when you get inside, it's just an elevator that takes you to the top straight up, not go around like I thought it would be. It was nice, the view up there is beautiful. I went during Fall, so the leaves changing was nice to see. You can also eat and buy a lock to declared your love to each other."
Good views ,Was happy that our guide was able to drive us almost to the top where the views were good but because of the haze rather restricted distant views
A great sight seeing but only on the day,"I've been to many tower view points in my tours (Seattle Needle, Eiffel Tower, the Empire State Building to name a few) and here it was a bit disappointing. We're reached the tower towards sunset to see the sun goes down on the city, but as the visibility was very poor due to the temperature and the atmosphere, we decided to check the tower itself. There is a deal for two at 22K W for two tickets + 2 drinks and 2 popcorn's (heavily stuffed with butter), and upon entering it looked very strange to the team there that we (as two tourists) didn't want to get ourselves pictured for an overpriced photo set (1 for 15K W and it goes on...)Once we reached up we discovered that it is almost impossible to get a clear sight in the night because of the merchandise and internal lights that these boots are reflecting. All the surrounding windows had reflection of everything you see inside (people shopping, lights of candy stores etc.) and you could not take a decent photo with those reflections. I guess during the day it is much better, but trying to compare the pictures shown by the staff of Seoul at night makes you wonder where was it taken (on the roof top of from a different building :))...."
I hurt,"Got off seoul ststion subway to walk to hilton bus stop up hill to find out bus stop a block away from hilton. Then bus 402 takes us to 2nd stop, which gps said to get off on, to find it in middle of no where. So we walk back to 1st stop to walk what was around a mile up a 45 degree incline...yes it sucked ass. But the best part was it smelled like sewer the whole way. When we finally got to the top it was definitely not worth the effort. Moral of story is research a better way to the top because u will be sweaty, thirsty, and exhausted if you take the walking route."
"Great view of city, but overpriced","My hotel was not far away, so I walked to the cable car station, which was easy to find. I decided not to walk up the path because I have a bad knee and climbing that many stairs would have hurt. I bought a one way ticket for 7,000 won. I didn’t have to wait long for my turn on the cable car, only about five minutes (around 10:45am on a Saturday). The trip up is about two minutes in the cable car, but they reallllly cram people in that thing. The views from the main platforms of the tower were excellent and it was nice to see the love locks as well. They have lots of food options there as well. I did not pay to go up to the observation deck, since I thought it was overpriced, especially when you get such good views from the free platforms. Please note, this is a super crowded attraction, so prepare yourself for that. I then walked back down, since it is much easier going down stairs for me - walk back down took about 10-15 mins for me, going slow. Overall it was worth seeing and you could certainly do it for free if you are fit enough to climb all those stairs. "
Great View,The view makes the trip up so worthwhile. The view is breathtaking. Bus trips up to the base are frequent and convenient.
Great view,We visited at night and it was an amazing view! The city stretches out in all directions. It was also cute watching all the couples.
Seoul Tower,"Maybe it’s Labor Day holiday so there were many people/tourists. From the bottom of slope waiting for elevator up to the ticket station , queuing to collect tickets, to go up the tower station and finally to top of tower was long long queue and we waited for almost 2-3 hrs. I did not think the night view was that fantastic, for the wait it was not worth it for me. We also queued an hr to wait for lift to go down. Bad experience, by the end of the night, my legs were aching so much. The staff there were not doing anything to make the wait more efficient. Maybe it is better if it is not public holiday. "
Good Tourist spot if the weather is clear.,"There is quite a bit to do at this location including many restaurants to have a meal. However, this attraction is at its best only when the weather is clear and the air is clear, so you can see afar. If the weather isn't so good, than it would be a slight disappointing experience, and you would miss out on seeing how Seoul is from top with the surrounding mini mountains."
quick visit,I am thrilled to find cherry blossoms in here! Good place for sightseeing and picturetaking although most of the time there were too many tourist in here. 
Go at night,"Really beautiful, we went during the day however I think at night would be spectacular. Also don’t go on a day where there is dust, as the view isn’t good on a day where there is a lot of pollution. "
"Great view, fresh air","Must visit in Seoul. Colder up there, wear warmer clothes and gear specially if you’re visiting from October to April."
Finale when you visit Seoul!,"Use the cable car going up, you can easily walk down on your way back. This site will show you how big and wide and how progressive Seoul is. It’s really impressive, and the site itself is a mix representation of Korea, very advance but they have cultural presentations scattered around the area too. This is the best place to take selfies and the background views are pretty impressive. Don’t miss it..."
Lovely view ,"Tried to go 5pm on Sunday. It was super crowded. At the cable Car, they put up a sign saying queue will take 90 min. We skipped that and went to the tower. A long queue again to go to the observatory. But I strongly suggest exploring outside first where the love Locks are instead of wasting time in the queue. I didn't know that and regretted the queue. "
A Must visit when in Seoul,Really nice place with beautiful night scenery. Took a cable car up and the night view was awesome. Be sure to lock down your love with a padlock there! 
You shouldn't miss visiting this place if you're in Seoul.,"For first-time visitors, and if sightseeing is an important agenda in your visit then you should definitely visit this place. For starters, it gives you a breathtaking view of Seoul and depending on visibility, you can see nearby mountain ranges. I assume that it also gives a very nice view at night where you can see the vibrant lights of Seoul City.If you are with your sweetheart, you can also venture and put a lovelock here to show your affection to him or her. Together with all the other lovebirds who've also done it before you."
An absolute must-see in (over!) Seoul (recommend walking up the nice hike,"Really great views, people watching, coffee and <some> food options up top. We walked/hiked up (paved) through what's l like a linear garden with fresh air and nice views. Then pay to go up to the top, the views of the enormous Seoul metropolitan area are outstanding! Top it off with the cable car ride down, but note that's quickly over."
Ok only,Only stay up there for a short while. Nothing fanciful. Head straight to the ticket booth to purchase your ticket as you will be given a number and you got to wait for your number to be called.
Nice view,"A must go place for tourist, however if i go again. I wouldnt go up the tower. Ill just buy the cable car ticket And i reckon the view there is good enough"
Exided tired of walk to wow.,"There are two ways to go, by walk and by cable car. We had used walk. Many stairs in a beautiful forest full of spring flowers and birds. Tired but happy. On top was waiting for us N Seoul Tower. View from the top is amazing. Special, when is good weather and visability. You can took great photos of Seoul. In tower are place yo eat, play, restrooms. Gift shops tax free. Also you can leave your love lock.Fully recommended. "
Prepare for a great deal of walking,"Once we got off the bus, we were surprised by the steep walk up the tower. It was difficult especially with a stroller. Then, when we got to the foot of the tower, there was a long line in the elevator and we decided to take the stairs so were very tired when we arrived to the viewing deck. The view was wonderful. We then paid a ticket to go to the very top of the tower - the view was good but it was very crowded. Please avoid going on a weekend or on a holiday!"
Great overview of Seoul,I would recommend visiting this place during day time for better photo taking. The hotel I stayed in Tmark Grand Hotel is very near to the tower and we got on a direct bus just in front of the hotel. Easy and convenient. The love lock area is always packed with tourists and quite difficult to find a nice spot to take pictures. We only stayed for less than 3 hrs including a short coffee break.
Excited to Tired to Wow,"Excited. While we were in line for the cable car, I thought it will only take us a few mins to hop in. Not really. If you want to take the cable car, it will be a very convenient journey to the top~But you'll have to wait more than 30 mins looping around before you can even hop in. I guess it's a lot better than walking all the way to the top? I wish they had a warning downstairs before getting the ticket that we will have more 30 mins wait. . We were excited for the sunset but we missed it... Oh well! The view was fantastic up there though! "
"Great views, long queues","Waited an hour to go up to the viewing deck, that aside, the views of Seoul are fantastic. Worth the visit, just take into consideration waiting times."
All for the View,"Seoul tower offers the most amazing & complete ariel view of the city unlike any other place. However one needs to be careful before going up, since if it is foggy then its a waste as you wont be able to see much.Interesting fact - the tower itself uses lights to indicate whether the visibility is clear or not, so its a good practice to watch for the lights and then make your way there.You can get to the base of the tower for free, which itself is good enough to get a splendid view. But if you want to spend money, you can pay more and make your way up the tower which as a restaurant with a better 360 view.There are two ways to get there - you can trek your way up a nice path or take the bus.The only downside is that it is super crowded, and you need to jostle for space to get a decent view."
"That view, though!","This is a super fun day out--especially if you like hiking! We decided to walk from our hotel (turned out we were ill-prepared...lol), and there is are well-defined trails with pretty scenery and a couple of rest-stops where you can buy drinks and snacks on the way up. Once there, there are a bunch of great photo ops, including a pagoda, the padlock ""love"" fence, and of course the tower itself. The price to go up the tower is very reasonable (if you have kids, you'll probably spend more at the candy shop at the top....haha), and on a non-dusty day the views are supreme. "
Fun way to get an aerial view or Seoul ,"The cable car is fun and easiest way to look at Seoul. The queue to get to the cable car is fast and the staff were helpful and attentive to old folks. Only thing is when we got off the cable car on top, we need to climb three flights of stairs to get to the tower. For people with accessibility issue or old folks like my dad, they can take the lift behind the cable station. Unfortunately, the signage was not obvious and the lady behind the ticketing counter was not conversant in English. We only realise when we were leaving the place. "
Mommyof4,We visited the tower at night hoping for a great view. However it was foggy and we couldn’t see a thing. It was still a fun adventure!
Nice view,Try to go from evening to night. U get a nicer view of the city. There is long queue but move quite fast
Bad knees are a no-no,"Unsure if it was the time we went but the lines were HUGE! We caught the elevator up to the cable car, the cable car up to the tower and then the elevator to the observation deck. There are quite a number of stairs and my poor Dad who has bad knees from an old sporting injury was hurting afterwards! It’s definitely a tourist trap, you get up to the observation deck, spend minimal time because it’s so crowded and then wait longer in the line to get back in the elevator to go back downstairs, it hardly seems worth it. Good to go once but wouldn’t be high on my priority list to go again."
Awesome View ,The Hop On & Off Bus makes a stop here. Gorgeous view from the top. It was a great day weather wise. The tulips were in full bloom as well as the cherry blossoms.Don’t forget to use the restroom inside at the top to take in another great view.
For Panoramic View of the City or Enjoy the Sunset Maybe...,They provide a shuttle bus from the subway station. This bus stop in some points and also reach the tower park area. Cost 10.000 Won for observatory deck but I bought online in Klook.com because it's cheaper (half price). Locals bring food and do some picnics in this area. I shd bring food here hahaha... Well in N Seoul Plaza yes there are many restaurant to choose. I eat budaejjigae here and it's delicious.
Cool visit ,What I liked the most about the visit was hiking our way up to the top. It’s a nice walk that rewards you with nice views and a few restaurants. The views from the top are ok although the smog is not helpful. 
Only interesting for the panoramic view,Limited interest as very touristic place with many fast food restaurants and gift shops. The panoramic view is nice by clear weather and you can really see the dimension of the city. To do if you have time to waste but not a must do.
Highlight of the day in the bathrooms!!!,This the best view point location from which all can gaze down on the whole city of Seoul. But our best memories will be of the restrooms. Restrooms were floor to ceiling glass and we got in trouble when there were women in the men's bathroom. The men face out and the women face sideways......totally strange experience.....
Afternoon visitors ,I got here by subway than catch a shuttle bus no3 to come up here. Be there around 3.30 pm I saw some traditional performance. Then walk around the place. I brought the e-ticket from trip.com got some discount. The top of the observer floor you can see the Seoul city in 360 degrees make sure go down there on a clear day! On the way down I walk to the Library direction very nice cherry blossoms trees the biggest tree I have ever seen.
Amazing views when clear skies,On top of the tower one will be amazed by the size of this world city. It's just incredible.Really love to go here when I am in the city.
Splendid City Views,"This tower used to be among the tallest in Asia. Going to the tower itself would be a steep uphill climb . You will be rewarded with awesome views of the city before you enter this attraction. The elevator going to the observatory point is a breeze, and is quite fast. But with many people converging with tour groups, it is hard to move around inside. We later had dinner one level below , and it is a buffet highlighting Korean cuisine. If you have time, it is worth spending time here. But avoid going down at the same time with other tourists, expect a long line in doing so. Nice to take photos of the tower at daytime and night time."
nice especially for lovers,This place is very nice specially for lovers. It has a view overseeing the city which is very beautiful. Nice place for picture taking. Senior citizens will find it a little bit challenging to climb. Must see when visiting korea.
Amazing view,This place is totally worth going up to. The 360 view of the city is fantastic! There is plenty of room for everyone to get a view.
Fun outing,We rode the gondola to the top of the hill and enjoyed the views from Seoul Tower. The souvenir shop and the teddy bear shop were favorites. We hiked down and enjoyed the vistas along the way.
Skip if no extra time to spare,The only nice thing is rows of cherry blossom trees going up the to the place on the bus shuttle There are small shops selling ice cream and beverages at the outside of the tower
Take a cable car,We took the cable car to Namsan park. It was a uphill climb to the cable car station. The view at the lower deck is sufficient for us. We did not go to the observation deck. Be there early to avoid the crowds as there were bus loads of tourist when we left the place at around 11 plus. There are three buses available at the bus stop which can bring you to selected train stations. 
N Tower Seoul. Namsan City Night view ,"Well, we do not choose to go up by skycab. we walk up from Namsan park. it was a right decision we made! Namsan park is abeautiful park and nice place to see sunset. we visited during the evening. and when reach the N tower, the night view of Namsan City really make us feel great! in cold, looking at the nice city night view, feel like you empty your mind. i think it is one of the best spot for city night view sightseeing in Seoul"
 Nice view,"Nice view. This is up at the top of a mountain. The area has the Lovelocks corner where you see a lot of padlocks put by couples and you can even put one too. There's a store there selling love locks. There's also the beacons, and the tower itself which you can go up using an elevator. At the top, the view is nice. You get to see the city view. There are also a lot of souvenir shops and food stalls at the top of the tower. At the top is a little small so you may notice there are a lot of people beside you.Going to the location: Make sure you're prepared to walk uphill here. Maybe 10-15 mins walk, as the bus cant go up any higher. Also make sure not to let your children run down this hill because one of the people in our tour group had let her children ran off and they came rolling downhill. Good thing there were people who managed to catch the child. But please be careful with your children going up or down the hill."
Excellent Viewing Point That You Shouldn't Miss,Seoul Tower is an excellent viewing point. You will have a nice view of Seoul from the base of the tower even if you do not choose to take the elevator to the top. It is quite crowded on the weekends. On the weekends they usually have a small flea market there in late afternoon. The best way to get to Seoul Tower is by cable car. Buying a round trip ticket will be cheaper. 
Dirty windows,Sad impressions from the observation place with so dirty windows (at a sunny week). Forget abour taking professional photos here. Enter price is cheaper online (search on klook). 
Worth a visit ,The North Seoul tower is the best way to see the city and the amazing views around Seoul.Take the gondola/ cable car up which is near Myeong-dong Metro station and you are taken to tower base within 10 minutes.The views at the base of the tower are stunning but you get the full 360 view from the top of the tower.In all a worthwhile few hours
Totally worthless,The view is great but the 90 minutes que to lower elevator and 60 minutes que at the top is not worth it.Go there and enjoy the view from the lower deck for free.
"Efficient, cheap, gives great perspective ",A cheap morning or afternoon activity that’s allows you to appreciate the scale and density of the city that is Seoul.They run a tight ship here: you are up top in no time. I recommend booing via Klook and simply scanning your pass at a machine to print a ticket; saves a line up. 
N Seoul Tower ,"I took the challenge to hike up for about 3 kms to and from N Seoul Tower.Once you reach the top, the magnificent view of the city from afar is worth the climb. "
Cute love lock area 🤗,"This is a must visit place for couples, friends, families and even singles. The place is full of love lock and the stores sell all these items. Good to read what people write from all around the world. Lots of tourists and locals. Very good vibe."
Great views on clear days,"Get your bearings for this vast city from the top. Take the cable car up, and a slow walk down with memorable views of the city. Specially during spring blossom period."
Great view!!,"N Seoul tower is a great way of viewing Seoul. Cheap, very accessible thru bus or hop on hop off bus. We used our Seoul pass to enter. There's a restaurant, gift shop and of course their observatory viewing floor. Try to use their washroom, even in there you will be enjoying the view. You can also rent hanbok and get your picture taken thru their photographer. I forgot how much is the picture but it's a reasonable price."
Seoul breathtaking!❤,"The walk towards the tower may seem exhausting at first but once you get to the place and see the view of Seoul, you regain all that drained energy The view is definitely breathtaking ❤ The only thing I disliked about it was that we were on a tour group so we had little time to savor the beautiful weather up there as well as the stunning view of the city. Oh well, there is always a next time "
Nice view of the city,"We visited the Namsan Tower as part of a voucher deal we purchased. The walk up the mountain looked like a lovely and peaceful hike but not an easy climb therefore we took the easy route up via cable car. Visit early in the morning to avoid the crowds however the view can still be obscured by morning mist, so beware! During the time we were in the observatory the mist partly cleared therefore we were rewarded with wonderful views. The windows of the observatory tell you in which directly many cities are and the distance. However, we would of liked to have signs pointing out the Seoul landmarks, such as bridges etc as we spent time trying to find these.The love locks are a beautiful attraction. You don’t need lock you padlock as soon as you see the main bulk of them on the walk up as there are places to lock them all over the site.A must do activity when visiting Seoul!"
nice experience,Seeing the whole Korea was fun. Travelling through cable car is more fun too. Lots of restaurant to choose from is a plus.
Nice view on Seoul,"It was an overwhelming experience to see the downtown Seoul especially in the middle of the night when the city lights are colourful, we also managed to send a postcard to the post box right at the observation deck. Thanks to Klook we managed to get a discount price and save a time."
Great views of city yes it’s worth it,I usually shy from expensive tower attractions that involve several intervals lining up in queues. Mid morning and midday really was not bad for the lines. We had no more than 10 minute waits. You absolutely MUST go to the bathroom as both genders have private bathroom views!
Amazing view,I It ride on the shuttle bus (5002) in dongdaemon station and from there it was just 15mins. It was 10pm already when I’ve got here but thanks to the management they still let me in and used my voucher. I thought it was not crowded but there still a lot of tourist and locals are going here. 
Weektrip Seoul,"Nice place to visit including the surrounding park, an oasis of peace in a huge city. Magnificent view over Seoul ( with clear sky ) You can go either by cable car which is not that impressive or from the other side by bus or taxi directly from metro station meyoudong which costs only about 5000 Won"
"Nice view, but oh my word, the queues!!!","Well, what to say really? Yes, it's obvious what the place is, it's a VERY popular tower on top of a mountain with viewing platform and restraunts up there. An yes, Korean restraunt up there was really nice and I'll review that separately. But as for the tower, the queue for the cable car up was easily 30 minutes, problems more like 40 plus, and this was a Sunday night. Don't be fooled by the queue for the tickets on ground level, that's just the start of your long, long quest to the top of the building, to get the cable car to the top of the mountain. I call it a quest, as it's almost something worthy of two small hobbits. I had read reviews that mentioned the queues, however I didn't quite read in enough detail to prepare for the queues that lay ahead, and I'm British, we're known for queueing, but I now think we should be handing that title for the Koreans.Then, once you finally get on the cable car and get to the top of the mountain, you can stop and have a look at the views from there, and then queue a further 40 minutes for the lifts up the tower proper. Now a good tip here, is to book a restaurant package to go up the tower, as this skips the lift queue up for you.View from the top is nice, but without the restaurant meal, it would have menat 80 minutes plus of queueing to get there.Then, to come down, repeat all the queuing again, so it was 40 miuntes to the bottom of the tower, which sadly the restaurant meal does not enable you to skip, and then another 40 minutes for the cable car. I know there's a bus to the top that misses the cable car, and we didn't try those so can't comment. If you're feeling adventurous, you can also climb the mountain on foot, althouh we thought that for an evening dinner out that might be a bit much.Overall a nice view, if you patient enough for the queues."
Nice Stop,"This was a nice stop. At your leisure you can walk from the bus stop up to the Seoul Tower. My son and I were looking forward to the Cable Car but when we go to the top, we found out it was closed. We were so disappointed.... Anyways ...we just walked around the viewing area and watched a Korean demo and display. We also had lunch in one of the few restaurant they have inside the tower."
Beautiful view,Fresh air and awesome view! Staying up there in the morning with sunset is just beautiful. It’s a bit cold for this time but worth it! You will have an overall view over Seoul 
Good city views,N Seoul tower and the surrounding Namsan park and gardens provide a nice break from the busy city. Enjoy a walk through the gardens up to the tower or take the cable car.
Great view on a clear day.,Nothing spectacular about the tower itself however on a clear day you can see all of Seoul and the surrounding areas and mountains. It is a must to visit the toilets which have a clear glass wall and a wonderful View.
N Seoul Tower wow!,We took the bullet elevator all the way to the observation deck and it lasted only 38 seconds or less. One would hardly feel it because there's a video showing on the ceiling while it's going up. The best part of being on the observation deck is the ladies' comfort room. One wall is entirely made of clear glass and you'll see Seoul while you use the commode. Weird but great experience! We were also able to do the lovelocks and it was fun!
Great view,Great view good for tourist to spent time here =DHave variety of food too and money changer if u need.
Look upon the City of Seoul from the N Tower,You can ride the cable car from Myungdong near Sinsegae Dept. store or ride city bus which is easier at the bus stop located just in front of from Namsan Hanok Village or Daehan Cinema at Chungmooro metro station.
Great View of the City,"My husband and I hiked up to Seoul Tower. It was a bit of hike; however, the result was great. The view of the city was great even though it was a bit cloudy. There are several restaurants to choose from. Great for a few hours our of your day!"
Nice view from the bottom of Seoul tower.,"We didn’t pay for the tickets to go up since the view from the bottom was already nice.I took the cable car up to Seoul tower. There were so people walk up which was free and they can also saw the view while they were walking. We took the cable car down and there was a lift took us to the street. (See the last photo). Overall, it’s worthy to have a look while we were in Seoul."
Spectacular City View,"The second highest point in Seoul city, this tower provides a gorgeous view of the city at night. The observation deck at the top provides a dazzling cityscape from the glass windows and houses a souvenir shop. While exiting the tower, I also came across the row of Love Padlock trees and heart shaped chairs, which seemed to be quite popular with the couples visiting the tower."
Great view,We went at night time and it was a lovely clear evening so the view was good. You catch the cable car up. If you are a senior 65 or over you get a discount. The locks of love are there and there must be millions of them. It should take you no more than an hour ago do this activity.
First visit to Seoul,"We are from the United States, so we're not able to really plan this visit around the weather. If you go, be sure to go on a clear day. We were lucky to have great visibility the day we went. The ""locks of love"" was great as well. We had no idea about it before going, and. were able to participate in it by adding a lock for us. Worth going for sure!"
"Great to do once, but there's not much to it after that.","I've been here twice, once in the evening and once in the day. From the entrance to the tower, you can appreciate the cityscape of Seoul and it's a great view. It doesn't cost much to go up the tower (only 10000 KRW per person, plus there is a bundle of 2 popcorns + 2 beers for 26000 KRW which we availed of). The top of the tower itself was quite small, in terms of circumference. Only housing a candy store and a souvenir shop were located at the main viewing deck, with a non-advertised coffee shop at the lower floor which we would've gone to and stayed at if we had only known (they're the only accessible non-restaurant establishment with seats). It was a great experience but it's more than enough to go up the tower once, no need to do it again and again."
"Okay, depends on the smog","I'm sure the views would be nice if it weren't for the smog. 360 views of the city available. Avoid the souvenir shop. Utter rip off. Was charged 9,500 won x 4 for four cards to send to folks back home. That's almost $40 USD!! I'm honestly horrified that they charge such prices, but promised some folks I would send a card. Never again. "
Great view of Seoul,"The tower experience itself is quite good. IMHO however, the Seoul skyline isn't particularly striking (e.g. compared to Busan). There are enough interesting things to eat and explore around the tower as well to spend a couple of hours.Tip: be sure to check out the restroom on the lower observation deck 4F! :)"
Superb experience ,Although the queue is quite long but on the top of the tower the 360 degree view is just fantastic! Beautiful place for sunset.
Beautiful view,Very happy we made it to this attraction. We got here during sunset and it was great. Very busy though so beware of people
Great Views!!,We went on a nice sunny clear day and were able to see all around the city. I recommend getting the beer and popcorn adult package (you can take it up with you).
Nice to visit,"You can get a good view of Seoul at both the bottom and the top. That is because the tower is located on a mountain that is at one of the highest points in Seoul. Walking up the mountain is a nice way to get there, but there are also buses from Seoul Station to get to the top of the mountain."
Hello Kitty Island inside N Seoul Tower,"Went to N Seoul Tower for the 3rd time already..never fails to amaze me. My faves there are visiting the Hello Kitty Island & the Locks of Love. So easy to go there from Myeongdong, just ride Bus 05. Always enjoyed my experience in N Seoul Tower! Till next time!"
Very good walk up the mountain ,Got up at 5:30an to hike from Meyongdong to the top. Amazing views along the way. Very physically draining. You will need to be pretty fit to make. Well worth it when you get to the top. Took me an hour up and 30 mins down. Which included breaks to take photos. Cable car wasn’t working when I was there but I still would have walked as it didn’t open till later. Lots of CCTV cameras so felt safe in the dark. 
Nice,This could be a very romantic place to visit. Views are great although it was extremely hazy on the day we visited. Not sure how it looks at night but I bet its very nice. You can hike up or take the cable car. It’s definitely a worthwhile visit while in Seoul
Tiring yet Good ,"My family of 4 stayed near Seoul Tower and made the mistake of choosing to walk to the tower. From the map, we are just less than 800m away to the tower. But the walk to the tower took us nearly an hour. The 1st part was just a uphill walk, quite tiring but managable. The 2nd part are mostly steps. We saw lots of cars parking at the end of the 1st part and some cars parked at the tower. From some reviews, we gathered there is a bus which we could have taken.The view on top was great. The space at the observatory is not big and I was surprised to see quite a no of people. There are quite a few restaurants and cafes at the tower. We went to Owl's Cutlet and the food was great."
good view of seoul city,"we took the Namsan Circular Bus (yellow bus no 05) up to the top of the mountain, it was the cheapest mode to get there (other than hiking up on your own). the view from the namsan mountain was spectacular."
Best Observation Tower in the World!,"Having visited quite a number of these towers, this is by far the best!The tower itself is not as tallest but the atmosphere within and around is unbeatable.The endless number of padlocks and viewpoints make this a special place.Once up the tower you get great views of the city! You can easily spend 2/3 hours here! "
Locks of love- Rare and fun spot to view the city at night,"If you’re into city views, I recommend visiting Seoul Tower. Unlike the typical skyscraper in every major city; Seoul Tower somehow engages the tourist by setting up multiple activities to partake along the way up. There’s multiple platforms to sit or take pictures prior to entering Seoul tower. Also, there’s love locks attached to the fence panels. Travelers could take bus or the Gondola (~$10 USD) up to Seoul Tower.Key Note: If you arrive late near closing time, the gondola that takes you down will have a long line. If you want to enjoy your date night and stay up late at night; you could always take the bus down. It's safe but it's a longer wait for the bus."
Beautiful and romantic,"Seoul Tower or N Seoul Tower is one of the most romantic attractions that many couples have. The couple must come to lock the keys together. And also has a beautiful view point Have convenient travel The entrance fee is not expensive. People are friendly, cute and Has a very clean place."
N Seoul Tower,"N Seoul Tower is one of the major tourist attractions of Seoul. Considered one of the most beautiful towers in Asia. Is a place that has beautiful and varied lighting. There is a restaurant on the tower that will turn around every 48 minutes, named N Grill. When going up to the tower to see the beautiful scenery."
nice but overrated.,"if you have been to other higher places in world, this doesn't give you that adrenaline rush. bt still, its good for one time visit and those love locks are good for romantic evenings."
Romantic,Actual fact is a quite romantic tower to go especially for couples who want to lock their love up on the tower. Is beautiful view from the top and breathtaking too.
Nice view,"Whether it is due to time constraints or the weather is too cold/cloudy, N Seoul Tower is your alternative to Building 63.With the Seoul Discover Pass, you'll get to enter the Observatory Deck for free and get 30 degrees view of the city.The surrounding areas at the feet of the tower are nice for photo ops. Just gotta find the right spots. "
Great and cold,"We loved our time climbing from Meong Dong to the tower, great to make you feel warm, as the snow just fell the night before. We loved the view and the landscape."
Great place with great view,I love the cable car ride to the top of the mountain. I love the magnificent view of Seoul from the mountain. The tower is interesting and sell many things from food to souvenirs
Fianlly got there,Every previous visit to Seoul had been cloudy or rainy meaning the tower was not good to visit. This time was a beautiful sunny day and worth the visit.We went up to the tower in the cable car which was fun in itself.
Look up!,"Overlooking Seoul at N seoul tower despite the very cold weather the place, the view,the scenery was beautiful. There were restaurants as well to chill out until night-time. And couples lock their ""padlock of love"" onto the railing and to dream that their love will last forever."
Average place,"I visited Seoul tower with my friends. It's just the view from the tower. But due to glass reflection, was not able to click good pics. Just an average place. "
"Overrated, but walking down is perfect!! ","If you want a perfect view, take the cable car up to the base of the Seoul Tower, and walk down the trail to the national library. It is around 860m, with a stopby to see the view. We went there at 2000hrs. Very nice.Seoul tower itself, going up, you wouldn't see best view, although you can see a smaller version of Seoul through unwashed windows. Up there, you can only go in a circle, and buy souvenirs. For me it's overrated.Check my pictures I've attached for the view I was talking about. "
Breathtaking night view,"We went there at night.....It was a freezing night, we took the cable car (1-2 min ride). When we got there, we saw the whole city and the night view is absolutely beautiful!!!! Highly recommend to all travellers, you should visit at least once in your life time! P. S. Some souvenirs shop there u can buy some postcards, ‘the couple locks’ thing...also, restaurant and cafe...."
Hike to N Seoul Tower,"From Hyatt Hotel you can hike going up the tower, there is a road not frequently taken but if you love nature you will like the view...30min -1hr hike depending on your pace. It is best to bring water and wear proper hiking clothes. The 800m mark going left and 1400m mark going right was confusing, so in between we walked up where you will see a small trail near a house...just use gps, and follow direction where the tower is."
Overhyped,"One of the place that I looked forward so much, but, ended up being so disappointed. It did not appear as charming and nice as my expectation. Ticket is a little on the pricier side as well, but, the hike up to the N tower was worth it, the view of Seoul from above is just breathtaking "
Good place to see the skyline of seoul,"Built on a mountain, Seoul tower is a quite high place in Seoul. People can see the skyline of Seoul and enjoy the food meanwhile. However, I have to admit I prefer the skyline of Tokyo or Hong Kong. There are no so many skyscrapers in Seoul compared with the two cities. Also. It is a little far away from the highest skyscrapers like lotte world tower. So I don’t think there may be best places to see the seoul’ skyline.People can arrive at the tower by the cable car instead of climbing the mountain."
Just another big city high viewpoint,"This is one of those obligatory attractions in any city you visit to get a bird's eye view of the city & its layout. Visiting in Feb when the temperature stayed below 5 degC meant we needed to take the cable car up. It was a good experience, and not too expensive. Surprisingly, there was quite a number of visitors but it wasn't very crowded. So the cafe and various F&B places were comfortable.The only issue is that the windows were not fully clean and so it was impossible to get a good selfie picture, or any good pictures for that matter."
Tower of lights,Visited Seoul tower at nite and presented with delightful displace of light show bathing the tower and lights from surrounding structures down below. Mesmerising!
"N. Seoul Tower, Namsan Park, Seoul, South Korea.","Timing is everything it seems when it comes to visiting outdoor attractions in the winter. During my visit to Seoul in February, I enjoyed some spectacular, clear and sunny days. However, on those good viewing days my schedule would not permit a visit here to the N. Seoul Tower, located within Namsan Park, here in Seoul, South Korea. Then I looked into taking a tour to the N. Seoul Tower. The price was prohibitive. However the booking agent for the tour told me that their bus would go to the base of the N. Seoul Tower. My friends who live here said that you have to walk up a long walk to get to the base of the tower.So I hired a taxi and off we went on a dark, gray, overcast and snowy day to see the N. Seoul Tower. I expected the taxi would take me to the top, to the base of the tower. This was not the case at all. I saw the snow covered walk leading up a hill and had to decline a visit.Disappointing? Yes indeed. But my timing was lousy and I had to be at the airport and won't have another chance to visit the N. Seoul Tower until who knows when. What is the point of this review? I strongly recommend that you DO NOT OPT TO VIEW THE N. Seoul Tower on an day with inclement weather."
A Must-See at Night But Be Aware...,"This is definitely a must-see attraction at night. This is no doubt about it. The views are just stunning, amazingly colorful and bright. But be aware that you when you take the cable car, the price does not include the observation deck of the N Seoul Tower. It’s only less than USD$10, but I thought I was getting a packaged deal when purchasing my cable car ticket."
What a great way to spend an afternoon/evening,"This is a wonderful place from which to view Seoul. We enjoyed strolling the grounds, taking in the views, trying some virtual reality, seeing all the love locks, and then taking the elevator up the tower. Do make a reservation if you want to eat at one of the two 'real restaurants' otherwise you can get a wonderful burger or coffee/dessert at one the self-serve type spots. Walking down the path at night was lovely--seeing the city lit up at night was just beauriful. Not exactly accessible for those with mobility challenges."
Great view,Short waiting time A bit steep and I’m not sure it’s suutable for people with a disability in parts . Cracking views 
cool,very nice view by the way on top of the hill some small kiosks with refreshing drink and foodeasy access
Beautiful views but very busy,"I love that N Seoul Tower has some seemingly random combo tickets. A trip up the tower with pizza and beer anyone?It made the experience more fun and it did seem like you got more bang for your buck. Like most of these kinds of attractions (Empire State Building, CN Tower, Space Needle, Venice's Campanile) it is way more crowded than you might be led to believe from pictures, movies etc... but I still think it was worth it. The atmosphere at night was fun and the views were gorgeous. "
Be prepared to queue,Queues for >1 hour to boardand the cablecar with people cutting queues. A better system could be in place.
Beautiful Scenery,"Had a great trip to N Seoul tower. We walked all the way to Shinsegae mall, turned left, and walked about 5 mins, we took the elevator provided. Because it was freezing so we gave up walking up the hill all the way to the tower.. we took the cable car instead. The view was spectacular especially during the winter. We brought our own keypad lock because they’re selling for much a higher price at the tower. Overall, the experience was great and we enjoyed it. "
A walk around Seoul Tower,The view overlooking Seoul is better at sunset. The tower in itself is more impressive at night with all the lights. Take the Namsan cable up to have the full experience. :)
Good view of Seoul!!,"A must visit place for us since its like an SOP whenever we visit another country. Go to their tower! N Seoul Tower didn’t disappoint us. It was a short cable car ride up and when you get there they have the Lovelock platform where visitors make a wish in a padlock and lock it in the railings. It’s pretty cool and the place is filling up..I wonder what it would be like in the next 10 years. Since it’s winter when we visited, it was freezing to the point you really wanna get out of there. We decided not to go to the tower itself and just enjoyed the view of Seoul in the viewing platform. It’s a good place to visit especially if you’re in Seoul for a very short visit. They have different tickets for the cable car ride and different ticket going in to the tower. Quite expensive but you can just stay in the viewing platform and enjoy the view."
Love keys are all around,A mixture of colorful love keys and skies made it nice picture. Get cable car (recommended return-way) to get there. do not forget to try yummy hot fish-cake in the winter time on the way back...
Couple from Australia,"We took the cable cart up to N Seoul Tower.We didn't actually go inside however just walked around, took in the spectacular views. We then chose to walk back down and not take the cable car down as we enjoy walking. It was a nice walk and along the way there was a cool free workout park. there was multiple bench press', sit up benches, weight machines etc. We stopped and did a 45 minute workout before continuing back down the hill, "
Yolanda Jones ,The views from the tower is amazing birds eye view of the city. At night the city looks spectacular. Loads of restaurants and shops and the sunset from there is beautiful.
Just another lookout,"I’m not quite sure what all the fuss is about. We had to do an uphill walk to the base of the cable car for $10 each, then pay another $10 each to go up the observatory which essentially gives you a city view not unlike any other big cities. Lots of stairs and walking, not worth the effort. "
Good view of Seoul,Good place to see Seoul 360 degree. Not a crowded place even during Christmas period. Will go again in different seasons.
Namsan Tower for Aerial view of Soul,"I tried going up to the tower by hiking. Do not start hiking later in the afternoon. It became cold and dark. So i abandoned the hike and tried again the next day. 2nd attempt was by taking the bus from Chungmuro St, exit 2. Shuttle bus no 02. Only 1,200 won. Straight up to the tower. The view was magnificent, very cold, did not buy locks to lock away my romance. Few restaurants, souvenir stores and my favourite Olive Young store. Saw few elderly people had their morning walk up to the tower. Such a Refreshing site.Must visit this place. Try using the cable which i could not find at that time."
360 view of Seoul,Nice sunny day so we got good 360 view of Seoul. Went there on Friday morning so it was not that crowded. We took bus 02 from Hanok Village which took us directly up to N Seoul Tower and later took bus 03 which took us to our next destination which was Itaewon. Very convenient
Expensive entrance fee but good experience,"Went there to celebrate my birthday. Fees for cable car, observatory deck and other attractions are quite expensive however, your Seoul tour won't be complete if you don't go to this famous tower."
Nice view from the top,"From Myeongdong subway station, you can easily walk your way up a steep road to the cable car station that will bring you up the tower. The cable car comes in frequency of 10 minutes and will be filled to its max capacity with people. My family went in the evening and saw the sunset. Also, the good part about going in the evening is that you get to see the day view & also the night view. Objectively, I do not find the view from the top especially amazing. But nonetheless still scenic. I am guessing most people go to see/put their couple lock. There is a mall there that sells souveniors, food and other things too."
"Woo,,,, I can view 360 degree seoul city,","We went up to the observatory in 30 seconds, we can viewing 360 degree city.blue house, yeoui-do, han-river and many bridge on river too.I taken many pictures at there.I was veteran, and I also got discount on admission fees.I was sorry that I could not take night tour. I would like to have a night tour at next opportunity."
Seoul view,"Dubbed as the ‘must-see’ site in Seoul and a part of all tour packages, the tower seems to be overrated. Packed with a lot of tourists, long waiting line. Btw, it does offer a great view of Seoul by night."
What a view!,"The Seoul Tower is an absolute must, particularly at night! It gives you a 360 degree view of the city with its brilliant twinkling lights. The signs that indicate what cities lay in which direction are helpful in establishing your spot in the world. It's a treat!"
Never visit N Seoul Tower on Holiday evenings,"I think I will never visit N Seoul Tower again, at least not on holiday evenings.Reason 1-- terrible waiting time spent20 minutes: for the escalator up to the cable car ticket booth80 minutes: for getting the cable car tickets and getting on the cable car30 minutes: for entering the tower ( They limited and controlled the total numbers of visitors up on the bird view area.)In a word, it took me more than two hours to get to the bird view area.....Reason 2-- poor quality of viewingOn the windows were stains left by visitors. Besides, the reflection from the lights of the stores were annoying.I have no idea whether a daytime visit during week days will be pleasant or not. However, I'm sure I wouldn't like to visit N Seoul Tower on holiday evenings again."
Get ready to walk up the hill!! ,Not suitable for elderly people that can’t walk far and up the hill. The parking space for vehicles are way down the hill. But it’s a beautiful place if it’s not raining and foggy.
Must go!,We went there before sunset and manage to see Seoul from above coming alove with the lovely lights! Plenty of beautiful photo worthy shots in the changing light.
"Nice View, long wait","Nice veiw over Seoul, but a very long wait for the elevator. Visit the skybar and enjoy the veiw. It must have been one of the most expensive touristattractions in Seoul. Still worth a visit."
Great view ,"Great view of the whole of Seoul but not much to do up in the tower for the price we paid (W10.000). Nevertheless, it was still a nice experience. I would recommend going up half an hour before sunset so that one can catch the view of Seoul both in the day and night view. There’s also a postbox and postcards and stamps sold in the tower so that you can write and send postcards from the top of Seoul ;)"
a mandatory tourist destination for you in Seoul,"enjoying the sights of Seoul city from a height, is the icon of Seoul city. the love padlock is an attraction for tourists visiting here. facilities available both even for parents and even pregnant women because there is a cable car available"
Lock & get lost,"If you are couple, don’t forget to bring lock or you can buy it upstairs. Buy the lock at the entrance of cable car will be cheaper then upstairs.I went there through cable car. It’s great and enough for me. We don’t go to the top of the tower.But playing around at the bottom is enough (at least for me), there are several restaurant that you can choose."
The queue omg,"I went here with a couple of my local friends, the queue though omgosh. We went there around 7pm and the queue was superrrr long. I don’t think I’m gonna revisit. The view at night is nice but I won’t spend Another hours standing in long queue like that for just looking at Seoul’s view at night. "
Must go,You must go there and remind you to try the lunch buffet at the lower level. The price is very good. Just around $16 in the Canadian dollar. The other lunch buffet is double this price. Please try to go there on a sunny day when the view is good too.
A must see in Seoul,Stunning view from the top. A little bit expensive for me. Food is also good. Things selling here is pricey
Crowded & no taxis!,We came here in the evening on a Friday night and it was crowded! There’s also no taxis that we could take to go back to our hotel because we had been on a DMZ tour that day & just want to get back to the hotel as soon as we could. I think it would be better to come here during the day. 
Great View and Walk,N Seoul Tower is an excellent place to visit with family and friends for any occasion because offers a great view day and night to the city of Seoul. The Tower is on top of a mountain and allows the opportunity to go for a walk and observe a large forest around the mountain plus having a delicious treat before going to the top of the Tower. Once on top of the Tower you can take some pictures of the city and buy some souvenirs.
Great views,You can walk to the tower but its hard up hill.we got the cable car with was 9500won each but well worth it .before you go up the tower you can take nice photos of seoul.it costs 10000won each to get the lift to the top of the tower.the views are great seeing all seoul right back to the mountains.you can walk round the platform 360degree.there are lots of shops cafe and places to eat but a little bit pricey.it would be hard for a wheelchair.but a must thing to do if your in seoul.
Love locked at N Seoul Tower,"Been visiting Korea for two consecutive years and wasnt able to visit this top spot in Korea snd frlt the need to come back and see this beauty ,so I did not want to miss seeing this the second time and I love it! Very picturesque"
cool spot to visit,"I spent 24 hours in Seoul and this was the first place I went. It was night, and really cold, but the view is good, you can see quite a lot of Seoul and the surrounding area. It's a very popular place, and there are lines to do basically everything, like take the cable car to the top of the park, take the elevator up to the observation deck in the tower, and take the elevator back down."
Cable ride is better,"Having been here twice ; first via coach stop which required visitors to walk up a very steep road up, then took cable ride, I can say that cable ride is more fun and offer better view. KLOOK voucher exchange can be done at Level 5 via few machines. Easy."
"Freezing in winter, great view of the city","We went at night on 2018 Boxing Day and it was freezing! There is a long line for the cable car going up / down but it's well supervised and no pushing & shoving - everyone seemed rather civilised and it made the wait bearable. About a 15 minute wait in line either way. You get a good view of the city from the top of the mountain. We didn't go up the Tower (tickets were very pricey but I don't recall the exact price).The usual souvenir shop and some eateries at the top, go up if you enjoy the view.One can also opt to walk up / down and I would've considered the walk down if I had time to spare, it would have been pleasant in the cold.Word of warning though - heaps of taxis waiting at the foothill but do ask if they will use the meter - the first few we asked refused and quoted ridiculous fixed prices - we refused and on the 3rd attempt got one that was willing to go my metered prices. We went in a group of 12 and on average it took 3 tries to get taxis that were honest - so it's possible."
A Visit to N Seoul Tower,"This is quite a nice place to visit. Taking cable car, one can view Seoul areas. If you are challenging, I would suggest you to walk down in order to appreciate more about Seoul. However, the best time to visit this place is evening after 4pm when the sun on the other side and you can take beautiful pictures. Enjoy."
Not cheap but worth a visit ,"Cable car return tickets cost 8,500 won per person and entrance fee to the actual tower was an additional 10,000 won per person. The elevator had an entertaining projection on the ceiling while going up for 30 seconds. The views from the top of the hill are definitely worth it because Seoul is a clean and attractive, easy to look at city. The windows of the observation deck have names of other world cities and distances to them so you can have your photos taken by ‘your’ home name. Even the toilet cubicles have a view! The restaurants at the observation deck are overpriced so just wait until you go out to the terrace where there are several coffee shops, ice creamery and a couple of average restaurants. We spent some 2 hours all in all. Better to buy a one way cable car ticket and walk down the nice paved path. "
Stunning views from Seoul towers,Visited this place as part of a tour package and spent about 1 hour here. The view from Seoul tower is amazing and we were lucky as it was a clear day. The elevator had a nice ceiling video while bringing us up and down. Worth a visit if you are nearby. 
Another Tower ,"It takes about 10-15mins walk from Myeong-dong to reach the elevator which will bring up to the cable car station. The cost for round trip for cable car was 8000krw. Upon reaching the top of the hill, you could decide if you want to go up the tower. Even if you decide not to go up, you will still get a good view and there are lots of places for taking photos. Just like most of the towers, you get panoramic view of the city at the top of the tower. The ride up the tower was interesting with the display on the ceiling of the elevator. "
Touristy but very beautiful ,The N Seoul Tower is a very touristy spot on top of a hill but even though it‘s quite expensive I‘d recommend it to everyone. The place is especially nice for couples because there is a spot where you can buy „love locks“ and hang them up for good luck in a relationship.Was nice and I‘d definetly recommend it for couples.
Overlooked korea,Spend my time at the Seoul tower....a lot of places you can go once you reached on top via the cable car...Nice view...Reccomended for all...
May opt to ride bus to tower,"You can pay for the cable car, round trip or one way, or you can ride the bus to and fro the tower. The cable car is nothing special, but it is very convenient. We enjoyed N Seoul tower, the view, the locks, the open space and especially the free hanbok wearing."
COLD AND CROWDED,We visited this place during winter and I honestly dont have a feel for shopping that time because it was too cold for asian born in tropical country. The best thing that you can do here during winter is to have a taste of its street foods
Great time having a cup of coffee with great view,"We took a bus up to the mountain followed by a stroll up the slope to the tower. We could view the city not only from the observatory deck but also from the toilet while doing business! It’s interesting! Once done going round seeing city from all angles, you could order a cup of coffee, sit by the window and enjoy the drink plus views! Very relaxing!The sight of love locks makes you wonder why people locked their love there? Isn’t that ....."
Beautiful view ,"We made journey but it was worth it. They view is phenomenal, especially at night seeing the palaces lighten up. Very polite people who were guides. Advise anybody that is going to wear sneakers. It is a good hike"
See the whole city!,"I personally think the visit is worth the price. Had a hotel in Myeongdong, so all I had to do was to take a lift to the cable car place.You should visit when the sun is setting, so you'll see Seoul during night, dusk and day. The inside of the tower is really crowded during that time though.You can send postcards directly from the tower, which I recommend."
The best thing of Seoul in my opinion.,"I think Seoul is an identical metropolis. It is green , not tall city like suburban or something like that. But it is really a metro , full of many transportation and technology. Actually I don't like to pay for climbing to see view in high rises like this. And some time it was disappointment. This time I had read reviews in this Tripadvisor and finally went to. From above , you will see this green metropolis clearly. It was beautiful. In fact the ticket for transportation itself is not expensive. But if you want to challenge yoursef , you may climb to the base of the tower with your own feet."
must go!,"favourite part were the love locks !! i loved being so high up and the view was so beautiful, spent 3 hours taking beautiful pictures here"
Currency Exchange,"There is a currency exchange machine located behind the Twosome Coffee and beside the restroom.Reminder:You need to bring your passport because they will scan it for the limit amount you can only exchange. (I don’t actually know how they do this. Wow Korea)The rate is higher than the ones we found at the Incheon International Airport. (i.e. 939/939.50 Airport, 100.05 N Seoul Tower)"
A little pricey ,The experience was great but the cable car ride only gets you to the bottom of the tower and then you have to pay again to go to the top of the tower. We only ride the cable car because we waited 45 minutes to ride and then it was going to be another 70 minute wait to ride to the top of the tower. 
Beautiful view of Seoul ,Can view how the city is divided by the river. Contrast of old and new building. Meantime have the famous corner of locks.. u can see messages of people to their love 1 or couple. Since we follow tour. We don't have much time to walk around and read but we have nice view as you can see from my pictures. Love the winter view. Imaging it full with snow. Even more lovely.
Beautiful panoramic view of Seoul,"Entering the structure through a LED tunnel was amazing! Going up the observatory through the elevator was an experience itself with the short video clip watched on the elevator ceiling. The whole of Seoul can be seen at every level of the tower but best at the observatory, and even through the bathroom! A must-visit place in Seoul!"
City views,"We took a short cable car to the base of the tower since we had a stroller, but it would be a nice walk. We did not go up into the tower but the base was a large park area with nice views of the city and mountains. "
Great views of Seoul,"A trip up N Seoul Tower ensures you appreciate the size and area of Seoul. Even after spending a few days here, we had no idea of the scale of Seoul until we went up the Tower."
Cold !!! -16 to 20c ,"Had an ir temp handheld for this trip. First time to get a headache from the weather haha Kids love it , just be sure to be prepared especially if reaching night time. Ate at n burger for dinner :-)"
Nice hike up the hill,This area is walking distance from the Myeong-dong area (about 15-20 mins). You then have the option to ride a cable car up or to walk up to the Tower. The cable car is just a few minute ride so we opted to walk. It takes about 30 minutes to walk up (much longer for us as we kept stopping to take pictures of the view!). We did not enter the tower itself (there is a fee) but we enjoyed the scenery at the top. There are some restaurants at the bottom of the tower. 
Cool but be prepared to wait.,"This was nice to visit but will take you a bit of time (would recommend about 2-3 hours total).If you choose to take the gondola up (most popular option, you can walk which is about 30 minutes but not sure what the track is like), which will cost you 9,500 won return. We waited in line for about 30 minutes for our tickets, and then there was a further wait time of 40 minutes to actually get on the gondola. The view from the top was lovely."
Similar to all other towers elsewhere,"There was a performance at the plaza area (outside, near the gift shop) where they let spectators try their hand at piercing a bamboo with a spear. Everyone laughed when the warrior (the staff haha) gasped in awe as one of the ladies managed to pierce it successfully :'D He had helped her wedge the bamboo before that. On an unrelated note, the gift shop staff was very stingy with their carrier bag. I know they don't have a culture of giving plastic bags but it's a gift shop at a tourist spot right?"
Definite attraction for tourist ,We had the Discover Seoul Pass and we utilise it got our visit to this atttaction. Easily accessible by the shuttle bus which has several pickup points at several convenient metro stations . Good panoramic view of the city . Prob a must see attraction for tourists 
A must visit but Observatory Tower can give a miss,"We booked the tickets to the observatory tower at N Seoul Tower through Klook as its cost around SGD6.50/pax, much cheaper when compared to purchase onsite. If travelling by taxis, you have to stop at the cable car ticket booth and travelled up by cable car or by bus. Its better to reach around 10am to avoid crowd as the queue for cable car can be long. After getting off the cable car, please proceed to B1 of observatory tower to print your ticket using Klook barcode issued to you. We spent less than 30 mins at Observatory Tower as its very small and crowded. I feels this can give a miss. The love-locked area is good enough for you to walk around and take some decent photos of the views."
Ok if pollution is good that day,Good views only if the smog and pollution have cleared out. Go after a big rain. Buses go to the top but the is no car parking at the top. There is also a crowded cable car that will take you up to the top.
Cherry blossoms,"It was amazing. The cable car was smooth ride. We also tried the stairs even though its high. The park is nicely clean and the flowers were beautiful and colourful. The people were friendly and nice to talk to. I highly recommend this place for people who will visit Seoul, Korea. Top list. "
Nice 360 degree view of the city,Nice place to visit and one of the main attractions in Seoul. Staff are friendly and helpful. From the top of the tower you can get 360 degree view of the city. Love locks is a common couple activity here. N Seoul Tower is mainly used as a broadcast and communications tower.
A lot of climbing,"Wasnt prepared to walk 20 to 30 minutes uphill to reach the cable car station. The station was very packed with 2 car rotating. Quite slow and packed, really packed. The view was fantastis especially it is winter time, cool off the tireness from walking all the way up. "
Amazing Namsan Tower,"You can see Namsan Tower from standing everywhere in Seoul, it's that huge and built on a slope. We went to the very top of this tower, which provides a beautiful 360 degree view of Seoul, South Korea. Another thing that Namsan tower is famous for is locking love locks. There must be million of colorful locks."
Nice place ,"Good place for memories taking photos , have coffee shop and small restaurant you can see nice view of Seoul from there easy access by bus 03/05/04 have 5 floors as well as the shiny lock you can buy lock twin and place it there for good luck in relation that’s ver romantic "
A Tower is a Tower,"This tower is pretty much the same as any tower you find throughout your travels. The unique thing about it is around it. Leading up to the tower are hundreds of locks with couples names on them that are locked on the guard railings. There are some restrictions for those putting theirs up and if you don't follow their rules, your lock will be removed at the end of the night. Good view from the tower of the City but like every other tourist stop, a bit over priced. Entrance fee is separate from the cable car ride getting there. "
Excellent View Of Seoul,"We decided to go up the tower at about 3pm (stayed until 7pm) so that we could view the afternoon, sun set and night scene since it was winter. There is a 10% discount coupon if you buy the T-money card from the subway vending machine, one discount per coupon.Pro :1) Excellent 360-degree view of Seoul. The toilet has excellent view too.2) There are cafes and restaurants. It is generally more expensive, as expected.3) Can rent the local costumes for photography.Con :1) May be very crowded during the weekend. We went on a Monday and there was moderate crowd.2) Can be noisy if there is a school group.A must visit once if you are in Seoul."
My Duo Trip to Seoul #cha2korea,Namsan Tower is one of the key place that my daughter wants to go. Watching the drama Deep Blue Sea with Lee min ho drives her crazy for visiting Seoul. It's quite a climb after the bus dropped us. Wish the bus can reach nearer to the tower. It'll be quite tough for the child or elderly to climb up. But the view is worth it! Had a great time here.
Stunning views,"We got the cable car up to the tower and it was incredible seeing the while of seoul .. the tower its self was very busy with a large school trip when we were there, but still its plenty big enough the locks are amazing there is so many I could have spent all day reading them .."
What a view ,"I recommend doing this in the evening, you see the whole of Seoul lit up! It’s an amazing view, definitely worth seeing "
Amazing 360-degree birdseye views of Seoul,"This tower (also known as the Namsan Tower) is located on the second highest land point within the Greater Seoul area, located on the north side of the river. It was built in 1971, and is 236 metres high. It was built primarily as a communications tower, but with lookout facilites, restaurants, souvenir shops etc included within the design..My partner and I just happened to be staying at a hotel that was within walking distance (10 minutes), which is how we made our way to it via Sogong-Ro road (on the north side), which then proceeds into a freeway tunnel into the hill beneath the tower and its surrounds. Just before the tunnel, and on the north-eastern side, we unexpectedly discovered that there is a cable-car that takes you from the aforementioned road level, up to the very large park that surrounds the actual tower itself. This saves you a somewhat steep walk up to the tower park... but if you're into exercise then by all means skip this free ride and walk up instead. It's quite steep.There is also road access to the tower and surrounding park that comes in from the south, and I assume that you can get a cab up, and there are many coach day tours that can also get you to this park and the tower.There is a LOT to see in the surrounding park, even before you decide to take the lift up the tower itself. The landscaped area surrounding the tower has many restaurants, fast food outlets, souvenir shops, and lookout platforms.The views even just from these large viewing platforms is very impressive, and you can spend an hour or more here, depending on whether there are special events, displays, and/or entertainment on the day of your visit, before you even consider taking the lift up to the top of the tower itself.But the main purpose of your visit still must include a ride in the fast vertical lifts to the tower viewing platforms where you get a 360-degree view of Seoul. Quite spectacular. Again, shops and food outlets on this high viewing platform.And... (I can only speak for the male visitors...) DO make a point of visiting the male toilets here! Men... you can stand at a narrow urinal against what is effectively a glass wall, and take in the stunning views of Seoul as you relax and relieve.... and... even taking photographs from the men's toilets are encouraged.A visit to the N Seoul Tower should be a mandatory port of call if you have never visited Seoul before."
Absolute must do in Seoul,"Wow. Amazing value and gorgeous views from the top of Seoul, our family loved this tower. Should be #1 place to start your visit to Seoul. (By the way, cross Lotte World Adventure off your list, absolutely diabolical, that's the tip from our kids too). "
Wonderful View to Realize the size of Seoul,The family enjoyed the tower and had dinner just outside overlooking the city. We went a second time to see the sunset!
Get Ready to be Wowed!,"What beautiful views of the city that just keeps going! We made a half days of it. We hiked a little, took the tram, ate lunch looking over the city and then added a lock to the already thousands placed there! Took some amazing photos too! My toddlers loved all the colorful locks and the lock “trees” and the tram. "
360 Seoul view,"Perched comfortably atop the Namsan mountain this tower provides unparalleled views of the Seoul metro area. One can get to the observation deck in USD 10, and you can also add some combos which include lunch plus drink sets.Accessible by cable car from Myeong-dong, or by public Bus, or even you a mild 30-minute hike. Look out for the special beacon fire lighting ceremony dates to make your visit even more rewarding."
Nice view down there! ,"Visiting N tower marked my presence at the very spot where my fav drama was filmed <3It was a lovely walk up the hill and once we were up there, we got a gorgeous view of autumn leaves and the big city laid right down below."
Not necessary to enter the observatory ,"I took a bus up and enjoyed the views and the place totally. I do not see a point in buying a ticket to enter the tower. Nonetheless, I enjoyed every corner of Namsam. There’s a cultural show from 3-4 pm everyday (except Mondays). I chose to take a walk down which took me 30 mins but the views were great. "
Gotta 10/15 min walk!,"Driving here. Car park goes 3/4 way up to the hill to the Lookout .This has a tower atop.. but the “free to look” version was adequate to us.A 360 * of Seoul.. the view from the tower should be more far reaching, but it was misty,cloudy thus,couldn’t be bothered to go up!Yes , it was a view of the city, 4pm, so it wasn’t a striking sight, as there were no lights to hi-lite the scene.A “padlock”fence, where U purchase a p/lock( costs money) and add to the collection of numerous others,who were expounding undying love to someone,( NOT ME!)There were movie characters, and others for foto shoot opportunities.Food and souvenirs were available for purchase? Toilets available (free)To me... it was a BEEN THERE DONE THAT!! As friend said,brought us here because it was expected!Came at wrong time, don’t know if open at nite?How long the visit depending upon the individual.. me.. twenty mins enough,Wheel chair access would be difficult because of the uphill push, and downhill hold."
"Wow.. nice place, cool and beautiful","Here, too many people using cable car on queue, so I only walk to Tower takes 1/2 hour, Ohhh... so tired. please bring your water. Beautiful places and blossoms. For couples and families can buy key worth $15 inside shopping area. There you can see many keys"
A strange night,"an ordinary experience apart from the extraordinary view of the city, the restaurant is not at the price and everything was too commercial, starting from the padlocks of the lovers. I bought a beautiful t shirt"
Beautiful view. Cold at night. ,We went there at night. But i guess the view during the nighttime is better because of the amazing lights. It’s just very chilly. We had to walk from the foot of the hill to the Seoul Tower entrance. And it’s December so it’s expected to be cold. Just prepare warm coats. 
Nice place to walk about but nothing fantastic,"Our trip started when we walk from myeong dong to the 45 degrees ""train"" at foot of the hill, it's free but works like a lift, sometime it could get over crowded. Then reaching the top, we proceed to buy our ticket for the cable car tower, there was no queue when I was there, but I can imagine the freezing cold waiting in line to buy the ticket, better use klook app and get some discount or buy at the machine. Still we need to queue going up the stairs to the cable car (more like cable BUS) there are 2 BUS one goes up one comes down. They will crowd about 20 people or so into the STANDING only BUS. If you are unlucky enough, you get squeezed into the middle of the BUS and see nothing but other people's head. So I suggest that if you moved towards the door and the BUS is still not full, stand aside for other people to board, you rush in to the next ride for prime view.During cold season, when you reach the top, it is freezing windy, so be prepared for the open air walk. Bring your own lock if you do not want to buy the ""LOVE LOCK"" at the top of the hill. Put your lock and throw the key....into a box provided. (unlike the romantic movie where you throw it into the forest.The tower ticket is way too expensive and I think day time is better, because the night scene can hardly be seen with lots of souvenir store lights reflecting against the windows, so you have to press your head against the glass to really see night scene of seoul.I didn't get to try the food so no comment on that.Sit around for a while, enjoy the noisy tourist taking photos and shouting children, trek down hill if you feel like it, should not take more than an hour."
Avoid school holidays at all costs,"For 10,000 won experience, it was ok generally. But at the queue, you will have to take a mandatory shoot & select your desired photo once you reached the top. The lift queue was a torture for me as it was stuffy and took some time before you could take the lift up (full of tourists and tour groups). The view was magnificient too as it was near sunset when we went...and too many people trying to get a good picture everywhere. Then the tragedy began when you need to head back down...the lift queue was super long! Took us almost half an hour to get down! Then at the 1st floor, it’s where you will visit the Love Locks gallery...and that’s about all for this famous N Seoul Tower (all you see on K Dramas) "
Great View,"We got the tickets that included the meal in the Hancook Restaurant. The view was great and the food was excellent. Even when you’re in the toilet, the view was great! It’s a bit pricey but I think it was worth it."
Views of Seoul,"The place to go to see Seoul city from a higher view point. The grounds where the tower base itself is located is already high enough to see great views of Seoul, however you could also go up the tower for an unobstructed 360 view.Recommend going in the evening as the sun is about to set to see both views when it is still light and as the lights fill the city as the night darkens."
Nice scenery on top of the tower,"You need to pay if you want to go on top of the tower. However, you can still able to take nice photo from the lower deck of the tower without going up. Nice place to visit in Seoul. Many buses go to Namsan Tower and it just within 10mins walk from the bus stop to the entrance of Namsan Tower."
Lovely Tower in Seoul,"Though you have another tower to visit, this tower is so lovely, please visit, you can take public transport, so easy and well connected, spend sometime there, go with family or close friends"
Beautiful view ,This is one of the must visit place in Seoul. We took a private tour to get there. The weather was sunny and cold. Managed to see clear and beautiful city skyline. Recommend place to visit. 
Fantastic Views,Make sure you go on a day with good visibility!The tower is commercial (shopping and touristy) but if you ignore that and enjoy the views it's a great location (make sure to check out the bathrooms at the top!)
Good workout walking to the top,Seoul tower sits on top of a hill. Can travel on top by cable car. 9000+ krw (both way) per person. Can also walk up to the top. Nice walk up. Good work out.
Nice view,Must visit the Seoul tower while in Seoul.The views from the top is beautiful and you can see the whole Seoul from there. It’s beautiful especially at night. You can take the cable car to the top if you don’t want to walk. It’s about 1 mile walking to the tower.
Korean Holiday,"The N Seoul Tower, officially the YTN Seoul Tower and commonly known as the Namsan Tower or Seoul Tower, is a communication and observation tower located on Namsan Mountain in central Seoul, South Korea. Construction started 1969. At 236m, it marks the second highest point in Seoul. This place is famous for Korean drama movies shooting; many Korean dramas scenes are shot in this place. Nice view of Seoul. There’s a souvenir shop here. Don’t take a taxi. Just take Bus Number 2 or 5 from some areas around the city including Myeongdong and it brings you all the way up to the base of the tower. It's only 1200 for adults and 350 for children. Seoul Tower was remodeled in 2005 and it opened to the public again on the 9th of December 2005, with the name of N Seoul Tower. The N stands for new."
Tremendous place in Seoul,This is the place is really tremendous and famous in Korea. I hope we will not miss the chance of visiting such a beautiful place.
So-so,There are a few viewpoints for this tower. The view from the lower level and the top of the tower are roughly similiar. Don't think you need to pay extra to go all the way to the top of the tower. 
"N Seoul Tower: Peaceful, beautiful and just simply amazing!","Climbing up the uphill landscape towards Namsan is totally worth every step. It was one of the most beautiful sights that I have ever seen in my whole life. The night lights of the city are like stars that brings everything to life. They carry a vibrancy and serenity at the same time. We were literally huffing and puffing on our way up on a cold and windy autumn night. But all the huffing and puffing didn't really matter when got to take a look of the beautiful gift that Namsan gave us. My sister and I literally just stood in there for quite sometime taking in the magnificence of the view. On our right the Seoul city view and to our left the majestic N Seoul Tower. It was a perfect night to end our first day in Korea. We also got to have a picture where Cha Taehyun posed for a picture for The Seollal Episode in 2 days and 1 night. Fun fact: Our guide told us that if the tower in lit Green meaning the atmosphere is clear of the microdirt and the air is clean. Other colors such as blue and red, indicates a different reading. On our way down, wind blew and ginko leaves fell, adding to the serene ambiance. Definitely worth hiking!"
Good view with lock keys,"This place is famous for korean drama shooting, many korean drama take shooting on this place... tons of lock key here etc... nice view of Seoul... there’s souvenir shop here..."
Nice view of Seoul City,Here's the scoop : don't take a taxi. Just take bus 02 or 05 from some areas around the city including Myeongdong and it brings you all the up to the base of the tower. It's only 1200 for adults 350 for kids. Same thing when you are returning back. The cable car is 7000 one way for adults and connects from the base of the tower to a middle station. For us we have been in many before and it didn't justify the short ride. Spend some 1-1.5 hours at the base of the tower and take in the beautiful views of the city. The weather was great and we took lots of photos. And we didn't pay to go up the tower because every country has a talk tower and it's pretty much the same 
Expensive observation deck,"The observation deck was relatively expensive (if only for 360 view of Seoul). I enjoyed the The Love Chair and Padlock area, it seem to bring couples much closer together."
Outstanding place to get an overview of Seoul,"Another reviewer said ""...Yes, there is a cable car. But the hike is very easy - it's reasonably flat and you get pretty good views all the way up."" That is what it said in the book on Seoul that I bought in Honolulu before going to Seoul. My wife and I found the opposite to be true. I took as 3 hours to get from where out taxi dropped us off to the top. In retrospect there was a Bus stop sign at the bottom but no idea when it might come so we elected to walk. Three hours later (with seven yellow busses passing us going up during the time it took us to walk there) we arrived with my wife very sore legs and mad. ""Reasonably Flat""... I don't think so.. I would call it steep. Once we finally arrived it was nice. We went to the upper level W 10,000 each, and got a framed souvenir photo W 25,000 which was nice... you can choose your background of views from the tower. Unfortunately, it was very cloudy that day, and we couldn't see much of anything of the city from the tower, but they did warn us about that before charging us to go to the upper level, and after that hike we wanted to go up anyway. I think i would be spectacular when it is not cloudy... it was just our bad luck the weather was like that. I hope someday we can go there when the weather is good!We enjoyed the fence where the lovers attach the padlocks with their names together and took some pictures there, and the Vanilla Shake at the Ice Cream concession was delicious.We decided to take the cable car back down, which was scenic, but we found that once we arrived it was a long walk to MyongDong Subway Station, which the map implies was colocated with the Cable Car terminal... it is not.It is also a steep road from the Cable Car terminal down, so if you were going to walk up from the MyongDong Subway Station to the cable car terminal it would be quite a hike... although certainly less than the alternative hiking trail.If we go there again I would either:1. Wait for the Yellow Bus at the bottom of the Hiking Trail where the taxi dropped us off ... I think he sign at the top said the Bus was only W 1,200 or something like that.OR2. Insist that the taxi take you all the way to the Cable Car terminal... and get the hotel or somebody to write that in Korean to show the driver since it appears none of the taxi driver's understand English.The fare for the Cable Car is almost the same for round trip as one way, so IF you can be sure the taxi will take you all the way to the Cable Car terminal that is probably the best choice. Otherwise the Yellow Bus from the bottom of the hiking trail.Aside from that I agree with all the other observations of the review by EmmaVestrheim."
Excellent place to see Seoul,"Spent the day hiking and visiting the N Seoul Tower.GETTING THEREYes, there is a cable car. But the hike is very easy - it's reasonably flat and you get pretty good views all the way up. Once at the tower, you need to buy a ticket to go to the observation deck. There is a shopping mall below, so choose to visit that either before or after the observation deck. Then you join the queue, get your photo taken (optional), and then take the lift to the top. Once at the top, there are three different floors full of restaurants and shops. Tip: If you have Lonely Planet, they have an excellent self-guided walking tour that's very easy to do. It includes a visit to the Old City Wall. CROWDSIt's *so* crowded. Be prepared to wait 10-15 minutes in queues for food, shops, and finding a spot to take photos.VIEWSIncredible!Tip: Want to get good views but be away from crowds? We went to the Hancook restaurant where it was VERY quiet. We then sat there, ate slowly, and watched the sunset from our own table in our own space. It's much better then nudging people out of the way on the main floors. FOODFirst we got beer + chips from a coffee shop, and the chips were laughably bad. Then we went and hid in the Hancook restaurant, which was a little overpriced but nice and quiet. We got our own table overlooking the city. SOUVENIR SHOPPINGSome of the best souvenirs I've seen in Seoul! Did all my shopping there."
Great view of Seoul,"Went with a friend last night and have to say that this place offered a stunning view of Seoul. They've also decent souvenir shops and love locks for the couples to hang up overlooking the city. We took the cable car going down and have to say while it was quick, it was awfully crowded. We didn't have to wait long at 9 pm but even then, everyone had their bodies pressed up against each other and save for those on the sides of the cable cars or those who are taller than most, we couldn't get to enjoy the view it offered. Still, it's well worth a visit."
Top tourist spot ,N Seoul Tower is worth a visit. You can pay to go to the top or just enjoy the views from the many free viewing platforms lower down or within the park itself. There is plenty going on day and night with organised performances or just people hanging out taking photos in the different areas. The all you can eat buffet is excellent value before 5pm when the price increases significantly. A good day out for those on a budget. 
Vacation ,"It is a good experience for the family, especially with kids and the love lock on the N Korea Tower. Very affordable. Walk up to the tower and then use the free elevator to come down from mountain to street level. "
Great experience!,"I generally skip towers when I visit new places because I have been to so many and they tend to be just waiting in line, going up for two seconds and then going back down. This one was a much nicer experience. There is a cafe at the top and you can kind of hang out for a bit. Also, the area at the bottom of the tower was really nice and had great views as well. "
"Tired, tacky, tourist trap","The N Seoul Tower is an iconic landmark located on Namsan Mountain in central Seoul. Its a tower, you cen get some good views across the city, weather allowing, but sadly thats as good as it gets. The main building itself is tired and could really do with a lick of paint and some TLC. It has the usual complement of tourist gift shops, but better and cheaper items can be located in Seouls many and various shopping areas. It has a fair number of food outlets and restaurants, but again these are nothing special. There are plenty (possibly too many) places to purchase love locks and plenty of places to secure them to the building as a way of declaring you love. Positives? Well the mountain park surrounding the tower is pleasant and offers gentle walks and nice views."
The beautiful landmark of Seoul,Romantic place to visit. You can find many photo spots here especially the lock bridge. Many dramas have taken scenes here also.The admission fee is moderate around 10.000Won (less expensive than Lotte Tower). Worth to visit while you are in SK.My advice is visit this place when the weather is clear unless you want see foggy Seoul
Perspective and twinkling lights,"A must trip to get a perspective of the city's density, river, and mountains. Get there early to see the sunset, you won't be disappointed. You can get there by public transportation, and take the combination elevator- cable car or hike up. "
A Seoul Landmark ,"Went to check the tower just because, thinking it's just like any other landmark tower. Proved myself wrong because the park is actually a great place to hangout and have a picnic. Views of the city is breathtaking. There's a lot to do in the park and includes hiking."
Nice views if you choose to hike up rather than taking the cake car! ,"So instead of taking the cable car, we did the mini hike up. This way we were able to see the N Tower in different distances. The entry fee is not too expensive especially when you get it with a combo (drink with popcorn!) the wait to go in isn’t that long, just go within your number. The wait to go down (the elevators) was sooo long though. I’d say similar to all other towers in Asia if you’ve been to any like Tokyo or Taipei. It’s all very similar, just not as tall. It’s not a must, but since it’s a landmark we just went. "
The best place for lovers,This is good place for any type of tourists but there is a special place for lovers. There is place where you could buy suveniours and another place where you could buy a lock and place it on a place and lock it for your partner or lover.
Namsan Seoul Tower (남산서울타워),"If you go to Namsan Tower on the weekend, u’ll see a lot people there. I recommend u to come here at fall, because the weather’s good and the view really good!~Untuk mencapai Tower nya bisa naik cable car atau jalan kaki ya. Tahun lalu aku jalan kaki, dan jujur sangat melelahkan jadi ga aku saranin hehe~"
A MUST Experience in Seoul,"You must see this tower and the park nearby, you must see the city from very top there and fall in love with it"
Breathtaking,"There are two ways to get to N Seoul Tower — via cable car or by foot. We went for the latter. It was less than 10 degrees but we were sweating haha I lost track of how many stairs there was but it took as approximately almosg an hour to reach the destination. Although it was very tiring (like really, our legs were so sore after) but the view while on our way is breathtaking. You can see the beauty of Seoul at night. As of November 2018, the cable car costs 9,000KRW round trip or 7,000KRW one way. Either is ok, depends on you and your time."
Not really worth the visit.,"Bought the combo which includes the N burger set plus observatory admission. Observatory was okay. View is nice but the kids found it too boring so we were out in less than 15 mins. We didn't realise that taxis are not allowed into the area. The taxi driver took us to the cable car station instead. There are shuttle buses going in and out. Price is 1200 won per person regardless of child or adult. Prepare exact as there will be no change given. The burger set meal was a bad experience. Burger was so so. The staff did not allow us to change drinks. Was told to clear the table after we are done with the meal - which we happily did but while throwing the stuffs away, we were given death stare by the staffs as we clearly did not know which rubbish should go into which bin. If you expect tourist to clear their own tables, please don't give us a bad attitude when we try to do it to our best understanding. Once we got the the restaurant and handed them our coupon for the burger set, the staff rolled her eyes and told another person to serve us. Seriously? Given a rating of 2 for the view. "
Crowded,Way too crowded by local and tourist. Have to queue pretty long to get in the elevator for going both up and down the observatory tower. Somehow it's worth the walk for namsam park and the city night scene.
Best views in the city,The Seoul Tower was the one pricey site I visited in Seoul. Most museums are free and the palaces and temples have nominal fees. Still no visit to Seoul would be complete without a visit to the tower. Keep in mind you need to buy a ticket up via the tram and a ticket back down. You also have the option to walk it. You’ll also need to buy a ticket to inside the tower once you reach the top. I would recommend going up a couple of hours before sunset so you can get photos of Seoul in sunlight (hopefully) as well as at night. There’s plenty to do at the tower so you’ll have many choices of activities to spend your time. 
Beautiful night view of Seoul from the top,"Even though it was a very hot day, the view from the top was breathtaking. Beautiful sight of Seoul at night. Long wait for the cable car to go up (Sat nite) and we decided to walk down after. Overall its worth it. Don’t miss this if you are in Seoul!"
Reaching the tip of Seoul,"Standing 237m atop of Namsan Mountain, N Seoul Tower, also known as Namsan Tower, is a must see when you’re visiting Seoul.Granted, although it was stunning to get a view of Seoul, I personally can think of more places that I would like to visit in this amazing city. However, don't let that deter you from visiting the tower as it is a big landmark of Seoul. It's a lovely experience to have and say that you've been there."
First time in Seoul!,"We climbed from the foot to the top, it’s a pleasant walk though may be steep and strenuous for some. The path is well paved and there’s handrails on the side.There’s a love locks area for lovers to “lock” their love there. Nice place for photo taking and crowded too. Though we didn’t go up the N Seoul Tower, we managed to get a bird’s eye view of the surroundings. We could see our hotel in Myeongdong and the coloured leaves around.Well worth the effort to climb!"
Bird's eyeview of Seoul,"We came here at late afternoon. It had a beautiful bird's eyeview of Seoul. I imagine the view would be even more beautiful at night.For those who do not want to get tired walking up, there is a free roundtrip shuttle from Seoul Station and Myeongdong. From the shuttle stop in Namsan Park, you can take the cable car to the tower."
Very nice place : ),"Last time we visited and dine there at night. This time we visited there in the afternoon for a different feel & view ^ ^ Under a very good weather the Tower, trees & leaves, environment are spectacular ^ ^See the photos I posted to feel what we felt > <"
Awesome view and invigorating climb. ,"Long steep climb to the tower. Decided not to take the cable car. Well lit walkway and stairs. Restroom stop part way up. The view is spectacular. Went at night, so lots of lights. Enjoyed popcorn and beer for two while waiting for the elevator. Convenient wait for your number to go up. Very long line going back down. "
Must do in Seoul,"It’s super touristic but definitly a thing to do in Seoul. The view is wonderfull.I recommend to go around sunset so you can see the view by day and night. I have the feeling that you can take better pictures from the nightview outside instead of in the tower, due to reflection from the lights in the tower."
A must ,We had a great day walking and putting our lock at the tower. They have places to get snacks and an arcade my son loved. Spend a half day here at minimum. 
Nice view,"My partner and I went to the N Soeul Tower in the afternoon and stayed until night so we could take a lot of pictures. You can go there by walking through the Namsan Park, cable car or by bus. We took the cable car. It was a nice experience. Even the toilet has a great view of the city. Also the Roof terrace of locks of love was nice. We bought a love lock and lock our love there. Next time when we visit Seoul we will visit Namsan Park. "
Nice City night scape of Seoul,"This is one of the most iconic touristic places in Seoul city, not just because of the popularity among tourists but also the deeply ingrained historical meaning that this piece of architecture has for Seoul and their citizens.If you have been in Seoul for at least a week or more and you still haven´t visited the N Seoul Tower you might have noticed that you can see this touristic attraction from anywhere in Seoul. And since the tower is located on the top of the Namsam park and it glows in different colors at night, this makes tourists wonder about what's happening on the top of that mountain, so don´t waste your time and go have some fun up thereFirstly, you can get up there on foot in 30 minutes or you can take a cable car and appreciate the landscape of Seoul city and the park as well. If you decide to take the cable car there is a return ticket and one-way ticket for both children and adults. I recommend you to consider the weather before choosing between getting up there on foot. If you do it by foot you can appreciate and surround yourself with the nature of the park but winter is so cold in Korea that temperatures can plunge to -20 degrees in late January and not everyone has experienced that temperatures in their countries. On the other hand, if you are visiting Seoul during the fall you'll have a great time watching the autumn foliage.Secondly, once you are at the top of the Namsan park you'll see that there are many ways to have fun and have a quality time with friends and family. There are several foreign and Korean restaurants at affordable prices and many souvenirs shops too. And if you are lucky you will see a Korean royal guard ceremony or a Pansori presentation which is a Korean traditional folk dance. Outside and on the right side of the tower, there is a wooden deck where you can see the cityscape of Seoul."
It's just a tower with full view of the city,It looks like the visit to this site is always part of the tour package.We arrived in the evening and the view at the site was good.It's now not the highest tower as most countries trying to compete to build tallest towers.The 360 degree view was interesting.
consider well before going up,Gives widespread view of Seoul. Rather old fashioned with comparison to similar towers (Sydney for example). The concept is well understood after 5 minutes. nothing else to be done next. consider skipping this site.
Amazing view,Worth the visit. We went at sunset and enjoy 360• view on seoul. The city is big and nice especially by night. We used the elevator then the car cable and it was great (30 mn waiting)
N Seoul Tower experience,"Reach this area via cable car. Came around 5 in the afternoon and the line in the cable car was long but moving. Reach the tower around sunset and by the time we reach the love locks it started to get dark. We have a love lock on hand and found a spot for it. Took some photos, ate some snacks and went to the observatory. There is also a line to reach the top of the tower. During our visit the place was really crowded and going back via cable car was also the same. I guess when you visit this place you should have enough time to spare or else you won't enjoy it as it feels like everything was hurried because of the crowd."
must visit great views of seoul !!,"i took the cable car to namsan where the tower is located . there is a nice park there with great spots to take picture with bird view of seoul in the background. they have a space like elevator that takes you to the top and you have a 360 view of the city . i had buffett lunch in the restaurant downstairs which was very good ! i left back to the city with the cable car .must see , great view !!"
Tick in the box visit,A good place to visit from a list of must do in Seoul. There is the love locks ..a good view from the top
N Seoul Tower,"Our trip to N Seoul Tower was so exciting. At first, we were worried that we might get lost going there, but with available online maps, we were able to arrived there so easy and fast just by train and bus. Once in the N Tower, process in going to the view deck is very organized that even too much people were there as it was I guess peak hour (6pm), the piles and waiting took us more or less 30-45mins. The view of the whole Seoul was awesome during the night. There are lots of instagramable picture perfect locations around N Seoul Tower specially those with their loved ones. Surely, would still love to be back to see and enjoy at daytime."
N Seoul Tower View!,Great view who wants to see the beauty of Seoul. Every corner on the tower is picture perfect. Will be back here as soon as possible!
Nothing much and it was too crowded,"Visited the tower at night. The line going up and coming down the cable car was so long. Waited for like 1 hour or more. Once at the observation deck, not what I expected it to be. The place is not that big and it became too crowded. Could not enjoy the view because there were too many people. Walking around the deck was troublesome too."
Worth a visit,"Popular with tourists; expect some crowd. Que for cable car was long at the time but it does move at a reasonable pace. A nice, short ride by cable car. Go up the tower observation deck and the view there is fantastic. There is a Cafe’ and a souvenier shop where I bought some unique and cute postcards. They sell stamps. Drop in their mailbox... so convenient."
Beautiful,"The scenery was beautiful, from the walkway to the top of the tower to the toilet. You can also enjoy the view while peeing :) I like this place, I wish we had time to stay a little bit longer to enjoy the view."
Seoul Tower,What a great experience !!! You don't realize how massive the city is until you see it from Seoul tower. Stay into the evening to see the lights of the city. There is a small beer and wine bar on your way up that was quite delightful. 
Beautiful View,We visited the tower in the later part of the evening and did not have much of a line at all for the cable car ride up to the tower. The view was beautiful and clear and a little windy. I would definitely recommend this to someone visiting Seoul for the first time. They have a gift shop at the top for you to check out.
"Great views, fairly quiet at 10am","We went at 10:15am, just after the 10am opening time. The tower was still fairly quiet, no queues, and we enjoyed the view. Having said that, the experience is quite cheesy/touristy, e.g. the animated video played in the elevator, and you still get really good views from the park at the bottom of the tower. Because of these points, I don't feel like this is a must-do, and I wouldn't recommend it if you have to wait in line."
Nice views outside,The area around the tower is lovely to walk around and take pictures. You get really nice views outside so it is not really necessary to go up the Tower. 
Skyline of Seoul,Took the cable car to and from the tower to enjoy the autumn scenery. Watch the beauty of different colours of the trees on the hills. 
Landmark must go in Seoul,Namsan or Seoul Tower is 1 of famous landmark in Seoul. We went there day time and nite time. Both are beautiful.
Wholesome,"Was with my sisters and 2 nephews. We took the Seoul City Bus which has N Seoul Tower as one of its stops. We took nice photos before going up the Tower. Very nice view from the Tower and cost is reasonable to go up the Tower. Coming down, we had some food, enjoyed by kids and us Moms."
We were happy we visited,"Walking up the hill to the tower on a Sunday morning was a great way to see the people of the city out for there health and enjoyment. The views from the overlooks on the way up the hill were beautiful, and the foliage was in full color."
Great views,"This is a fun trip starting with the free funicular ride, then cable car to the base of the tower. It is busy but like everything in Korea they are very efficient so even though lines were long we really didn't have to wait for extended period. The views from the tower are outstanding especially if you go just before sunset so you get the day/night aspect, it's a little expensive but I really enjoyed the experience even though I have done similar towers in other countries."
Wonderful views,"Went with an elderly relative. There were about 30 stone steps to climb, but otherwise quite accessible. We got the free venicular train, then the cable car and finally the lift. Although costly, the views were wonderful. Thete was also a demonstration of Korean traditional soldier training in the square by the tower, all wearing traditional costumes and using traditional weapons.Back to the tower, there views were marvellous on the day we visited, bot I can imagine that on a wet or cloudy day they would be very limited. We did have to queue for a long time to get in the lifts and on the cable car, so leave plenty of time."
Just a TOwer ,I think seoul korea is just fine I didn’t like much seoul korea ... just a normal city and nothing much ... it was pretty different though but N seoul tower is not really beautiful ... just a normal tower ... But their toilet up above is quiet funny ... 
Very nice,"Perfect place to get a nice view of Seoul while also enjoying a good hike. We spent 4 hours exploring the area, going up on the tower and taking lots of pictures. We went there around 3pm and it was busy but not suffocating. Include it in your travel plans if you want a good hike (going up to the tower on foot, not by cable car) with nice views of the city."
Awesome place to catch the sunset ,Suggest to go there early if you plan to go there and watch sunset. As there's a long queue waiting in line to go to the top of the tower. Estimate will take about an hour +/- waiting time. 
Very good view OF The City ,IT is a long step climb to reach The TOP but worth The effort to glimpse The 360 view OF Seoul. There are a lot OF Tourist and there was Cultural Show at The open Space. The view is awesome ON all sides OF The City. There are stores and restaurants for meals or snacks. You have a choice to Go UP The Tower but you have to pay to ride The elevator. A must see when IT The area.
Beautiful Fall Foliage,"Thanks to Google Map who thinks we are birds and can fly a bee-line from a bus stop at the bottom of the mountain to the tower in 4 min, we had to take a 30 minute hike ip to the tower. Fortunately, the slope is gentle and the fall foliage along the way more than compensated. The grounds around the tower were adorned with splendid fall colours and the unobstructed view of the city is very enjoyable. If you would rather not hike up, buses 2,3,5 can take you up from most major sites. "
Great place to visit and a must see,"This is a great area to visit during day or night. They have great views of the city! You can see it from the top, where there is a 360 degrees viewing floor with windows all around. There is an area u can hang your love locks to commemorate your visit or for your significant other... I think a must place to visit is the bathroom in the tower. You get an amazing view while you use the bathroom (at least in the women's)."
N Soul Tower Experience,Good to experience specially if you are a fan of the Love Locks area and to view the panoramic side of things of the city. Things may tend to queue up during peak hours at the cable car so be sure be there before 5pm and hopefully there are not so many groups tours as it gets crowded. 
"Busy and full of tourists, but a great view","I visited this place and learned that also Korean people love to come to this place. I had a beautiful but exhausting walk up the hill but on the way lovely view already. I need to mention that there is a cable car available for those who don't want to exercise.On top of the tower I had a beautiful view over the huge city of Seoul. Around the base of the tower there are shops, cafes and restaurants to take a rest.Highly recommended."
"Lovely Sweeping View of Seoul, LoveLocks and the Tower","What a wonderful experience to go up and see how vast the Seoul is, Very very progressive and impressive city! We also enjoyed looking at all the colorful love locks everywhere in the park. There’s an artisan market, as well as their regular gift shop and they are very inexpensive. It cost approximately $8 Round trip on the cable car but we decided to trek it down. There are little zen gardens in between the stair and it’s not steep at all. We would recommend to trek it up if you are up to it. Lots of nice photo opps. Just make sure you wear comfy shoes."
Wonderful 360° views - a must go experience,"I was lucky to choose a warm, sunny day in October to visit the North Seoul Tower. Having explored the surroundings under the tower first, I then bought my 10.000 Won ticket and rode the fast lift to the observation deck. The young lady in the lift asked us all to look up to the ceiling of the lift as we started to ascend and the film then took us on a journey much higher than to the top of the Tower - we continued to climb up beyond the earth's atmosphere and into space. Very clever...At the top I enjoyed stupendous 360° views over the complete city and way beyond. The sky was beautifully clear and you could see for miles and miles. I liked the fact that at one level you could orientate yourself to your home city/country and one level below you could spot the local sights. The gift shop at the top was well stocked. I really appreciated the chance to buy a postcard or two with the postage stamps already inserted in the envelope. I just needed to buy an extra stamp to cover the postage back to Europe. And there is a postbox at the top of the Tower. All well thought through. Oh, I forgot to say there is free, strong WiFi connectivity up here. For me, this is a must for any tourist itinerary of this fascinating city."
Great view from the top,"The tower gives a great view of the city, most specially at night. It's a great place to hang out and take photos. It was so cold and rainy when we visited the place but it still had so much fun."
Night ride!,A cable car ride in the night time is worth taking and then reaching the tower is a pleasant feeling.
Another place to see Autumn Leaves,"We were staying in Myeongdong area and we walk all the way to the cable car station, is easy to find just follow the google map will do :) We were there on 19/10 and the view and the weather is just perfect! Autumn season is the best time to visit Korea I guess! We found a few photo spots and managed to take some photos because it wasn't crowded on that day. The B duck status is so cute and the love locks bridge is just so eye catching. We spent a few hours up there mainly enjoying the scenery."
Excellent views from the Seoul Tower ,If your in myeongdong then this place is a 15min walk.Once you reach the site you need to take a cable car to reach the top of the mountain.The wait for the cable car is 10mins. It takes another 5mins to reach the top.Some stunning views from the top. If you have a good camera you will be thrilled to take the best shots. 
Beautiful autumn scenery,"I took the loop bus no 5 (1100 won) from myeongdong exit 3 bus stop. Took us 30 minutes to reach the tower. Once alight, there is still a very steep slope to reach the tower. It is the same, irregardless which transport you take (cable car). Nice observatory to see the whole of Seoul, with its autumn colors slowly turning."
Good view from the tower,"A very good view from the tower. People buy locks, write their names and hang there(lovers). You can take the cable car to enjoy the Scenery."
It's Okay,"Nothing spectacular once you arrive at the top of the Seoul Tower beside enjoing the city landscape. It is a tourist attraction so expect nothing more than souvenir shops, gift shops, kitchy activities and pricey restaurants."
Fabulous Vistas!,"A friend and I climbed the stairs all the way to the tower base and went up to the observation deck. It was a beautiful day and Seoul was bright with fall colors. There was a nice gift shop, places to eat, opportunities to purchase and leave love locks, and a quintessential Korean atmosphere. We did take the cable car down! A definite highlight of my visit to Seoul!!"
Sightseeing with a spectacular view!,"Recommended to find a way to the cable car station, we walk upslope to the station..Take a cable car to enjoy the scenery to N Seoul Tower.Plenty of food options.Good time to visit is an hour before sunset."
Awesome,"Great stunning views of Seoul. However, lines are super long. It took us 30min to get tickets for the cable car. Additional 20min to get tickets for elevator to go up. Here is the killer, 1 hour line to come back down!! I am sure it also depends on time of the day and weather etc. regardless, it was all worth it. We loved the view. There is also coffee shops up there to enjoy your latte. "
Beautiful in autumn,"Take the cable car - although we did have to squeeze alongside a ton of people but if you’re going in autumn, it’s worth it. We loved taking pictures here and our 4yo and 7yo loved to run around and also got to go to Hello Kitty Island (which isn’t an island but rather a unit which takes you through Hello Kitty history and rooms). My kids did enjoy this. We chose not to go up the tower - we did this the last time we went to Namsan so we didn’t feel it was worth the money. You don’t need to bring any locks along as they are also sold in kiosks for krw10,000 on location. I would suggest going early as it gets more and more crowded as the day passes. "
Nice hiking and beautiful places,"N Seoul tower is quite good to go as a tourist. One suggestion is after you finished, please hike and walk to Nam San Park. The park is extremely beautiful !!! And after it, you can walk to nam dae mun market to eat."
Must see ,I really had no idea how big this city is until I visited the tower. The views are incredible. The city tour bus is a good way of seeing this along with most other attractions in Seoul. 
Great hike for a view,"Hiked up from the main road. Steady incline so a bit challenging yet great views. Take an elevator up the tower for great view of city. Check out the bathrooms for a unique glass floor to ceiling window!! No one around to look in:) Had typical tourist shop, but I found some beautiful cards that are pieces of art. Couples left locks all around the grounds...wished I had my husband with me. Hike back down was just as interesting as I saw different views that were equally beautiful."
City's Landmark - Got to visit,Almost every city in the world has a landmark and Seoul is no exception. I came here last year and again this year to check it out and see the surrounding area and views again.
Take the cable car and see the city from above,"Excellent viewpoint, to get a away from the hassle of the city. A couple of refreshment points and restaurants up there"
Seoul Tower surrounded by trees in fall colors,"Touristy, yes, but a must see when in Seoul. Great to walk down from the top, and don't miss the love locks! "
Take a hike!,"Should you wish to burn some calories, refrain from riding a cable car going here. On the other hand, if you are with children and those in their senior years, I suggest you take that round trip cable car. Try to explore the tower, many spots are good for picture taking. They also have 3D and arcade sections."
at least to go once,"i have been visited N Seoul Tower for two times. people can see the busy city from the top of the tower, people can take a walk from the well built mountain tracks from tower back to entrance. i tried to walk with my friend once in March, there were cherry blossoms along the track, very beautiful and leisure"
Our last night in Seoul,Great spot to view Seoul. Awesome vistas especially after dark. Great place to close out our How2LeadUS Korean National Security and Leadership Experience
Wonderful tower in Seoul!,"I visited this tower at night. I saw beautiful night view, and it was incredible. When I enter the tower, ticket cost $50. However, the top floor in the tower, there was 3-D art museum. It was fantastic! Light turned on and the colors show the weather. I hope you to visit this tower!"
nice!,Cool... don't forget to drop by their toilets. They have the most beautiful view. hahaha. will recommend.
Worth the view,A good tourist site. Reasonably priced. Take the cable car to the top and watch the free daily entertainment.
Amazing views.,Long wait to get on the cable car but the views from up there are awesome. Some good restaurants too. Had some really tasty udon noodles with beef brisket in one of the restaurants. Well planned attraction and worth the wait.
"Queue, queues, queues ","Visited on a Sunday night. Queued almost 50 minutes to go on the cable car which held about 40 people so not as ""romantic"" as it sells. Then queued up to go to the observatory tower. View is worth it but there are better views elsewhere where the view is still as good. Worth the time? Hindsight, probably not, go on a weekday."
360 degree view of Seoul,We came for a nite view. And its beautiful... After using 3mins claiming my online ticket ... And 10mins queue. We r up there.Nite view are beautiful. There s a few restaurant n cafe. Expect a 1hour trip.
Great Views of the City,"Worth visiting as part of the city tour. Great views of the City all round and for photographers, great landscape shots can be taken from various angles. It does get a bit crowded but that’s only because it’s a great location. "
"Fantastic, Romantic View","What a great place for tourists and dates. The combination of these two make N Seoul Tower a must visit during your time in Seoul. I would especially recommend going around sunset. As a tourist, I was able to experience Seoul culture because locals actually come here to spend time with each other and add to the collection of tens of thousands of locks that are clipped to fences and rails around the summit. There are also restaurants and stores. If you come with a loved one and are thinking ahead, bring your own lock. Otherwise you can buy one in vending machines or the store. Highly recommend this experience!"
The N Seoul Tower is worth the hike!,"Our hotel looked at this tower and we couldn't wait to get up there. We started hiking, but decided to take the cable car up. The wait was long, but not unbearable to get to the top. It was a Saturday afternoon, so that was to be expected. We enjoyed the views and the hiked back down. I would definitely recommend a visit to the N Seoul Tower. "
Phenomenal view of the city,The hike up to the tower was well worth it. Even if you don’t go up the tower there is a lot to do in the landing area. There are plenty of restaurants and gift shops in the landing area. I did not take the cable car up because the line was very long but I here it’s a unique experience. 
The most beautiful view of Seoul from here!,From Namsan Tower you can see whole Seoul and it's super beautiful whether its day or night! It does get a bit chilly at night so keep that in mind. :) I always try to go there when i'm staying in Seoul. There are 2 ways to get to the top : cable car and climbing up the stairs. If you are not tired and the weather is good i totally recommend climbing up the stairs because you will get to see a lot of beautiful places while going up! There are also a lot of souvenir and convenience stores in case you want to buy something.
"Very nice park, but tower is nothing special","Very short and not impressive cable car will bring you to a hill, where you will see lots of love locks, several viewpoints and park. Viewpoints are really great overlooking Seoul. To go to tower you have to buy 10000 wons ticket. It includes elevator with a ceiling video ride, restroom with a wall size windows and observation terrace with a glass, which will prevent you from making great pictures. There is a photo service, which will take photo of you and add different backgrounds to it for an additional fee. Bottom of the tower has LG OLED tunnel and Kakao Friends figures. Tower hosts several restaurants including one on the top of it."
Best Way to See Seoul,"Breathtaking views of Seoul. Take a camera for good pictures. The inclined steps up to the tower were a pain, but worth the 25 minute walk. We paid about 20,000 KRW = $18. If your not in good shape for cement stairs, take the sky trolly over. My only warning is the exit of the tower is kind of scary for a claustrophobic person. Takes too long to exit and the process needs improvement for emergency reasons. "
Good view and good for wheelchair,I bring my daughter use wheelchair to see seoul from here. She's very love it...but no sign for wheelchair clearly so we very difficult to find way. I ask a few times to other people to get way for wheelchair.
Namsan Seoul Tower during Chuseok 2018,"First I must say that during Chuseok is not the best time to visit Namsan Seoul tower. The queus was out of this world, so many people visited Namsan tower during the holiday (we visited Namsan on the 2nd day of Chuseok). Not only the queue to the cable car but when you reach at the top, there were so many people making it hard to enjoy the sceneries. On top of that, getting a food is another struggle (due to the queue). I’d rather visit it on another time, taking pictures is not possible I might say due to huge crowd everywhere!"
Great overview of Seoul,Nice to take the cablecar to reach the top of the mountain and enjoy the view.We were delighted to see a martial art show at the base of the tower.
Mesmarizing..,"The Seoul Tower is beautiful. You have to walk a ways to get up there, but it is beautiful. The revolving resturant is there as well."
"one place you wont Miss, and you will Miss","10,000 won to go up the elevator to take photos like this; hard to trust the perfectly transparent walls in the toilet assuming someone is definitely watching me doing the business. wondered what’s it like at night! "
Amazing city. Great views,"We took a bus to reach the Tower. We did not go to the top of the tower but there were a few levels from the ground up, that gave us a wonderful view of Seoul and surroundings. We had a bite to eat avail from various outlets. Great atmosphere. "
"Nice view, but a little tacky!","This is a nice little excursion, but quite touristy and a little tacky! It can be easily reached by metro and cable car, and price is very reasonable (around €7 round trip in a cable car). From the main area there are several viewing points all around the city, and there is a show that takes place in the afternoon (free). You pay extra to go up the tower itself - again reasonable at €7 for a 30 second lift ride to the top. There are several restaurants and gift shops at the top, and the views of the city are great."
What a Great View,"The trolley car was packed going up and that was a little disconcerting. However, once at the top the view was spectacular and well worth the trip."
N Seoul Tower,We walked from our hotel. Got to a very steep hill to climb up and some stairs to get to the cable car. We waited for 30mins to get the cable car and then 90 mins to get into the tower to go up. The view from the top was worth it. An enjoyable evening.
Nice views,Can not argue that the views from the top are nice. The tower itself is not all that great. Low end souvenirs at the top. You can mail s post card from the tower. Love locks are cute. Not bad but not a must see.
A must do when in Seoul.,"Seoul Tower is an iconic site to see in Korea. A little known fact is the color the tower is lit, actually indicates visibility conditions. Blue is clear and best viewing, green is next best equaling a little hazy, and red means bad air quality and limited visibility, so best to visit on a blue day.The cable car is fun, also if you like hiking its a fun time too.Good eateries at the base of the tower as well."
Nice view in the night,"Although it looks awesome in the night, don’t go on weekend nights! The walk uphill to the cable car ride was long and tiring and estimated waiting time was 90mins and additional waiting time up the tower was 70mins. A lot of time wasted..."
Awesome Tower,When staying in Myeongdong N Seoul Tower is a must to go see. Get a cable cart ride to the top and check out the views...Anthony.D
Beautiful View,Thanks to our guide Mike for working overtime in sending us to visit N Seoul Tower and back to Insadong Street after our trip to Nami Island and Petite France.
how to go to N Seoul Tower,"hi, i just want to share how beautiful sunset view and how to get there..if you want to go up to the top of Nseoul tower, the entrance fee KRW10.000 and also have package with drink + popcorn KRW21.000i go to Namsan Seoul Tower (N Seoul Tower) by bus number 03, but you can also use number 02 or 05 (detail bus stop attached)arrived at the bus stop of Namsan Seoul Tower, i had to walk through uphills road about 300meter.. little bit exhausted :(there have a elevator also.. i just known it when i want to back to the bus stationwonderful view of seoul city and sunset made my weary gone..enjoy it and take some picture of lovelock.. end of sept weather with 16 degrees celcius up there"
Great sunset visit,We were hoping to visit for sunset and glad we planned in advance. We rode the gondola up the hill rather than hiking since it was a super hot/humid summer day. There was about a 30-45 minute wait for the gondola ride. Once we got off the gondola we bought our tickets to the top of the tower and stood in line for only 10 minutes. Once at the top we were able to walk around and take plenty of pictures. Also bought a postcard with stamp for about $1USD to write and mail from the top of the tower. After sunset the city lights came on which was another beautiful sight. Then there was another 15 minute line to take the elevator back down to the ground. The area was fun to look at with the trees lit up. The gondola ride down was quite quick with almost no line. This is not a cheap place...I think for 2 adults we spend $50USD between the tower and gondola tickets. I would have planned more time at the base of the tower during the daylight had I known there was more to see because they close parts off after dark.
Best View In The City,"This is the best couples ticket in the city.Even the cable car from the street (if you don't want to walk up a lot of stairs) and the gondola ride to the tower are a fun with lots to see. Great place to walk and hold hands when you get to the top. Love locks everywhere, so don't forget yours. Bring your camera for some of the best views and shots in the city. Fun for everyone.Great food and drink at fair price.There was a band rocking out by the base the tower, so atmosphere was very cool.To get the best bang for your buck(or Won) go during the day and leave at night.This will give you the best of both worlds.Enjoy"
Spectacular views - try get there at before dusk to experience both daylight and night views,N Seoul Tower is the perfect place to orientate yourself in the city and enjoy spectacular city views at the same time. It's a decent walk up the hill if you fancy a workout otherwise there are plenty of buses to take you to the base of the tower. Buy your ticket but don't expect to get admission straight away - this is a popular place and you'll be given a timed ticket. You can select straight forward admission or other packages - we went for one with popcorn and beer! Having to wait I while meant we could explore the lower levels for a bit and appreciate the architecture before we took the lift to the viewing floor. We got there as the sun was setting so could appreciate the city by day and night. The views were impressive. Try get there so you can see the sun set from the top. You won't be dissapointed! If you do leave the tower in the dark you'll need to take the bus back in to town. Finding the right bus was quite a challenge but after a fair wait we found the right one in the end.
Nice view ,"Nice view of the city, takes about 1 hour to get tickets go up take pictures and come back down. If you are into observation viewing areS want a panoramic view of Seoul then go here."
Spectacular view!!!,Great spot to see the whole landscape of Seoul! They also have their most known teddy bear museum to visit and little memorabilia to brought home. Definitely a must visit if you're in Seoul! 
Get A Good View,This is a good place to get a good view of Seoul in all directions. They have several places to eat and shop for the usual tourist.
City tower experience with a bit extra ,"There is always a tower sightseeing experience in a big city but this one was better than others I have experienced. With the tower being on top of a hill there are loads of restaurants and bars at the top where you can still enjoy the great view.We loved the bar area at the top as we managed to be at the top for sunset, which I would really recommend seeing.The love lock concept has been done before in other places but the massive amount of them here is actually pretty impressive! "
Go at night,"We went there quite late in the evening. A Korean friend guided us through alleys and we took the cable car up to the observation deck. The car can fit a large number of people so even if you have to wait, do not lose patience. We waited for about 10 minutes and our turn was up. The night view of the Han River, the busy city of Seoul with all the lights was worth seeing. I am not too sure how I feel about the locks that seems to be a trend with young couples but I am not judging. This was one of our most memorable night in Seoul. The place had a photo booth around the viewing deck. The three of us got in there and took some pretty crazy photos which were promptly sent to our email address including copies printed there. We felt like we made memories there."
perfect,"This was a perfect way to end my long day, after much sight-seeing around the city. The views from the obsevation deck were magnificent. I would recommend giving it a visit and if you have the extra to spend, go straight to the top."
Tourist hotspot ,"I would recommend walking up the trails through Namsan Park, so that you can enjoy the vistas of the Seoul fortress city wall against the towering buildings. Enroute the way to the top, you will also pass by the beacon hills which was used for communication with smoke signals in the olden days. There was renactment of the guards patrolling the fortress and opportunity to wear the traditional Korean costumes. At Seoul tower - a popular filming location for K drama fans - many locks have bedn fastened to whatever available space around the tower. It is accessible from cable car and it s worth going up there for the vistas of Seoul city "
Short hike up or take the cable car...worth it!,"I consider this a must do in Seoul, although it does not have to cost you anything. You can walk up to the tower from a few different spots. It's mostly stairs, and takes 30-60 minutes. Some really great views along the way up and at the base of the tower. You do not have to pay to go up to the observation deck to get the great views. You can shop, eat, and play games at the many stores in the base of the tower. This is a great half day for anyone including those with small children.You dont really need to bring anything. Water is good, but easily bought along the way."
"Just went to the tower, not up top of it","Had three kids along so decided to save a few bucks and just to go up to the area around the tower. It had plenty of excellent vantage points of Seoul in all directions and plenty of food and beverage options too. Kids enjoyed finding where we were staying, but once you've had a look there's not really anything else to do so we had to bribe them with churros."
Beautiful views of Seoul,"I stayed in Myeong-Dong and took the number 05 bus from outside exit 3 of the subway. The journey was cheap and took like 40 mins cos we hit mild traffic, then when we got to the tower you have to walk up hill a little to get to the ticket hall. You can appreciate the views and the outside stuff like the fence with the locks on it without a ticket; the ticket gets you inside the towers upper levels for higher views, I went up early evening and watched the sun go down - totally worth it! "
Fantastic Views,Absolutely beautiful panoramic views of Seoul from the north Seoul Tower. We went just in time for sunset and saw stunning views
Nothing spectacular but worth doing,Good views of Seoul. Take the public bus there. It’s easy and cheap. Shouldn’t take longer than and hour or 2 to roam around and check out the views of the city. Worth it to kill a couple hours
How to fall in love with Seoul,"N Seoul Tower is a landmark of Seoul because you can pretty much see it from everywhere. And it's just so beautiful! I had the advantage of staying at a hotel with a terrace that was faced right at the tower and every night seeing it was like magic, along with all the city lights. The view from its top is also very beautiful, too bad that we were there on Chuseok and the crowd and huge lines of waiting were exhausting. But still, I do recommend visiting it."
Do not take the cable car ,I like namsan tower but i think the cable car is not worth it. You can go there just by walking and have a good view of nature. You can enjoy many things in namsan tower. Just don’t enter to the hello kitty museum. It’s not good. 
Took the long route,Took the 1200m ascent and it was a lot of calories burned. So I think. Bring water. There's a vending machine and convenience store and a burger place when u reach the top. Great view of the city during daytime. Even better view at night. 
Breath taking view...worth remembering!!!,Waiting time for Namsan cable 45mins-1hr but worth it once you reach the top to N Seoul Tower. The view is awesome & there are performances like magic show & martial arts in the afternoon just before the lights of the whole Seoul turns on...wonderful!!!
Best View of Seoul... Crowded,This place deserves a 5-star-rating solely for the views of Seoul that are found at the top. The city looks very different from the N Seoul Tower... the city almost reminds me of Rio De Janeiro the way the lighter colored buildings sprawl out over the hills. While the observatory itself is only so/so (it's crowded and the tower is somewhat old)... the surrounding area is beautiful... and I like the cable car (gondola) ride to the top (which also reminded me of Sugarloaf Mountain in Rio.Don't miss the views of Seoul from this place!
Worth a visit,"While weekends can be crowded, we really enjoyed the visit. It was quite windy at the view point so you can carry a jacket if you visit in autumn/ winters, even if it's sunny otherwise. The view was amazing, and I especially remember the video which plays in the lift while you go up or down."
Great views,"If you are staying in Seoul, you need to go here to get a great 360 degree view of Seoul. But beware, there are always a lot of people there!"
Evening/night stroll ,It’s nice to get away from the busy city right before sunset and also enjoy the city lights from above. I like starting my walk/hike from Grand Hyatt through botanical garden:)
Seoul: North Tower,"Now my second time in Seoul, which is one of my new favorite cities to visit, and it came time to explore further, and the Seoul Tower was one of the locations to venture to next. I went with a girlfriend of mine, and we enjoyed every second of it and even did the photo op opportunity with the digital background, and it came out perfect! One of the best things I loved about being in the tower was the section of windows that had different countries/ cities and displayed how far they were and what direction they were in (a fabulous idea to have here!). I also would recommend getting a charicature done while here as there are some amazing artists present."
The view is magnificent,Crowded but worth the time to visit..U can buy Ur lock before coming up the cable car coz it's cheaper than the shop upstairs
Work out in a natural way,It’s tough to go up to the entrance to the tower. The easiest way is far away from a metro so it would be a good idea to take a taxi to the library. There are other ways to walk up but they are steep and hard to climb. If you don’t think you can manage a walk up there is a cable car which can take you all the way up. Fantastic views. I went in daytime but heard that the views are fantastic in night time.
Great View,"You have three options to access the tower, first you can take the cable car both ways, second you can take the cable car one way and walk the other, or third you can walk up the hill to the tower and down back.We took the cable car both ways and we were glad we did as it rained heavily shortly after we got down from the tower.The tower offers a great views of the city and it is very beautiful."
A great tower,"N Seoul Tower is perched on a hill that requires a bit of walking. But if you don't want to walk, there are other ways that can get you there. But the walk is worth it because you can admire the scenery while trying to reach your goal. The N Tower offers an amazing view much better than the other towers I visited. And most importantly, it's cheap. A $10 per person is a small price to pay to be mesmerized by this amazing City. "
Top of Seoul,"Don’t be lazy to climb to the top of tower about 15 minutes . Amazing Seoul was zoomed out here - A huge of love keys that couples buy & stick them by their wishes in it :) But if someone buy key from store here , price around 5-7-8 usd per one . Worth buying or not ?. ^^ "
Nice getaway from hectic city scene,Really close from Myung Dong shopping district (withing walking distance) but yet so far removed from the hustle and bustle of the city. Beautiful panoramic view of both the old and new Seoul. Fun place for both couples and families.
Great view of Seoul,"This is a nice visit to get a great view of the city of Seoul. We took the elevator up and then the cable car. There is actually a nice path that you can walk all the way up to and down from the tower. If we had more time, we would do that."
The place you should go,"i came here on April, it cherry blossom seasons. Nice place to sightseeing. you can enjoy their nice view , a place you must visit when you came to seoul. You can go upstair by walking or cable car, for cable car you must pay 8000k won per roundtrip ticket."
Seoul tower,Very good place and close to restaurants we have good time and fun with our friends highly remanded to all love Seoul
Love here !,I really recommended to come in cherry blossom season ! 1 point shorts for the way walk to cable car was far and slope. It’s not good for elderly.
Experienced snow up there,"We were fortunate enough to experience snow when we were up there. This site is very nice and a must visit when you visit Seoul. We enjoyed the Bear Museum and the Observatory also. The love-locks bridge was very so we just take a peek and did not get much photos. All in all, it’s a must on your itinerary."
"The views are awesome, but the whole experience rather average","We took the cable car up to the top. The price for adult is 9500 KRW for a round trip - rather expensive taking under consideration that you will spend aprox. 1 minute in the cabin and there will be not much to see from it. Then, we got to the top of Seoul Tower, where you can admire AMAZING views and take some neat pictures. However, its next 10000 KRW for an adult. During your trip to the top, you will be obliged to pose for two photos, fortunately, you dont need to purchase them (15000 KRW each, sick!!). On your way down, you will be also ""distilled"" through a gift shop - as the staff is hoping that you will be also tempted to buy some more overpriced things :PAll in all - the beauty of Seoul is here, expensive, but worth it. However, I cannot say I enjoyed the aggresive money extortion during our visit."
Awesome views at night ,"Travelled up the first night in Seoul, cable car was fun. Views were amazing of Seoul, lots to do while you are there. We went yo the Hello Kitty world, which was fun. Nice coffee shop at the top, with view out over the city. A must to see when in Seoul. Be warned the taxi fare there was very cheap, but will be charged 3 times the amount if you want to get back. We walked down the hill to catch a cab, but thats not for everyone. Great experience."
Beautiful tower during dusk,We went up using a cable car. The place is busy with tourists and has lots of love locks. It has a beautiful view of the city. But nothing much to do so allocate 1-2hrs only in this place. We went up the tower and had a good Korean dinner. The tower is a sight to behold at night. 
Nice place,This tower is on the mountain Having laser show here and some restaurants around And it’s famous for couples to leave a lock with wish on the Net Weather is cold sometimes so don’t forget ur jacket 
Seoul Tower,"Quite expensive, if you want to include going up the actual. The cable car only takes you to the base of the tower. Very busy, however we went up just as it was getting dark. Amazing views of the city, well worth the visit."
Nice view over Seoul,"A classic choice for a tour of Seoul. It's a bit of a journey going up there, but a nice experence once you've made it. Consider using the cable car."
Great View,"It's quite a climb from the where the bus drops us off and up to ground level of the tower - so make sure you're ready for a hike, wear comfortable shoes. The view from the grounds below and at the top of the tower is magnificent during the day or night if you get clear skies, I was lucky enough to be there when sky was clear. We had a buffet dinner at the top of the tower, I would say the view was more magnificent than the food."
Excellent ,Nice place to visit. Take the cable and lock your lock and take photos. Views are breathtaking. Recommended 
Loved it - a great outing,A cable car to the bottom of the tower was a great way to go and see the city. Views from the observation deck - amazing to see the size of Seoul. The locks on the fences and trees and everything else were a sight to see in themselves. Great parkland to enjoy and although busy has a peacefulness about it.
So many love locks!,"You have to ride the cable car or take the bus to reach the mountain. When I saw all the love locks, I was quite overwhelmed. I felt the immense hope and optimism that caused each couple to place a love lock there. There is a viewing deck overlooking the city. Unfortunately, it was raining hard when we went there so we weren’t able to appreciate the view. "
The best view,"i went to Namsan tower 3 times when i was in Seoul because i loved the view so much, you dont even need to go into the tower itself to see. its so pretty and unobstructed. if you go in the early evening you'll be able to see the city light up so so pretty "
Great views of Seoul,"Spent an hour here and enjoyed it a lot. Nice landscaped parkland with a central plaza with shops and restaurants. The views from the tower are stunning, make sure you go on a clear day. This place gets packed at the weekends so get there early."
Nice view of whole of Korea. Not cheap to go up. Need to pay for cable car ride and entrance fee.,"Nice view of whole of Korea. Not cheap to go up. Need to pay for cable car ride and entrance fee. But is the best view of Korea, and not to be missed."
Loved it!,"We went around 5pm so we could see the sunset from the top of the tower. Ended up getting the 22000won ticket set with popcorn and a drink each and were pleasantly surprised by the size of the popcorn bucket!The tower itself had excellent views, and lots of good little souvenirs. We sent a couple of postcards from the top which was a nice touch - hoping they make it home! All in all, reasonably priced for good views."
Seoul from above,"Ok. Seouls tower and viewing deck is not unique at all but on a good day you can see for miles and miles and miles and still not get a grasp of the huge urban sprawl of Seoul today. Worth the money on a clear day. But the whole picture/gift shop thing as everywhere else with these towers, maybe a bit less pushy actually. And the rest room - at least the mens is a hoot!"
Nice place to see,"We went there with the cable car which is a very smooth ride to the the top of the hill where the tower is located. We bought round trip tickets, but you can easily go down walking and buy only a one way, this is to go up the hill and the tower is not included.Up in the hill you can take walk and enjoy the view. There many padlocks put there by couples. The visit to the tower costs extra, but you can take only elevator or elevator + 2 beers + a big pop corn, there are 3 different packages.The ride in the elevator is fast and with a small movie on the ceiling. We went during the day, but can imagine that at night must be fantastic.Worth it to visit."
Awesome Tower,We visited the N Seoul Tower and were amazed by the views of Seoul. A must see during the day with refreshments nearby. 
Seouls icon,"Namsan tower was amazing. it will give you a 360 degrees birds eye view of the entire city. There are 2 ways to get to the tower. first is by bus and second is by cable car. We chose the Namsan cable car which can accommodate about 50 persons at a time. There you can also find souvenir shops, restaurants, hello kitty & Sentoy museums. The famous love locks. recommended to wait for the sunset and hight time when the tower was lit. definitely seouls icon."
Good view of Seoul,Our personal tour guide bought us to the top of Namsan Seoul Tower. You can have a 360 degree view of Seoul.
Wonderful,The views from the top of the tower are awesome. I would not recommend going on a Saturday night as it was very crowded. It seemed to be date night. There are restaurants and souvenir stores. Well worth it.
Crowded on a Saturday night but still amazing!,"We took taxi from the Hotel Shinshin and arrive at our first line to take a cable car up to our second line to take the gondola up the tower. You can walk all these parts if you feel so inclined. The walk from the gondola building to the tower being the longest. Once at the tower there are many restaurants and shops and for an additional 10000 won to go to the top of the tower, another line. Once at the top of the tower the view is amazing, but you wait in another line to come down to the gondola building.one line to come down on the cable car. Sorry for being somewhat a downer about the lines. All the lines did move quickly for the amount of people. Saturday is not the night to go is my point. The rest of the experience was wonderful, the sites were amazing and well worth the visit.Take enough money so you can do everything you want!"
Seoul TV Tower & reastaurant,We were expecting nice view on Seoul TV Tower at night but We were unlucky. It was foggy/cloudy night. Korean food is served but I found that most of them are average quality and taste. I had Korean food experience...
Famous Tower,"Better go here at night time so that you can enjoy the night lights. Also, you might want to go up here on the left side road than the one on the right since it’s less steeper. I suggest for those tourists with seniors or young children in tow to go up via the left road since you can go up to the tower through their elevator.Padlocks are pretty expensive if you purchase it there so you might want to purchase one before going here. "
Tower climb ,"My husband and daughter went up, initially via the cable car and then up the tower itself. I didn’t go due to vertigo!They both loved it - can see for miles!Unfortunately both caught in a massive dump of rain on their way back but both still were upbeat due to the experience.Not for those not liking heights."
Weekends vacay,"Must visit this place if you are in Seoul. This is their one of the history. It is good for a family weekends get together. It’s is nature friendly. And when I was there, there are Korean food tasting and beer tasting. There are also restaurant around the park. I would highly recommend this place to visit when you visiting Seoul.Just take bus no. 1,2,3 and 5 and pay 1200 Korean won to get there"
Amazing views,"Must go to N Seoul Tower, it's an amazing view once you get up there, lots of photos and videos you can take, there is a long line to get up there and back down, but it was worth the wait, otherwise you can walk but takes up to an hour and has alot of stairs."
"Nice view, but you may feel that thuis is just another tower","Our family had been to a no. of towers, not too different this one. Kids loved it, maybe the ice-cream. There is a place for lovers to place a lock to ""secure"" their love...LOL. Not muich to do, good view as usual though."
Indescriptible ,Well the N tower is a small commercial center. It is no so cool BUT the best thing is the point of view at the top of the tower. You can see all Seoul. TAKE THE CABLE WAY to GROW UP. 
Definitely an attraction you should not miss!,"Discover a romantic side and sight at N Seoul Tower if you're visiting Seoul. Known as the love tower, visitors and locals buy locks (which are sold as a pair in a box) and lock it around the tower. You can write the name of you and your loved ones on it -- it is said that if you do that, your relationship will stay true forever! "
Simply the Best,The N Seoul Tower is awesome. There are great views to be seen. I highly recommend visiting this iconic place when in Seoul!
2 hours of waiting time... Don't waste your time,We've waited for more than 2 hours in a long.. at the end it was normal noting more than seeing Seoul from the top.. I don't recommend it.. 
Visit when the day turns into night,"The elevator was very crowded, had to queue for about 10 minutes.we climbed some stairs to the first level when we saw the love chains for the first time; it's a nice view.With all the love chains there are in this place, you could guess it's for people in love. Yet, it is more than this, because the best part is the wonderful view panorama over the City of Seoul. Luckily, we stayed long enough to see Seoul from the tower both during the day, and during the night. We eat nice food at the Japanese restaurant. Still wondering why Koreans don't give knives at the table.My granddaughter was excited to be able to sit in front of the large glass windows displaying the beautiful view over part of Seoul.All in all, it is one of the best places for tourists in Seoul."
Beautiful and romantic ,"The views of the city are quite beautiful. My favorite part were the , “love locks.”You can take a cable car to the base of the tower if you don’t want to walk. "
Amazing views!,Visited here with my boyfriend last year. We had amazing views of Seoul although a little cloudy - make sure you go on a clear day.
Amazing view from the height,N tower gives you 360 degree amazing view from the height. Whether afternoon or night the view is still awesome. The binocular helps to see more.
NIce place to hang out @ night,A great place to view Seoul at night. Lighting is very beautiful and the pricing of the tickets is pretty reasonable as well.A romantic place for couple too
The tower of Seoul,It is a cool place to just walk around. At the top of the tower you have the distances to most home countries. When I went you could get a free photo by playing a match the image game. We also took the regulars tower photo and they emailed us the jpegs of all the pics even though we only got a printout of one. At night everything is lit up and without paying this would still be a nice experience.
Good place,Good place to see the city of Seoul from a height.The observation deck where tickets are sold are at reasonable height so no need to buy tickets to go on top unless you are very keen.
Worth doing,"You get exceptional views once you get to the base level of the tower - without actually going further up. So, if on a tight budget, you do not need to go all the way up. There are restaurants and arcades inside so you should be able to keep the family entertained."
My favorite site in Seoul so far...,"I have been in Seoul for 4 days now. I fell in love with Namsan Tower. I used to live here 20 years ago and my sister remembers every detail of the restaurant. I don’t think that it exists anymore.The views are phenomenal like everyone said, but I must say that the air feels so fresh and clean as well — the forest-like experience with mist in the air felt so good in my lungs.If I lived here again, I would probably hike here 2-3 times a week. Since I don’t, I will probably come back next week at the end of the trip.I went to the top after several hours of the typhoon. At first, I was a bit miffed as the windows were fogged up with condensation. I debated to get a refund until I asked one of the attendants if I will be able to see the views. So I waited and the images were breath-taking.Namsan tower captures the beauty and magnitude (population) of the city.One thing I thought was kind of weird is the voyeuristic feeling you get when you use the restroom. You get the best views and if feel like someone is peering into your window, but you have complete freedom.Last thing I really loved doing is too go is to watch people below look like the size of ants move around.Here are some of my photos."
Amazing attraction for all the family,"We visited Seoul Tower in a rainy morning and were lucky in that the place was pretty empty which we understand is quite rare. That means no queuing up for anything at all.The visit began with walking through the world's first OLED Tunnel which is pretty amazing and the kids loved it. After purchasing tickets we took a locker to place our bags and then went up to the observation tower but first passing an area to take our photos which we paid for later. Despite that rainy weather the views were still pretty stunning.Once downstairs there is the large area where lovers can attach their own personal padlocks with messages of love and this in itself was pretty amazing. However, on this rainy day hardly anyone was out here.Seoul Tower is very child friendly with a Toy Museum, the LG 3D World, a place for games and a 360Degree VR Tour. In addition there are numerous restaurants and coffee shops and stores selling souvenirs.On a rainy day, due to hardly anyone being at the tower, our family had such an amazing time."
Nice view!,"N Seoul Tower is a nice placeto take photos and see the magnificent view of the surrounding area. We took bus number 2 from Chungmuro station as a family member was not too keen on taking the cable car. Besides the view, there are also a lot of good food options when you get there."
Always something new to see and explore,I have been here a couple of times in the past years and I am delighted to see that there are always new things to do or museums to visit in the N Seoul Tower. It is a good place for families to spend 2-3 hours. 
Beautiful Tower,It’s a good exercise when climbing up the slopes towards the tower.Price of ticket is quite reasonable and great view of Seoul.
Nice views at night,"It's just a standard observation tower with a gift shop and restaurant, but atop a small mountain. There is a 3-minute long cable car ride that takes visitors to and from the tower. The best time to visit is at night when the sky is dark and Seoul is lit up for amazing views."
Got a bit bored but nice when nothing else to do,Its like any 360 tower but on the mountain. Take cable car up and down. They got a resto but quite pricey as expected. Its not really romantic. 
More than just a photo stop ,"More than just a photo stop, accessible by cable car or drive with ease. Houses a nice Korean restaurant that is good to dine in. Views here are wonderful "
Great views ,I enjoyed the views from the tower. I especially liked the viewing deck with 360 degree views of Seoul. We did not take the cable car as it was far too hot this time of the year. 
Namsan tower,We tried going to namsan tower by bus from our hotel and got lost because the hotel staff didn’t say we had to cross the road from Myeongdong subway exit 4. We decided to get into a taxi when the driver kindly pointed out the bus we had to board was on opposite side of the road. So we got out of taxi and got to the right bus stop .The many love locks at the tower were a feast for the eyes and the night scene of the city was lovely. The walk up and the slope to the tower was good exercise 
Great view of an amazing city.,"This is a great place to enjoy the wonderful view of Seoul city in the open air and inside from the tower. The view is even better if you go at sunset and stay for the night sky view. If you go with a partner or bff, make sure to take a love locket to write something and leave it chained as something special to remember."
Only for the view,"Doing a tour of Seoul tower is to expensive and not worth it in my experience. The view is fun, but I would recomend Namsan tower instead. Also the place is crowded with tourists."
good view,it is good to see seoul from above. worth visit. it takes 1 hour tour. u have to walk up the hill. i like it
AWESOME DON'T MISS IT,"Guys, Your Seoul Trip is incomplete if you don't explore Seoul Tower...!!Go in the Evening, Catch Cable car in the daylight so that you can enjoy both day and night views from Tower.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED PLACE TO VISIT IN SEOUL."
Must Visit Point,"Stunning views IF its a clear day, love how they have distances to every city from the various directions on the tower, great Toy museum on the first floor too, and the cable car ride to the tower is a must too."
Visit this place on the night,Don't forget to try cable car to Namsan and back from Namsan using Bus. Better visit on Night. Nice view in the night. 
"Well Organized, Great View","We went for shopping though since this was my first time in Seoul we decided to do a little sight seeing. We checked into the Pacific Hotel and walked to the Tram entrance, a short hike directly behind our hotel. The tickets were $9 each for the tram ride up and once at the base of the tower, we purchased a ticket to the observation deck of the tower. Another $9 each. The tram ride offers a great view, though I was disappointed that it wasn't air conditioned. In case you haven't heard, summer and winter weather in Seoul is extreme! The park at the base of the tower is very nice with lots of areas to sit and enjoy the view, restaurants, a bar and shopping areas. The elevator ride to the top of the Tower is quick with a fun video to keep your mind off the quickness of the ride. The observation deck has a restaurant, a bar, a candy shop and plenty of shopping. It even offers a post office with lots of fun stationary for purchase. The lines to get up/down to the park and tower are long, though it is very organized. I would suggest adding another drink machine in the staging area to the tram. There is one right before you get to the stairs. It would have been nice to have a machine as you walk into this room."
Skyline of Seoul,"I went to Namsan Tower twice, both of them on the last week of June. I visited it at night time and on the afternoon the next day afterwards just so that I will be able to witness the night view and day view. The night view was kind of a shame to be honest because it was very foggy so we weren't able to see much of Seoul's skyline. However, the day view was really amazing. Also, Namsan Tower had a lot to offer. I went to the observatory and had the 360 degree view of Seoul. The love locks were great, considering the number of locks that were in there. It was such a shame that I was alone when I came to visit. They also have the hanbok experience which I greatly enjoyed. It's definitely one of the must visit when you're in Seoul."
A must-go! ,Nothing really special but it is still entertaining! You can take a lot of nice pictures there and see wonderful places~
Great place with loads of activities,"N Seoul Tower is the signature observatory tower of Seoul, sitting on top of Namsan Park. It also houses thematic museums, cafes, restaurants and souvenir shops, so you have plenty of options on what to do.At 10,000 won per entry, N Seoul Tower is one of the cheapest observatories that I have been to. You can mix and match your ticket to have museum entries, food or dining experience to go with it. For a really romantic night, you can make advanced booking (they don't accept walk-ins) for n.Grill, a high class French restaurant. Really enjoyed my experience here. We had a lovely coffee at the cafe on the observatory tower with an equally lovely view. Highly recommend in for an evening outing paired with dinner so you get to see both the day and night view."
Beautiful Travel Spot,"Winter time must visit, so beautiful from the top. if summer time suggest only visit in the evening, it's too hot. "
A Place Worth Visiting ,"This is a place that I will visit during my every trip to Seoul. My usual time to be at the cable car station by 5pm. It kind of make me slow things down, feeling relax. But for god sake, they should have set a limit for the number of people in each cabin! I mean look, why would people rather pay a little more to get on cable car? For speed? Haha I’m kidding.. To have a better view and of course some selfies and scenery shoots. But the sad thing that I’ve encountered (almost every visit except once), all I could do was lifting up my hand and blind snapping. Can you imagine that there isn’t any space for me to just turn around. Kind of feeling sorry for the sardines packed in cans... Well, that’s the only negative feedback I have. Overall, from the young to the old that’s a place worth visiting. I leave the place feeling happy, always. Oh, don’t forget to get a set of lock before the ride. The shops selling at quite a reasonable price. Those locks aren’t just meant for lovers (K Drama misleads me). Lol!"
Great view,The view at the top is great. The surrounding area is also a pleasant park for relaxing. There is also a ‘love locks’ area at the base of the tower. 
Great views,"Got the cable car, no queue when I was there, and got amazing views of Seoul. If you go into the Seoul Tower Plaza you can get almost 360 degree views without having to pay to go up the tower. Well worth a visit but if you don’t make it during your trip then I wouldn’t worry."
Interesting spot,"While in Seoul, an nice spot to spend your afternoon hours is the tower of Seoul. Sleepy after lunch but not tired enough Seoul tower offers you the excitement that you need but still in a relaxed mood. Its a place for families, young couples and groups of tourists."
Seoul iconic skyscraper,You can take a cable ride or bus to this place. Try to skip ticketing line by purchase your ticket online. The tower offers a digital observatory with a 360° panoramic view located on the third floor of the N Tower.
Save time & money on tower visit,"We did the cable car and elevator to the top of the tower. Total cost is about $20USD a person and takes at least 3 hours The view at night was pretty cool, but not a ""must see"". If you have spare time or just like towers and cable cars (like me), then go ahead and spend the time & money.Otherwise, you can take a public bus close to base of tower, then walk around the grounds to get some good views and pictures. Skip the elevator to tower observation and walk back down to bus. Total cost is $3 and takes less than one hour."
Best views of Seoul,"We went to the N Seoul Tower in the morning which was a cool ride with the cable cart followed by a small climb and lift ride rewarded with the best possible views of Seoul. It is on the tower where you realise what a massive city Seoul really is. Although I think the tickets to the top of the tower were worth it, if you're on a budget you can ""just"" walk (more like ""climb"") up to the base of the tower which still provides a very impressive sight of Seoul. Just make sure you don't plan that for the afternoon on a summer day. Good alternative to the Lotte World Tower as well."
Always want to hit the heights!,"You can walk there from downtown and get the free funicular to the cable car - the view at the base of the tower is as good as the top of the tower and there’s actually a few things to do prior to going up the tower. I would recommend potentially not paying the 10,000 to go higher up in the tower if money is tight - but still enjoyed it!"
Great sceneries ,The place is worth visiting and U should prepare your camera as the place is pictures-tic .U have to take a cable ride to the top and then another ticket to go to the top floor for the unforgettable view .
Great Views,"Once I got on the correct city bus, we drove to the top of the hill where the tower was. Make sure you buy a ticket beforehand. The views from the top in the observatory are spectacular. The city and Han River are very picturesque in the evening."
Must see views!,"We went to the top @ night. Restaurants require advance reservations and probably that you not be as bedraggled as we looked when we arrived after hiking Namsan on a hot & humid day... :-DWorth seeing the view from the top, particularly at night. Can get crowded."
"Gorgeous view from tower, wait was long though","If you want to get to tower by cable car, from the ticket booth, expect a 60 wait to get into the cable car, then once you get up to the tower, you need to purchase another ticket to enter the tower, another 15 minutes wait. The wait was long but was well worth it. Don’t forget to visit the bridge with all the love locks on it. On the way back, we didn’t use the cable car because the line was too long, so we hiked down and the view was beautiful as well. So if you plan to use cable car, just one one way ticket if you want to avoid the line to get down. "
Good tower to visit,N seol tower is one of the favorite tower to visit. A lot of beautiful view to see around the tower. 
Not worth it,"I usually love visiting the tower / tall buildings in a city but this one is not worth it. Maybe it was because we went on Friday night but the queues were ridiculous. We took the cable car up, which had a long queue. Then there are a lot of steps from there (not great when you are traveling with older people who struggle with steps), and then when at the top, you have to queue again to get up the tower. At the top of the viewing deck, I found the glass to be dirty, and there were so many people that it wasn't enjoyable. If you are going to go, consider just taking the bus up the hill and enjoying the view from the top of the hill - in fact, it is better!"
Beautiful in the Spring,"I didn't actually go up the tower, it was good enough to stay down and take photos from outside. The hop on hop off bus stops here, which is nice and convenient. You can put a lock on the fence if that's what you're here for. There's TONS of cherry blossoms all over during the spring, which is when I came. You will be able to get a LOT of great photos without paying to go up to the top, which is what I'd recommend."
Wasting time,"I don’t recommend people to visit, as the sightseeing is not good enough, and I take a couple of hours to wait for the tram to get there. And I only spend 20 minutes to see the sightseeing. You won’t want to see this after you have been to Victoria’s Harbour in HK"
Will visit again,"If you want to go to this place but on tight schedule, use their cable car. The cable car station is around 10 minutes walk from exit 3 of myeongdong station. But if you have extra time, just walk uphill while enjoying the scenery. Sadly when I visited here in May, it is misty so I cannot take a good pictures"
Pretty view from the top,"Caught the Cable Car from the bottom after getting in the sideways elevator from the street. The views are amazing. Try to stick to the Left on the way up and the Right on the way down for better views. Up at the bottom of the tower there is a bit to see and do with restaurants and lookouts and exhibits. Probably more to do when the weather is not so hot because there looked like nice walking trails around. We were here to find the location of something from one of the Kdramas we watched and once we found the right spot we didn't bother to go right up the tower (and we had been up Seoul Sky Lotte Tower anyway). There were restaurants up here and we ate at one as they were reasonably priced, which was a pleasant surprise. My friends were visiting for a second time and it was fun to try to find their love lock again in amongst the massive amount of them there!!"
N Seoul Tower-rrific! ,Classic experience with a thrill of riding the cable car.The landscape is amazing.Clean and comfortable.Friendly staff.Good view.Thank you for great experience and history. 
Beautiful nightview,"I recommend to visit the N Seoul Tower at night because the view at night is way more beautiful than the morning view. There is an option of walking or taking the cable train up, so I took the cable train up. there is a bit of wait when we went up and went down after. I would suggest to have a meal in myeongdong area before going up since the pricing at N Seoul Tower would be pricey and limited in selection. Tickets comes in a bundle when purchase at the ticket store, that could range from 2 different visits with N Seoul Tower or N Seoul Tower ticket + a meal at one of the food area there. When you go up, there could be a lot of ppl but don't let the crowd ruin your time because the nightview is simply amazing."
"Lines, numbers, line again....a mess","First you have to buy a ticket at the booth and you are given a number. No , you cannot just go wait in line,you have to actually wait until your number is called and it has nothing to do with the number of people in the tower, nothing. After you number is called you wait in the actual line for the elevators to go up. I takes an hour for a number to get called, then another 30-40 minutes before you are in the elevator. To go back down there is an actual line for the elevator and upon descent to get out you have to walk through an entire retail store."
very good,it looks very beautiful at night and if you visit you will not regret. very nice view of the city and we enjoyed every bit of time we stayed at the tower
Nice view,"We had to wait for a specific bus that could bring us to the top, quite odd they dont allow taxis there. Beautiful view of seoul at night, wish we could stay longer as it wasnt included in our tour group itinerary so we went on our own at night. Might've been nice to see it during the day."
The High Tower @ Seoul,"Locations in the highlands of Seoul, you can see the sights of Seoul from here, especially when looking at the Tower. You can enjoy the view of Seoul from a highest place. Attention for time to visit, consider about backlight"
Nothing Special ,I went in the morning and the view was OK. It wasn’t that much better than from the viewpoints below. It’s affordable and probably one of the better city views from a urinal that you will see. 
Another tower,"The Namsan Tower was built in 1972 and is the second highest point in the city at 236 meters. Inside you will find restaurants, food courts and observation decks. It is located in the middle of Namsan park."
Landmark in Namsan Park,"The object of the morning was to hike through Namsan Park and make our way up to N Seoul Tower, we had not need to visit the tower, rather reach the summit and check out the views of Seoul. There are several ways to reach the tower, hike, cable car or vehicle, from the main road in the vicinity of the cable car is a long staircase and pathway up to the tower, 1200 metres long, there are only a few drinking water fountains along the way and one toilet facilities before reaching the summit. Once we arrived at the tower there were visitors everywhere, school children on excursions, tour bus groups and independent visitors like us, it is a very popular destination in Seoul. There are other things to see other than the tower, there's a large temple, the Namsan Bongsudae Beacons (five chimneys) and the fabulous views. There are locks everywhere, designated surfaces for the locks, all over fences, while rather colourful and great to photograph I do not believe in this movement."
Amazing views!,Only went initially as the boy wanted to go- we took the cable car up (which was around 7500 each for one way and 9000 return)- you can't buy a combination cable car/tower ticket. We opted for the beer/popcorn/tower combo which was only 6000 extra (total 26000 for 2) which was amazing value as the beer was delicious and the popcorn was a good size and gave you several flavour choices. We went at sunset and got great views over the city although it's not as tall as most other towers. We took the stairs back down and it took less than half an hour and you had another great view point half way down. We ended up going back during the day as well and took the stairs up and down which wasn't a taxing climb at all and only took around 40 minutes. We went back to do the love locks (we bought one at the shop where the cable car starts-but you can also buy them at the tower itself). The locks are very colourful and make for good photo ops as well. It was good to get the views during the day as well-though we didn't go up the tower a second time.
Second visit that still count !,"This is our second visit, still nice to look around but a very hot weather even it is located on the hill ! We buy rainbow ice cream that almost instantly melt...Second floor with locks surrounding for taking pictures. Nice view of city of Seoul from here."
Complete 360 Views Of Seoul City,it is one of must-visit places to complete your tour in Seoul. The 3060 views from observation deck is a great way to understand the city layout and location of those famous places in Seoul. I can see the famous lotte tower from here.
go in the evening,We went just before sunset. The views are amazing. the views got better as it got darker. it is worth the view.
Worth to visit,"As Namsan Seoul Tower is the symbol or the icon of South Korea, this place is worth to visit. It is very well known for its love locks hanging everywhere. You don’t need to buy tickets if you only want to hang your love lock there. You can also go inside the plaza to see around, take a picture and enjoy the food. You only need to pay if you want to go to the top of the tower and to take the cable car. Moreover, there is also a performance and you can enjoy it for free. For the lock, it is suggested to bring your own because it’s quite pricey there. Overall, Namsan Seoul Tower is worth to visit place."
Great Views of Seoul,"On a clear and not too smoggy day, the views of Seoul were fabulous. Even though the Tower and the area around the base of the Tower are highly commercialized, the 360-degree views were worth it. The views from the washrooms were great too.Upon entering the Tower, you can get your photo taken then it’s photoshopped onto a background with the Tower which you can buy up at the Tower. There are several restaurants and a coffee shop up at the Tower. A candy store and a gift shop are also located in the observation deck of the Tower. You can dress up in a hanbok and get your photo taken too.The area around the base of tower is covered with love locks. There is a vending machine that sells love locks at the base. There is an arcade and a virtual reality room at the base along with a restaurant and other food outlets."
Breathtaking view,A ride up in the large cable car is the start of a wonderul journey. Once you arrive at the viewing platform up the tower the 360 degree views are outstanding. Make sure you visit the bathrooms....its worth a look too. If you part with a few thousand won you can buy a Love Lock and leave it attached to the railings with your loved ones details on it...there are millions of love locks there 
Perfect place to view Seoul,"Really awesome super tall building! Lots of entertainment at the base, and you can pay a bit to go up to the top where there is more entertainment. Cool depictions of other super tall buildings and cities around the world in the windows."
Breath taking views of Seoul!,"Me and my parents went here to visit and this place is amazing! So plenty of picture opportunity! We paid around 23,000 Won to get to up the Tower. I personally wanted to get to the tippy top but we were told we needed to request a reservation! lol! Oh well, maybe next time! But the view we got was still amazing!!! Please check out my photos! Oh, parking here is a no-go! You have to go park near where the gondola is at or near the science building (with the round/dome roof)."
The trek up is killer,"There is a very long steep climb up before you even get to the base to go up 4 flights of stairs and then the elevator to take u to the top. Once at the top the view is beautiful. There is a gift shop, a few food places and the fences with the locks. Alot of nice picture taking opportunities."
Lock in Your Love,"Who knew that N Seoul Tower (or originally known as NamSan Tower) is the Eiffel Tower of Korea? That being said, don't be surprised in seeing the hundreds of couples that venture out here. If you take the elevator ride to the top, not only will you get to see the great cityscapes and beautiful scenery of afar but see millions of locks that couples have locked on to ""lock up their hearts"" for each other. It's pretty cool to see."
Make it a leisurely day. Worth the visit. A lot of greenery and well maintained,"Spend a leisurely half day here. On a hill top with a lot of greenery. We took the circular bus up the hill and it was a very comfortable to get there. The adventurous also walk up the hill. You take a lot of photos from the observatory tower or the lower deck when we came down. The 'love locks' all around the lower deck is interesting and a lot of other railings/areas are getting to grow these colourful locks. We also visited the 'hello kitty museum' (additional ticket). Which was very nice and loveable. A nostalgic visit and we took a lot of photos. You can buy the Observatory Tower entry ticket on Klook.com. They will give a discount and it is valid for one year. Even if you go up the hill, you do get a good view of the city down under from the lower deck even w/o going to the observatory tower (which has a ticket) {this deck is up the broad stairs somewhat opp. the Hello Kitty Museum}. The observatory tower, is like any other tower in other cities with an all around city view. There is an upper deck and a lower deck after you go up. There is seating on the lower deck here where there is a coffee shop.  To get to the Tower we took the subway train:• Subway Line 3, Dongguk University Station, Exit 6, take the CIRCULAR bus 02/03/05 (Strongly Recommend)OR • Subway Line 3/4, Chungmuro Station, Exit 2 (in front of Daehan Cinema), take the CIRCULAR bus 02/05• Subway Line 4, Myeongdong Station, Exit 3, take the CIRCULAR bus 05The Namsan Circulation Bus operates every 15-20 mins and goes to a lot of places in Central Seoul (you can choose as you deem fit for yourself), The fee is KRW1200 or 1250 by cash and KRW1100 or 1000 by T-money Card {one way cost}After you get down from the bus, there is a short steep climb to the deck (as referred above where u do not need a ticket). You can shorten this climb; look out for a lower entry with a lift (on the left side as you climb up - you cannot miss it)"
 nice photo spot,"this place is good enough to take pictures, but the road to this place is quite tiring because there is a fairly steep incline ... this place has a nice souvenir shop. at the top if you are a couple then can put a padlock of love so that the couple's wish materialized. this tower is south korea icon so if you visit seoul then you must come to this place."
On the top,Nice place to view the city view of Seoul. Just take the cable car or walk up the trail to the top. Nice view!!!
nice view,I walked until the top and it worth it. Nice view and lovely place. I was stopped at the place that there were a million of key love chain or I don't know how to called.
The Eiffel tower of Korea,"Namsan tower is renowned as an iconic national landmark and for its cityscape. This place attracts many tourists and even locals especially during night time when the tower lights up. There are many attractions aside from the tower itself; the most famous one is the ""locks of love"" where people- especially couples go to."
N Seoul Tower,"A scenic place to visit. Pleasant surroundings provide a relaxing atmosphere, while enjoying the view."
Amazing View,A must go visiting Seoul. Fantastic view despite the drizzle and chilly evening. Be ready to walk a bit.
Churros Ice-Cream,We took the cable car up and take note you still need to hike up the stairs abit before you reach the base of the tower. We did not experience the tower itself but mainly there for the love locks and experience. Buy the superbly delicious churros ice-cream or rainbow ice-cream from the cafes there and take a sit at the viewing gallery where there are high chairs for you to sit like a bar and enjoy the magnificient view while enjoying the sweet treat. It's FREE! :) We went to the Hanbok Cultural Museum at the basement and had a fantastic time but that is another review. 
Stunning sunset,"There is an option to take the cable car ride, but we chose to hike (from Myeongdong to Namsam park, then to the tower), and enjoyed the scenery on the way up. We reached the tower at 5pm, and stayed till after sunset (approximately at 7.20pm). The sunset was absolutely stunning! Do plan your trip up strategically so that you can catch the sunset!"
Tourists destination,"For me there are too many people. It is somewhat interesting to get on top and to see Seoul from that hight. But there is not much to do up there. After Lotte Tower was built, this Tower became even less attractive. If you are really interested, you can go one time. But it is not in the top 20 things to do in Seoul. To make it interesting, do the trekking from Botanical Garden or Dongguk University up the hill to the Tower. Also crowded on weekends like everything else in Seoul."
Magnificent scenary.. breathtaking!,"This is a great experience. The tower itself at night is mesmerizing.. couldn’t get enough of it.. the panoramic night view is so breathtaking.. the best time to visit is in the evening before sunset... i would recommend to get the single trip cable car ticket and walk down as there are more nice views along the way down..Besides, the cable car has very long queues going down.we bought a return cable car tickets but ended up walking down due to the long queue. Blessing in disguise... we enjoyed the walk in cool breeze and nice scenery."
accessible high hill for city view,worth going in a clear day. You can see even the ancient buildings in Changdeokgung Palace and Gyeongbokgung Palace from just the lookout at the ground of the N Tower. No need to go up the tower unless you want to enjoy a decent western meal there.
Breathtaking ,"Been to London, to Paris, to Sydney, to Berlin, to Dublin, to Dubai sightseeing towers but nothing compares to what you experience on top of Seoul one. Maybe Jungfrau panoramic restaurant in Switzerland can be on a par with it. "
Nice view but slightly crowded :),"We went here a saturday so I would say it was our own fault about the crowdiness ;). The view over Seoul was astonishing and the amount of padlocks were mindblowing! Even though we had to wait quite a bit to go both up and down the cable car, and up and down the tower, I would say the trip was worth it! Be prepared with a big bucket of patience and a portable fan "
Nice Tourist Spot,This was a nice place to take my sister visit but I think that it is overrated. The cable car was hot and crowded. You have workers trying to pressure you to take a picture to purchase before you can actually enjoy the tower. Don't expect anything spectacular.
A nice outing and couple time,"We had planned to go up to this namsan tower park but not sure whether to take the cable car or bus. Understand that there is also a ""travelator"" option too and of course walk up (cycle up too). So finally while walking along myeongdon area, we just walked to the bus stop and took the number 3 shuttle bus (15 minute intervals, 120won per adult) that brought us all the way up to the top. We just needed to walk another 300m from the bus terminus to the peak. The weather was hazy that day so we decided its no point paying to go up to the tower observation deck. The time was 530pm and the weather was cooling down but still bright. We walked about to take photos of the view of Seoul city. There were lots of tourist but the place was quite spacious. There was a section of the base where visitors bought locks and locked it into the fence - I think similar to one of the ""love bridges"" in Paris.There are some shops and several F&B options up there at the base of the tower.We took a bus down again and it brought us back to myeongdon subway station. The ride was comfortable in AC public bus. Not crowded at all. We enjoyed the outing and including the time we spent together on the bus rides. Everything moment made the time memorable."
Lots of walking but worth it,"The buses are limited from a certain area so you’re left to walk up a long steep hill. It’s doable as many people all ages were making the trek. Once at the top, the very was very nice. There are stores and food options without having to go to the top. The tickets to the top were about $8 per adult. The elevator was quick and once to the top they have photo booths, candy, food, souvenirs and great 360 views of Seoul. It was definitely worth it. Then on the way down you can explore each floor and the interesting details that each has. "
Impressive night Seúl view,"N Seúl Tower visit is better at night because you can appreciate the lighting Seúl city and is more beauty, the schedule visit is until 23 hrs. You can ride the cable car or go up by stairs ways The people who works and the staff services very professional I really recommend this attraction is very fun and good experience."
DO NOT COME ON A FRIDAY OR SATURDAY NIGHT!,"Crazy long ques and crowds pushing and shoving, definitely not worth it. Very rushed by staff to get you in and out."
ROMANTIC PLACE FOR LOVERS!,"Great view and nice place, this place is good for group of friends and lovers. The place is full of love, very romantic theme and a 360 view for seoul korea."
Great view,"To be honest it quite crowded place, however 360° view is great. Note, due to glass window to take a good pictures is very limited.Worth visiting,"
View of the city,You could get a sense of the direction and whole view of the city and the main rivers in the city. A very impressive view of the city. 
Crowded but pretty,"Visited during the summer with the hope of catching the pretty night view, but the afternoon went long, and until 7PM the sky was still bright. Went up to the 360° observatory deck and the view is very pretty indeed. You can see the city of Seoul, the Han River from many angles. I suggest you order the ticket from online websites before your visit as you can get cheaper price (e.g. Klook).Below the tower is the love lock place you can enter for free and a spacious park where you can also view the city from a height.There are many senior citizens visiting the place to exercise and stroll with friends."
Too noisy up the observation deck and bright reflections on the glass at night which ruin the view,"I went on a Thursday night on a bus (not many people using the bus which was good) around 8 pm. The evening was humid with some light rain. When I got to the bus terminus by the tower, the sky was still clear enough for some good night view of Seoul. By the time I got up the observation deck of the tower, it was very noisy and crowded with people, with loud music playing in the background, and bright light inside which cast strong reflections on the glass. All these kind of ruined the night view and made the visit very unatmospheric. Then mist set in and everything was shrouded. I stayed for a short time and left. I have visited quite a number of high towers in different cities and many offer great views day and night. This is probably the worst experience I have had so far. I guess it would be much better if I go during the day on a weekday when the weather is fine. "
Good view on the centre of the city,"It may sound boring, but it's always a good idea to take a view from the top of the tower when you are in a new place. Seoul Tower included. Awesome view, especially at night. Also great at daytime. It costs 10,000 won per person to get on the tower.You need to get on the cable car to get up to the NamSan Mountain, or walk. Taxi and private vehicle cannot go up to the mountain for protection of environment reason. You can use either bus or cable car. We used the cable car. Round trip 8,500 won, one way 6,000 won."
Good view,"What I didn't like you have to pay separate for the cable car and tower. Not to mention it was very crowded (Thursday). True we did go kinda late, around 21.00. At 21.30 all the restaurants are closed and we really wanted to dine with the view."
Amazing views ,Only spent a short while here as it gets so busy. If you have a good camera then night time isn’t so bad but if you don’t then day time visit is better to capture the best pictures. 
Nice 1.5km walk,"Nice 1.5 km walk, with lots of stairs. Once you are up there you can put a love padlock. Otherwise to get up in the tower you need to pay a restaurant. There are French, italian, Korean, burger restaurant. Or you can also just pay 10000 to go up to the deck. But restaurants have nice offer."
Ok but too crowded on weekend,"I went there twice, one during week day day time and another on weekend night. The week day day time was great, not too crowded with good view. On the weekend night it was really crowded and the wait was 40 minutes going up and 40 minutes going down. Not worthy! We didn't pay additional to go up the observation tower level since the base level offers a good view already.It's worthy going up there, but not on weekend."
"Nice at night, strategic location, but it's quite a hike","Located near Myeongdong station, so it's easy to reach. You need to walk around 1 hour to reach the top (assuming you take picture along the way). But it's like mini hiking all the way. elderly / children stroller / wheelchair will be difficult to go. There is a cable car but you have to pay. Beside, it's more fun to walk actually because there are things to see / restaurant / interesting photo opportunities. "
Panoramic,"I had a two hour visit to the N-Seoul tower with a tour guide miss Sue Chung, a government certified English tour guide. N Seoul tower – the highest point of Seoul - from where you can enjoy panoramic views over the city. You could find hello kitty museum onsite. The view from the top was panoramic. SEE photos."
Amazing View,The Namsam Tower is a must see destination when visiting Seoul. It has an amazing voew both day and night and most of all it is the perfect place to lock your love with your special someone ;)
A nice cablecar experience ,"This is one of the attractions to accomplish during any Seoul visitA bit crawled becuase of touristic mean.Wondeful place to take panoramic photos, selfies of Seoul from different angles.I'd recommend visit this place during late afternoon so you could enjoy sun set and why not enjoy something elseYou need to pay to get to the top which I would recommend to do it but if you're looking to jump higher you have to visit Lotte Tower ... 555m "
Nice if you're on a romantic trip but low priority,"Went June 2018. Walked up the 800 or so steps - thought the views might be worth it. Not worth it. Recommend taking the cable car. We paid the cable car one way for going down. They do pack the cable car tight with people. The city view is nice. Nothing to brag about. If you're on a romance trip and want to do the love lock thing, it's nice. Otherwise, go if you have plenty of time. "
N Seoul Tower/Namsan Tower,"We didn't plan on visiting the tower that day. We got lost and found ourselves going that way. We sure did a lot of walking up hills that day, including up the steps to the cable cars level as the elevator car wasn't working when we first got there. However, the views were worth every step. Walk 360 degrees around the viewing area and be amazed. The view from the women's bathroom wasn't too bad either."
"Yeah, another Tower",Unless you are a world tower traveler not sure there is anything here for you. It goes up and offers a nice view of the city. That is true and overpriced THe revolving restaurant is WAY overpriced. I only ate there b/c we won a free meal and the 2 glasses of nasty wine was still $20.00. The walk was good exercise up the little trail though. 
Not to be missed while in Seoul,"The view from upthere is really amazing. Not to be missed while in Seoul, but it is a quick visit that needs to be inserted in a more comprehensive itinerarium."
Great during day or night,"During the day, you get a great view of Seoul. The night view is also amazing. Any tourist must add this to your places to visit."
#Seoulmates,This is my favorite. The love lock is so nice to visit. Cool place and and when you look around you will see very nice korea. 
Not worth it,"This is a far away tower, so you get to see the city but from far. I'm not a very big ""seeing big cities from above"" fan so for me the time to get there and the whole experience wasn't worth it.Lots of shops, some restaurants and it's located in a park, so that was particularly nice."
Awesome,"Sunset from the top is breathtaking. After coming in, one can stay in the observatorium for unlimited time - great for the beers + popcorn combo :) "
Cool place to visit,"If you want to get here on the cable car you have to pay 9.50 won per person, round trip. The view of Seoul from the tower is amazing. After an hour you will want to leave the place. Not much to do other than enjoy the amazing view. Oh! You will get a cool/crazy surprise when you visit their bathrooms on the top of the tower. If you decide to visit this location, feel free to let me know what do you think...he,he They have a souvenir store in the plaza and there is another store on top of the tower. There are restaurants on top of the tower and places to buy tea, water, ice creams, churros and others on the bottom. Once you are out of the cable car you will climb some steps that will take you where the thousands and thousands of locks are. Next time I want to visit during night time."
Ok place to visit ,"We visited the observatory, Hello Kitty land and Ssentoy Museum. It is worth it if you travel there and visit all 3 places in the building. We did not go to the place with locks as the weather was very hot and we weren't interested."
Just a tower!,"Its good to see the tower and park,but comparing to other towers ,i think its not very special.there are souvenir shops, city view cameras, some love realted decorations and designs for taking photos....etc.the ticket can be bought at the entrance."
Good views,"The tower was beautiful. Starting off its not hard to get too. If you want to take the cable car then you'll get off at Myeong-dong station and walk about 15 minutes towards the Pacific Hotel to the right. The only thing about the cable car is 1. There are very few cable cars so you won't get your own car but you'll be on it with about 15/20 other people.2. The wait time depending on the time of day you go can take up to 30 minutes to an hour. THIS IS JUST ONE WAY btw!3. Be prepared to spend more time waiting in line for the cable car if you decide to do round trip.Another way you can go up is by bus which is very efficient. Buses 2,4 and 5 will take you there and from there you can walk up the hill or ramp. Once you get up you'll see the love locks (which you can lock your lock) in numerous spots around the tower. You'll also enjoy the beautiful scenery. I enjoyed the night view for I loved how lighted the city was and how quiet it was to just enjoy the lights, breeze and view. I also heard that going during the day was just as nice.  You don't need to go to the observatory deck to see the 360 view of the city for your able to see it below but if you want to do something extra then you can pay to do it and easily pick up your tickets. It's also best to book your tickets in advance for the observatory deck.Overall I would recommend."
Beautiful Night Scene,"We do enjoy the night scene from the top, but the strong wind is too cold so we keep stay in the building itself. Due to the strong wind , the cable car is stop operating and we do need to go to Seoul Tower by bus. It is quite convenient too. The most amazing part is the toilet , is a big see through glass window, you can enjoy the night scene while poo'ing or pee'ing."
"Worth it, when clear sight ","Went there on a Friday with really good air quality, so the sight was impeccable! The price of 10k Won is fair. The staff was absolutely bored, however no interaction is needed to enjoy the view... "
Absolute Must See,I reached the foot of the tower at night and the decks there offer a spectcular view. I couldnt go to the top as was part of a guided night tour. Next afternoon took the cable car to the foot and then bought a decently priced ticket to the observatory deck .. awesome view i reached at around 4 pm so it was a bit early. Would recomend going around 1900 (7pm) for best of both worlds day light and illuminated beauty of the city. And if the timing is right the sunset. 
Good value for money and good views,Worth the trip to the top. There is a funicular to the cable car station which we took ages to find >_< but it was worth looking for it. The views in the cable car are alright but nothing compared to when you get up the tower. There is also a HK Island (museum type of Hello Kitty) and a toy museum. We bought the ticket that lets us into all three while we were there. You can skip this if you don't have interest in these things but I'm a child at heart so I loved it.
First tine taveller,We opted for the paid entrance online. But we found out you dont really need to go to the observatory deck to see the seoul skyline.Theres a portion below the tower which overlooks the city already. I would say that was equally satisfying already. I wouldnt have paid if I knew about it.Efficient eay to get there is via bus.Refer to the photo I took from the “free” view
good to spend a couple of hours,"Enjoyed the cable ride up to the tower, it was a cloudy and wet day, so the views we enjoyed from up were not that great. There is a hanbok rental and photoshoot place at the tower, as also Hello Kitty Museum and another kids museum - both small but good to keep kids excited. There are cafes too. "
"The view was phenomenal, but the tower itself is a little bit of a let down.","The view from all around the tower is great and could not ask for better, however you do not need to actually go up the tower. The surrounding views are great on their own and doesn’t get that much better that it is worth the money. Besides up top is just a massive tourist trap. There are some shops and stuff at the base of the tower that are neat and a Starbucks for your caffeine fix. So overall would make the trip to it again to see the surrounding area but not the top of the tower."
Worth it just for the tram ride!,"There are a lot of cliche things to do in big cities, and visiting their ""tallest buildings"" is one of them. But this was truly a nice experience. From the lush setting to the fabulous views, it is very much worth the trip. Plus, you can take a tram to get to it. As Miranda's mum would say, ""such fun!"" Not only do you get amazing views of the city, but you can send postcards all over the world! They provide the postage. Make sure you have enough memory free on your phone - you will be taking a lot of pictures. Also, right before the elevator to the top of the tower, the staff take a picture of you that you can purchase later. Very expensive and not worth it. I saw signs that said no pictures, but everyone was. They sell popcorn like you are going to the movies, like this is an EVENT. Inside the elevator they play a short clip that you watch on the ceiling. At first I didn't understand why, but it makes sense. How awkward would it be to be crammed in a silent elevator with 10 other people trying not to make eye contact? Great for the whole family. Tons of food options too. Also, if you are with your boo, you can leave a lock on the railings like the French used to do on the Pont des Arts bridge in Paris. Very cute."
Great view of Seoul area,"The tower is very nice and surrounded by cafes, shops and places to just sit and relax if you don't want to go up. If you do go up, you get a 360 degree view of all of Seoul and the surrounding cities. It is mind boggling how many buildings there are here. The bathrooms in the tower are also amazing as they look out on the view! "
Beautiful Veiws,It was a fun hike up to Seoul Tower. It had some breathtaking views of the nearby mountains. It didn’t hurt they had a deal for tickets when I went.
great view on a clear day!,"Sadly I picked a very misty day so there was not much of a view.Easy to get to with public transport, Good staff to assist with directions. Fast lift. Nice gift shop."
Worth a look," View from the tower is spectacular. Go on a day were the pollution is low and you can see forever, there is plenty to do and eat around the tower spend a half day there and it is well spent. "
Locks and Lights,"Ideal to go here in the afternoon while there's enough light to see the colorful love locks and walk around the area. Then wait the sunset at the top of the tower.And see the lights change from daylight to city night lights. There's entrance fee so be sure to check Klook or other sites for discounts .Like other tourist spots, there are shops to buy souvenirs and coffee☺️"
Best place to see Seoul at night,A very nice place to see Seoul at night. Be sure you get there by sunset and stay a bit afterward. You can reach the place with the cable car or walk up the hill. Nice walk.
Good view of seoul ,Went there before sunset and it was lovely. The tower itself not high only 5th floor bit since it was up high on the hill so the view is 360 ard seoul. Lovely area ard the tower. The tower itself is not big and gets crowded during peak time. Got a lots of school kids doing field trip when we were up there so going down took us 45 mins queque time 
Nice view,Provides a good view of Seoul. Should come late afternoon and leave at night so that you can see the day scene and the night scene. 
The Highlight of our trip,"This is a magical place esp for couple although i travelled with my daughter. We enjoyed our stay here for free. From chungmuro station there is bus no.5 or 2 as recommended by locals , it was easy to see the yellow bus , just look at the bus map if there is no.5 or 2 is passing by. We didnt pick a tour since we have a tight budget. The view here is so relaxing, it was summer but a little bit cold during late afternoon. We are looking forward for sunset but it was cloudy so we didnt really see it, too bad huh. Better bring your own love locks as it was 9$ there but it was too pretty and has vibrant colors."
Fabulous ,"I have been up many towers but this is one of the best. We used the cable car, which took no time at all. We went up in the evening and the atmosphere was amazing! It wasn’t expensive either compared to some others. I.e. Burj Khalifa, Dubai.It has food outlets, shops and a very happy, family feeling. Would highly recommend."
Lovers hot spot,"What an overwhelming sight. Below the famous Namsan Seoul Tower is a huge collection of locks hang on a long wall to symbolise endless love between not only lover but also within families. Also other wishes such as friends to meet up in 10 years time. With new locks adding daily, it is very difficult to find a spot on the original fence. Some hanging from another lock. Not only padlocks , we saw slippers and socks hanging too. Don't forget to sit on a heart chair - looks broken with a bend in the middle.Great view of the city from the Terrace. Padlocks selling at the premises are very pricey, suggest to get in advance from outside."
Nice View,We went there during the day. The view is nice and ok but I flew to Seoul after Tokyo and was much less impressed by the Seoul view (vs Tokyo Sky Tree night view). Maybe at night it would be better. The air around that area was very good and you can have nice walk around for an hour.
Nice view,"Nice view of the city, but not worth queuing and paying to go to the top. Tickets aren't expensive but the view in the tower is the same as what you get outside and there isn't anything much or special in the tower + insanely long queues. Take a bus up because its a steep walk up. One of the locals actually told us we can WALK from Myeongdong. Glad we didn't."
Lovely View of the City at Night,"It is worth a trip up the tower if it is not too crowded and the queue is long. The city scene up there is nice at night. Actually taking pictures of the city from the park below without the glass window is much better and clearer. But as a tourist, heading up to the tower is just some novelty."
Nice place to visit,Its a nice place with interesting things to do. The journey there is also just as interesting. The view from the tower and from the bottom of the tower is good and nice.
Takes too long to get there.,"The line to ride the cable car to get to the tower is so long, it took us approximately 2 hours. In the end, we only took pictures of the love locks and didn't go to the tower itself because it was so late by the time we went up. I don't recommend this if you don't have the patience for long lines. The view of the city from the top is also not spectacular."
So so,"N Seoul Tower is quite OK, but the view is amazing and it was a bit hazy today,the view could have been better (in my opinion). My kid thinks there is nothing much, but we agree that the love locks are interesting, with some dating back to 2006.Overall, a good experience. Might come again."
Stunning place to visit for a day out.,"Lucked out with no crowds or lines! Cable car up to the base gardens; quite a few stairs, lots of rock walls and stunning views make this outing one of the favourites of Seoul. Scoring a reasonable clear day, views were amazing, the gardens spectacular and the walkways well worth the time. Souvenirs, food, drinks and lots to do. Sit and enjoy the cool air or wander around the lush forested area - very much a spectacular spot. "
Its a tower,"cant really say much about the tower, i mean its a high place. if you want to enjoy more? get a package with ssentoy or hello kitty island depending on your preference no lines, though"
Overlooking Seoul!,"This place is cool! It has a led tv tunnel, bridge of love where you can post locks and several snack stores. I have not tried going up the observatory as an afraid of heights! "
Not as expected ,"I happened to watch a few shows and videos introducing the tower. I suppose the experience of getting there would be cute and romantic, but it didn’t give me that feeling. We went during sunset and was able to see the night view of Seoul. However, I think it’s not a very good place to look over Seoul."
Best view of Seoul.,"Obviously, you go here for the panoramic view. If at all possible, choose a clear day and you can see for miles. Come with your sweetheart and place a lock on the tunnel of love or one of the many sculptures provided to do so. Note: if you buy a souvenir picture, they give you a free digital download, which is a nice touch. Secondary note: even if you take the bus instead of hiking up, there is a pretty steep road to get to the tower. Be prepared. "
Nice evening,Stunning visit the price its OK to go up but the view is really worthy by night and sunset!!! We love it! Romantic spot! 
Dont bother,"Since in april and may weather is smokey and rainy! You wont be able to see any view,plus the pollution clouds coming from mainland chins"
Amazing view,"Would recommend visiting the place for the sheer beauty of the Seoul skyline from above. The cable car option for 8.5k both ways was pretty fine else the trek to the mountain can be exhausting. Since the queue on the way back can be longer, I would suggest to may be take the stairs on the way back and pay only for 1 way (depends on individual choice)The place is huge at the top with some good food options and the famous love lock bridge!The view from the top is great and I would recommend visiting during sunset!"
A scenic view overlooking Seoul City!!!,It's a breathtaking view from N seoul Tower. The place is really awesome overlooking Seoul City. It's really a great view from tower. You will surely appreciate the view especially at night!!
Great view,"We decided to go during the day - and this meant beating the queues! We had no waiting time at the ticket office, and we went straight up and enjoyed the view. It is lovely to be able to see the whole city laid out before you and be able to distinguish its different areas. I am sure the night view is great as well, but I can definitely recommend a day trip.I would suggest getting the cable car up and walking down, because although not steep it is a long, slow rise to get to the tower. If you're like us - enjoy walking but maybe not in the best shape! - then your legs are sure to be achy. And the cable car ride does offer a lovely view that's worth paying for. Inside the tower, you can pick up souvenirs (possibly slightly overpriced), eat at restaurants (quite dear), or perhaps enjoy a drink at the Twosome cafe. We had beer and cake there, and enjoyed the view for a surprisingly reasonable price.One thing to look out for are performances at the bottom of the tower. There's quite a large square with viewpoints alongside it. When we arrived, some sword-fight demonstration was going on. Worth staying behind a few minutes for if it's happening."
Nice place,Go earlier or you will have to queue for at least one hours after 6pm. Most ppl take cable car in the evening to be able to see the sunset. Food is costly up there. 
another must go place in seoul,"it is like the iconic tower in seoul that u simply cant miss. i have been to there for like 2 times already, so i didnt go up the tower. it was nov and we missed watching sunset when we arrived. still a lovely and beautiful place to visit"
Seoul’s official queue experience,"OMG THE QUEUES. 20 minutes to queue for a 8,000 KRW cable car ticket, 40 minutes to queue for the cable car itself, you pay 10,000 KRW extra per person for a ticket to the tower, 50 minutes to wait for the lift up the tower, spend 10 minutes admiring the decent views, then 20 minutes to wait for the lift back down, then 20 minutes to wait for the cable car down. "
Great way to see the size of Seoul city,"We did our usual hop-on-hop off bus on our first day visiting a new city. Seoul Tower was one of the first stops. Excellent way to take a birds-eye view over the city and surrounds. We were lucky to have a clear sunny day, we learned that it can get fairly smoggy and/or cloudy in Seoul. Our hotel was at the base of the Namsan hill in Myeongdong so the tower became a good 'home' landmark when wandering and becoming lost in the enourmous city. I am pleased we visited Seoul Tower on the first day of our visit to Seoul."
Good views. Can walk up or take cable car,"Landmark of Seoul. My revisit after more than 10 years! Views are the same, but much improved facilities after all these years. Restaurants and coffee shop on the observation deck floors. Walkable from downturn area or can walk to cable car station and take cable car up. 10,000 won for adult ticket to go up to observation deck. Restaurants and coffee places at the foot of the tower"
Nice spot,"It s one of the main attraction of SeoulBut my favorite part was the trails that I followed in order to go up and down , though the nasam parc, nature , follow the old wall , smells of flowers and treesReally nice experienceThe view from the top is so nice "
Presented very well,"A great view of the city and landscape. Noting the features from past and present. Very pleasant staff at all points of interest. The restaurant is pricey 120.00 for a steak dinner, great if you go in planning such.Walking down is worth the trip many more sights to see, points of interest and history of the wall and region."
"Hiking Opportunities, Pretty Views","The N Seoul Tower can be accessed in many different ways. I took the faster hike, and it took about 20-30 mins to complete until I reached the top. The restaurant options vary from burgers, to korean, and asian fusion. I ate at the Owl's Cutlet (Asian Fusion), and it was very tasty. ( the prices were very reasonable ). Would recommend visiting if you are interested is seeing a 360 view of Seoul."
Very good night view of Seoul,Beautiful view of the whole city at night and have a few paid attractions in the base area as well. Nice place to spend an evening with.
Beautiful scenery,"This is one of the most listed must visit attraction in Seoul. I'd say it is worth the time and energy if you love cityscape because it is really beautiful from above. Other than that, they have an indoor photo studio with hanbok rental, which you can wear outside the studio for several hours, some museums (I went to a Hello Kitty one and it was cute!) and restaurants and cafes, also gift shops. The only thing bothering me is that there's not much option to get there, as you need to pay for a cable car OR hike your way through the hill. I don't recommend the hiking option, it's really really far and not worth your time and energy (except if you live there, maybe you want to ""kill some time"" or exercise). Cars with diplomatic license number can go through and park in the tower area though."
"cable car and wall of ""love locks""","Good view from the top, with small exercise going up to the cable car station (we stay at hotel nearby myeongdong station).the attraction is a a lot of locks with names on it and it is plenty of them as well as colourful"
Great view over the city...,"If you are looking to see the city so you just got the place for..The view over the city is very nice, but have a look at the weather channel before you got on line for the ticket..."
It's OK to visit ,"Went up at Observatory deck of N Seoul Tower for curiosity. Went up there not to see the view of Seoul city, but to see the sky high bathroom and to dine in at one of the restaurants. That was it. "
Check the weather first!,It is easy to get here using public transport but it takes time so be sure to check the weather first otherwise you'll miss the view.I arrived in clear sunshine but in the next 45 minutes the cloud cover increased so I had very little time to see everything out the windows. You can see a long way when it is clear.It takes a while to come back down the tower too - not sure why but there seemed to be loads of people lining up to go back even as more arrived in the lift...N stands for Namsan in the title
Little Paris of Korea,"I fell in love with Korea the first time I visited it and I knew I had to come back. One of their popular tourist destinations is N Seoul Tower. My husband and I hung our love lock by the tower and wrote it with our names on it. It felt great! It's also a good idea for friendship, not just for couples. Locks may be bought from the store near the tower."
Loved the experience ,Beautiful views and lots to see! Hello Kitty was my favorite part. It was a little expensive but overall an unforgettable experience. 
The greatest view upon Seoul,"I went there a few weeks ago with my boyfriend and I have to admit the view is quite extraordinary! I really enjoyed the different activities too, even if I didn't feel like paying extra for some (like the Teddy Bear Museum). I think it is a bit disappointing that Seoul is most of the time foggy, so the view can get a bit limited on some days but I was lucky with my visit. Definitely a must, especially for couples!"
It's a must view point to look over the SEOUL!!!,"I've been there in first week of May... Nice weather and cool to visit there at that time... Located on Namsan Mountain and It's not that difficult to take bus to get there.... Terrible of long queue to take bus to get back down.. It's not worthy for 10$ to go up... But great place for the moment of Romantic time with your Love !! By the way, 10$ for pad locks that was sold as souvenir to lock up on the romantic area there..."
Great view from above!,"Definitely a place to visit when you in Seoul, the view from above is just great, recommended to visit"
Nothing special,If you’re under budget travel you can skip this. Nothing to do here accept looking for the city. Thats it. I suggest traveller just go to namsan park up to N Seoul Tower and skip the observatory. Its good enough.
Its a must see..,We visited at night. Nice to see the whole city with lights. Its little bit expensive to go up but its worthy.
What a view!,"A bunch of friends went up one fine morning to the tower. We took the cable car up and down, but recommend walking down - if not both ways. We also recommend going towards the end of the day to be able to see the view with both daylight and night lights popping up. Sunset view is amazing.Enjoy the walk and the view with a bunch of friends or your loved one. Worth it!"
Lovely weather + view,"U could choose to take the elevator or walk up to the cable car station. We wanted to take the elevator but when it came to our turn, the elevator broke down. So we had to walk up. It wasn't too bad though. We rode the cable car up to the tower and reached in time for sunset! "
Tipical attraction,"If the sky is clear the view is nice; even better at night. The tower is not very tall so it is, similar to anyother city; it is however very simbolic from seoul, there is like a small mall at the bottom of the tower and s¡sometimes cultural performances too."
Cool but know it's on a mountain,"I wasn't aware this was on the top of a freaking mountain. Took awhile to climb up but when getting to the top, you'll notice the tower itself isn't very big. The area up there is touristy, with shops and restaurants. Maybe get the cable car going up and walk down."
Great hike,"Lots of stairs and great hike up. We took the bus down. Evening is great, we had good pictures of the tower and the city. We didnt go up the elevator. There is a free 3D picture show the reruns about every 10 min. It was nice. "
Worth visiting place in Seoul,We went there on our anniversary and totally enjoyed the evening.There is souvenir shop too which is pricy.Italian cuisine restaurant serves great food.
Beautiful place with nice view,"This tower is worth checking out when you are in Seoul. However, the Korea buffet restaurant at the top level is over-priced and lack of varieties, not recommended. There are other restaurants in the vicinity which I think worth exploring."
Good stop for its view,Best for couples to come here and hang love locks on. We didn't get up to the top but surely it must be nice view from the top. It brings more feelings when come at night time 
Go visit - and walk the way up!,"The view from the N Seoul Tower is fantastic. You can see all off Seoul in every direction. Take a walk around the park for a pleasant walk (leftbound) around the park, starting from the Namsangol Hanok Village. Then it is a 3,5 km nice walk in the park with a not too steep walk. Or you can go up alongside the cable car which gives to a mot of steps."
The climb up is exhausting😂,"We took a bus from up to N Seoul thinking we have reached. Much to our horror, there was still a steep slope of 15min in order to get to the tower. It did not help that the weather was so cold and getting up there made us out of breath! The elevator up to the observatory was cool and the view of the whole city was breathtaking. Unfortunately, we went at night, and all the window panes were full of fingerprints. The place was dimly lit with several bright spots from the souvenir store that made photo taking really difficult. Was told by a friend whom went in april recently to go in the day as it is the spring period and there are sakura everywhere to seen. "
N tower,"Nice view of the city, nice park around, few pricy restaurant..... must be seen if you go on Seoul but do not aspect something incredible "
Must see when visiting Seoul,Great location to view the Seoul city. You will be amaze of the love locks there. You can also rent hanbok
Views and food,"Instead of getting a bus up like what other people seemed to be doing, we ended up climbing up the road through the park to get here. We were a bit rushed since we still had one more stop after the tower. We used the Discover Seoul pass for the entry ticket. There is a number on the ticket and you can only line up if your ticket number is within the range on display. While waiting you can get something to eat, shop for some souvenirs, or go look at a display like the Hello Kitty one by the ticketing area.The top had really nice views of the city. The glass had cities and their distance from the Tower which I thought was quite nice, particularly since Auckland was there. We somehow managed to get there for sunset which was quite nice.The plaza downstairs had plenty of shops and restaurants. Would've like to spend a bit more time to have a more thorough look at the area."
tour!!!,"You can see one of the best view of Seoul in this tower. Usually a bunch of people (tourists) are hanging around. Seoul is about 500 years old city. The first king of Chosun dynasty set up Seoul as the centre of Korea. Since then, it has been the hub of politics, economy and power. And now it is the capital of Republic of Korea.서울을 관람하는데 가장 좋은 장소!!! 사진 찍기에도 좋고 산책하기에도 좋으며 가족여행에도 굿!!! 요즘은 한국인보다 외국관광객이 넘쳐나는 곳!!!"
Hiking,"Great view up there. I think it's better at night, We had our private tour guide and he wanted to do everything in the morning lol. Try to visit this place when you are in Seoul."
Amazing views of Seoul,"Just got back from visiting Namsan Tower and Namsan Park. Get the cable car up (Or walk, but its quite steep!) and you'll get access to sweeping to the city skyline. Afterwards (or before hand like we did), take a walk around Namsan park. It's beautiful and full of colour."
Want to see the seoul .... Must visit. ,Second tallest tower in Seoul and it's a love lock location. The tower have 5 f. And each of the floor have it's own attraction. 
family visit,a good and must place to go in seoul. plenty of activities with surveniour to bring home. a lot of visitor but very lifely. public rest area with good house keeping. braveo to the korean. your country is very clean and polite people.
Gorgeous views of the city,"N Seoul Tower is worth the visit. Although we didn't climb to the top of the tower, we spent time watching the sunset just outside of it. The views of the city from the park around the tower are well worth the visit. I would recommend taking a bus to the top. Walking up to the top is doable, although tiring, but the views on the climb up (or down) are well worth the trek. "
The hike is worth it.,"The scenic view made it less tiring to climb the steep road to the tower. When you get there, there's so many things to do and to look at besides the tower itself. You would not mind the crowd because I think it's better when there's a lot of people around. "
Very nice views ,"Had to wait about 15 mins to take a short elevator up to the cable car center. Another 15 mins queue to get return tickets (8500 won per adult). Then it was almost an hours queue to get into the cable car to get to the towerThe crazy waiting aside, it was a magnificent view of the surrounding town. There is also decent F&B and shops here too. We didn't go up to the observatory or the musuems though.Another thing note worthy to visit is the lovers Bridge. Apparently couples buy locks (now they don't do metal locks anymore due to environment reasons), write their names on it and lock it on the bridge and surrounding areas as a symbol of locking ur love away.To the wife this was a romantic gesture but to me it was a waste of resources and creation of trash. To each his own then."
Not a must go attraction for us.,It was a short cable car ride to reach N Seoul Tower and you need to pay 26000 won with pop-corn and 2 soft drinks for 2 to reach to the top of the tower to see the whole city of Seoul. Remember to buy love lock to lock your love along the fence or others place that you can find. A must go to the toilet and you be amazes to see the city when peeing. It's actually take less than 30 mins for the whole sightseeing beside the Q-ing for the cable car & the lift to go up the tower..
Cool place,"I heard about the hike and the cable car, but since this was one of the stops on our bus tour, we did it then. The bus goes almost to the top, only a short walk to reach the tower from there. View is amazing! We were lucky with the weather; it was blue sky and very clear, so took some great shots. We didn't go up, as we felt the view from down there was good enough. Nice walk around, nice food options and plenty of other things to do. Must to!!"
A Tower,"The cable car is cool, but you have to pay extra to go the rest of the way into the tower. Lines are pretty long, but the view is worth the effort.The best thing to do would be to take the cable car up, then walk down along the old city wall. It's nice at night.Buy a love lock and join in on the fun."
Waste of money,"We visited N Seoul Tower a.k.a Namsan tower on our last day in Seoul. since we were in myeongdong we decided to pay a visit since it’s within the area. If you want to ride a cable car, You can actually walk going there from myeongdong exit 6 or use naver map to navigate walking a little uphill but manageable. it’s pretty near. or hop on a shuttle bus going directly to the tower if you want to skip the cable car. but cost you a bit. You can pay thru T-Money card around 1,250-1,300 won. Bus 02 and 05 at bus station near subway. We opt to ride in cable car, and that’s my biggest regret, it’s a waste of money, trust me. We went there around 5:30pm but since the line is wayyyy too long, we hop on cable car by 7pm. If you want to ride a cable car it’s advisable to catch by day because at night you won’t be able to see the nature’s view, unless you prefer to see the lights of the tower which is okay at night. well, for me anytime of the day is not good. because, the cable car itself was not pretty good to ride. No seat. It’s not private where you and your family can enjoy, its not even romantic. it’s basically public transfer to tower, with lots of people inside and when I mean lots, I mean it will transfer people within the limit capacity, I think 20-25 person inside. I thought it’s like in Singapore where you can privately have your own cable car and enjoy the view with family, or can be even romantic with loved ones. This one was not. We didn’t enjoy at all and it’s just a waste of money. Roundtrip is 8,500 won/person. We can’t even move. Seriously, if we were knew the situation inside, we were not opt to ride the cable car. If you are energetic and wants to explore the Namsan Park, you can walk from Myeongdong all the way to the tower as there is park nearby the tower. Pretty cool to have pictures there specially on cherry blossoms day. Worth the walk, some of my friends opt for walking. And we opt for a cable. Just too know the difference.The tower: observation deck is overrated for me, there’s not much to do there, from our experience, you pay for the ticket, you have to fall in line that is waaayyyyy too long as well, stand on a photo booth, so you can have your photoshopped at tower where’s there’s another fee for 15,000 won per picture (optional) you enter elevator going up top, and voila you just have to sit on floor or not or stand up, and just take a look down there to view the skyline buildings. If you want to view from a telescope there’s another fee 500 won. We didn’t enjoy the observation as well, aside from mini souvenir station and a candy store, there’s not much to do there, and with lots of people blocking the window glass, you can have a spot for picture. Actually even there’s not much people there you can’t even have a decent photo there, the lights are dimmed there. That’s it. Unless you have a high resolution video and a good skill of photo and video editing, you can enjoy that, or you’re a lovers of some kind, and wants to waste time mingling with each other while looking at the view it’s fine too. But for us, it’s a waste of time and money for tickets. We’d rather enjoy outside the tower taking free pictures with all the Lovelocks spots, and cool climate, or going and enjoy other attractions there like hello kitty, ssentoy, and teddy bear museums. There’s plenty of restaurants on tower but too pricey for their food. Don’t even buy it. Find decent meal at Myeongdong its way better there. The food in Namsan doesn’t have quality. We will come back there, on a day but never to ride the cable and visit observation deck. N Seoul tower is pretty much for taking photos outside and nice conversation with a very good climate. That’s all. "
Just another tower,Easy access via bus and namsan cable. Crowded with a good night view. Two spots for love locks photo taking. I prefer the one near the cable as its not so crowded.
Namsam Tower - Awesome,"A very popular place . A visit to the restaurants require planning as the reservations fill up very quickly on weekends . The entire environment / view from the beginning with the cable car to the seat setup in ' The Place Dining ' which maximizes the view is a must do for a great romantic evening out with that special person . The Italian cuisine is good , however there is a limited of alcoholic beverages ."
Sweeping Views,Namsan Seoul Tower was the first tower-type tourism spot in Korea. There are performances held here with traditional Korean dancing with swords they also have quite a good buffet restaurant.
North Seoul Tower,Very cool place to go when coming to Seoul. Take the Tram for a few bucks or walk up the mountain. Great views of the city on a clear day. Locks everywhere . pretty neat.
nice view,nice view from above we used the cable car all the way and the place was full of tourists. The view of the locks all over the fence was colorful and so beautiful
Great view from above,Great view from the top of the tower. However there were full of tourists thus I had a hard time taking photos and enjoy the view. **MUST go to the toilet as it is a open window concept. **
Go at night,We used the cable car back and forth from the tower. We went before it was too dark and got to the see the city lightning up. I think at night the view is more beautiful.
Nice View,"We went up there just before the sunset, it's really a nice view during sunset. The blossom is really beautiful up there. The overlook of Seoul is really beautiful and romantic during sunset.We took a circular bus up to N Seoul Tower. It's more convenient if you are going with elderly as you can take the bus from a few metro station exit like Seoul Station and Myeong-dong Station. So you don't have to walk a lot and a much cheaper and convenient way to get to the tower."
Seoul tower,"You can go by bus or cable car (and then walk a little bit but it's not that far). On the other hand, if you decide to use the metro, be prepared to climb some stairs! It takes a little bit of effort to get there, but I'd still recommend it!"
Great Views if Seoul and Romantic overlook,North Seoul Tower is pretty much a must see when you are in town . Like the CN Toer in Toronto or the Space Needle in Seattle. You just pretty much have to do it. Great view! We went in the early evening and saw things in daylight and night light. One thing that we didn’t realize was that it’s kind of a romantic place fire couples to go and place a lock with their name on it on the fence. Locks are available to purchase there or bring your own. Food is available there. Anything from grap and go good to sit down resturant. Take the cable car to the base of the tower
Worth the view and the experience,Really nice experience to climb up to the surrounding of the Seoul Tower and take the cable car up to the actual tower.Lots of little activities for children with Pokemon characters and areas to take pictures and enjoy the beautiful views of the city.I would really recommend the experience. If you are traveling with your partner try and get the lock in the actual city as they are extremely overpriced up in the tower.
One of the best point in Seoul!,"Namsan Tower is really perfect place for seeing Seoul from top.(if the weather is clear daily time) You can reach here by Bus, cable car or on foot. One of the the best choice is cable car!(operating hour: 10:00-23:00 - Fare: Round-trip (Adults 8,500 won / Children 5,500 won) / One-way (Adults 6,000 won / Children 3,500 won, it can be changeable year by year) There are lots of coffee shops, souvenir shops or restaurants. There is fun museum you can take pictures a lot inside! Don't miss it!By the way you can eat something inside tower but little expensive and not tasty for me. You have to catch traditional performance also. (15.00 everyday) Ah by the way padlocks are everywhere :) so hang some of them and write your love story:)"
Go at night,"The first time I came here, it was daytime, and it was fine, but when I came back at night, I loved it. It's a beautiful view, and there are fun museums and food places, too."
Beautiful view! ,"We walked from Namsan park to the N tower and take the cable car down. We enjoy the walk cause the view on the way up is very nice, we stopped many times to take photos. Strongly recommend people to go there! Very chill! "
Being on TOP!,"The place was nice, we went there at night, (sorry but Taipei101 view was better on top) I just felt kinda disappointed when we were in the observatory, but the padlocks outside are everywhere! I recommended taking the cable car to be there, but there are just too much walking you have to do that you must wear rubber shoes, no to heels!"
"Romantic for couples, but skip otherwise","Below the tower is a mall with some restaurants. There's also a place here to hang padlocks for couples, and there are couple benches where you can take pictures of you and your partner. Maybe kids can enjoy running around, but other than that, there's not much.As for the view from the tower itself -- it's just the view. There are no explanations for what you see (maybe a brief history of some key places would be great!), and I think there were no audio guides either. That's why I give this place 2 stars.If you do decide to go up though, make sure to try the bathroom, where you can get a good view of the city from the comfort of the toilet bowl ;)"
Great place for couples ,We rode the cable car going up. Took the bus on our way down. Makes more sense than taking the crowded cable car. Long queues to ride the cable car. Love locks are good for couples. Namsan tower gives you a perfect view of the city. Got free passes from Shinsegae Duty Free. 
Good places for couples who loves Korea :),"Reaching here can take up to 5 minutes walking from the bottom, along the way you're surrounded by gardens. During my visit above you can see shops, Korean in traditional clothes, love locks and of course kindesses of Korean people :)The love locks itself is the most famous part here together with the view from above. The view at afternoon is just average so I think visiting at evening will be better as the tower lights is on with the city view at night. Visiting here as couples will be very nice, guaranteed."
Great view to get a clear understanding of the size of Seoul,We enjoyed the opportunity to walk the last part of the trail to the tower and enjoy the cherry blossoms.The tower gives just what you would expect - great views in all directions. It was the first real opportunity for us to realise the density and spread of this city.
"Fun for couples, boring for non-couples",Basically it is paradise made for couples. Nothing special just bunches of lockes. But the scenery is especially good at afternoon to night
Nice hike up to the tower ,"My friends and I really enjoyed hiking upto the tower. Only took us about 1,5h. Nice trails and then great views when reaching the tower."
Every City has its Tower,"Every city has its iconic tower, and this is Seoul's. The panoramic views here, even from the parks, are simply beautiful, especially during sundown. The breeze is lovely too. It can get quite chilly at times, basically in all seasons but summer. Probably the most famous thing here is the love locks, where couples can buy locks and write messages on them to lock them in dedicated sections. It's quite pretty with all the different coloured locks. There's a cable car ride as well which could be worth the trip, even though I did not personally experience it."
Fantastic Views,"Love the Seoul tower!!! I came here to check out the lovelocks areas, as seen on Korean drama “My Love from the Stars”. Taxi took us to the cable car station. The cable car took us to the Seoul tower area. You will see nice view of Seoul. There is a couple of restaurants, gift shop. We did not go to the top tower, the fee was pricey but just the park areas alone you can appreciate fantastic views."
A tower with nothing to offer,"Visited this so-called Seoul tower but it was not impressive as it was just too low to offer a good view of Seoul skyline. The lift just took 5 minutes to reach the viewing deck. I hardly could take decent shots of the skyline as the glass were blurred by the reflections caused by the bright lighting from the candy and souvenir shops on the deck level. To make matter worse, the attendants could not speak English when i asked for direction to get down from the tower. So, don’t expect too much from this dwarf tower,"
"The view above is so so, but everything else is great","Went up the deck for viewing at night and I did not enjoy it that much. I was suppose to go there in the morning, but the one on the counter told me that the view is not good because of the fog. I did appreciate it.. I spent a few hours during the day below the deck and it was nice. Got really great photos and stuff. At night, the picture of the tower is cool too because of the light, unfortunately, it was tooooo cold so I did not enjoy it that much."
Romantic place,"One of the romantic place in Seoul where many couples like to lock up the keys together. We saw the view of Seoul, It's pretty much and good luck that snow falls.It make us feels very romantic although it was very cold too. Good memories to visit here"
The wait is not worth the view ,I can’t tell that the view is bad. I mean of course we can see Seoul from a very high point but the night I visited the tower it was foggy (bad luck) The thing that I didn’t like was mostly about the organisation of the visit. First of all you have to wait 10 minutes for a lift that can take 15 people max and then once you arrived up at the entrance you’ll have at least to wait for 1 hour or 2 jours. You have to wait standing because there is a few sits. Then once you are up in the tower you have once again to wait for 1 hour to come back downstairs. Consequently we literally waited 3 jours for a 10 minutes panoramic view. I found this not worth it. 
Great views not too expensive,"For 10,000 per adult you get to visit the observatory deck of the tower. Not a bad price compared to other cities. Get there early for a quieter viewing experience. We had no wait for the elevators, which was great. Great views from the top. Amazing on a clear day."
"Great view, especially during sunset","You have to take the cable-car to go to Namsan Tower, and then pay more to go up to the observatory. It's all worth it though, especially just before sunset, so you can see the sun set over the city, which is very pretty. You can also purchase postcards up in the observation deck and post them straight away, international too. I even received mine, though a month late. The view was spectacular, giving a 360 degree view of Seoul. It's a must visit."
Interesting place with nice view,We walk up and took the cable car down from Namsan Tower.We visited the observatory deck and enjoyed the view.
Cooke views ,Very cool view ! Can hike to too if you have the stamina or take a round trip / one way cable car .But a love lock to make sure you leave it behind with a message for the city ! Really cool 
Great view of Seoul ,This place is a must to visit in Seoul. You will see a Seoul view from a tower. I took the cable car to the tower which was very convenient. There are many spots that you can take a nice shot. 
A high place in the middle of Seoul,"Lots of nice views and popcorn.I like popcorn, especially with cheese. Maybe potatoes too. Shall we go eat swirl potato tomorrow?"
Best time in sunny weather in spring or autumn,If you want to get here by subway you can take line 4 (blue line) and stop at the Myeongdong or Hoehyeon station and take 2 minutes walk.. then you can take the cable car the price for 2 way ticket is ₩8500/adult i recommend this then when you reach the N tower you will find a place full of love lock..they believe when you write your name and your spouse name on it and lock it in this place your reationship will be last forever.. the price for the lock and key is between ₩8.500-₩14.500 here you can also enjoy lunch or romantic dinner in the restaurant called 'the place' or burger shop and many N tower merchandise are sold here
Scenic,Went up at night and the view was beautiful. Walked on the transparent walkway which was an experience. Nice way to see the city of Seoul
Glad I went!,"I recommend going up for sunset (if it's sunny) Now it takes a bit to get up there, there is a little elevator that takes you up to tram, there are stairs involved in most facets of getting up to the tower if you have a problem with stairs I would look up their website and see if they have accessibility things that I didn't see (I did see one person in a wheel chair come off tram but not sure if they could go to top) yes so anyways a good amount of stairs. A little to a long wait for tram & elevator so give yourself extra time if you want to catch sunset or something. They light the tower up at night so catching both day and night was awesome. Highly recommend that timing. "
Night Scene to go in seoul,"Lock key, merchandise of N tower, love icon and bench you can get all the cheesy romantic ambiance here, to to there there’s 2 way by walk on wood stairs that took less than ahour with norma pace or by gantole, i recommend just use the cable car/gantole and later you can go down by walking, go up when evening and sunset are near its best view to see seoul by aerial view in 1st phase of photos /panaroma booth before go to the higher ground "
Seoul sky tower,The glass floor was a fun way to see the city. Even though it was a bit scary but a good way to view the city
Cable Car and Nice View ,"Need to walk up hill about 15 min from Myeongdong to take cable car. A bit tiring If you are with kid. Anyhow, the view is nice and we had relaxing time spent there. "
A Great View of Seoul,"There is only one reason to go to the Nansam Seoul Tower - to get a grand view of Seoul. It is worth going up just for that reason. The 360-degree restaurant view is also spectacular, especially at night. Just don't expect the food to be more than average, and don't be shocked by the high prices - just remember, you are there for the view. If you are there for anything else, you will be disappointed. NOTE: Don't go up when the air quality is bad - you won't see much."
Wonderful view over Seoul,"You can reach the tower via foot or by cable car. At the main times, you will wait for the cable car longer than you need to walk up to the tower. The tower offers a wonderful view over Seoul. So if you go to the tower, spend some more money to go up inside of the tower. It's worth it."
Seoul N tower,We visited n tower todayThe place is magnificentYou can reach by two ways ! Either the bus or the cable carWe have reached using the cable car which was a bit hard traveling with a toddler and a strollerTo reach the cable car u have to ride a veichel up to cable carTickets are for both 1 or two waysAdult round trip = 8500Children under 3 are entering for freeOnce you reach the cable car you need to fold your kid’s strolled !Ride it and then carry it for a very long stairs ! Along with your toddler or baby ! As access for wheel chairs and strollers are not available which is really disappointed We didn’t actually get into the tower  We spent the time around the plaza Which is consisting of 5 stories I have seen some restaurants with nice viewWe were actually looking for the park but not able to reach it as google map services in Korea is so bad and you can not reach using the walking option !  
Easy travelling,Easy to go. Buses stop at the carpark so you can walk to the tower. But the walk way to the tower is going up the hill so that quite hard for elderly people. The tower view is beautiful you can also look aroun the tower.
Love Lock,I don't have a boyfriend .. but who say we can't came here if we don't have a boyfriend isn't it .. we also can take a picture with all the love lock here .. and i love this place so much .. 
Panoramic views from Seoul Tower,"My husband and I took the shuttle bus from Chungmuro Station to go up to Seoul Tower. It was a cheap and convenient mode of transport. You can also walk up through Namsan Park or take the cable car up. Once you reach the Observatory Deck, the views are already fantastic on a clear day. However, you got to go up for the magnificent views of Seoul City. We had lunch at the Korean fusion restaurant on the ground floor. It was delicious and reasonably priced. Highly recommended to visit while in Seoul."
"Beautiful place, clean, nice to go here","Its good place to go if you go seoul, dont walk go go here, the have something like cable car availabe, paid 8500 per person to return way. Romantic place with populer lock things and tower, have good store too. But too cold here if you come when winter season"
Seoul In 360,"Whenever you go to Seoul, you should visit the N Seoul Tower. Such a wonderful place, fresh air and beautiful view."
Good tower for a city view,Good place to visit for relaxing and great city view. Color of tower lighting changes based on air quality. love locks are great.
Ok ,The place is nice if u don’t have any plan we went in evening it’s ok the tour to visit too small museum for toy and hello kitty museum and can keep love lock if u like food and drink there is few restaurants and bars 
Must Visit In Seoul But The View From The Peak In HK Is Better,"When in Seoul, one must visit the N Seoul Tower because.. ""when in Rome"". I'm rating this a 3/5 because of the challenges my family faced when visiting this landmark:1. We were travelling with my mum who can't walk much. According to multiple taxi drivers, they were not permitted by law to take passengers up. This meant that Mum had to slowly hike up the hill, and mind you it wasn't the easiest of hills to walk up to.2. Again, mum couldn't walk much. There was no direct access to the top of the tower. Once we reached the hill and boarded the slanted elevator, there were still a series of stairs to climb to finally make it to the entrance of the tower. It was rather handicap-unfriendly.3. You'd think that after all that climb, the view would be spectacular but it was pretty average. The entrance free to the viewing deck cost KRW10,000 per person and it was indoor. Perhaps I am biased but I thought The Peak in HK was a lot better, must it was outdoor and far more breath-taking.4. Getting back down was another challenge as you can imagine.I would still recommend this for those travelling to Seoul for the first time but probably best to go during the cold weather (otherwise you'd be sweating away), you are wearing comfortable shoes, and are not bounded by toddlers/prams/elderly."
Namsan Tower ,"I went there in december !!! It was supposed To be cold but because we walked a lot, It was warmer ^^ I think if we go non, we can enjoy spring !!! "
N Seoul Tower,View from the tower is average. View of tower itself is better. All souvenirs are extremely expensive compared with other places in Seoul. Here can be visited with last priority if time is limited.
Sooo hard to look for!,"Our Google maps made us go in circles to find this! Use the public library stop, then use bus 2,3, or 5 to get to the top. Then youll get free access to the place, some restaurants, and a great view. Theres a fee to enter the top most floor. They also have a Hello Kitty museum here. "
Best view at night,It is best to go there at night because the view is very nice. You can skip Observatory because the best view is in outside. The place are also nice. There's so many restaurant or coffee to choose if you get hungry or have a coffee break. We took a bus going to Tower to skip the line in Cable car and its not tiring.
A Little over rated,"We went to N Seoul Tower after our palace trip. I can honestly say that the place is over-rated. They have this area where couples can put locks and write something on the locks, i guess a wish that the relationship lasts long. Forgot how much i paid but i feel that it was more than what the place offers. But we went anywhere...went for a train and a bus ride which was very easy to follow. Still worth a go but again is a little over-rated. And the locks being sold on-site costs between 6500-8500w!!! A little pricey "
Not really interesting,"In March, you barely see anything due to thick fog. But I cannot imagine this place will look any different in another season though..Located on a hill near Seoul, you supposedly able to see the sparkling Seoul at night.They have a couple of stores and museum inside the tower area, but it was just standard. This place could be a better tourist destination if they involve more imagination in developing this area."
Nice view,"We spent an hour at the Tower, because the view was very nice. You can buy fridge magnets, odds and ends. Recommended."
Love locks and tower must see,This is one of the best places I've visited during my trip in Korea. The place has a full view of the City. THis is also the place where couples place in their love locks to seal their love as they say. Nice picturesque place. Every view is worth taking pictures. Must see in Seoul..
Tourist landmark~,"A great place to visit at night. We went to 5th floor for observation deck only. The admission fee is KRW 10,000.00 but we booked thru klook where it more cheaper. We went there by bus where you may take subway line 3, Dongguk University Station, Exit 6, take the bus 02/03/05 (Fee is KRW 1,200.00 by cash or KRW 1,100.00 by T-money card).What impressed me was you can have a view in restroom as well which is also called as sky restroom."
Very nice attraction,"A must see in Seoul . Excellent restaurant with nice view at the top . Go by foot to the entrance, it is a nice excercise...... :-)"
Romantic place for couples!,"It was abit hazy when we get there but we still managed to enjoy our time in the tower. Initially we tried to walk, but we gave up and ride the cable car instead. It wasn’t an easy journey I would say. There are love locks garden where you can place a padlock all around the tower. "
Seoul Tower,"A breathtaking view overlooking the city of Seoul. There is a show about Korean warriors on top of Level 5, which is not to be missed. "
it is worth a long escalade !,a great place to be ... very nice view from the tower top but very nice escalade from the city to the hill top
Great views,"It was not a very clear day, but from the top you appreciate how expansive Seoul is. There are great vantage spots for pictures and of course selfies."
Go Up At Night!,We loved our visit to this tower at night. The expansive lights of Seoul are amazing. The tower is fun and easy to visit. It's definitely touristy but worth it for the view. The cable car didn't seem to be running when we went and we got confused about which bus to take so we ended up walking up the tower. It was about a 30 minute walk uphill but it was not hard at all.
So that you could see seoul,"You could either go here by walking or using the cable car which costs around 8000 won for round trip. It's actually free to roam around the place and look over seoul, if you have enough budget and money to spend you could avail the 10000 won access to the top. Is it worth it? Yes, for the view but if you have a lot of children avoid. When you get to the viewing deck you have elevator access but upon exit you have to go one floor down and you have to carry everything. Imagine. When you're a large group I suggest you keep that money for food. "
"Besides cable car, you can reach by bus","From Myeongdong station, take the bus #5 straight to the tower, with only 1200W. If you don't know how to get the bus, there are mobile tourist info providers wearing red jackets at the main tourist attractions to help you out. They are indeed very helpful. Upon arriving at the tower, you may need to climb a steep path about 150m to the main entrance. I see many people just lingering around the open space where lovers placed their love locks along the fences. It's very sweet and good for photo sessions. They sell locks from a vendor machine but it costs 9000 W. Wow! Why don't we just enjoy the view of Seoul merely. Hehe."
Worth to climb in a good weather,"I sincerely recommend to climb to N Seoul tower or to take the cable car in a good, clean weather. A view is sooooo amazing! You can actually see almost all Seoul! You can also buy many souvenirs and get nice pics. Really popular for love locks. They are almost everywhere"
Really enjoyed this.,"The tower is really in an amazing location the views were great and we were fortunate to go on a clear day. There was also a show in the ""court yard"" of music which was neat. We enjoyed the exercise and all of the love lockets!"
Fantastic Views of Seoul Towerwith lots of love locks,This atraction is worth to see the wonderful views of seoul the tower has love locks all around the railings with lots of people leaving love messages 
Good to visit,"Took a cable car in the evening, quite nice (apart from the chill).One of the must visit place when visiting Korea."
Seoul Tower - used to be Namsan Tower,We went up the tower after our dinner at foothills and was enjoying the walk up the hills. You can also take a cable car to the tower if you don't fancy flight of stairs. There are cafe if you want to sit and enjoy the view while finishing a drink & popcorn.
Enjoyed the visit,"Visited as part of a half-day, multi-site tour. There are nice gift shops and snacks in the tower and once you go up there are some great shows by performers and breathtaking scenery to take in. One of the highlights of my trip."
Gangnam tour,"Fast elevators, Great heights, a bit expensive but worth the try, scary though. A must try when korea. "
Nice view,"From the observatory of Namsan Tower, you can enjoy a magnificent view of Seoul. Around the tower is actually a park, and before and after the visit of tower, you can also spend a relaxing time. Actually I walked to the tower from Seoul station. It was a nice hiking."
#HappySeoul,"It was a difficult journey going to N Seoul Tower from our guesthouse. But nonetheless the ""trekking"" we did was worth it as we see Seoul by night and mesmerized on how people believe about forever by having love locks (like the one in Paris...hoping and praying it soon)"
Wonderful!,Great place. Enjoyed the hike to and from the tower. Amazing view from the observation tower. There is post office on the too that sells really nice post cards. 
Overlooking att the N Seoul Tower,Super enjoy the overlooking view at the N Seoul Tower from riding to cable car to roaming the area. We bought colorful padlock and put out name on it the lock in the designated area at N Seoul Tower. Its good to visit during the sunset and night to see the lighting city of Seoul..
Don’t miss all the shops next to the tower! ,"When you go there, there are some shops you can’t miss. Moreover, there is one beautiful Starbucks.Next to the tower, you can find a beautiful place with some love lockers. Well « some » = A LOT. You should go there during the sunset. "
Overview,It was a grey day and the view therefore was not the best. Still worth a trip to see how huge Seoul spreads. Nice view even from the toilet :-) would prefer to have a section without a window but free for pics
Best to go at night!,"I purchased the tickets from kkday website, with a little bit of discount. We get there by cable car which is fast and better than walking that long path to the tower. Abit crowded inside the tower. You may see the full view of Seoul but I guess it will look beautiful at night. Restaurants are available inside. "
Best night view of Seoul,We went there last Feb and it was a freezing cold night. At the observation deck we were able to send postcards from the Namsan Tower
Alternative to the gym,"I'd highly recommend to walk all the way up to the antenna. It's a good workout. On half the way you'll find some gym machines as well to make the workout perfect. Besides this the view over the city is really nice and this is a must for travellers in Seoul. Only from here you will realize how big the city is - in all directions. For walking down I recommend to use a ""hidden"" path downwards on the other side. Only use it when it's dry since it will be muddy/slippery. There are no English signs so just follow the way downwards and keep the directions since the path splits several times. "
"Good place to hike, dont take bus!","Seoul Tower is symbol of Seoul. There is two ways to get there, take a bus and them cable car or just climb it. I choose second one. It was like 4 km hike from bottom to get there, but it was worth it. There are lots of sightseeing places while you climb, so you can see city from there and as well have some rest. If you have problems with knees, better use bus, but hike was amazing. When you get to the top, there is some shops and traditional Korean dances. I went there around lunch time. To get to the top of tower it costed more than 10 000 won if I remember correctly, I thought it was expensive. But either way view from the there was amazing."
Great views,Good place to have great views of the city. Not very expensive but Nothing special in my opinion. Went there at night so I saw the city with the lights on which was cool.
worth a look,I walked up from city hall which was a bit of a haul. there is a gondola up which was cheap and fast which would have been a better option. overall it was quite hazy but still worth a look. 
enjoy seoul from a height,though not the tallest building in seoul. Namsan tower is a must to visit for first visit to seoul. You can put a lock love or just enjoy seoul scenery from a height.
"A ""Must-See"" in Seoul",This 360 degree view of the city should not be missed. We were dropped off near the top by our tour bus and walked up the last section to the tower. Views on all sides are spectacular and give you a sense of the size and scope of the city. You can even see some of the old city wall. There is a cable car available but on the sunny Sunday we were there was at least an hour wait. You can also hike up to the top but we didn't have enough time to do this either.
Love it ,"We went to N. Grill restaurant at the Seoul Tower for a set-course meal with a rotating view. It comes with free lift to the said tower. After dining, we went around the area and decided to buy some love locks. It was pretty cool. "
Nice view,the lift does not bring us directly to the ticket office..we use stairs and it was quite slippery as it was raining on that night.we went late so most of the shops are already closed.one must really know where to board the buses 02 03 and 05 to go to the top.We saw snow the first time.the view was spectacular but as the he8ght restriction it was not that great compared to taipei 101 or tokyo tower.Combo ticket consists of observatory hello kitty museum and SSentoy museum which i think quite worth.
A Walk to the Tower,"My friends and I decided to walk from Myeondong Shopping District to the cable station of N. Seoul Tower. We did not look for the bus and just decided to walk. The line for paying for the cable car ride and even the line for riding the cable car were really long. I recommend tourists to be patient or to come early or may be to allocate longer time in visiting this place. Despite of long waiting period we spent, it was worth it. The place is just so beautiful and romantic. We ate in the restaurant in the area before indulging ourselves to picture taking sessions. We decided not to buy a love lock but we enjoyed taking our photos in the site. Since it is in the mountain expect for a colder temperature especially at night. Bring extra jacket with you. If you are a K-Dram fan, then this place is a must for you since a number of drama series were shoot N. Seoul Tower from My Love from the Star to the Legend of the Blue Sea."
Worth the trip,"Nice park around the tower, wonderful views of the Seoul. Has a restaurant on top, did not have time to try."
Early morning walk and exercise,"Had a free morning, so chose to get up early and walk through the lovely park and it’s trails. A frosty morning didn’t put me off as the steady ascent soon warms you up. So peaceful for a big city! As you near the top there are remnants of the old city wall, well preserved and worth s look. Fabulous panoramic views all over the city too. Had hoped for coffee and cake but be aware that the cafes and shops do not open until 10am. The walk was well worth the effort with routes to suit all abilities. Also a public bus if you have mobility issues as well as s cable car service"
Good experience,We enjoyed our time in n seoul tower. Been there with friend. Can see seoul from the tower. A must visit. Hello kotty is a good place for children they will loveit
Walk the talk ,Try the hike to Seoul tower. Short and sweet but memorable once you reach the tower . Excellent hike especially on a cold day
Worth the walk,"We decided to walk up to the N Seoul Tower, it was a lovely walk with little stops on the way which look over the city. You can cable car up and/ or down if you do not want to walk. The tower itself is impressive but the views slightly disappointing due to the smog."
Prepare to Queue!,"We loved the walk up to the tower and the love locks and the green tea lattes, but each time we needed to get in a lift we had to queue for what seemed way longer than necessary! Otherwise defs worth a visit."
Go in the evening and on a weekday,"There was a huge line to go up there on the holiday weekend and then no line at all on Tuesday night. The views from the observation deck are amazing. The colors of the tower at night, very cool. Not sure about the food up there, we didn't go to the restaurant. You can walk to the base but it's a bit of a climb. Better to take a taxi up there and then walk back down afterward and stroll through Meyongdong."
Beautiful city view,"Located on the top of the hill with a beautiful view and one of the most favorite place for dating (though my friend said not anymore). And yet i'm curious to see the love chair and stuffs that appear on the drama, LOL. I visit there to enjoy the sunset and quite crowded in peak season. We take our time strolling to the top and take cable car to get off. The cable car queuing was insane ha3 but no choice since it was chill outside. Don't forget to visit the toilet at top, you can see fantastic view from the most unusual place, I mean it !"
Amazing view of the city,"If you are planning to go here make sure to anticipate at least 3 hours by the time you get through the cue for the cable car and the lineup for the tower. A lot of walking and stairs so would be difficult for the elderly and with a stroller, they do have elevators but still quite a hike. We went at night and it was very beautiful"
Good to do,Good to do for about two hours because there's a lot to do downstairs from the tower and it's great to see the tower at night and in the day
Ok,"It was ok, but not impressive. Thanks the gondola! The walk up is not easy and you just end up wasting time. Good panoramic view of the city. "
Night time activity,"It opens late and offers amazing view of the city. We mapped it and ended up taking the bus and hiking to the tower. The hiking trail was well lit, clean and we'll maintained. It was an easy and good hike, however I wouldn't recommend doing it at night like us as it was a little spooky because there was no one. The other (more expensive, less time consuming) option is to take the cable car. There are some restaurants at the tower. It wasn't too crowded when we were there and city views are always amazing (even the bathrooms has views). We paid (10,000 krw each if I'm not mistaken) only to enter the observatory however, there are other packages available. While exiting, there are lots of love locks along the pathway and 'trees'. If you wish to leave one behind, do bring your own! "
Rferreras,"Great for the whole family. Especially when you have little kids, they will enjoy the activities in store there."
Love locks haven,"We went to the top via cable but it is nothing spectacular. If you can walk, the experience will be much better and the view is great. We didn't go to the actual tower but just hang around the bottom around where the love locks are, ended up reading the messages left. It was a great experience and overall, unexpected"
👍🏻👍🏻,"Thumbs up for this place! Great for photo ops and sight seeing. You can see the city view on the top and tha area is amazing. Cable car is 8,500 won for adult roundtrip tickets. There are also restaurants on the tower but a bit pricey. "
A must see!,"Stunning views of Seoul from the observation deck - its a must see in my opinion!! We took the bus from Myeongdong to the base of the tower, but there is also a cable car. There are a bunch of coffee shops and some food places around the base, we didn't try these as the few food places we looked at were expensive. Coffee totally reasonably priced. Cost 10000 for each adult to head up the tower for some beautiful views of the city. There is also a coffee shop and gift shop at the top. I would recommend waiting for a clear day and going up in plenty of time for sunset.There are awesome views from the base of the tower too, but I would definitely tell you to head up there!!"
Best at sunset ,"If the tower itself is not the most impressive in the world, it is still worth it. Take the cable car up the hill and enjoy the great views of Seoul at sunset. See the city walls light up all around Seoul in the mountains opposite the tower and the sun reflection in the river towards south. It takes 45 minutes to walk down and can be a good to open your appetite before hitting a great Korean restaurant "
Not worth the effort,"I chose to ride the cable car up, due to a sore back and unfamiliarity with the walk up. Bad decision, as I waited in line for over 1.5 hours to even get on the cable car. However, even once I was up to the tower it was a let-down. There was another wait >1 hour to get up to the observation deck of the tower. The tower plaza has great views (I did this at night), but is fairly ""cheesy"" and tacky. The view from the observation deck is really no better than that from the plaza, so if anything I would recommend walking up (won't take more than a half-hour from where the line for the cable car ascent is), and just spend time at the plaza. Despite it's tackiness, there are pretty views and lots of lovers' locks to look at, if you're into that kind of thing."
"Great views, dirty windows!","Very busy....of course we knew it would be after the 40 minute wait for the cable car. Huge complex and great views - disappointingly the viewing windows were pretty grubby and not at all condusive to achieving good photos. I was quite surprised by this as Seoul was a very clean city and I would have expected there to be a team of people constantly cleaning them.Other than the views the tower was very commercial with restaurants and shops. A must do, I think we spent a couple of hours here and did have difficulty finding our way back to the cable car departure point!"
It's okay,"My friend and I didn't have a pleasant experience while waiting to buy tickets to get to the Seoul Tower. Many times we were cut in line by some group of people or a grandma holding a toddler. Then later on, the whole family cuts in with the grandma and toddler. Long story short, it took an hour plus to get in line to buy the tickets and then wait another 40 minutes to get on the cable car to the Seoul Tower. After we got up, we waited another 30 minutes to be seated at the noodle house. Everywhere was just waiting! It was a madhouse. The gift shop was packed like sardines. This was during a weeknight around 6:30-7pm. It was just impossible to navigate around. We were able to get a few shot of the tower, but that was it. We waited in line for the cable car to get back down. And of course, we were cut in line again. Somehow I think our forehead said ""Please cut in front of us!"" Overall, nothing special but just a tower with a lot of tourists."
A place with view ,"Suits family outing, couple dating. Take the cable car up before sunset and great views awaiting you. Take the public bus when you leave and admirer the night view along the route down.."
Such a beautiful site with great restaurants and stores,"We were in town for only one night so one of the sights we wanted to see was the Seoul Tower and we were not disappointed. We're from NYC and this definitely reminded us the Empire State Building in many ways. It also featured a great burger joint, excellent vantage points of the temple and the space needle is simply exquisite."
Tower Visit,We were surprised how interesting this was. The 123 restaurant was pleasant and in crowded and provided a spectacular sunset. 
Seeing Seoul,This is a great place to go. It is wonderful seeing the city and surrounding areas from on high. I would highly recommend that you go on a clear day so that you can take full advantage of the view.
The place for orientation of the city,"This is the place you should start your stay in Seoul. Get a touristmap orient you self on the map, make a plan for what and where you want to go during your stay and bring with you this map and plan during your visit in the twr. Its great to walk through the city when you go to the twr since you can see the twr from aømost everywhere. The place it self is a bit crowded and a lot of candy and other stuff to buy. Take the cablecar down, toward west, and visit mayongdong shopping/ market area, Its about 5-10 minutes walk downhill from the cablecar stop. If you have time it is a nice walk up to the twr. "
Beautiful combo of nature and technology ,"We didnt take the cable.car to the tower we hiked. It took us about 1.5 hours to reach the top with young children. Once there at the tower, you can shop or eat. Also one of the levels of the tower has the oocks of love walls/ trees. Dont worry if you forget your lock they do sell them there for a decent price. There is also a hello kitty plac there were you can walk in the oife of hello kitty! "
photo spot,"many photo spot, love locks, try cable car. some snack bar available not so crowded. day and night available for visit"
Worth the wait at the top,"At first the walk up the hill was a bit tiring until you took the first ride up . Then you get in line to buy the tickets which I’m guessing with no holiday will be less persons , don’t worry it will be quick , then you go upstairs to stand in line again to get on the tramp which will take another couple 15-20 mins depends on the time of visit . But on arrival to the top , it’ll be worth the wait . The view , the restaurants , the activities ."
Only for couples,It's not a place to visit with friends. If you are not a couple it will be very boring. The view is great but that's all. The products prices are a joke. VERY EXPENSIVE. Disappointed.
Great evening activity!,"I took the bus to the park at the top. Was going to pay to go up the tower, but said it was a 50 min wait, and didn't want to wait. You can walk around basically the whole base and get great views. Go inside the base of the tower for food/drinks/gift shop. I went during the Lunar New Year, so that might be why it was so busy."
Oh the view,"Great views obviously. Got a slightly tacky but funny professional photo taken, very nice. Bought a souvenir up top from the sweetest girl ever, awesome view of the city. Must do. "
That view...,"If you're lucky enough to get a clear day, this place is amazing. You can see EVERYTHING. If it's hazy or the dust is extremely bad, it might not be as impressive. Either way, the park is nice, the entrance fee is very reasonable, and the crowds are not too bad.Just one thing---parents, be warned! There is a candy shop on the observation deck. Your children WILL want candy. "
hard to get there by public transport,"The tower it's far and difficult to reach by the public transport and expensive to enter , there are places that you can view the city for free or much cheaper than this tower"
A tower with a past,"Challenge yourself and go up through the winding stairs to appreciate the scene and the sights (of course, there is an option to take the tram going up or down). The experience us also different when you do it late afternoon or evening as you get to see the lights. Trivia - there is a wall situated along the footpath that has a historical meaning (more than the locks near the tower) :)Tips: wear comfortable shoes, queus can be really long, stay hydrated and bring some snacks "
My first time,"We came from Myeongdong to N Seoul Tower by subway and took the bus no. 2 to tower. Weather was very cold, good view. "
A great place to enjoy the view of Seoul,"You can get to the tower by foot, by bus and using the cable car. The view up there is breathtaking at any time of the day, if you're in Seoul you should go there at least once."
The lover spot,"If you like climb but not too difficult and want to have a wonderfil view on Seouol, this is the venue to visit day time or night time, both is good. The best is to catch the sunset depending on season, you might take some amazing shoot of Seoul."
Great experience,Took the bus from the city to the tower and managed to catch the sunset. It was beautiful esp for photo taking near the locks and keys deck. There're multiple bus number which can bring you back to the main city esp if you stay at Myeongdong. Just look at the bored for the location that you're going and wait for 10-15 mins for the bus. The interval is very fast. Very convenient to go there by public. Mini shopping centre below the deck where to can eat or buy drinks like bubble tea but don't expect much from it as the main attraction is still the observation deck. There's also an arcade. Place was very peaceful. Still can oversee the whole of seoul from the shopping area as you can go out and take pictures at a higher level
Cool,"This was neat, but we live in Seattle and it was very Space Needle like. The ride to get up there was forever long and that's just to the base of the tower. I'd recommend this as a novelty, but beware of the crazy, business of this place!"
It’s my most favorite part of the entire trip,"On the way there's always something to stop by for exemple the ""the locker"" where you can lock your love with someone special. Once you're at the top, you'll get the view of the entire Seoul ( most beautiful at night). The Seoul Tower also provides you a lot of other activities such as game station and photobooth. Personally I think the ticket is very expensive but it'll worth the ecperience. So very recommend!"
Don't leave Seoul without visiting!,"We woke up super late on the day we visited the N Seoul Tower. My friend and I were thinking of not going and just rest the entire day cause we were super tired from clubbing the night before however, we thought that if we didn't go it wouldn't feel like we didn't visit Seoul at all. And it was a good idea that we went. We went there at night and the view was just beautiful. Next time I go back, I wanna visit it again during the day. "
Beautiful night view of Seoul,I went there around 6pm. So I can saw the night view of Seoul. I usually went there by walk but this time I took a bus(takes 10-15mins to the top of mountain).The bus is stop at Chungmuro subway(metro) station(line 4). The bus number is “2” and “5” Go out Chungmuro station exit 2 and go straight about 20m. 
Worth visiting even if you don't go up to the Observatory,The view is amazing at night and would definitely recommend coming at night when the city lights up. Lots to do and wander around even if you don't want to check out the Observatory. We didn't go up and still enjoyed the amazing view and checked out the different shops at the base of the tower. 
Lookout,This is just one option if you're looking for lookouts over Seoul. Other buildings include the Lotte Sky Tower at Jamsil or the Seoul 63 Building. Otherwise not bad and worth the visit.
A can't miss while in Seoul,you must take the ride up to Seoul Tower preferably at night so you can look at the lights of the city
Good View,"Good view of the city. Although it is open year round, avoid it on a holiday. We had a 40 minute wait for the cable car. 8500 for round trip cable car and another 10000 to ride to the top of the tower. Several food choices at the base of the tower and all the way up too. Can also walk up to the tower if you are feeling energetic."
Great View,We went there around 4 o’clock in the afternoon and walked up the hill ( did not take the elevator). The views were great from that location and so the pictures were good as well. My son was enamored by the chain link fence complete with “ love locks”. By the time we went up in the elevator to the tower the sun was setting which was perfect timing for pictures!!
Typical tower views,"The tower is attractive, but the best part is the views from its base, which is already at a decent height (reached by cable car). From there, you get great views across the city. Views from the top of the tower itself are almost from too great a height - it's hard to make out anything of note. Oddly, a cleaner kept wiping the windows. Unfortunately, this didn't make them cleaner, but left great big smears which then meant everything you looked at was blurred. Overall, OK only"
Great view,"Be sure to go to N Seoul tower in a sunny day. Or a day that is clear. Seoul can get really foggy sometimes and this is a view that you reallywill love to see. I have been a cauple of times and i have walk all the way up, take the cable car, and in bus so you have different ways to get there. Be sure to buy the lock if you go with ypur love one is a really cute and sweet tradition. Is restaurants and the food is really good. I am not a picky eater and i love to try new foods. "
Views,Amazing city view of Seoul. Impressive elevator video show and loved the random game they have against the folks in Busan's tour. 
"Dated, but still a must see!","The N Seoul Tower is a bit dated, but a definite stop to get a birds eye view of just how massive Seoul is in terms of sheer volume of buildings and area. If I did return, I would choose to walk up to the tower, a great way to get in a little fitness and avoid the overcrowded cable car ride. The tower itself boasts places to eat, a (paid) museum for Hello Kitty and a toy exhibit, gift shops and a Starbucks! A little tacky as far as the ""love locks"" goes, but still a cool place to wander."
Nice view of the city,It gives you a good view of the city. I think the view at night is better compared to day time. Can easily take the Bus #5 from Myeongdong and then walk up a bit to the tower. Found out that the colour of the tower depicts the quality of air in Seoul. Blue is the best quality.
It's just okay,Having a great expectation of this place since it's very popular on korean drama lol but ends up with just okay place. It's not that bad but it's also not that good. You can't find something 'wow' you in this place
1 or 2 hour,"If you have 1 or 2 hour to spare this is worth a visit. To get there, a bit of walking from myeongdong but it is worth it. "
great view,"very nice view from above, touristy place but still a relaxing place to visit. got food options though it maybe a bit pricey. nice experience"
Highlight of the day!,"Took the Cable Cars up to the N Tower and it was amazing! We went at dusk, and as the sun set, we saw Seoul transform into a glittering city of lights and sparkle! Well worth a night trip. We visited the Love Locks, had hot chocolate and took in all that the N-Tower had to offer"
Good view,Good view and the price is pretty good. I’d recommend walking up instead of the tour bus unless you are pressed for time the views are fantastic all the way and it’s a pleasant walk and relatively easy. 
Romantic Namsan,Came here twice.. But the tower itself is boring to me.. I love the love lock.. I love the mountain.. But too bad they only have two train to go up.. Or we can take bus instead
Awesome Views,"Wow! The N Seoul Tower is a must visit attraction. You have 360 unrestrictive views of the entire city. In addition, each window tells you the distance to most major cities in the world. This attraction took me about 2 hours to enjoy, including lunch. By the way, if you have the chance, get the Entrance + Lunch combo. The cost was only less than $100 and it included three full meals and entrance to the tower."
Fabulous views but I'm not sure it was great value.,"Can't argue with the views from the top, and the complex itself has plenty of places to eat and lots of souvenir shops etc. However I'm not sure it's worth the money. Maybe if you made more of a day of it and walked round the grounds/complex you would feel it was better value. For the brave, you can hike all the way up! "
Spectacular views,Easy to go all the way up...spectacular views of the city...option to go up and down by foot...some restaurants and souvenir shops available...great place to take some nice pics
Must Visit Place,We were lucky as it was snowing when we visited the N Seoul Tower. We took the shuttle bus from Myeongdong and walked to to Tower. Beautiful and breathtaking views.
Feel like you're in k-drama!!,"It is the most popular place in Seoul! Easy to get, nice view from the observatory (if u only wanna take some pics with love lockets, i suggest you dont need to buy the observatory tix)"
a romantic place for couple,"this is a good place for couple, they can hang their lock as a symbol of their love, but if you're single you can come here and enjoy the scenery, a beautiful view of Seoul"
Namsan tower,Namsan tower is the tallest tower in Seoul and it was very attractive to see the night Seoul when I was travelling
so pretty,"I went there a least four times , with my friends , family and lover and all the occasions were good ! In winter , in summer , day or night you can go whenever you want it will always be pretty ! For me , I prefered the winter view at night, it was magical !!! "
Memorable attraction. ,"Everyone goes to the tower and you are glad you did it. The view is amazing, but try to pick a sunny day or less fog so you can see really far. I liked the cable car ride up to the tower, but you can always take the stairs. At the base of the tower is where the Locks of Love are and that’s fun to see. You have to buy a ticket to go up to the top or you can eat in a restaurant. We just went up and enjoyed the view. "
Nice view,From myeongdong shopping street you can take a walk to the lift near highway gate. To reach the Namsan Seoul tower you should take the tram. Up at the N Tower you can can city wall from joseon and see beautiful scenery from top of it.
Good!,"Went here on our first day in Seoul. It was a steeped walk going up to the Tower and during that time the weather was foggy. Didn’t see much of the view, we are not just lucky enough since the weather was not so cooperative. "
Unbelievable views of the coty,The view from the tower was great. It really puts the size of Seoul in perspective. $10/person for the elevator ride up. A must for first timers to see how huge the city is. 
Should go Seoul Scenic Spot,"The Seoul Tower situates at the town centre just 10 minutes walk from No. 4 exit of Myeong Dong Metro Station of Route 4. Small and large cable cars are disabled friendly. Although not very high, you enjoy a nice panaramic view of Seoul on the obervation deck of the tower. By the way the toilet is quite unique with a nice view of Seoul while using it.Probably worth to pay a short visit during the stay in Seoul."
Romantic tower,"N Seoul tower is famous for tourist sight.try to go there by cable car, and you'll get amazing view of Seoul ( IF the weather good)."
Seoul tower,It so amazing when I go to Seoul tower. When I saw that place in tv. I wish I will go there with friend. I just couldnt imagine I can see the real pad lock. 
Best view of the city,"If one desire the best view of Seoul, this is the place you want to be. The view is fantastic. The walk up is a good exercise but totally worthy."
Nice light up at night,"There were a few museums in the tower, such as toy museum and hellp kitty museum providing lots of photo opportunities. The building lights up at night and provides a nice view of the city. The lift up take only 1 minute and there will be a show on the way up and down. There are candy shops and souvenir shops at the viewing gallery."
Mesmerizing views!,"The tower was the last attraction I was keen to see and almost didn't get to as I don't think I could've found it on my own. My sister and I were able to access the tower via the cable car service, something we TOTALLY recommend. Its just a part of the experience. Also, unless you LOVE to hike, we definitely suggest taking the cable car. I had spent about 18 days walking around South Korea so decided against walking there. We arrived at the tower at 10:30PM, last admission for the cable car back is 11:00PM (otherwise you walk back down if you miss it) so we spread our time between looking at the sights, taking quick snaps then headed to see the love locks! Honestly 10-15 minutes up there is all you need. The love locks were most interesting for us.The views from the tower were absolutely beautiful. It doesnt take you long at all to do a circle before you are back to where you began. Each panel has a different country listed so we were happy trying to find ours. The Love Locks didn't disappoint. If you are a massive fan of kdramas, this is the place to visit as seen in kdramas such as Boys over flowers and My love from the star etc. When we came back down the tower, there was a wall with thousands of signatures and messages left by people from around the world who had visited so we left ours too :D Food places available there too. Overall a fantastic experience and Im so glad I got to visit before I left."
Tour,Everything a kdrama fan expected and received. Wonderful view of the Han river and the city at night. 
"Great View, Must See","For fans of Korean drama series, N Seoul Tower or Namsam Tower is a must. Great views from the top of the tower. Plus you can see where the love locks are. If you're staying in Myeongdong, the cable car station up to the tower is a 10-20 minute walk depending on which side of Myeongdong you are coming from. "
Nice view from the deck,"if you take cable car, 5K Won for 1 way and 8.5K Won for return trip for adults. Serene and tranquil atmosphere up there and they have performance too."
Good views,"You need to take a cable car to reach the top of the tower.Some people hike but we found the cable car most convenient as we were travelling with an infant. No baby changing place at the tower. However when I requested a place to feed my baby, the staff were very helpful and provided us their office room to feed.The tower does provide some good views. Remember to visit the washroom at the top of the tower. They have floor to ceiling windows with amazing views while you do your thing :D"
Very Nice,"Korean Experience is not complete if you never get to visit N Seoul Tower.It is one of the highlights of our tour that I enjoyed a lot.Being a self confessed nature lover,I really enjoyed it on our way to the peak of the mountain with all the zigzags and snowy trees. Bus was our means of transpo going up. Buses to NSeoul Tower is accessible from anywhere in Seoul.Also, going back to Myeongdong or any area in Korea is convenient as buses are available as scheduled.With respect to natural lighting,best time to go there is from 4 pm to 7pm thus giving a nice effects on your pictures.We'd got so many nice pictures,awesome. You have to go there before dark time to enjoy the view much better.The view from atop is a picturesque. It was snowing that time. One experience definitely worth remembering."
"N Seoul Plaza, children friendly, no queue on Saturday morning","There are 3 ways to go to this tower: by walking, using Namsan Circular bus, or using cable car. We chose the third one to go to the Tower and the second one to go back to Myeongdong. We visited this place on Saturday morning. From Myeongdong, we just walked to the intersection near Namdaemun n Myeongdong. We took Namsan Oreumi and arrived at Cable Car station. We took one way tickets (6,000 won for adults and 3,500 for kids). It was around 10.30 a.m and there was no queue on Cable Car. We visited N Seoul Plaza and found out that that Plaza had a lot of cute animals' characters. If you have children, we suggest you to visit this Plaza. "
"N Seoul Tower, one of the highest places in South Korea!","We visited N Seoul Tower, which is touted to be among the highest buildings in South Korea. It is comparable to The Peak in Hong Kong. It was fun. And they also have other attractions in the building such as The Hello Kitty World, and Ssentoy Toy Museum and Shop."
"Lovely area, much better for fans of hiking","You can take the gondola lift to the top but if you're average fit I highly recommend to walk up there. The road is sure a bit steep but not that bad that you lose breath. The whole path is green, made of wooden stairs and you can rest at any point. There are a few view points where you can see breathtaking views and take pictures.Up there there's a park by the tower and cafes and restrooms and souvenir shops. I personally enjoyed the hot chocolate in the sun as the weather in November is a bit cool.Again we walked down from another path where thousands of people were for a Sunday hike/walk. Everyone peaceful. There are monuments, buildings and traditional villages on the way down."
Disappointed. Long queue ,From Myeongdong you can walk to the N Seoul cable car station. It takes about 15 -20 mins walk. We didn't make it to the top as the queues at the cable car station was madly insane. It probably going to takes us 2 hours just to ride on the cable car. 
View is breath taking - literally,"Coming up here in winter literally took our breath away due to strong winds and the cold. However, it’s still worth it to come up here to take some shots and enjoy the Seoul lights at night. Purchasing the lock isn’t necessary but still a good memory. "
For a Romantic evening ,"Everything here is a bit pricy however, it is a great sightseeing or dating venue. We roamed around the complex looking at the love locks, super hero museum, coffee shop and gift store. We then ventured to the observatory where it had a nice view of the city, photo booth and another gift shop. We ended the night with a romantic dinner in the revolving restaurant. It costs atleast 130K wons per person to eat here( you are really paying for the experience). "
Day Trip Seoul,It is also known as Namasan tower and located on one of the the highest land in Seoul and is visible from most of city. It can only be reached by public bus or a hike up the steep landscape. We enjoyed the view of the city and beyond once on top of the viewing platform. There are a number of small cafe/restaurant located within the complex where we enjoyed some food and beer. Definitely a place to visit in Seoul 
It's ok.,"Nothing much to see. Easy to get there by bus. Go there at night. Only candy stores and souvenir shops on the viewing deck. Although, it's nice if you want a view of Seoul."
21st EAFONS,"To Fall in love in seoul South Korea is to go to seoul tower at night time. Tho, almost every tourist spot in seoul is to be paid in thousands of won it was one of the best spot in Korea..."
Beautiful Lights and City View,It's so pretty at night! Mesmerising view from the viewing deck. The love locks were a sight to behold as well. 
Nice to back again,Was at N Tower in 2013... In 2017 is so nice to be back it the also a different feel as it was winter!!! it snow everywhere .. this time with our little prince..I also that the price at the N.Tower is cost more compare a few year back. 
"Worth a visit, especially at sunset!",Worth a visit when your in Seoul. Not too expensive and our ticket included a drink and some popcorn which was nice to sit and enjoy while watching the sun set over Seoul.
Tower,"Just stopped and took pictures did not climb, was on Hop on and Hop off bus. Toocold to stand around in January"
Good Views but little else,Worth a visit for the views but not much else up there and all a bit of a mess. Walking up is very steep so be aware.
Magnificent view,"You get a great feeling about Seoul, nice to be there for sunset especially for romantic dates. You can walk up from Grand Hyatt hotel through the park so that you earn your drink and food at the top. You can book a dinner at the revolving restaurant - recommended to do in advance or simply go up the tower, enjoy the view and have a drink downstairs with still a great view. Please note, sunset times might be a bit more busy. Come when it is still light so you get the best of both. Don‘t forget to use the toiletts or to check it out on the top of the tower - they are with a view.Enjoy"
Seoul under your foots,Firstly if u want to visit the tower u have to climb or have to use cable car. But know that too much line to get in cable car. Bur when u r near tower u may se amazing view of Seoul. And couple may lock as In the bridge in Paris
Great views,Really great views across the city Good to go at dusk and stay after dark to see both day and night views. 
Seoul from above,Spending entire day here was really worthy! Spectacular view from the observatory tower. I got a cheap deal from Klook.com and got the chance to enter the Ssentoy Museum! 
Love Lock,"I took my wife here for our 26th anniversary and we left a Love Lock on the fence. Very fun, great views and something everybody should experience. "
Views,"Visited N Seoul Tower on a Thursday afternoon around 2PM. There weren't any crazy lines for either the cable car up to the tower or the observatory. I suggest to purchase observatory tickets in advance to make the process a bit faster (you can't skip the lines; you still have to line up at the ticket booth to exchange your voucher for a ticket, but at least it's already paid for!). The sunlight at 2PM made it hard to take pictures, as the glare didn't agree with my camera. Perhaps try going in the morning or around/after sunset."
Beautiful Seoul,"This is near Myeong-Dong shopping area. From the biggest Uniqlo store, just go straight and cross the street (by going down the subway) and then walk straight. It's kind of an uphill so walk at your own risk. You can also take the cab directly to the entrance of the tower, it was I think 6000 won from Myeong-Dong. We took the cable car (price can be seen at their website). There's love locks everywhere! They sell the locks for 5000-7000 won so might as well lock the love ;) We were surprised that there's a separate ticket for the observatory so we just stayed downstairs. There's a coffee shop, souvenir shop and Olive Young beside the ticket booth. Would love to go back once I find The One!"
Perfect view,This is one of the perfect way to fall in love more to Seoul. You can enjoy the city view in daylight and nighttime and in every season. You better bring your cameras and your walking shoes if you want to climb the slopes but the easiest way to go up is using the cable car. You can do a lot of things in N Seoul Tower and there are restaurants and cafes too.
Tourist trap,"The cable car is crowded, the stairs up , too. When you arrive at the hill you cannot enjoy the view, because all terraces are full of people. Then you have to queue up to get a ticket for the elevator to go up a 100 meter tower. The average waiting time for using the elevator is approximately 80 minutes. At the observation desk there are a lot of shops and no space , so you are not in the mood to stay for a long while. So you have to wait again 20 minutes to get down and then another 30 minutes for the cable car. All in all it is stressful and not enjoyable."
Great View of the Seoul,"I say great view of Seoul IF the weather or smog is clear. Otherwise, it will be like going up into any observation tower and seeing next to nothing. With clear weather, you can see Seoul better than any place else. Lots of food places at the base. If you have a significant other, bring a padlock, write your lovebirds name on it, and fasten it with the millions of other adorning the fences around the base area of N Seoul Tower. You can take a moderate hike up from multiple directions, take a tram ride from Namdaemum area, or catch some public transportation (or tour). Dominant landmark visible from all over the city for getting your bearing. Interesting place to visit."
Special effects when entering the place are neat,"Nice, but I really would stay with my visit to Lotte Tower. Is nice to go, but if you have to choose, go to Lotte Tower. "
Take the cable car up if you do not want to climb the slopes,"You can take in the 360 view of Seoul from the Tower. See Gangnam, the new Lotte Tower and the Han River."
Worth a look,Easily accessible by mini elevator car up and then there is a main cable car ride up to the Tower. You can buy locks at the stores itself and join e thousands who have locked theirs on the fences around the tower. Good photo spot and there is a mini toy museum and restaurants to eat. Queues were fast moving on Xmas Day.
Beautiful Namsan Tower,I saw Namsan Tower on many kdrama and it is as beautiful and romantic as what I see on the drama. Go before it turn dark and then wait for nightfall. The city below would be tinkling.
Well worth the visit.,"Spectacular views over Seoul. Good refreshment facilities at the tower. Quite a difficult walk, probably 70% is climbing steps, but well worth the effort required."
Tower,"With the hike up, few drinks and a marvellous view before getting cable car down. Awkward to get public transport there, but possible once you fathom networks."
"If you love K-drama, you'll want to visit here","Finally on my 3rd visit to South Korea, I managed to visit the Namsan Tower. I went on a private tour and able to skip the cable car visit and went up by tour van instead. Love it! Too bad the city view was foggy when I visited but I still like the place. "
Family vacation ,Visited the Seoul Tower in the night. Nice view of the city with lights on the buildings. Took a picture with the tower in the background. Also taste the ice cream there. Overall a nice experience. 
Great view of Seoul,"If you are looking for a great view of Seoul, please visit the N Seoul Tower. It is a nice ride up (if you take the Cable Car) or a nice walk if you have the condition. From the top, you get to see the entire city.Also, there are some “love” fences in which people can express their love with a lock.Nice to visit, don’t miss it if you are in Seoul."
Beautiful place!,"Walking through Namsan Park will lead you to N Seoul Tower. Alternatively, you can take a cable car from Namsan Cable Car Station. N Seoul Tower is a must to visit during your visit to Seoul. You can enjoy the view of Seoul vividly from the Tower which need to pay an entrance fee. There are also restaurants and some cafe that you can enjoy a cup of coffee enjoying the view. "
Not worth to buy the ticket to go up the tower,"We were here nearing sunset. The view of Seoul from Namsan Park was great but not the view from the observatory deck which cost 10k won. We felt that the glass was stained and could not provide a clear view. Especially at night, the glass was reflected by the bright light from inside the deck. Ended up, we could not see much of the view and have to constantly get ourselves as near as to the glass and kept wiping the condensed glass. We also felt that the deck was more like a souvenir shop as it was very packed and the walkway was narrow. Other than that, the line was long too. So there were waiting, lining, waiting and lining. Pretty standard for touristy spot.Would recommend to just view the skyline at Namsan Park instead. The sunset was good too. "
2nd highest point in Seoul,"We took a bus to the tower. There was a walk up a steep hill and at the top to the right is the center point of Seoul marker. The tower elevator incorporated an ""in-flight movie"" on the ceiling. At the bottom of the tower you can buy a love padlock and lock it around the fence."
Not just for couples,"Considered a date place by locals however there is a lot of history and plenty of things for kids to do. The cable car ride up is fun and the view is stunning. There are locks with couple’s names every where and a proposal bridge. You can buy locks there if you find you suddenly needing to purchase one. There is a huge lg tv 3D area that is free, you can get a picture made with a loop Star in s holographic booth or have a traditional Korean meal. We watched the guards send smoke signals over the city which was really interesting."
Separate ticket for cable car,Its a great tower to visit. Nice view if weather is good. If you have bought tickets online then that does not include cable car tickets which is 6 $ per person one way. Many locks can be seen on the grills. A good experience for the tourists.
Very pretty,Something really cool about looking down on a radio tower! It was a great view despite the tower being yellow. Yellow means that the air quality is foggy usually because of smog and there not being a strong wind to move it away from the city. The tower is at peak viewing when it is lit up blue.
Memorable,"At 237metres tall tower, this is a great place for photographs, even in their toilets! However do be mentally prepared as the place is slightly crowded."
"Fun Place to Visit, Great Views and Love Locks","We were lucky to get dropped off at N Tower by AJay of Ultimate Korea Tour, and then he picked us up after we took the cable car ride down. The top of N Tower has great views, and of course, fun to leave a heart on the fence of Love Locks. You can buy a heart lock at the stores up there, then write on your lock the date and your name and where you are from, then lock it onto the fence. It's also fun to get your picture taken in front of a green screen, then choose the background pic. You can also buy a postcard that includes a stamp, and mail it from N Tower - very convenient!"
Get the combo ticket,"Note the cable car tickets are separate to the Tower entrance ticket. We arrived via the cable car and the station opens up to the viewing platform with commitment locks. Locks were available to be purchased as well as flowers from vending machines. There was a cafe here to wait for the cable car if the queue is long.Otherwise it was a short walk from the cable car station to the base of the tower. Tickets to enter the tower are located outside of the tower. For two people, we got the combination ticket with soft drinks and a bucket of popcorn free. There were several shops and cafes/restaurants at the base and in the tower. As we visited in the morning, there was virtually no queue for the elevator up to the observation level. Great views on a clear autumn day. There are very limited ""seating"" on the observation deck, so don't plan to stay too long.Don't forget to use the washroom!"
Romantic Place,We went there by Bus No.3 from Seoul Station Exit 9. They have a beautiful view. We can see the city of Seoul from above and buy a lot of cute souvenir.
Beautiful view of the city,"Though it's not completely straight forward to get to, the Namsan Tower is the perfect spot to take in a great view of Seoul. Grabbing the bus to the cable car is probably your best option, after which you can ride it to the tower itself. When you're at the tower, you not only get a 360 degrees view of Seoul but there's also restaurants, snacks, and gift shops. Don't forget to check out the lovelocks! Keep in mind the cable cars don't run when it's windy, so best to go on a clear day and it's generally best to go at night for the view of all the lights when it's not raining!"
Beautiful view from the top,"The instructions online to get to the cable car station wasn’t clear so we kind of got lost a few times while hunting for the station. We saw a few others getting lost too:(However, cos it snowed the previous day, the fortress wall looked beautiful with the snow on them. View of the nearby mountains from the top was beautiful! There was some traditional martial arts performance at the peak too when we were there and my son enjoyed it a lot. "
Lots of fun and great views of Seoul!,"We took a short tram ride up to the N. Seoul Tower. You pay to do this and then pay again to go up into the tower. Kind of a pricey tourist visit but worth it when you get up into the tower and get a 360 degree view of Seoul. There are restaurants, a candy store and lots of things for children to do. We really enjoyed this site."
no harm going there if you are in Seoul,"Took a cab up to the cable station. you can climb and hike, if you have strong legs and energy. But personally it would be dreading as i see the steps were steep. Cable car ride was nice. I think we enjoyed the cable car most.Up at Namsan, the view was breathtaking.Its a place to take lots of pictures, and getting a lock was not necessary for me.There are cafes, place to sit and place to play( claw machine). "
Namsan tower ,It’s really good for those who want to release some stress. It’s not only for couples. You guys also can go alone. The view is really awesome at night Becouse u guys can see colorful of the whole Seoul City. 
A must see in Seoul,I have visited this place several times. I recommend walking up the trail. The views are great and it's an excellent place to take pictures. I think it was prettier without the mall built around it. It's a good place to come with kids. 
Best view of seoul,"You will get the best view of Seoul. Ice cream, food & others are available. Large Led panel offers a great view. Enjoy cultural programs also. "
"Visit the tower, great views","As many times I can travel to Seoul, I'll always make it a point to travel to the tower because of the views!!Do this, you won't regret it. There's food up there, so you need not worry about eating before you go if you're in a rush."
Remarkable Place,"Seoul has plenty of interesting places to visit and the N Seoul Tower is one of the places we liked most. There are some places to lock a love padlock and leave a piece of your history there.You can see an outstanding view of Seoul, the Han River and, of course, N Seoul Tower."
Please don't walk up to the cable car station!,"Hi, my family (old and young) went up to the cable car station via foot (path along pacific hotel). The route is very steep and long. I do not recommend travel by foot, just take a cab up and down hill. By cab from top to myeongdong station is only 3600won. (My family walked up so don't have pricing.)The N Seoul Tower itself is wonderful, a must visit when in Seoul."
Great view but watch out on the waiting time....too long!!!!,"We went to visit the place at 3.00pm via cable car ride but to our surprise, it was a long waiting lines to catch the cable car. Take note of the uphill walking lane to go to the cable car station. Our advise is to take the elevator located at the side of the hill which not many people know about it. Save you the walking uphill agony, esp to those elderly people. We only got to know about it on our way down! You should also get the Discover Seoul Pass since you can get into the observatory for free. Be prepared to wait for 1 hour plus to get into the cable car and another 1/2 hour to go up to the observatory. The view is superb! Worth all the queuing and waiting. Unfortunately for us, it was about to come to winter season so the sky gets dark earlier but night time is also breathtaking. You get to see Seoul from far....nice!"
Nice view both day and night ,The Tower could be reached both by cable car and on feet. The view is very from the tower. Couples often place a love locker there. 
Early morning hike and sunrise,"Started the hike from Myeongdong station in the early morning. Passed by the cable car station and followed the path up the hill to the tower. It was not strenuous but still sweat a bit even in the cold morning below zero degree Celsius. There was hardly a soul at the top and the sun was already up with the orange glow. Didn't spend much time to linger around to enjoy the stillness and quietness, a world apart not far from the busy street scene in Myeongdong. Take note though, this place will be overwhelmed with tourist after 10am once the cable car start operation. "
Not a bad view,Price is Ok. Good view of the city. Pay a little extra for drinks and a popcorn. That tub is huge. Would be five stars if it were easier to access. You either need to take tram or walk up.
Great views of Seoul,"We went at night, which was a different view of the city. All of the lights are beautiful and the gondola to the tower is really pretty views."
Seoul tower,We went at dusk. It was cold but surreal. The night scenes were great. Weather was really windy and cold but was warm and toasty in the observatory tower.
Tower with a view,"If you are a first time visitor of Seoul like me, I would really recommend going to N Seoul Tower. We took the subway then walked up to the elevator to take us to the cable car station. The cable car takes you up the mountain. The view from the cable car is also nice...if you are near the window. It can get really crowded in the cable car. Upon reaching the top you will walk up the stairs going to the tower. I suggest you go there before the sun sets because it will give you many beautiful photo ops. Pick your spot because you are not the only one taking pictures. Do not forget to have photos by the love locks. You can bring your own lock or you can buy there. Romantic couples will have great time there. If you get hungry, there are several restaurants / cafes by the tower. To get to the top of the Tower, you have to purchase a ticket. When you have a ticket you will line up for the lifts to take you to the viewing deck. There you can get a wide view the city. You can buy souvenirs, take photos or have dinner there. We went there at the onset of winter so it was quite cold. Timing is important. Do not leave when everyone is also leaving because it will eat up your time waiting for lifts and cable car. Bring a lot of patience... it will help. Do not let the waiting in line ruin the experience for you. A good camera will help preserve your experience there. Overall, it was great for me and my family. We had fun memories and pictures."
Beautiful spot high up the mountain~,"We went here via cable car (KRW 8,000 per person, roundtrip). It was around 9pm on a Saturday, so the line going inside the cable car bound for the N Seoul Tower wasn't long.. however. the one bound for the exit of the tower was full of people!We had paid a ticket for the observatory thru Klook, and it turned out to be cheaper, as the one they were selling on the spot was KRW 10,000 per person (I got mine on Klook for 298 PHP per person~).Buy a padlock and marker in advance if you're planning to leave a padlock in N Seoul Tower because the ones they have there are pretty overpriced.Overall, it was a good experience. We got to see Seoul from the observatory and it was quite romantic!"
Great view,"Nice way to break up a city tour, walk to the top, enjoy a churros (they were surprisingly good), buy a lock and attach it if that's your thing. Lots of photos opportunities ... can be a little crowded "
Make sure to take the stairs ,"Went on a very hot and humid August night, without a doubt the way to go is up the stairs. It’s a long and steep climb, but oh so worth it. Anyone can take the gondola up, take the less traveled route! "
No harm if you skip this,Seriously no harm if you skip this if you travel to korea.Was told by the local to drop at myeongdong station and walk to the namsan cable car but the walking part is like climbing a steep slope and i was travelling with 2 young kids.So my suggestion is to take bus no 2 or 5 from chungmuro to go to the cable car.Cable car ticket is too expensive for a less than 4 mins ride...
Must see!,View is amazing! Awesome to see everything from above - during the day and also at night. Take the cable car up to the tower!
The Tower is For Lovers,"Namsan Seoul Tower was built in 1969 as Korea's first integrated transmission tower beaming television and radio broadcasts across the capital. Since opening to the public in 1980, it has become a much-loved Seoul landmark. The tower's main attractions include multi-colored digital art projected onto the tower at night, a digital observatory, a roof terrace, the HanCook restaurant, the n.Grill restaurant, and the Haneul (Sky) Restroom. Namsan Seoul Tower's mountain surroundings on Namsan Mountain have made it a popular place to unwind for locals and tourists alike.Seoul has a number of viewing platforms where visitors can enjoy the nighttime cityscape or gaze out onto the Hangang (River) but the tower's Digital Observatory is unique, offering an astonishing 360 degree panorama over the city, and 32 LCD screens recounting the 600-year history of Seoul. That is why the observatory is so popular and such a source of pride.Situated on top of the N Plaza, the Roof Terrace is a spacious wooden viewing deck whose exotic atmosphere makes it very popular with lovers. A recent attraction for courting couples is ""Locks of Love,"" thousands of padlocks attached to the fence by romantic Seoulites symbolizing their undying affection."
Nice place but expensive entrance fees,"Do note that you need to pay twice to enter this tower, one for the cable car and one for the actual tower entrance fees. You could also take a bus up I believe but most individual tourists would take the cable car. We visited on a day where visibility was quite poor so that was unfortunate, but still wanted to make a stop here as we have heard of it in many Korean dramas :) The love lock area was great as well, super colorful. You can bring your own locks or purchase an overpriced (but colorful) one at the gift shop"
It Snowed.,"Beautiful Views from one of the tallest structures in Seoul. While I was there, we got a combo popcorn and beer from downstairs and watched snow flurries from the observation deck. "
Seoul by night,Seoul Tower gives a great opportunity to look over the whole of the city for just a small entrance fee. I went at night time which was amazing as Seoul was all lit up. The cable car was also very good although there is a waiting time to get on. There is also lots of love locks if you want to participate in the thousands of locks attached to fences.
Bird's eye view from the top,"Interesting to see Seoul city from the top. I would suggest taking the cable car though it is quite expensive for a short ride. Only thing lacking, there is no clear instruction as to where to wait for the free shuttle bus that would take you to the cable car station. I had to walk and it was quite a walk going uphill!Other than the tower itself, there's also the area for couples to profess their love for each other on padlocks that they hang on the fences along the way. Quite an interesting sight."
Walking and Hiking,"Prepare your very comfortable shoes. But the place is very nice to take a photo in almost winter season. This is the place of the famous seoul tower love lock. But, I’d rather sit in one of coffee shop under the love lock bridge, it has good fish and chips taste and 2 beer in one package only for 17 won."
Best place to see all of Seoul,"This is the tallest place to see all of Seoul. You can either walk your way up or use the cable car. Once at the top, you'll be greeted with a marvelous view of the city. You can buy a small padlock to write love notes to your beloved and secure it at any of the fences. If you want to see more, you can buy a ticket to enter the observatory, which is about 15 floors higher. The view up there is priceless!"
Bus Up and Cable Car Down,"To avoid the steep uphill walk from Myeongdong Station and the crowds for the cable car, we went up using Bus 2 at Chungmuro Station Exit 2. We had timed our bus to reach N Seoul Tower at sunset. Near the top, we saw a lookout with beautiful views of the sunset, but there was no bus stop and our bus passed the lookout. Well never mind, there ought to be better views at N Seoul Tower itself.Wrong!!! The sunset at N Seoul Tower open platforms were either blocked by trees, or were facing the wrong direction. Up in the observatory, it was not easy to take good photos with the glare from the glass.The Sky Restroom was a cute novelty though.We also liked the new Ssentoy Museum. Not a very big exhibit, but still good entertainment for an hour or so.We took the cable car down (no queue), and the Namsan Orumi to Myeondong Station (downhill all the way)."
It was ok,The view from the tower observatory was nice but you get quite a good view from the viewing area below. Not really worth the price but the tickets wasn't too expensive. We took the bus up the hill cos I read the cable car it's not worth it.
Great place to visit with small kids,"We really enjoyed this place with a very breathtaking views of city of Seoul as this tower is located on top of a mountain.Easy to reach this place. We went to the tower by a shuttle bus which stops at most of the main stops around Seoul city. Also can be reachable by cable car from which we can have a nice view from the cable car.The place was also not so crowded and we did not queue long to buy the ticket and to board the lift to go up to the observation deck.Overall, a must visit for families with young children."
A must see!,This spot is just great. You can get a great view of the city and the tower it self has some really interesting things to see and do.
A unexpected treat,"Had a great time looking out over the city. A must if it's your first time to Seoul. Just make sure your taxi understands you want to get dropped off at the cable car on the south side of the mountain, otherwise you have a pretty steep walk ahead of you. "
Very Cheap with good views,"Excellent tower which is very cheap compare to other cities, good views at nighttime and the elevator area is very good for pictures. "
Over-rated,"Be ready to climb up the steep steep road. It's not recommended for senior people. Not good to also bring infants because if they're on stroller, difficult to move up. Limited access to go up the tower, it's quick but line is long. There is no view actually because you could see the same sky-scape when you're in your hotel or in the airplane. "
"Very nice, specially if weather permits","We went on the clear morning at 10 am, so we did not have a line. Make sure to buy a lock there if you are that type of things - we did. No line and it was nice. Not the best tower, but gives you a good perspective on the city. We also took a walk down from the tower - very nice and easy walk."
"i went in the end of september, and the whether is cold and is a good place to take photo",you can buy a lock with your lover and lock on the wall. the lock can buy from the shop at N seoul tower.
Amazing views ,We were lucky and got a fantastic clear winter's day. Very informative and professional staff as well. The padlocks were cute as well. 
It’s colourful and relaxing. ,"The view from N Seoul tower was amazing. Everywhere we looked, it was filled with colour. We took the cable car to the top and walked down. "
Nice attraction ,The N Seoul Tower is the highest spot in Seoul enabling 360 view of the city. It is located on a forested hill to which a nice cable car is leading. At its base a love couples area resides where you'll find thousands of locks locked on every fence and special tree to denote a couple's love. It's a nice attraction to visit if you have some spare time. 
Namsan Seoul Tower,Enjoyable and easy climb up Namsan Mountain to Seoul Tower with a wonderful panoramic view of Seoul. 
"A must for a Kdrama fan 😅, like me.","Namsan Tower is an iconic structure in Korea and its one of my places to visit in Seoul. From Myeongdong I just walked all the way to the top although you can take the cable car for KRW8500 roundtrip. I preferred to just walk to the top because there are a lot of beautiful things to see while walking, especially it was autumn. The view from the top is amazing and it gives you a great view of the city. So beautiful to see the city lights if you choose to visit at night. "
Very pretty,"We had heard that it gets very busy at night, so we made sure we got up to the first platform before the sun set. We had time to look around before having dinner in one of the restuarants, which was very reasonably priced. The view from the top was average, unfortunately there was a lot of light inside the building that prevented a clear view of the sky. There was a good view from the toilets though."
Not worth money,"Good place to see the entire city from above. However, KRW 15K/pax is expensive. It's only a high tower, not any more."
Beautiful Tower,I liked the atmosphere of this tower on the hill. I didn't get to go up at the top of the tower because of the long line. I got there at night which was too late to queue up. Had a quite reasonable price dinner at the base of the tower and some starbucks drinks. Some people come here to exercise because of the steep hill. The only thing I didn't like is the overcrowded bus on the way up and down. 
Special spots ,Go to the toilet there! One level down from the top viewing deck ;) the view will be amazing! Trust me 
Excellent ,"Built in 1969 this is an excellent tower on top of a hill providing maximum views. Highlights apart from the views are looking a everyone's love lockets affixed just outside at the base. You can buy food and drink cheaply at the base and at the top. Entrance 10,000 KRW. Allow 1 to 2 hours."
Stunning View,"Perfect place to visit. You can see the entire Seoul City from the top of the Tower. You can lock your love story also in the special place just beside the tower entrance. Very fantastic place to visit, the view is extraordinary, the café area offers great view towards the city as well. A very recommended place to visit. Note: I recommend you to bring some cash when you visiting the site because the ATM on the site charging very high tax."
Beautiful place during autumn,Took the cable car to the tower. Great place for photo taking. Restaurants and shopping at the tower.
Spectacular view,Visitor witnessed the nice panorama of Seoul . There is an elemant of modern and traditional building where you can see how the korean protect their culture . Walking will takes you approx. 20mins or by gondola less than 5mins.
Amazing View of Seoul at Night,"We walked up to the tower late on a Friday night. We weren't sure if the cable cars were running so we walked about 20 minutes along the road to the tower. It wasn't bad of a walk at all - we enjoyed the quiet of the surrounding woods. The tower complex has many stores, restaurants, and attractions. The view from the top was stunning. I highly recommend going at night but I'd love to come back during the day as well."
Great views over Seoul ,"Although not as high as the Tokyo Skytree, the N Seoul Tower offers great views over the Korean capital. The price of the visit is reasonable, even including the cable car to get there. Walking up the stairs is also a nice option on a sunny day, but it’s a lot of stairs.The closest station for the cable car is Myeongdong, it’s a less than 15 minute walk."
Stunning view of Seoul ,A must if you’re in Seoul! From the tower you get a stunning view of the city and its surroundings. Also a very nice souvenir shop at the top. 
Beautiful View!,A hike to N Seoul Tower is a must! Beautiful 360 degrees view of the city and then take the cable car going down
Great place for Seoul City View,"The N Seoul tower is accessible by cable car.It required a long walking distance with slope to Namsan Cable Car boarding place after coming out from Gate 2, Myeongdong subway station, may take taxi to reach the boarding place.The fee will be charged to visit Observatory at the N Seoul Tower. But the great view on the top of Namsan tower has definitely become a good spot for photolovers. As well, the visitor is able to enjoy the performance- Namsan Beacon Mound Martial Arts at 3pm. "
Fantastic!,"Visited the N Seoul tower a few times whilst visiting Korea, truly remarkable sites when you to get to the top from day through to night. You can either take a nice walk up from through namsan or you can take the cable car which was quite cheap! Oh and great restaurants at the top too!"
Best view of Seoul,"Just like most observation towers this N Seoul Tower gives an amazing 360 degree view of the city go Seoul. People leave padlocks all around the Tower with writing on them. It’s a great sight to see. Along with the observation deck they have a Hello Kitty museum and a toy museum, but they both cost extra. "
Yes yes yes! MUST,If we had more time I would've preferred to hike up but we took the cable car. You could also hike back down.Beautiful area and so pretty at night when it's lit up.The love locks alone was worth it to venture up the Seoul tower!
One of the best views in seoul,"If you want an amazing view without having to climb a mountain this is the spot for you! The view was do good we went back twice during our stay.There's loads of food options, noodles, burgers, cultets, chicken and beer, 2 buffets and a French restaurant on the top floor. There's also a pretty good arcade and there are martial arts displays on sometimes, the cable car makes it so easy to access but the walk up through the park is lovely too. Not to be missed. "
Hanbok Experience in N Seoul Tower is the Place to Visit,N Seoul Tower itself was just okay. It's a closed space so the view was not really spectacular.The place itself was a very good place to visit. There's a Hanbok Experience store in the area which we really loved. They have premium Hanboks for rent and various settings for picture taking. The prices here are way higher than those found near the palaces but the same goes for the quality.
To the tower we go !!,"Visited the tower a couple of times during various times of the year. To me best is during winter as visibility seems to be better. You good a reasonable go view of the city, don't forget to take your padlock ;) Also there are a number of good restaurants and bars on the way back down into the inner city. Its a nice walk to the cable cars, its a bit challenging walking all the way up but quite good fun!"
Fun!,The love locks place is kitschy. Such a photographic area. We rode the cable car at dusk so our view was the city slowly lighting up. 
Amazing walk,"Walked up, gondola down. Worth the trek. Incredible views that really highlight the overall expanse of the city of Seoul."
Beautiful night view,"My daughter and I went on a chilly, slightly overcast night. There were hardly anyone around but there were lots to do and see. Several places to have a drink and snacks, few restaurants,small hello kitty store as well as few gift shops and plenty of photo op places can have you wander around for awhile. The view is amazing with sparkling colorful lights everywhere. It’s even more colorful now because the major department stores and few hotels had Christmas decorations on. Definitely a must when in Seoul!"
Iconic Seoul monument,"One of the touristy things that everyone should do. Take the cable car up near Myeongdong station, and you will get an amazing view of Seoul. Recommend going at night for beautiful nighttime viewing."
"Dear visitors, read this!","Dear Diplomats,- You have a blue plate vehicle, feel free to drive up the tower and park your car below Starbucks, next to the Hanbok Experience shop.Dear Normal Visitors,There are two options for you to go up there:1. Take a guided tour bus2. Take a public bus- From inside Seoul area, usually, the public buses are Green and numbered 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. They have other buses but I am not sure about the numbers."
Worth Visiting,"At first I thought this would just be another tourist trap, but it turned out to be well worth visiting. I went during the autumn season though, so this could be the reason why it was so beautiful. All the trees had orange, yellow and red leaves making the little uphill walk to the tower such a beautiful experience. It felt serene to be surrounded by nature while in the city. Seeing the whole Seoul at the top of the tower viewing deck was also great. "
Very good place to see Seoul.,"Went with my Brother and his wife and even though it was foggy that day, the view was still really nice. We walked up to the tower but there are also buses you can take. "
Best way to see the City,"We visited the tower on a nice clear day and used the cable car to get up at about midday. It was rather busy and the tower itself is a little pricey from my view, so instead we just stayed around the base and the views even there are spectacular and make for some great pictures.You must 100% visit, mainly on a clear day."
Fantastic view,"I would suggest walk up instead of taking cable cars. The mountain isn't high, you should be able to get there within half an hour. You can spend a couple of hours to circle around the whole mountain track. The view on the tower is just magnificent, suggest buying a cup of coffee in the artrium and sitting there for relaxation."
Nice view,One of the must visit place when you're in Seoul.. Can get a nice view of the city and you can leave your signature lock here 
Best for Nov Autumn Season,"For those who were not able to visit on Oct, here's the place for you for Nov. Autumn leaves and trees are extravagant for autumn. For those who missed the big exchange of guards, you can also have it here. Plus photo opportunity with the guards.Double check for the exhibit at the top if it's worth the price.Skip the deck if it's already cloudy on the ground, chances are you'll never appreciate the horizon."
Meh...,"After seeing the towers in Shanghai and Kuala Lumpur, the view is nice but underwelming. The tower is additionally not that high and the viewing deck is not that big. However, I do recommend visiting the toilets (as they also have the same nice view) and a bucket of caramel popcorn as you wait to go upstairs."
“magnificent view”,"our hotel was very close to the cable car station yet we tried walking. its a long uphill walk and very tiring but its worth it because you get to see and enjoy the beautiful scenery along the way. and upon reaching the tower, you get to see the magnificent view of the city. "
Beautiful sunset and night view from the top,"It is a nice place to spend the 2nd half of the day. There are restaurants, coffee shops, souvenir shops and lots of lookout points for photo taking. The sunset is amazing from the top and the night view is not too bad either. The sky toilet is an absolute must visit just for the fun of it. It is very couple-centric on the top, with various love locks locations, love-dovey photo spots targeting tourists and Seoulites going on dates."
Just okay...,"Nice views from the top but that’s about it. We did come in the morning though so the views at night may be better. Tip: If you plan on visiting during the day, come early in the morning to avoid the long lines from the the cable car."
Great views of Seoul,"Namsan Seoul Tower (or N Seoul Tower as it is commonly called) was built in 1969. It was the first tower tourist place in Korea. It was also Korea's first integrated transmission tower beaming television and radio broadcasts to Seoul. The tower opened to the public in 1980.The tower has a digital observatory and a roof terrace. The digital observatory gives you a 360 degree panoramic view of the city. I noted a few restaurants - the HanCook, the n.Grill restaurant, and the Haneul Restroom. The roof terrace is a great viewing area. It has many padlocks attached to the fence by couples to show their love for each other. These are the “Locks of Love”.The top of the tower is about 480 metres above sea level taking into consideration that Namsan Mountain on which the tower is based is 243 metres above sea level and the tower itself is about 237 metres. You take a free ride on a funicular from street level to the cable car station. At the cable car station. you need to buy a ticket here for a cable car trip to the tower complex. You can buy a single or return ticket to the tower. A return ticket costs 8,500 Won (equivalent to about GBP 6.00 – August 2017) When you get to the tower, you then need to buy a ticket for admission to the top of the tower – 10,000 Won – (equivalent to about GBP7.00 Aug 17). You can get a great view from the tower base and it is just as good as the view from the top of the tower. In the tower, the windows have the names of cities of the world and their distance from Seoul. The tower has some kiosks selling snacks."
Let your soul soar at the Seoul Tower!,"This place is definitely a must see. We walked from Yongsan to the tower and had an extremely fun time. There are many sights, sounds, and tastes to experience along the way like Namsan park, the love locks, and many souvenir shops and restaurants. The real beauty, however, is the spectacular view of beloved Seoul from the tower. Take the trip, see the sights, feel the power of the tower! "
A must for first time visitor,"You need to get to Namsan Park before purchasing a ticket (about AUD10) to the tower, you can either choose to hike up or get in a cable car. Once arrived, you need to purchase ticket to get up yo to the tower. Expect big crowd if go after 11am as this is a popular tourist spot for groups. "
Nice but long wait,"Whenever you go to viewing spots it is short. You see the sight, you're done. We waited about 15 minutes for the elevator. We probably spent less time than that up top. We saw what we could see at night, took photos, then left. There were sooo many kids - maybe a class?"
Breathtaking view,"A must see for tourists - I go every year when I’m in the country and although the view is the same, it still takes my breath away.The nighttime view is so breathtaking and makes great photo opportunities."
Impressive view,"Note that a entrance fee is charged to go to the top of the tower - about 10k. The walk to the tower is rather enjoyable and is a short intense hike from the entrance of the park.The tower itself is very commercial - but what made it interesting for me is the 250 view from the top of the tower. As a European, it takes this view to grasp the extend of the large expanse that represents Seoul; dense habitations, shops, and high-rises as far as the eye can see.Taking pictures here may not be very fruitful since you’re behind glass, but you’re in the open if you go down to the 4th floor."
AMAZING view and FRIENDLY staff,"I would recommend visiting this place at night, not to late so shops are open when you go but late enough that you can see the lights. I would say I mostly saw couples at this place but even if your just with your friends, family or traveling by yourself it's still a must do. Bring your own lock or buy one there and set your mark.You can either take the cable car or the bus, transportation is pretty convenient and on a set schedule."
Beautiful overview of Seoul City,"There are few ways going to the top. The most accessible to tourist either cable car which you have to pay or walking. During november, the autumn foliage is beautiful. at the top you can appreciate seoul city both during day and night trip. if the weather permits, the sunset is beautiful."
Padlocks and great views,We spent a lovely evening at the seoul tower area... firstly the cable car. From here you can get great views over the city alone. Bring a camera and tripod. Secondly head to a shop and buy a padlock. You will see where to put it. We then went up the tower and took in the great views of seoul. Afterwards we ate dinner at the buffet restaurant at the bottom of the tower. Highly reccomended
Nice and cool ,Nice to see from tower Seoul city. This is my first time in Seoul so i really enjoyed to see Seoul city from Tower .I recommend to visit this place. 
Nice walk up the tower,Did a walk up to the tower in the morning. Well lit up pathways. The steps are well constructed. Please carry water or fluid.Great city views.
Viewsss,"The elevator ride is already worth it. It is just so cool to be in the heart of Seoul and to see the whole if the city surrounded by mountains. Make sure you have little sit at the toilet too, I know it sounds weird but just believe me on this one haha"
Seoul Tower.,"This impressive Tower literally does tower above the Seoul skyline. The easiest way to reach it is by taxi or take a tour, but the effort is well worth it. It is situated on the top of a hill with a fast winding road to arrive. The views are magnificent; across towards North Korea to the North, and across the whole city spread out to the South. Very impressive."
A quick glimpse of N Tower,The place is a perfect one to unwind and correlate with nature. This place with a view of the city lights in the evening and the wonderful trees and nature sight during daytime particularly during autumn which adds wonderful experience on your visit in this place. The love padlocks scattered around the place are good way of taking a look about lovers wishes and messages to each other. The N Tower is included to the tourist attractions when you get the Discover Seoul Pass.
Amazing view,The tower has to be visited during night hours to admire the beauty of the lighting. The lift has an OLED screen on the roof which displays the city and its buildings along with various land scape . By the time the film is over you reach on top. The view from the top is awesome. Binoculars are installed on top to see the city from various angle. You may have to drop 500 Won coin for activating it.
Namsan Seoul Tower,"N Seoul Tower; YTN Seoul Tower or Namsan Tower is some of the names being called in this prestigious scenery and one of the most tourist spot in Seoul, South Korea. The tower is renowned as a national landmark, and for its cityscape and it sits on the Namsan Mountain and attracts thousands of tourists. It's a great venue for family with children, friends, couples and people who love nature to hangout.The Roof Terrace is a spacious wooden viewing deck whose exotic atmosphere makes it very popular with lovers. A recent attraction for courting couples is ""Locks of Love,"" thousands of padlocks attached to the fence symbolizing their undying affection.Which is located in the second floor of N plaza.*Opens 10AM to 12AM *Round trip ticket for cable car (valid for 1 day): 8,500 won*Located at 04340 105, Namsangongwon-gil, Yongsan-gu, Seoul, Korea (Yongsan-dong 2-ga, YTN Seoul Tower)"
N Seoul Tower,"This area is simply beautiful - especially at night. Plan to dress according to the season that you visit. It was a bit chilly when I was there at the end of October. Beautiful city views! Very romantic (especially at night). Be prepared to wait to go up to the top of the Tower; however, the view is worth it!"
Awesome,We did not go for the observatory deck as the sights are already worth it. Take 2 wat cable as hike is too much activity even for a semi fit person (in my opinion).
"Great View, Big Cable Car - Commercialisted Shops",What a great view of Seoul. I love a Pagola next to the tower and pleasant walk to bus stops. Do not miss a kind of Korean traditional army ceremony held there (check the time before you go). Cable car ride was okay but can be very crowded. There are many restaurants and cafes around and inisde of the Tower. 
Nice viewing spot!,"We didn’t bother going up the tower beyond the free locations, as we find the base of the tower already offered great views of the city at almost 360 degrees angle.In particular we found the gift shop was pricey and lack variety of souvenirs. We took the bus up to the tower and found it very convenient and cheap to commute to. Would recommend visiting!"
Nice walk,We were here in the morning so its quiet great but I think its best at night to see the lights of Seoul City at night.
Nice Scenery,We took cable car to N Seoul Tower. Love their beautiful scenery. They have locks trees which you can buy those cute locks from their souvenir shops and write both partner's name & lock it there. 
Great place,Great place for travelers kkk. and weather was cool and really good place for couples i think kk if ure traveler hace to go there but evening is more beautiful and have fun 
Beautiful area of Seoul,"This is the iconic centerpiece of Seoul. How can you not visit? The park around the tower is absolutely beautiful, especially in fall. There's multiple ways to get to the tower... you can take a tour bus, you can take the cable car, or you can hike. I highly encourage you to take the time to take the cable car up, and hike down, or vice-versa. The view from the top is great (but it's not near as tall as Lotte Tower, which I also highly recommend). The only downside to tower is its accessibility. I don't believe there's a parking lot to drive your own car, it's out of the way for a taxi, and it's not near a subway stop. That's why I recommend the cable car or hiking."
A good 360 degree view of Seoul,"Who doen’t like cable car rides and observatories? It is a good contrast of beacon hill during the Josepn period and the technology now not to mention the romantic lovelocks, instagrammable scenic spots and the vibrant hues of autumn. Tip: use the restroom."
Romantic destination with excellent views,"One of the most visible landmarks, Seoul tower is worth a visit at least once. I've been twice now, both during my first visit to Seoul and my most recent. Getting here can be a bit tricky if you don't have a knowledgeable local to help guide you as I had during my second visit, but I was still able to find my way with my limited Korean ability during my first visit, so don't be scared! Once you're on the correct bus, it winds it's perilous way along a narrow winding road until letting you off at a stop shy of the actual summit. You're expected to walk the remaining distance to the tower itself, so wear shoes that will be comfortable for walking up a steep incline. It's a little bit of an exertion depending on your fitness level, but the views from the top are well worth it! Both of my visits have been during the night and it's breath taking. The collection of locks has grown an incredible amount since my first visit, too! Make sure to bring your own padlock to seal the bonds of your eternal love if you have someone worthy of locking down. I contributed my own lock to the collection during my last visit! Be sure to go up and do the view, too, it's worth the admission fare. Even the bathrooms have incredible views! It's really worth seeing at least once and if you're already there, just go for it. "
Breathtaking Night Views,"Seoul Tower at night was spectacular, the entire city is lit up and you can see for miles. The cable car up to the tower was also a fun way to get up there. There are shops for souvenirs and food as well plus many different spots to view the city."
Famous Landmark,Come during the afternoon until dark.Enjoy the view and city lights at night.Also you can enjoy walking up and down. But would suggest to take the cable car.
Great view on the way up,This tower is placed on top of a hill. The park and the hill are very beautiful and offer a view to the city. Don’t miss the great scenery by taking the bus straight to the tower. The tower honestly doesn’t have much for you to explore. 
Nice city view ,"This is an iconic place, you should if you can, visit this place, it is close to major attractions. There’s a cableway to get there "
Nice View,Have a nice view...I came here at spring and the weather about 15 degree in the evening and may be cooler at night... we must prepare light coat.. love this place... romantic and istgramable...
Amazing sigtseeing ,"It worth to wait in a line to attend the tower and enjoy sightseeing, great atmosphere and technoligies. An elevator will lift you to the top in 30 seconds to observe spectacular Seoul's life. All WCs are with a window wall and you may enjoy the view even there. Souvenir shop and Hello Kittie's museum provide a variety of gifts for adults and kids. "
A cool view of Seoul,"Skip the bus and enjoy the hike up to the park at the base of the tower. Have a beer in the rotating restaurant, but don't eat there, and enjoy the panoramic view of the city. Go on one of the rare clear days, or you won't have much of a view. "
Fast elevator ride.,The ride up the elevator was super fast with cool visuals. There are a coiple of activities you can do when you arrive at the observatory. Best come at night for awesome cityscape.
Very long que!!!,"This is my first time in Seoul korea and decided to visit N Tower on a Saturday, the line was very long and it took us almost 2 Hours just to get the ticket and ride the cable to go up the tower. Once we got to the tower, it was very crowded and we have to wait on the line again just go go down the lift. The view on the observatory is not very impressive and it’s not worth waiting for 2 hours."
My favorite place,"I live in Seoul for 3 years and I was lucky that my apt is located near Namsan. I always go here for a hike especially during spring and autumn season. The view of Seoul from N Seoul Tower is quite amazing. In N Seoul, aside from the observatory there is the Teddy Bear Museum, the love lock areas and just recently they constructed a 4 or 5 storey building that houses a lot of restos, cafe, led displays and much more. My fave thing to do here is to just have a cup of coffee and just enjoy the view.It is pretty easy to go up N Seoul. The most expensive one is thru the cable car, the most practical is thru the namsan loop buses and if ypu dont want to spend money, you can just walk.. a lot of hiking trails to choose from all with commanding views of Seoul. I highly recommend the Namsan Park wirh its fortress wall. If time permits, go walking or jogging in the walking path, especially during autumn as it had the best autumn leaves.There were also a lot of exercise equipments to use for free. "
Seoul 360 ,"A breathtaking view awaits you! Every one will really enjoy a 360degree view of the Seoul City. There is a coffee shop and a souvenir shop awaiting for you at the top. Having a cup of coffee and overlooking the 360 degree of Seoul Is somehow very hard to describe.Once done, you can buys souvenirs for friends and family at home. You can even have your picture taken right at the ground level, and once u are up there thru the loft, your picture will be printed. Thats how fast it is. Suitable for family and even couples whom are feeling very romantic."
Fantastic Views!,"We took a trip here on our first day in Seoul, it was busy but a great place to look around and for views of Seoul. Again there was reduced entry for seniors. "
Amazing Seoul tower,Seoul tower is a must see attraction in Seoul. It is true that you have to climb a hill to get there but on the top your efford is paid off with amazing view of the city. It is also appropriate for people in love because there is a fence where they can lock their love with a lock forever
Still the same...vibrant view and scenery,"Started our day with walk from our guest house to Namsan.This is my fourth time visiting and the excitement is still enticing. The wonderful autumn just right around the corner make the visit more meaningful.They have upgraded the place especially the padlock area..The halloween theme accomplished the fall season perfectly. However, the shrimp burger no longer been offered at N Burger.If you like to have view of Seoul plus the scenery+nature, you should not miss N Seoul Tower "
Beautiful View of the City,"Best to take a bus going here rather than the cable car. Bus is cheaper compared to the cable.You only need to walk on an inclined road going up, so be prepared. It's very cold here during Autumn, bring thick jackets, and it's quite windy here.They have a place to put your LOVE LOCKS as well. You can spend at least 1-2 hours here."
Go see the whole Seoul,"Suggested time to go up by around 4pm. then go straight on the love lock area and witness the sunset. After the sunset you can go to the park beside the tower and theres a show you can watch... its ideal to go up the tower by around 7pm so you can see the beautiful lights of seoul. Dont forget to buy pop corn and drinks on the ground level (before riding the elevator to tower) its much enjoyable you see the view while eating and chatting with friends. once you are at the top of the tower, dont worry theres a lot of space you can sit on :) Enjoy!!!"
Very mediocre attraction,"My wife and I were visiting Seoul for five days and towards the end of our stay, we were largely out of sightseeing destinations. Almost as an afterthought, we decided to see the view at night from N Tower. I genuinely wish we hadn't made that decision. The process takes a long time as it is crowded getting up the cable car and then up the elevator. Then the view from the top is (at least at night) largely obscured by the bright lights of the gift shop displays which are DIRECTLY behind all the windows. So you're essentially seeing glare, not the beautiful city lights. Big tourist trap too - lots of kitschy souvenirs and overpriced food. To say nothing of the ""love lock"" gimmick they have going on too. And the N Tower itself is hardly impressive if you're been to other towers around the world.Pass on this one."
Wow,"If you go up there you will enjoy an 360° unbelievable view of Seoul and surroundings. It is surely worth the trip to see how big this city really is with over 20 million inhabitants close to seaside on one side, close to high mountains ( with skiing possibilities ) on the other side."
Our favorite part of Seoul ,"Walking through Namsen park up to the tower was our favorite part of Seoul. Beautiful views, and when you leave down the cable car it is not more than half a mile to Meongdong area. "
Best sunset view,"The iconic landmark of Seoul. Go there in the evening so that u can get both day & night view. Do allocate extra 1hour for the cable car queue. I suggest that you take the elevator to the cable car station. Walking there is tiring especially if you travel with seniors and kids as it’s uphill road. To get to the elevator , exit at Hoyeon station NOT myeondong."
Worth it ,"We paid and took the cable car up and walked around for a bit when we arrived. It was nice in the area without needing to go further up in the N Seoul Tower. Having said that, we paid 21,000krw (about $21 USD) for the two of us to go up the tower, with two drinks and a large popcorn. Or you can go up the tower for 10,000krw each. When we went up, it was just in time for the sunset, and that's when you truly can see how large Seoul really is! "
Walk up is good exercise,We walked up instead of taking the tram. Fine in 24 degrees Celsius but we are quite fit and were happy for some cardio. Lovely once you are up there. Cute shops and an arcade too
Nice view!,We go on the night time due to our flight arrived in the afternoon. Plan to catch the sunset but spend too much time looking for our hostel but the view on the night time also stunning. Try the cable car for fast access to the top and video recording along the trip up.
symbol of the seoul,"The symbol of Seoul is open from 10 am. Couples leave each other's names on the keys after they are written down. The observatory fee is 10,000 won. Hello Kitty has an exhibition hall."
A great place to visit,"Visited N Seoul Tower during my visit to Korea. The walk to the Tower is very steep and a bit tiring but I'm sure young people will enjoy. In the tower, it was good view of the city. The souvenir shop was good too."
Great views from the tower,You can either climb up around 200m from the station level or get a cable car. The walk is part slope and part steps. Good exercise but not at all tough. The views as you walk up alongside the old city wall are great - but excellent from the viewing gallery up the tower. Highly recommended. 
One of the best in the world,Travelling to korea will not be complete without visiting this amazing tourist attraction.You need to exert extra effort to reach the top of the Tower. We went here last April 2017 and its freaking cold.This is also the place where you can see the love locks in the area. Such a romantic place to be with your partner and or ur family.
Nice spot with scenic views,"If you're in Seoul for more than a day, definitely consider visiting the tower. You can get there by subway (close enough) from the Myeongdong stops, and walk towards the mountain. Eventually you will see signs for the Namsan park and tower. At the base is a gondola, but walking up the staired path is free, and takes about 20 mins at a leisurely pace. There are good views and photo spots along the way. At the top there are some assorted restaurants and eateries, and the tower itself. Also, at the plaza there is usually some kind of cultural-related event taking place, and there is the world famous ""love lock"" wall you've seen in many Korean dramas. The walk down is rather steep, so be careful if it is wet. "
Namsan Seoul Tower is a place of solitude.,"Built in the late 60's as a radio and television transmission tower is now a main attraction for tourist and locals alike. What attracts many people to this landmark is its multi colored lighting that's projected onto the tower at dusk, an observatory that offers a 360 degree panoramic view of the city, the Rooftop Terrace and the Sky Restroom. My wife and I especially liked the Rooftop Terrace that offers a romantic ambiance.The terrace is a wooden deck with a city view and thousand of padlocks ""Locks of Love"" that's attached to fences, walls and trees that symbolize undying love. Also remember when you're in the observatory, make sure to visit the Sky Bathroom!"
A must for tourist and none tourist,I've been here doing the day light and during the night. It's such a pretty place. And they have a great view of the city. Try to go during sunset so that you get both the day and the night view of the Tower and the city.
Go for the view,"I was originally going to take the cable car up to see Seoul Tower because I like cable cars. However it is inconvenient to get the the cable car eventhough there is a free shuttle. I read that in the afternoon the line can be quite long. Then once you get to the top there are alot of steps to get up to the tower. I opted to take the bus up instead. I didn't go up to the observation deck but you can get a decent view from below as well. LG has three OLED curved displays. One is a wave, the other is a tunnel and the third is a circle. There is also a 3D immersive video display as well which is kind of cool. I waited as long as I could but I had to leave at 6pm. Unfortunately the tower was not fully lit up yet. They seem to light it parts of it one at a time very slowly for some reason. I had to head back to get my bags from my hotel and head to the airport."
Very scenic view and many performances.,"Very scenic views, we can even see the sunset and the mountains. There are also many cultural performances showcasing the skills of the swordsmen."
Good Exercise,"Went to Seoul tower as a must do/see kind of thing. We started the trail at the beginning of the steps and didn't know there was a cable car initially. Anyhow, great exercise going up the mile of steps. Great easy workout with plenty of places to pause for a quick rest and plenty of photo ops along the way. Plenty of people to include small children were working their way to the top. Once up there, you find the love lock area. Similar to Paris' love lock bridges only difference is there's not bridge and it's encouraged. The day we went there was a show going on so free entertainment on top of being random tourists. You can go inside the tower for food, toilets, gift shops, and for the observation deck. We didn't bother with paying to go on the deck as you can see some cool sights just walking around. We decided to do the cable car on the way down for another unique experience. Got to see the city from a different point of view and tickets are fairly cheap. If you can't do the hike up of the stairs, the cable car goes up and down. Just need a little patience to wait in the line. Would def go back again for the hike up."
"A must, at least once","I was only in Seoul for a couple days, but this was my one of my favorite things to do. Be sure to leave plenty of time to enjoy the experience. We left our hotel about a mile from the tower at 2pm walking and returned at about 6pm. The time is spent waiting in lines to get up the cable car and the tower. About an hour wait for the cable car and 30 min for the tower. The observation Deck is worth the extra money. I really did not understand how big this city really is until I was on the observation Deck. As far as the eye can see in every direction, the city sprawls out over the landscape. It is so beautiful and amazing. Truly is a humbling and awe inspiring sight. Was worth the wait and worth the experience. My guess is that it is less busy in the morning. "
Views are not very spectacular,You get to see a paradomic view of Seoul city at the observatory. View was not spectacular and there wasn't much to do at the tower too. 
Great area and nice views,"A was a nice and sunny day, albeit a wee bit hazy. Went all the way to the top and nice views of Seoul (11 million people are living here). Plenty of things to do and can spent half a day easily. You can walk all the way up, or even cycle, but would be okay to go to top by car and walk down. Plenty of lights to make evening visit worthwhile."
A Toilet With A View,"The walk in Autumn is definitely worth it instead of getting the cable car.The base of the tower had traditional dancing and performances which is great to stop and watch whole you rest a little.The line for the tower was fairly long but the views are amazing from the top. The most surprising thing was going to the toilet to discover the full window views, definitely an experience in itself lol."
Worth visiting ,"There is nice large park around it, with shops out side the tower. Acceptable fees for entry and nice view of the city from up and great souvenirs shop at the end."
Seoul Tower,Superrrrr place for sightseeing especially in the evening.We visited in the evening and the lighting is superb.Not to be missed since you can see the entire skyline of Seoul
You lock my heart at N Seoul Tower !,"N Seoul Tower is worth to visit. 1st time been there by cable car. 2nd time I went there last year during my honeymoon trip. since the cable car is under maintenance, we go up there by public bus. Feel so happy go round around the city before we reach our destination. I would say the scenery is beautiful from the top. you can see the whole Seoul City.. In the cold weather, its so relaxing. The padlock is an attraction...I cannot help it but to read the wordings on the padlock....Its really funny you know...People write a lot of things to express their love affair. Ha ha ha. I really like to spend time up there."
Incredible views,"If you enjoy a long walk or run, check this place out! The views are spectacular! The walkways get work up a good sweat!"
Great view,Stopped here while taking a bus tour of the city. Amazing views of the city on a clear day. Even better at night.
Amazing view,"We couldn't take the cable car due to the long queue. We decided to walk till the top and the stress was well paid back. The view was amazing, especially at night. A must attraction if u spend some.some . days in seoul"
Seoul tower,"Seoul tower is a must go tower for tourists because it has a magnificent views of the buildings, places, points of interests and mountains. Went to check it out in Oct, it was great because the weather was good and sunny. We walked slowly up the hill to get on an elevator lift to the tower (free). Then reached mid upper hill had to buy a return ticket (or single one way up or down - can hike up or down the hill) cable ride to the tower. Negative was the staff will filled up the cable car (packed sardines :/) with enough tourists then start the ride. Enjoyed the great views but not really while in the cable car because can't move around to take pictures.When reached the hill top, there were steps to walk up. There was a lock place, where lovers can buy locks to write their wishes and locked it around the fences which was so romantic and a vending machine to sell flowers. After had to walk up few more steps up and there was a Korean dressed up guard standing there and behind 2 more guards were marching each side of the huge big vases (those were for guards to lit those big vases when enemies entered their provinces -old time). Because it was mid autumn festival, there was a stall that let visitors to put on Korean traditional costumes (free) then took pics with the guards. At the tower, visitors able to buy just visit the tower platform, or tickets that include hello kitty museum and comic characters museum. Both museums are small but kids loved them so much. Up to the viewing plateform, the views were magnificent and spent long time to see how Seoul formed. Seoul was surrounded by mountains, palaces were along those mountains, buildings were not tall and able to see the new develop areas and old areas. Slight dissapointed - did not have places to sit and no much service facilities if compared with Lotte world tower (from namsan world tower you can see the Lotte world tower is right opposite to each other). The ladies toilets have glass all the way down in the cubicles but abit smelly and not clean. Overall it was great experience."
Great view of Seoul city,The tower is advertised as a romantic place for couples. When we reached there it was so crowded and the line to buy the tickets were equally long and took us another 45 mins to line up to get to the top of the tower. But that could have been our fault as we did not check if we could have bought the tickets online prior to us going up.Once you are up there you can see the whole of Seoul (provided it's not a cloudy day). At the bottom of the tower you can write little messages and lock it by a designated fence there <3My advise is to buy your own little lock before heading to Namsam tower because buying it there is quite expensive. Overall it was a nice and wonderful experience a part from the crowd. 
Views!!!,"First on my list before coming to Seoul was the tower. And I didnt regret it at all. Seoul is huge so you better come 236m above ground to check the city from air. Also I was lucky with the weather, so I got a full beautiful picture of this huge city. If the weather is nice I would suggest going up by foot and coming down by cable car. "
Choose your time of visit carefully,We made two trips up to the tower - one during the day mid week and we were pleasantly surprised that we didn't have to queue very long for either the cable car or the lift to the top. But when we returned with our daughter to do a night time trip on a Saturday it was another story and we had a long wait for the cable car of about hour and twenty and then there was going to be another hour for the lift to the top. You get a good view from half way so we didn't bother queuing. It was very busy and we didn't bother eating up there either a good trip though and worth making .
Touristy,"Perhaps it was because I went during the chuseok holidays... It was mad crowded. Waited one hour to get up and another hour to get down. If you're asked to wait, head over to the N Burger. Unfortunately when I went late at night, the Burger was all sold out so I had chicken tenders instead. Pretty decent. Entrance fee is 10,000won for adult. But you can also get it on KLOOK which is about 20% cheaper. Enter ""QL2E9"" when you check out to enjoy $4 off. "
Worth the visit,So this is a touristy spot but well worth the time to visit just for the amazing views of the city. Saw this as part of a tour but would go to see it on its own.
worth to hike!,I went there as a tour leader and brought all my guests there! it was pretty cool when u come to Korea around april because the path to go to the N seoul tower got so many trees and some flowers are blooming. look like a cherry blossom! but seriously it wont be cool if u come in summer coz it will make u double sweating :P
This tower is Middle of SEOUL,"Nice place for tour in SEOUL. Tower has different color depend on air conditions. Green, blue, yellow, red....etc"
Prepare for a good workout on your legs,"Personally I went at night, the weather was quite cold (October) at first but after walking up so many stairs, I don't feel the cold anymore. Prepare water as there are less water dispenser. Also there are not much place for visitors to rest while walking up the stairs, so brace yourself! It was also crowded when we were there, and we saw a very long line for those who are taking the cable car. But it has many stunning view and quite a number of observation areas we can enjoy while we are on our way to the top. The place with the love locks are beautiful but full of trash, so clean up after yourself after eating there. Wear comfortable shoes as you will climb alot of steep and uneven stairs."
Nice view of the city,Not too far from the city is the observation tower. Steep walk to get to the area from the bus. Elevator takes less than a minute to the top thou long lines going up and down.
Glute workout,"We decided to walk up to the tower. It was beautiful but wayyy too hot in the middle of June. Tons of stairs with barely any place to rest. When we got on top of the tower, we were soaking in sweat! The tower and view is breathtaking. Keep in mind the heat and stairs if you opt to climb up the mountain. Great gift shops here."
Very Nice View,"We went to the N Seoul Tower in October. The line to enter and to buy your ticket is about 90 min, very long line. when you are in the line waiting, along the way you will find some people selling stuff like food and drinks which I think is a very good idea. when you get to the ticket centre the staff there speak English.And the way up is by elevator, before you go on the elevator they show you a short clip but they keep replaying the clip so it becomes boring. when you go up in the elevator when you come out of the elevator,the view comes and there is a candy shop on your right but tits really expensive. overall the view is nice but there isn't much to do other than take pictures. I recommend you going to the N Seoul Tower if you have never been to it, or Korea itself!"
Lots of stairs,We decided to walk from Naman Gardens. A load of steps but plenty of seats along the way. It was a little busy while we were there so we divided not to go up to the top of the tower. There is plenty of observation areas around the bottom that offers excellent views. Lots of shops to eat. Gift shops as well. Good restrooms. 
No need for observatory tower,"It was a good place providing a really good view of Seoul however we feel their observatory tower is a little underwhelming. It feels a bit stuffy inside especially when there's too many people and for the price you'll see almost the same view from their cafe below. The grounds of the N Seoul Tower though is really worth the visit. There was a ramen place that we loved, some shops for souvenirs, large grounds to wander around, a place for ""love locks"" and scheduled shows that feature traditional and historical culture. The cable car ride to and from N Seoul Tower is also a good way to see amazing views around the area. But be warned, lines get really long so be prepared to wait a while. "
Small Tower Great Views,This tower is not very prominent in Seoul's skyline because of its small size. The actual experience was much better than expected because it makes up for this in views. It seemed like I could even see N. Korea from here. Be prepared for lots and lots of steps if you decide to walk. There are meal/ticket packages that make dining much more reasonable. Be sure to see the free cultural performance outside if you can.
Nseoul tower experience,It was fun riding the Namsan Tour bus to see one of Seoul's tourist attraction. It was an amazing experience. Don't miss to see the mesmerising view of Nseoul tower when you're in Seoul. #NseoulTower #Ktravel
Worth visiting this cities icon! ,Gondola ride to the top is the quickest way to visit the tower. The view from the top gives a great panoramic from the top. It was surprisingly to discover all the love locks at the top! Korea is a city of lovers.❤️ 
Not worth it,"Not too bad of a view up there but we realize without paying for the observatory deck, the deck below where all the locks are, do have a nice view. The wait to head up was crazy. We were told to come back 2 hours later. But thank god we bought a package with the sensory experience and could head up the observatory right after. Heading up to this place was quite a chore. We had to wait an hour or so for the bus to travel up and down. Heard that the waiting time for cable car was worse. The frequency of the buses were slow. Would suggest them to have a shuttle bus specially dedicated for visitors even if it means charging, rather than having to take a public bus and to impose on their locals who merely want to take a bus from one point to another. Actually another good place to see the view of Seoul would be Seoul Sky Tower that is newly opened and more accessible. "
"The Best views of Seoul, In Seoul`","our first night in Seoul, we discovered that our hotel was about a 5 minute walk from the cable car lift to the tower. We headed out to it and discovered a pleasant surprise in the little incline elevator car that took you from street level to the cable car station. Once at the tower, we discovered that there were a lot of school children in groups, at the tower. The wait for the elevator was about 15 minutes. The children were noisy and excited, but not rude or disruptive. Once at the observation deck, the 360 degree views of Seoul at night were impressive, One complaint I do have is that the gift shop, and snack bar, located in the center, have such bright lights that the glare off the windows made night photography very difficult. After touring both levels of the observation deck, the line for the down elevator was quite long, so we had coffee at the coffee bar until the line got smaller. I should mention that there was no wait for the cable car, either going up or down."
Romantic,"The tower features the highest toilet in Seoul where you can take a photo while doing your business. Remember to buy your own lock and permanent market for the lock bridge. It will definitely be cheaper than buying from their shop that sells them at 8,000 won and above. Buy the popcorn package with the tickets to the Observatory Deck. In the floors below the Observatory Deck, there's plenty of restaurants and entertainment such as arcade and a 3D viewing. Highly recommended to take the cable car up and down."
Not worth the wait,The 5 hours of waiting in lines was definitely not worth the wait. Better to use your time seeing other sights. 
Great view over Seoul,"Great opportunity to take in the scale, size and layout of Seoul. On a clear day it offers amazing views. Lots of shops, restaurants and souvenir stores at the site."
Past its prime ,10 years ago it would have been a great place to visit. Now it's nice but not breathtaking. Nowhere near the highest in korea anymore.Can get here by walking or cable car or bus. All ok options. The queue to the top is ridiculous do don't bother. 
Scenic view of Seoul from N. Tower,"We went there on 4/10/17. We walked from our hotel to Cable Car and it took around 15minutes.We reached Nansam Tower around 2.40pm. I had bought ticket online,so no need to que to purchase ticket for Observation. Just show our online ticket to Information counter & they issue entrance ticket for us.We just took the Observation & Hello Kitty Island package.We spend around 3 - 4 hours there. "
Beautiful views at night,Was a lot of lines and crowded. But very nice views! Is obviously a great place for couples and people getting engaged. The hello kitty island and the ssentoy were a little over rated. I wouldn't pay to go back in them. 
Namsan tower,We went to Namsan tower during a busy holiday and it showed. It was a fun observation area to see fun views of the city. However I didn’t like that when we asked to walk down stairs they said no it’s unsafe and made me really uneasy about where I was. Really high with no way to get down if something happened I imagine this is untrue but golly it sure was unnerving. For the most part the tower was fun for views and I recommend going at sunset that seems to be a busy time but a prettier time too. 
Romantic,Had anniversary dinner in the restaurant in the tower. Very nice food and view from the top is amazing. Bring you padlock and just like tourist lock it on the fence.
Not so senior citizen friendly,I went with my family to show them the birds-view of Seoul. Too bad cos it was difficult for them to walk up the steep slopes. They should have allowed cars with passengers who are senior citizens to go up atleast near the elevators so they can enjoy the view as well. 
N Seoul Tower at Night,"The place is lovely at night, with the lights of the tower on and getting a nice view of Seoul from the tower. There are shops and restaurants at the Tower Plaza such as Starbucks and Gong Cha. "
It sucks,"Do you want to waste your time waiting for a single lift up, then a single lift back down?Do you like to queue/wait for hours on end?Then N Seoul Tower is for you!I've included a photo of the line for the lift to the bottom floor, what you don't see if that it wraps around the whole building twice.Don't bother coming up to the observatory, you'll just get back to the bottom annoyed and frustrated."
The surroundings of the Seoul tower,"The best way to get there is to take a cable car up and wall down. On the top of Nansam Mt. There is a small park area and the Seoul Tower. You can buy a separate ticket to the tower restaurants. The 360 view is already perfect to different directions of the huge City. Restaurants, cafes, shops...."
Great look after 10 years,"It was a great experience going up the N Tower this time in a car instead of the cable car. It was certainly a different view. As I recall 10 years ago the inside of the tower is slightly different to what it is today. For example 10 years back there was no LED tunnel at the entrance. The entrance is unique the tunnel is made of LED panel that plays 3 different videos. It started with Seoul City, universe or nebula and followed by marine lives. All different video gives one different feeling as you walk through it. My favorite so far is the marine life video."
Nice view of Seoul,"We visited during the cold season, so it was freezing up there. I've been here twice, but we only did the locks once. Tip: Bring your own locks, much cheaper. :)"
Stunning Night scenes,The tower is worth visiting both during daytime and at night. The red leaves in Oct/Nov make it a good photo spot while the night scenes are also great. You.can find the lock chains for lovers along the railings of the foot paths. We enjoyed every minute of our visit there and had wonderful buffet dinner with great evening views. It was difficult to get a taxi back to the city centre from the cable car station but you can always walk down to Myeongdong. It took about 20 minute. Quite a nice walk too after a heavy meal.
Not worth it ,The view is kind of nice but is not worth it There is only one trolley to go up and the wait was one hour so we hiked up. The home was not bad 30min approx Then when you arrive to the tower you buy a ticket 10k won and have to wait for your turn to go up Once you are up and enjoy the view for top 30 min then there is another massive like (40-50min) yo go down. So lots of lines 
Lock it Up!,"Came here for the view and to add a lock to the collection. To take the lift will cost around $8.00usd per person. Locks cost around $10usd. Throw in a drink or snack and your total cost will be around $30usd. If you want you can also walk up to the top and will take you around 30 minutes. But it is very humid outside. So you might be covered in sweat when you reach the top. Looks like I will be back in 10 years to retrieve my ""lock"".Tips:Bring water. You might want to buy your own lock and print on it before coming to the tower."
Free popcorn and a fun lift,"We walked up the hill to Seoul tower, which we would really recommend. The walk was lovely and we stopped for the view all the way up :) When we got to the top we thought we may as well visit the tower for an even higher view, and we weren’t disappointed. We managed to get a deal for two people, two drinks and a massive popcorn for virtually the same price as two standard tickets, which was a win. We loved going up in the lift to the top - no queue when we were there and the video was great.We watched the sunset from the top so got the day / sunset / night view. We have visited a lot of similar towers and viewing points from around the world and we did really enjoy this one. Good value to money and a great walk if you start from the very bottom."
Great view of the city and a nice hike up if you can manage,"Ended up going for a morning jog up this hill to see the top. While I only recommend this if you are fit (the incline isn't forgiving), it was well worth the effort. The view from the top of this hill allows you to see most of Seoul. There are a few places to eat and if you're lucky, you'll even get to enjoy some live entertainment near the temple at the top. The tower is not too expensive and affords you a birds eye view of a massive city.There are a few other things to see at the top of this hill, to include the lock bridge, where young couples proclaim their love for one another with padlocks hanging from the railings. And of course, there is the gondola lift that will take you to the top and back for a very reasonable rate. I'd recommend doing this at night, as it not only shows you the entire city, but adds a bit of ""ahh"" to the ride, since you are unable to see the tree line swooping past you.Overall, this was a nice little tourist spot in Seoul and worth visiting. There are many methods to get to the top and if you have the time, it is worth exploring all the areas around the top, as you'll see some great sights."
Ok,Nothing special there when you already went to lotsa tower from different countries. May be a great experience for 1st time traveller.
maybe it's just for couples,no special design. You should go at night just to see the view of the entire Seoul. That's it. Nothing's special. 
It has a nice view,"Tower is nice, it is a small size copy of the CN tower in Toronto. You can have a great view of the city but that's all. Go if you have spare time otherwise you dont miss anything."
Skip the Line and Walk to the Tower ,"It's worth the view at the top of the tower to really get a feel for how big Seoul is - bring your nice camera to get some pretty amazing shots from the top. Also, If possible, walk up to the tower and don't wait for the gondola - the line can be ridiculous. We waited for over an hour to get on the gondola to get to the tower due to the humidity. You buy the ticket up at the front before getting a good look at the line."
One of the coolest things to do in Seoul,"This was our 3rd trip to Seoul and we finally made it to the tower. We rode the cable car to the top at night. Nothing special there. The views of Seoul from the tower were very cool and the city lights very beautiful. We hiked down and that was very fun. If you hike down, make sure you have decent shoes and can walk well. Not a place for high heels.Some thought this was the coolest thing we did in Seoul."
It was Cold,"I went there on 21st September, it was windy and cold, I love the weather. But it was foggy too, the view is not clear, we could not enjoy the view that much. I like the souvenir shop and mini mart there, the service received from staffs were so good!"
Long Wait but Stunning View,"Stunning night view from the top but the queue was so long (at 6pm). I would recommend a later visit, perhaps around 9pm if you want to go up the tower to enjoy Seoul's night view to avoid long queues."
Pack your walking shoes,"The walk from the closest station to the cable car is up various hills and some fun stairs, unless you have a pram then it involves more hills. We didn't have a map so relied on signs which along the way we only saw 1 sign for the cable car.You can also walk up to the base of the tower but that wasn't happening with a baby and pram.The cable car going up was packed as it departs every 10 minutes, so best to be one of the first inline so you can pick a corner to stand to enjoy the view going up.Once out of the cable car, there some steep and uneven steps before you get to some viewing platforms, with amazing views out across the city.We didn't bother going up into the tower it's self as there was some traditional performance going on so sat down to watch this instead.Lots of tourists as to be expected, but it's a nice big open space to sit and relax."
Great day out for escaping the busy city,"The tower is quite touristy as expected but great views over the city and a great day out wandering in the park around the tower. Many pathways, very well maintained, clean and beautiful nature."
#1 for a reason,Tremendous views from the top. Well worth a visit! Exit Myeongdong station and walk to your left up a narrow winding hill for about half a km then up a flight of stairs to catch cable car which is 8500 won. Takes just a few mins and the views are great. After this you walk up more stairs and ticket office is to the right for the tower. 
It was okay...,Neat concept but could be better. The lower levels have restaurants but is still being developed. The viewing deck was filled with at least 100 small children on a trip... can't control that. We also went on a cloudy night - the ticket booth warned us before purchase which was nice. The view was really obstructed by the bright lights within the viewing deck. Also seating was limited... which was odd. At least 50% of viewing deck is retail space which made things very crowded. The bathrooms were the best part! If you have time and 10 bucks/ person it's okay. Take the 02 bus there and then start walking up the big hill!
Wonderful views,This tower and location offer great views of this great city of Seoul. A cable car ride up or a good walk make the tower available to all tourists. The tour cost is reasonable and the views and information provided in the tower give you a good insight to this city. The plaza also hosts historical dancers and other events. Well worth the time as views on a clear day go on for miles.
Higestpoint,Very Nice view from thé Namsan Tower in Seoul you must visit resturant när toilet souvenir shop rake the cabelcar to Tower Good ride to see the city
Big Tower,"Not much to do in Seoul, so you can visit a big tower that is bathed in colorful light at night. Nice view from the cable car and from the hill the tower is on."
Tower visit,"The best time to visit the tower is before sunset so you enjoy the day and night view of Seoul, I don't recommend visiting the tower "
Beautiful view of the City,"Go for the view. Enjoy the cultural dances and performances. Very similar to US tourists spots with photos for sale and over priced concessions. Plan to stay sundown, it beautiful. "
stairs stairs stairs. worth the walk:),nice restaurants within N Seoul tower:) must visit. nice weather but i think for summer it will be hot :)
One of the main Seoul attractions,"N Seoul Tower, aka Namsan, is one of the most popular attractions for visitors in Seoul. I've been there several times in the years I've lived in Korea. The best way I've found to get there, is to take the subway to Itaewon then grab a taxi to go up the hill. If you tell the taxi driver, Namsan Tower, they know where that is and may ask you top or bottom. Why? Because from the bottom, you can take a cable car ride to the almost-top and walk the rest of the way. The view from the cable car is pretty nice to see whether you go during the day or night, you get a birds-eye view of Seoul as far as your eyes can see.When you arrive at the almost-top, it's still a bit of a climb going up to the tower. My last visit, I went with my niece and nephew (10, 7 years old). They were fine walking up the stairs to the tower. At the Namsan Tower, you buy tickets for the Tower. There are different prices for additional attractions. When you get inside, you go through a souvenir photo background booth where photographers will take photos of you with a neutral screen background. If you're interested in the photos, you can purchase them upstairs. The digital photos can be mixed with different backgrounds of the Tower: in Spring with cherry blossoms, at night with the lights, during the day, etc. The observation deck at the top of Namsan Tower also has a photo booth where visitors can dress up in traditional Korean clothes- hanbok. It's a little pricey, but fun if you're into that kind of memorable souvenir.Going down: you can either take the cable car back down to where you started or walk down. My niece, nephew and I decided to walk down. That day, it started raining, drizzling, as we were walking. When we got to the bottom, we grabbed a taxi going to Insadong- our next stop."
"N Seoul Tower, Love Locks",We joined a group tour and N Seoul Tower was one of the destinations. The observation deck gives a nice view of the city. This place is also popular because of the love locks area. 
Long-waiting cable car,"Second time to be here. Actually enjoy seeing conservatory tower from far. More than 45mins queuing on ticket office. Inside the cable car, standing all the way in packed limited space, luckily it's short time. "
Amazing !! Romantic ! Must visit,"Visited N Seoul tower twice during my stay at Seoul , once with my girlfriends and another time with my husband. Fell in love with this place. It has got a romantic, fun feel to it. There are two ways of reaching the tower. By car uphill or by a cable car ride of less than 5 mins. On a rainy day its more romantic as you can feel the mist around you. At the entrance there is a ticket counter , then go straight up to the top using an elevator. Just after getting out of the elevator all the guests are directed towards a gallery where they take pictures of all their guests ( dnt forget to giv ur best pose )and later if u want a copy , u can buy it from the top floor. At the top floor one can view the city by using the special telescopes. There are so many pretty souvenir shops . there are many options for coffee and snacks up there. Outside the tower there is an open area specially famous for its colourful locks display. Its a good photo point. Namsan Seoul tower is a must must must visit."
Nice view,"Went for the third time. Couple Love locks are still there. We walked to reach the top, rather than taking the cable car. Nice area for an evening."
Super visit ,123 floorsExiting Fast liftsSky restaurant Good food and and a reasonable menu for a sky restaurant Well organized and good security Enjoyed Photo facility excellent 
Amazing views over the City,"Second visit there. Love the place. Definitely go up by the cable car, it's great fun. The view is awesome. We were lucky to see a weapon handling demonstration which was awesome. You can buy a lock and sign it with your loved one. Food was good - tonkatsu was really good actually! It can get really busy whatever the weather so be ready for it."
Lock your heart here,"Don't wear any highheels here, coz u goin to walk quite far and it's climbing.Lock your heart here as they got the padlock gate. "
Very iconic,"I went to this site by cable car (admission fee 8000₩/person round trip). It open until 8am (we left on 7.30am and cable car still operated).You can just walk around the tower, see the view and there's unique spot: love chain everywhere. Besides, you can enter the tower and go up, but it needs extra fee 10000₩/person. In the tower, you can see Seoul from the sky and you can see sunset. Best spot to take the night scene (light of the city) is in outside the tower (no window).It's modern tourism you can get from Seoul."
A landmark common to most of the main cities,"It seems that every major city around the world has a ""Tower"". It's always a beautiful view of the city from high grounds. The majesty of Seoul could be only seen from Seoul Tower."
Fun like most Towers,"This tower is very similar to tower attactions in most asian countries. The tower gives you a great view, there are gift shops and places to eat in the connecting building, and laces to sit and relax if you need it. One thing that is different is that there are lock and key's on most walls. This place is a place of love. Many couples come here to put a lock on the fence to symbolize their love."
Beautiful Tower and grounds,"We visited during the week, and the tower was overrun with school children on field trips. The view was amazing, and the area around the park was enjoyable. Somehow we missed the tram ride up the hill, but the bus from Insadong took us right to the top. A little pricey, but on a bright day, well worth it/"
Wonderful ,It's a wonderful place with amazing city view. I recommended it strongly to all tourists who visit Seoul. Very nice elevator look like Burj Khalifa in Dubai. The place contain many terraces with nice view. We reached the tower with bus.
N seoul tower,Pad lock lover. Couple will write their wish in the pad lock n lock all the way of the staicase. I had yummy pop corn in the top of namsan tower. Surprisingly the coffee price is still normal price not like other tourist attraction. I love namsan tower.
Nice views up top!,"My wife and I got the return cable car ticket from a friend, so we went to N tower. The cable car journey up the hill was really picturesque. We went up here towards sunset, and the view was just amazing! You could see all the trees and the setting sun while going up the cable car. Once up there, we went to the place where there were the love locks. It was pretty cool. And makes for a nice photo stop. You can place a lock there as well, but you'll have to pay a fee to purchase a lock I think. We didn't do that. But lots of people were doing that. We then continued to the tower. The top was really great, with cafes, restaurants and souvenir shops there. The highlight is the top of the tower where you could just stay and admire the city. Really beautiful, with all the city lights at night. You could even buy snacks and popcorn there. On the way down, the cable car broke down! And everyone was queuing to get refunds. They staff were good and helped to move things along as quickly as possible and we got a refund for not just the trip down, but the whole return ticket price! So it wasn't too bad. I'd recommend it if it's your first time there, but if you're there during winter, be sure to bring enough clothing. It gets quite chilly up there because of the wind!"
Good enough attraction ,"The tower is surrounded by lavish natureSince it's a little old, don't expect hightech featuresThe position on a hill gives it a little edge to have a 360 degrees look on SeoulThere is a nice souvenirs shop on top and a candy shop underneath it"
beautiful...,"both of us take train then take the public bus there to seoul tower at night.realy nice view ...can see the city there...v take a lot of picture there....as v went at night,the light all seems awesome...i just feel like so romantic...so lovely nnnn sweet at this place..thus you must bring your couples there to enjoy this beautiful scene n capture the beautiful scene in korea...visit korea must visit seoul tower..yeah..."
A must place to visit -N Seoul Tower,"We went to Seoul in late August and spent one full day at N Seoul Tower.The Cable Car Station is situated at a very convenient location which is within walking distance from the main shopping street.On arrival , we took a lift to go up to the ""sky-deck"" where we had an excellent bird eye view over the entire beautiful Seoul city.A lot of shops to buy souvenirs and the prices are reasonable with many choices.It is also a very popular place for film site of many Korean Dramas like "" My Love From The Stars"". Also it is a romantic place for lovers to buy their "" love locks"" and locked it over the rail.We went to a local nearby restaurant , next to the main Tower site , where it is famous for fresh food and vegetables -from ""Farm to Table"".It is a buffet type lunch at a very low price , many choices and very local Korean style/taste. A must place for lunch and good value for money.You cannot leave Seoul without going to the N Seoul Tower."
Definitely worth the lines,"The views from the top of the tower are absolutely spectacular. If you take the cable car up you will probably have at least an hour long line. Then when you get to the tower you will have another 30 - 45 minute long line, so take the wait into account when planning your trip. Seeing the view at night with the lights of the city is amazing."
Great view,"We went up the tower in bright sunshine and had perfect view. If the weather is dull, postpone the visit."
Great for first timer tourists to Seoul,"I went with my parents and sister who visited Seoul for the first time. We took direct bus to N tower, the bus was crowded. We didn't walk to the cable car from Myeongdong because of the distance. They enjoyed the cultural performance. My sister had photo with G-Dragon in Kpop photo booth. We went up to the observatory to have a city view. I was disappointed the ticket price has increased to 10000 won, and senior citizens ticket (7000 won) has been removed. Tourists can easily spend half day there taking photo, catching cultural performance, having good meal, playing arcade games (for kids and teens),.... Did i tell you the Teddy bear museum is there? strongly recommended for family. "
nice view,"Nice view of Seoul. the restaurant requires a reservation(I am not 100% sure, I didn't go there) the helps put Seoul into perspective for me always "
Overcrowded and dirty,"This is our second time there in ten years. Namsan tower is not what it used to be. The place is so overcrowded and dirty. The line to ride the cable car is so long and once you get on you can't even enjoy the view because so many people are on that you can't look out. When you're finally at the tower, you can't enjoy the view because of the smog. In addition, the crowd is so immense you can't enjoy it or take pictures. Stay away and spend your time and energy elsewhere. "
Namsan Tower - Highest Place to seeing SEOUL,"I choose to get Namsan Tower by Cable Car, due to my Hotel near Myeongdong then I need to walk from Hotel Pacific area, you need trekking to find Cable Car station, it takes 15 mins then enjoy the view from Cable car, once you arrive, prepare your feet to go upstairs and Finally you find a super beautiful Namsan Tower, enjoy the coolest photo spot, museum teddy bear, don't forget to go the observatory and also shopping cute things a lot. my suggest is buy cable car ticket for return for saving. Happy explore Namsan :)"
Take many beautiful pictures with love locks,The locks are not as beautiful as in the K-Dramas. Buying locks here is quite expensive. About 20000 won.The stairs from the 4th floor to the 3rd floor of the sheep show are quite fun. That is a beautiful shooting location.
Overview of a 25+ mio people city,"After 30+ minutes of pain, from the rather steep stairs (cable car available for lazies), the views from the top are well worth it. As in most other similar places. the top floor is quite crowded, but the floor below offers more or less similar angles and less hustle. Nice videos projected on the ceiling of the elevator during the up or down rides."
Must visit,Must visit this tower because it is the iconic landmark if you come to Seoul. You can view the Seoul city from the above and it is very spectacular!
Seoul landmark ,"They say you have not been to Seoul Korea if you have not visited N Seoul Tower. As part of our tour package, we were allowed to stay and take pictures for 15 mins only. Hope to have stayed longer and checked out the observatory.Must visit. "
Interesting evening out ... with gorgeous view,"We got on a bus at the buss stop in front of namsan Hanok Village and it was as easy and smooth ride up . Or if you want a more scenic or adventure type then head down to myeongdong and catch the cable car up. We stayed about 2hours.. enjoying the view , the breeze and taking in the whole Korean culture or scenes that we normally see in Kdrama or Kvariety show. It would an ideal time to buy and share (or not..=) ) the varieties of snacks, desserts and ice creams ..Since we went in summer it was a perfect time for ice cream and churros .. Yummy!!The famous thing to do here is the love locks , you may purchase the locks at the tower or bring it from home or form your country.. But they do restrict the size of the locks ,.. so even if you have a steering-lock of eternal love , pls follow the rules or your love locks will be open and disposed off.. hahaha .. TIP: If you come in summer, best have some insect repellent sprays for the evening as i was bitten quite a bit by bugs or mosquitoes.. lolz.. Tip: almost everything to do upstairs need $$$ ... besides the view. haha so best to find bargain/coupons/discounts at seoulpass/ klook and a few other websites that offer discounted pricing .. That would be more worth it ..."
Great view of Seoul ,"Must visit this famous N-Seoul tower. Namsan is famous seoul mountain and view is fantastic.Good food, lots of gift places."
Impressive views of the city below,"Seoul Tower is an inexpensive attraction for families and couples. It's a great place to relax and see some of the impressive Seoul skyline from the highest spot in the city. You can take a cable car up to the top for under $10 or make the long hike up on your own. I did not go to the observation tower. It can be busy during the day, so I would advise going in the morning hours or just after 3pm. However, it is one of those places I would only go once. Once you've seen it and have taken all the photos from all the angles, what's the point of going again?"
Worth to go up,"If you like to view from height I would recommend you this attraction. You can go on to ramp with transparent floor and take your picture. The views over the city are beautiful, we did it in night and it was perfect."
Surprisingly Cool at Night,"A friend took us up the hill at night to see this spot. Although we did not go up the tower or ride the cable car, we loved the view from up here. 360 and very very interesting. "
Must to go!!!,"Definitely I recommend the visit to the tower during the evening time. The tower is on the top of a hill, you can get there by cable car (very very long line during the evening and weekend, if possible better to avoid the weekend!!) or by foot, it is a very nice walking of about 30min.I spend 2hours on queue to take the cable car(IT'S NOT A PANORAMIC trip like usual , it takes about 15/20ppl per time and it's just to reach the tower), then if you want to get to the top of the tower you need to buy another ticket (Saturday night another 1hour queue).Anyhow once there is nice cause there are lots of activities to do, take pics to a temple, restaurants, games center, love lockers wall. Going to the top you can take and purchase a cool pics and I recommend the visit :)"
Great view,Very nice view and great relaxing feeling while strolling along hill. You can see distance between districts clearly and elevator ride was quick too.
It's a must in the evening,It is located on the hill in the center of the city and offers a great view on the city which spreads as far as one can see in all directions. If you have time get up there in the late afternoon and wait there until dark. It is worth it.
A waste of money,"We paid the 8500 won each to take the cable car up to the base of the tower at night, by the time we made it to the top it was pouring down with rain so it did kind of damper our excitement. The love locks were nice to look at, I wasn't keen on buying a heart shaped locket to write sweet nothings to my husband.You trek up the stairs more and buy a 10,000won ticket each to go to the observation deck at the top of the tower. I didn't and still don't understand the option to buy a popcorn bucket and coke combo with your ticket. Que and get in the lift. They tell you to look at the ceiling of the lift and you watch a retro 30 second clip of going up the tower and exploding off into out of space and land somewhere. You step out the lift, around the corner and stand in another que for a photo in front of a green screen to which you stand in line again to see your photo with 4 different sceneries with or without the tower in it. You need to pay 12,000won for a photo or more for a framed photo or 2.You can bypass it. Congratulations, your at the top of the tower. Multiple signs of No Photo's Allowed. You can sit on some steps/platforms they have. You can buy some expensive souvenirs and pay by weight a self fill bag of selected candies. The sights are nice, but I personally feel some of the parks around Seoul give you a nicer view without the money grab."
Nothing actually to do there,They used to have a light show on the tower but seems it's not napping anymore and that's the only they had which was cool. But still it's good to go there on sunset and enjoy the Seoul view. And of course for couples it's a very popular destinations to leave a lock there. Lol
Awesome,"I didn't expect this place to be as awesome as it was. Not exactly sure what it was - maybe the views from the toilet? Really from floor to ceiling windows with a view of Seoul while you sit and potty! Soooo cool! Great fun photo opportunities, good snacks and even martial arts displays/shows... but just the breathtaking views from the top - really worth it! "
"Loveky tower, better in the evening! ","Lovely Views from the tower at nighttime or evening, go around 7/8pm when the lights are coming on. It's much more romantic. We hung around for it to get dark which was a good choice to make. Would return :) "
"Day or Night, Incredible View","I was fortunate enough to be staying across the street from the hillside entrance to N Seoul Tower so I took advantage of my proximity and hiked the hillside one morning. The climb isn't easy to dress appropriately but once you've reached the tower the view makes it all worth while. I've been told that the view is hit or miss based on the level of ""yellow dust"" in the city but I was fortunate enough to have a perfect view of the bustling, enormous city below. Take an additional trip at night for a spectacular view."
N tower visit ,we went there and it is good place to see Seoul from the top. It will take not more than one hour tour and you can have a snak there also. 
"Popcorn, Love Locks & a Beautiful View at Dusk.","On the way to the cable car enjoy the walk through the colourful wee area covered in comic themed graffiti. Incredibly vibrant! I wasn't that fussed initially about visiting the tower but my husband suggested we go and so glad we did. We went up early evening and got to the top of the tower just in time for the sunset. We bought the popcorn / drink combo (you can add it on for around 1,000₩ - wee bit more for the drink, but worth it!) The only negative is the glass windows need a bit of a clean! Beautiful 360° views of parts of the city and the mountains.Very romantic!"
"Oh man, is this place beautiful at night or what.","I came here with a friend after a long day of walking through Myeongdong and Namdaemun market to see the tower, and it was really fun. We took the cable car up as a round trip (there is a Namsan park that you can walk through to get down the mountain, but the park is HUGE and dark at night, so be prepared for a trek if you want to do up or down that way rather than taking the cable car). The tower lights up at night (as you can see in the picture) and makes for a great photo-op. Even just being in front of the tower has some incredible views of Seoul; I can only imagine the view from the top of the tower (it costs another 10,000 Won, i.e. ~$10, to go up so my friend and I did not). There's also the famous ""lock area"" where couples write on locks and lock them to the fence all around Namsan, so if you're in a relationship and are into doing that kind of couple-y stuff, either bring a lock with you or buy one at Namsan (I don't know how much they cost, but you can buy them). There are also little cafes at the area in front of Namsan, and a pretty Korean style gazebo which makes for good pictures. There's a little arcade area too where I found some free wi-fi, so that was fun. I would recommend going at night with a friend, I think that would be the most fun. I'm definitely going to go back when I'm in Seoul again and pay to go all the way up. I want to hike through the park to get up next time, however - I actually attempted this while I was still in Seoul a few days ago, and I made the mistake of not using bug spray and wearing shorts. Guys, the park is very jungle-like, so if you don't use long pants and bug spray, you will get EATEN ALIVE by mosquitoes. Don't make the same mistake I did. I was barely walking for 30 minutes before my legs started burning with itch, and I had to sprint down the mountain before I was even halfway up. But the park is gorgeous! If you have the time, I would recommend walking your way up to the tower for sure."
Nice Experience To Go Up - 一個相當不錯的造訪經驗,"We went up with light shower & came down with heavy rain. Even though, we still enjoyed this trip due to few reasons. It was nice to try the walk, elevator train and cable car all the way up & down. The temperature was nice & the views were great. The tower is beautiful and the photo service was nicely designed with very reasonable price. It costs less then 20USD to go round trip cable car & tower lift, which is quite reasonable.我們在小雨中上行卻在傾盆大雨中下來，即便如此，我們還是因為很多原因很喜歡這個行程；上去和下來我們用走的、坐電梯車、也搭乘纜車，首爾塔很美、氣溫很舒服、景觀也都很棒，照相服務算是便宜而且效果很好，一個人不到二十美金就可以坐纜車來回和搭乘首爾塔的快速電梯；真的蠻舒服的一趟造訪。"
A tower that can see Seoul,"The tower is located at the hill top. We chose to go up the hill by cable car. However, the cable car station is located at a place that not convenient for visitors. The tower itself is not tall. The entrance fee is expensive as it does not offer much different from the sightseeing spots at the hill top. The day I visited did not have many visitors and made my visit very comfortable. I do not know if they do not have many visitors every day. There are a lot of restaurants beneath the tower."
"Long queue, nice view","Maybe it was weekend, it was very crowded from cable car to entrance to skydeck. Recommend you to take bus to top hill (bus line 03, 02, 05) instead of waiting in long queue. Entrance to skydeck was through photo zone which is not neccessary and waste time. "
N Seoul Tower,My son and I loved this place. It was fun riding the cable car and hanging around the Tower Park. Lots of free performances and very romantic as well.
Beautiful views from Seoul Tower,Easy to access by subway and then bus-cheaper than guided tour. Exceptional views from all levels. Good facilities.
Romantic place ,I've been to a restaurant on the top of the tower. It was very romantic. N grill on the top has also good atmosphere. I had really good time with my boyfriend. 
A pleasant morning outing,"We walked from Myeongdong station. Go right at the Pacific Hotel road-fork to get to the cable-car station. The cable-car ride was squeezy - with everyone standing, it was hard to get a good view for photo or video. It was misty, so we did not pay to get up to the observatory. The environment was pleasant enough. We had a relaxed bus ride back down to the metro station using our T-money card."
Foggy,It was raining when we went there and it was foggy. Could barely see the city from above. Nice cooling.area during the summer. 
Super Fun for Teens,Our teenage daughters loved visiting the Tower. Lots to see. Take the cable car up to the Tower grounds. It was hot when we went but if cooler you can walk up and down. Lots of places in food court. Great Bubble Tea.
Great view,It's a hike up the hill but the view from the top was fantastic. We went there after a long day of sightseeing and were worn out so the hike up was tiring but worth it. 
Visit night or day.,Nice attraction with great views of the city. See all the locks and relive your favorite Kdrama moment.
Hmmm... not so impressive,"To be honest, I am not a great fan of man-made towers. When we have crystal clear sky, it is a good place to visit to see Seoul. They have lovers' paddle locks there in N tower, I don't like it but... many tourists love it so... well..."
overall view of the city,"Almost every place has its own iconic tower. So this is a must-go if it's your first time to Seoul, just for that ""been there done that"" picture. It's accessible from Myeongdong anyway, so why not?"
A famous romantic overlook,"Unfortunately this overlook is famous as a dating spot in a country rife with couples culture. Expect lots of tourists and couples crowding this area during weekends and evenings. That said, it is a pretty dang decent view if you can peek out from over the crowds and love-lock infested railings. I would certainly recommend to hike up the mountain and arrive just before sunset. You will be tired enough to want to lounge around until the dusk, which gives you the benefit of seeing the city in the daylight, the colors of the sunset, and the lights after dark. There is a cable car you can use to get back down or you can hike it again for another workout."
View of Seoul,"If you want to see Seoul from above this a must. Go in the week, not weekend. There wasn't any queues when we went. "
Can see main area of Seoul,"I visited here on Aug 13 by cable car located in mid point of Mt Nam. You can enjoy night view of Seoul. I recommend you to visit here late afternoon. Cable car cost of adult is 8500 KRW for round trip and 5500 KRW for oneway trip. You can find lots of restaurant, coffe shop, and souvenior shop in the N tower. The nearest subway station of cable car boarding is myuong dong subway station. "
Nice views of the city,"It was our last day in Seoul, and even though it was a cloudy day, we decided to give this a shot We got there early and rode the first tram up and it wasn't crowded. It was a weekday too.Nice views on the tram but you get the same at the top so if the tram has a line, take a taxi or bus or, if you have time and in good shape, you can walk up to the base of the tower. We went to the top of the tower but you could see that a lot of people don't as the view at the base is pretty good. The view from the top of the tower was worth it as you have great views of the city but the clouds kept us from seeing to far in the distance."
Nice view,"This is one of the main landmarks in Seoul, the waiting lines were dredful, line to the cable car, to the elevator ..etc The view to the tower is amazing cuz it's in Namsan park, but to tell the truth it wasn't really that much you can do up there haha"
Great views but expect to pay,"The tower its self is great. We much more enjoyed the 2nd level as it was less crowded and you got a nicer view, the 2nd level also had more information unlike the top that just seems to be about getting kids to ask their parents for lollies. We took the cable car up. They PACK the people in so if you dont rush to a side of the cart you basically cant see anything. The cart ride isnt great so if i was to do it again i would just get the bus up. Once you get to the base of the tower its then more money to get up. I understand they need to pay for everything but it really does feel like a tourist trap. The view was great and Id recommend going at sunset so you can start to see Seoul light up and do its thingWorth going but dont stress if you dont have time"
Spectacular view,"No taxi is allowed for direct access and we took the bus nr. 2 directly out side the hotel. A little climbing act led us to the Tower Square where we bought the entrance tickets for half price after 18:00pm. The lift drive has a quick view of the N Tower from space. Be aware the timing of going back as long queues are awaiting yours. There are impressive breath-taking views on how Seoul survived from the wars! With so many bridges and clusters of tall buildings around, Soul shows her perseverance and determination to sustain growth inside this compact well-knitted localities."
The Love Tower,"I've heared a lot of the ""love-tower"" and had to see it myself. I realized that I'm glad I did. The tower it self was OK. The view was more stunning from the tower in Auckland, but the view was OK. We hang up a lock as everybody else and enjoyed the traditional Korean Guard show. The toilet in the tower had the best view ever. Here you could do number 2 and look over Seoul while doing so!"
Nice View,"This was my second attempt at checking out the tower. The first day it was too much smog so I decided not to go up to the top. At the end of the week I tried again and I was so glad that I did. I used the cable cars to gain access which offered great views. At the end of the cable car ride was a performance area, food bar and more views. Then I purchased a ticket to go up to the tower it was nice with more great views, picture opportunities and a gift shop.  "
Beautiful views but can get crowded,The views from the top of the tower are beautiful but it can get very crowded the you get to the top. The tower itself will be lit up at night and is great for pictures. Its nice to look at from afar.
A paronamic view of city landscape (tall buildings surrounded by large patches of forest trees.,"A paronamic view of the city Seoul landscape (tall building surrounded by large patches of forest trees), consistently seen at 360 degree view from the N Seoul Tower. It is interesting to notice that when we were downtown (city ground level), the surrounding was humid. But as we board the cable car, we begin to see the wide areas of greeneries and felt the whip of fresh cool air (late afternoon). Awesome view, forest trees all across the city of Seoul."
Very Romantic,One of the Icon of Seoul City. N Seoul Tower is very nice place to spend your afternoon especially in Autumn. I would recommend this place for couple because is very romantic.
Just fine,"Nothing really impressed me in SK, this one, in particular, is nothing to be excited about, the same stench in the street surrounding the place, the oils and filthy water from the street vendors kiosks running on the side of the streets is just disgusting."
"Stunning, but typical","The N Seoul Tower, although boasting stunning views of Seoul city, is the typical tourist attraction. I've been to many similar towers around the world, and they are all very similar to each other, with just different views. If you have not been in a tower like this, I would recommend it, however it is nothing special. It contains the usual features to try and coerce you into spending your money such as the group photos, gift shops and overpriced restaurants. The views are amazing though and I would recommend a visit if it is your first time. There is one special feature which are the locks on the fences, which are quite fun to do and look nice. The hike is also quite beautiful and great if you want to enjoy nature and fresh air. The cable car ride is also stunning and you can see amazing views. I would recommend going to the tower during the day time, where the view is clearer, whereas as night only the lights can be seen. I did go during sunset and the ride up the cable car was beautiful, and the views were absolutely amazing. This is dependent on the season, I went in winter, it was quite cold at night, and the bus rides down the mountain were limited. There are a few restaurants there, however I would not recommend them based on my personal experience. I went to the Korean buffet, and the food was not worth the price. The view was nice, however the food was below my expectations, and it was quite pricey as well. Overall I enjoyed my visit to the N Seoul Tower, however I think that one visit is enough."
Tower on hill top,"Seoul Tower in South Korea (Namsan Tower)Seoul Tower, also called Namsan Tower or, more recently, N Seoul Tower, is located in the centre of Seoul on Mount Namsan. Seoul Tower was opened to the public for the first time on the 15th of October 1980. Namsan Tower is 236.7 metres high and, because it stands on Namsan Seoul Towertop of Mount Namsan, it rises to about 480 metres above sea level, thus allowing visitors to enjoy a great panoramic view of Seoul.Seoul Tower was remodelled in 2005 and it opened to the public again on the 9th of December 2005, with the name of N Seoul Tower (N stands for new). The new tower has a new lighting system that makes the tower spectacular at night; new facilities such as restaurants, shops, cafés; a lobby with a media zone where films and music videos are shown for free; two pavilions, one for exhibitions and the other for performances; two observatories, the new digital observatory with new state of the art digital telescopes and the classic analogue observatory; a new revolving western style restaurant called N Grill on the top floor."
FEEL LIKE YOUR IN KOREAN DRAMA,"Very romantic place at the top of the city, best at night. Very cold and its nice to be here if your really fan of korean drama like me. What you see on the drama is true."
Amazing and definitely worth a visit!,"You might have to climb up or drive up but the view is really worth it! It is quite a tourist attraction and is quite busy and of a welcoming atmosphere. I suggest coming near the evening to afternoon as the view is beautiful and the N Seoul Tower will light up which is quite spectacular. It is definitely a great destination to take pictures and just look over Seoul and as well as that, the railings of stairs are chained with beautiful colourful locks that you can purchase (quite expensive though). If you want to purchase a lock and key, I suggest going to the actual store to buy the locks rather than people standing around on the platforms. Other than that, it was definitely worth the experience. As well as that, inside there are restaurants, souvenirs, walls where you can write stuff on, and an arcade which I enjoyed greatly. Definitely worth a visit if you ever go to Seoul!"
Really worth a visit.,"Stunning views or Seoul, specially at sunset when the city lights start to light up. You will have the whole city at your feet."
Definately worth a visit.,Amazing view of the whole of Seoul. With lots of interesting shops/activities on the lower levels. Spent a pleasant morning with teenage family who enjoyed it.
Watch Where You're Going! ,"Like most attractions of this type, the North Seoul Tower is what it is: a tourist trap. That doesn't mean it's not worth seeing. Just be aware that you are there primarily to generate revenue, via ""group"" photo sales, overpriced gift shops and restaurants, etc. Stick to enjoying the views and you'll save a ton of Won. A word to the wise: When heading back down to the bus stop, make sure you take the correct path! Otherwise, like us, you could end up unwittingly hiking down the full length of the WRONG side of the mountain! If that happens, just buy a tramway ticket(s), ride back up to the base of the Tower, and try again. (Bet you won't make the same mistake twice!)"
Worth a visit especially in the evening,It's a tower which gives amazing panoramic views of Seoul city!! Especially in the evening. Half way up it has its own lovelock platform. Souvenirs usually are a tad on the costlier side but the views are breathtaking. Worth a visit for anyone who is visiting Seoul!!
Best view of Seoul: Stay from when the sunsets to Night to get the best experience,"The N Seoul Tower is about a 10 minute walk from Myeong Dong's busy streets. Its really easy to get there and there are many ways to get to the tower, bus, taxi, private car, cable car or by walking. We purchased a round trip ticket (8500 won) to take the cable car. However, I would RECOMMEND PURCHASING A SINGLE TRIP (6500) and walk down, you can see the amazing views of seoul as you make your way down plus it is relatively easy to walk down with the cool wind keeping you nice and cool. Really peaceful! -There are quite a few restaurants and cafes at the base of the tower, which are reasonably priced. -There are souvenir shops and an Olive Young (beauty store). -We didn't go up to the tower but stayed at the base of the tower to admire the views, the views were nice enough at the base. -If you are a couple, go to the Love tunnel. -Stay from 7pm to 9pm to see the sun set and the city night lights. -If you are with friends and family: battle it out at the game arcade (1000 won per game!)"
Beautiful view,"This was a beautiful view and it is in a lovely area. We went at sunset on Tuesday and it was crazy busy. We spent a lot of time in line and a lot of time walking, up hills and up stairs. There is an elevator to the observatory and we took the cable car up, as well. Still a lot of walking."
Cool views at night!,"I was a bit nervous taking the cable car to the tower, but I really enjoyed it & I would to it again. I visited the tower at night, lots of nice things around the foot of the tower - shops, food, bars, and artwork. The view at night was very good, would like to have done it during the day too. It's cheap to go up the tower and it was worth doing. "
Tower with a view,"N Seoul Tower is not very tall in comparison to other towers but the attraction was very worthwhile. Admission is about 8500 won (approx 8 USD) which includes a cable car ride to the tower base offering great city views. Try going near sundown to get a clear view of the city, sunset and city lights. The colorful love locks are a great attraction gimmick. Great for couples."
Nice view at night,"Nice view you shoul try the cable car and the escalator its nice experience. Try to send postcard to your country from here, the postcard arrived 2 weeks after i sent it. The view at night was great we can see fireworks from there. "
"great view of Seoul, go to the restaurant so you don't have to pay","I used to go here often when I had visitors. They charge to go up there, but if you eat at one of the restaurants, you don't have to pay for the ticket. The food is relatively expensive, around $40 per head, but the restaurant food is really good and well worth it. You can choose where to eat and what you like. Definitely worth going. It gets busy during the weekend, so better to avoid then. "
Nice view of Seoul,Visited with friends the Tower of Seoul which is in the centre of the city. You have a nice 360 degree view and a nice visit.
Some lovely views,"A nice place and well worth visiting with your loved one. There is a big focus on celebrating love.Quite a boring walk up and down, well worth getting the bus."
Top of Seoul ,We walked up a little way in the park to get to Seoul Tower. What is great about the tower is that you do not have to go to the top to see the view as it is on top of a high point! The base is great as it has lots of platforms on many levels which all have free access and provide great views of the city! The love locks all over it are very cute and colourful! If you do want to go to the top it is also reasonably priced. Recommend a visit!
Above it all,Loved this visit. It was fairly clear day to see as far as one can. Loved the Korean cultural performances of dances and martial arts. Spectacular. Took lots of photos. 
Picturesque ,"Main attraction is the Observation deck offering an astonishing 360 degree panoramic view over the city. That why it is so popular with the locals and visitors. Although its touristy, it is still one of the must see when in Seoul. There is also a spacious wooden deck on top of the N Plaza whose exotic atmosphere makes it very popular with lovers. The Locks of Love attraction where thousands of padlocks attached to the fence by romantics Seoulites and visitors symbolizing their undying love and affection. There are numerous restaurants in the plaza. There is an entrance fee to go up the observation deck, but it is free to enjoy the rest of the attractions in the park. "
Nice to place to see Seoul from the top!,"It was easy to get there by bus (thanks to T-Mobile and mobile Google Maps). Once there, you can quickly get tickets to reach the top of the tower (I was there on a Monday morning and the place was not crowded).You can get there by a cable car (other ticket to pay) but I chose to get down by this cable car instead of getting a bus again.There are some places to eat there. The place is also very wooded as several parts of Seoul (congratulations to you, Koreans).Nice trip to see Seoul from the top!"
View of Seoul,"We spent almost three hours in this place. It's an amazing view of Seoul, 360 degrees. Some good restaurants and coffee shops at the base of the tower. We were surprised to find the Love Locks in an area when you get off the Sky Lift. It's amazing to see the 100 of thousands of Locks place on the railings in the area. I was told it's better to go up there at night to view the lights around the city, but we enjoyed our afternoon visit."
View was okay,The view was okay. You can take a cable car up to the tower or you can walk it up the hill. There are better things to do than getting up on the tower.
Worth a visit to gain perspective of the city of Seoul,The cable car ride up to the tower is enjoyable. Seoul is not an attractive city so views aren't spectacular but worth going up the tower to look out over this enormous city. We had a very clear day with good views to the mountains. The area at the top near the tower is quite pleasant also.
Not amazing but OK,We've been in many towers around the globe and this one probably excited us the least.Though you can have a good view of the city and maybe the sunset timing in a clear sky day would make it much better.There is a free shuttle bus which can bring you there from the nearest subway station to avoid climbing the hill walking. Ask your hotel for information.The cable car cost 8500 and the tower ticket another 10000. Almost 20 USD/pers - maybe a bit too much...Enjoy!
Love it,"I walked up to the cable car station from my hostel. I visited N Seoul Tower in the evening, very nice view. I enjoyed my time here."
Beautiful Night in the City,"This review is for a visit made to Namsan Tower in May17.N Seoul Tower, also known as Namsan Tower, has been featured in many Korean dramas. It is famous for being the 'go to' place with your partner to place a lock on the available fixtures, thereby 'locking' your love for each other. My partner and I decided to make a trip up on a weekday night. From our hotel in Myeongdong, we walked to the cable car station and boarded the cable car that took us to Namsan Tower. At times, the cable car can be pretty filled up as the ushers try to pack in as many visitors as possible at once. That said, the short journey makes it bearable. The area was not very crowded while we were there and hence, we could really enjoy what the place had to offer. The atmosphere was great and the air was cold and crisp. We ended up taking a leisurely night stroll around the area, browsing in the gift shops, immersing ourselves in the beautiful scenery and of course, doing the love lock thingy! Overall, a very great first experience at Namsan Tower and I would recommend that those who have not been there before to visit at least once just for the experience. Not sure if it makes a difference whether you visit in the day or night but night time certainly seems to bring out the magic!"
Great view area,"The observation deck is absolute amazing. Not only it's the tallest point in Seoul, it has beautiful unobstructed view. It's pure and fantastic. If you come to Seoul, definitely need to come here. "
Love locks and observatory at Namsan Tower!,"A typical tourist spot but definitely a must-see! Loved the love locks and the views from the observatory deck. We took the cable car to the tower because we had hiked enough during our visit to South Korea. The lovely colorful locks were everywhere! I spent some time reading the messages on the locks and then headed to the base, where we were pleasantly surprised to see traditional korean dances and martial arts being performed. We were thrilled to be able to catch some of that and then headed down via the cable car and straight to Myeongdong for more shopping. Enjoyed our pleasant eventful day at Namsan Tower!"
What do you expect? It is a tower.,"I've known a lot of couples who visited here just to do the ""locks"" --also, if you have children make sure you take locks.The tower is a tower. Many people, including myself, dreaded visiting here because it is such a tourist hot spot. Sure, ride a cable car! Ahhhhh - what fun~ Sarcasm aside, if you're a romantic then go take your picture beside your locks that you attach to a fence or structure and have a great memory and upload your pics on social media to prove your love.I guess if you're in the area do it. If you're a tourist do it just to tell people you did it. If you're in Seoul for only a few days then I suggest you make unique memories elsewhere.The area around has a bit of nature but some days are jam packed with busloads of tourists. "
Perfect view of Seoul at night....,"On a clear night, a fantastic view of one of the most vibrant cities of the world..... plenty of gastro choices and ways to get up to the mount."
TOWER VISIT,"quick visit of tower on May/2017.well organized and good facilities available , i walked all the way to top of the hill , there was a long queue at cable car station due to weekend but my plan was walking even before i arrived to station .would like to suggest visitor to go there but not on weekends !"
Beautiful scenery,Affordable tickets to view all of Seoul from the tower.The souvenirs sold inside are also affordable.Went there during the day.Will try going during the night next time.
Didn't enjoy it. It was a foggy night,"The tower was quite high and one can see the view of Hanyang River. However I didn't enjoy it was it was foggy that evening. Perhaps it was due to post-rain. Maybe if it was sunny, it would have been a better experience"
Seoul Symbol,"A must if you are in seoul coz this is the symbol of seoul, just search for the internet on how to get here and be ready to walk uphill. you can also find here the famous love locks"
Nice view,"There is a shuttle bus to the cable car station. You can wait at the exit 3 Myeongdong station, but this time I chose to walk up to the hill :) Namsan tower area also have many photo spots area,, also a lot of restaurant available."
Sunning views of Seoul!,We rode the cable car going to N Seoul Tower. it was an amazing experience because of the stunning views of the city! There are thousands of love locks that sorrounded the place. The place with all the love locks! N Seoul tower is one of the important landmarks of Seoul. This iconic tower is a frequented tourist spot nowadays. A must visit!
Great views of the city,Very easy to get to the tower. The peak has some great views of the city. Other than that not much else to do.
"Like all towers in the world, it's a tourist trap and overpriced.","It's a tower.....that says it all. Overpriced and touristy. A plus is that it is situated in a lovely park that has beautiful views of the city, so you don't have to go in the tower. The aerial tram ride is horrendous because they treat visitors like cattle, we were literally pushed against the windows in the smoldering heat....To be fair, when your at the top of the tower you have beautiful views of the city."
Beuatiful at night.,I was there late in the evening or early night. Very pleasant and beautiful view over Seoul. The tower is beautifully lit Korean style and I love it.
Beautiful,"This is the first place i go when i arrive in Seoul. Beautiful at night. Went up the tower, nothing much up there, only for the city night view. Took the cable car to go up the hills as we are short of time. There's a free shuttle bus to get to the cable car entrance but you need to ask first as they on write ""shuttle bus"" on the bus and we got the bus by coincidence."
Weather,"We went up to N Seoul Tower by bus. It was a rainy day and there were mist all over Seoul, so we didn't go all the way up in the tower. But the view was til great. If we had more time in Seoul we would have went up there on a sunny day og clear night."
Very Through and fun,"Second day in Seoul and we decided to go to the Seoul tower to check it out. Best and fastest way to get there would be by taking the cable car (unless you want to do a steep hike). The cable car station is pretty high up, so you have to go pretty uphill. However google maps tells you to go is alright, but if you're not in a rush, there is a slanted elevator you can take. The elevator entry is on Sogong-ro road across from a Cafe that starts with a ""M"" (I can't quite remember the name). Fast forward to the part where we arrive on the other side of the mountain where the Seoul tower is located, you have to climb quite some stairs. There is a long wall of colorful locks, that you can buy there or bring yourself. The wall is long colorful. Once you walk a little farther, there is a little patio where it is a great spot to take a picture. You probably will have an issue getting the whole photo of the tower, so if you have an iPhone, you can do a panorama up and down. Around the Seoul tower there are many cafes and a few restaurants. If you buy tickets to go up the tower, the view is breathtaking! On your way out, you will have to take a flight of stairs to the floor below the watch deck. There is a beautiful bathroom there that has the view of Seoul in the stalls. While you are doing your business, you can also see the big city at the same time. Overall, I enjoyed the attraction, and highly recommend that you go too!!"
Night view,"N tower has a great night view when you go up by cable car, the cable car kinda shaky at first but I think it is safe. There are lot of attractions too.(teddy bear museum and marvel museum).Please check on my vlog for more information (EN CHANNEL): search by title#4 TRAVEL BLOG DAY 3 JEJU - SEOUL - NAMSAN TOWER"
Overlooking and cool place,"I've been to Namsam twice. You can go up there by walking or cablecar. Going up to cable car just cross the street across Sejong Hotel and beside exit 3 of Myeondong Station you can find in the corner the 7 eleven store, check the road and there is arrow sign with the namsan tower drawing, follow it going up. Cable car will open at 10 am and it costs SKW 8,000 per pax round trip. If you want to go up to Observatory it will cost SKW10,000 but for me theres not much see in the observatory. Taking pictures at the ground floor is much fun."
Birdseye view of seoul,Not a must see but this tower certainly has a great view of Seoul and is especially worth a visit close to sunset to see the many lights of the super-city Seoul come on. It can get pretty crowded up the top!
A must visit!,Going up here was memorable as we literally walked up the hill to get here. My friend bought the package tickets with popcorn and drink and it was worth it. The view of the city is stunning!! 
A number of free tickets for this entry....,"I did not go there, but noted that several duty free shops were giving out its entry tickets as gifts for purchases. So for those that would shop at duty free shops, just take the chance to get the free tickets then. Enjoy!!"
Good tourist spot,little far from central. seoul tower is a good tourist spot. surrounded with greenery and beautiful view. it is one of the must visit places in seoul. you can visit this place in city tour bus or a taxi which is not cheap in seoul. 1-2 hours are enough for this spot.overall worth a visit.
Must see for tourist,Catch the bus near myeongdong station which goes all the way to the tower. A bit of hilly walking is still required. We did not pay to go inside since the attractions outside itself are enough. There are number of floors to visit which are free. Outside they allow free hanbok trial. THere is also a show.
Ability to see a huge city,"I really like this place. Me and my friend didn't take a cableway, we walked the way up. It was in late August, very hot weather during the day, but it was worth in the huge queue. If you like walking, you can do it. It's really nice way up with super clean toilets and nice views. Up, we bought tickets, waited something around 30-40 minutes (you can take pictures etc..no big deal) and then went up by escalator. The view on the city is breathtaking, I really recommend. We had a nice weather, so we saw longer distance (choose to go there where there is a nice weather). There is a space to take pictures... And the last recommendation. Use the bathroom. The view from toilets is one of the best, I have ever had from that type of place :). "
Watch the city light up!,"What a fun place to visit! Arrived before sunset , was first in the queue to take the chairlift to the summit. Lots to explore at the top including the millions of colourful locks on long stretches of walls and also shaped into tall cone structures. I was almost the only tourist amongst the crowds of Koreans who clearly love this destination. A number of viewing platforms give the perfect vantage point to watch the dazzling display of city lights that turn on at dusk. Hint- taxis in Korean were very reasonable and many waiting outside so got a taxi back to my hotel taking only a few miniutes. "
A loo with a view :D,"Well, would it be very weird to say that highlight of my visit was toilet trip?)The thing is that there are cabins with panoramic view there and I bet you gonna take couple of pictures while there.Apart from that N Tower is the highest city viewing deck and I guess that in sunny weather view is awesome. On my visit day it was a bit foggy.Cable cars were closed that day so I had to get there by bus and on the way back I had to wait for ages to get back to the city. That was the only downside.The park around tower is nice as well."
One of the beautiful landmarks in seoul,Dont forget to ride the cable car when going up. Your camera and of course your special someone. Its where love birds can have a date hehe
Good place for Seoul city view,"Suggest to visit during evening time and you can have a good view of Seoul city as well as the sunset. Night time might be a little crowded. Take a short cable car ride to reach the bottom of Seoul tower where you can find an observatory deck, some cafes and restaurants."
Viewing tower located up in the hill,"You can come to N Seoul Tower either by cable car or bus, better still to try both. We took cable car on the way there and took bus on the way back to town. Very nice view from the tower top and the cool weather is another plus point."
Fun,"Exciting, entry to the top is expensive but worth it. Area before tower has a lot of viewing spaces and refreshments."
Disappointing (Too Be Fair It was Raining),"I had read that the activities around the tower were fun, so we went up to the tower even though it was raining and overcast. Maybe the activities would be fun for a small child, but I was not entertained. The toy museum and the hello kitty museum just looked kind of pathetic from the outside, so we didn't pay to go in those. The arcade was sad, mostly claw machines (we had already experienced a claw machine arcade and lost several thousand won because the claw jolts too much)."
Average,"When on in the tower, windows were quite dirty so we didn't really get a good view. The outdoor view was definitely much better. There are many restaurants but my favourite was definitely the fried chicken restaurant(really good and spicy)! "
Nice View,"Namsan Tower has nice view because you can see beautiful cities Seoul city on top of Namsan Tower. I prefer to go at night than noon, the reason why when you go at night you can see a beautiful lights. And if we purchase with MasterCard, we can get a 15% discount."
Loved the view from the top,One of the must-do-things when visiting Seoul. The view from the top of the tower was beautiful. Tickets can be purchased from various websites online which are generally cheaper than buying on the spot.
Nice view,Nice aerial view of Seoul. The easiest way to get there is on the Hop On Hop Off bus. But it's dufficult for PWDs and senior citizens to climb the steep slope 
Healthy tourist spot..,Because involving walking uphill a bit to get there..quite sweating eventhough its autumn hehe..the view from tower and love padlock thing quite amusing..worth to see..
Bit of a honeymoon trap but great views,Iconic place in middle of Seoul. Ate in Korean restaurant which included trip up to viewing deck Weather didn't cooperate but enjoyed it anyway. Very busy with dating and honeymoon couples - sweet to see. 
Spectacular city view,"Incredible views of city. If you hike up the hill, you will get a major workout! Definitely recommend it to anyone visiting."
All trails lead to the tower,The tower is an icon in Seoul. It also messages air quality to the masses with its color displays. Best part about the tower is the great hiking trails all around. The city wall trail even courses nearby 
Magnificent view ,Easy to combine with visits to Namdeon market and Myeongdong district. The cable car trip was short and enjoyable. The additional ticket up the tower was worth it as you can appreciate the shear expanse of the city and pockets of diversity. Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.
Great!,A pleasant visit. We take the bus to go up and walk down on return. Not many people and we could enjoy the time. If the weather was better would make this visit perfect.
Lovely view!,"The view from the top of N Seoul Tower is amazing and the cable car ride up is also stunning! From Myeongdong station, it's not a long walk to the cable car station, though it is all uphill with a decent set of stairs at the end. There is also a shuttle bus from Myeongdong station to the cable car but we just walked. N Seoul Tower should definitely be done at night, when the tower is lit up and so is all of Seoul. One of the most amazing things about the tower is definitely the bathrooms, make sure you pay them a visit before you head back down! We didn't spent long at the top, it's actually a pretty small area, there is a small gift shop and lolly shop, however the gift shop at the base of the tower has a much better range. "
Absolutely breathtaking,This is one of the stops in the Hop On Hop Off Bus A. It's a long climb up the hill but the view is worth it at the Observation deck. We already tried the N Seoul Burger with fries and drinks and it was actually good to the palate. Love lock is where couples put their names in padlocks along the perimeter walls. Suggest you stay for only an hour or two at the most so one can try the other stops in the bus. 
Expensive Tickets - Beautiful Views,We took the cable car up and then went to the top of the tower. The views were beautiful. Even at the bottom of the tower there are great views of the city so if you don't want to spend the money on tickets it would be worth going to the area. We bought our tickets from Klook which gave a discount. 
"Well built on the mountain, have a number of shops and restaurants, not so high..","Seoul Tower is easily accessible by a few number of buses, we can see the Seoul City all around, however the tower is not so tall, there are a number of restaurants and starbuck coffee to serve you, if you have time, I will recommend you to go.. "
The front ticket office can't speak English well ,I was lost in exchanging my ticket from my discover Seoul passIt was disappointing It was rainy in Seoul but I have to see the place as it says it's a must see I'm a tourist and the locals they can hardly speak English . The ticketing iffice asked me to go down in exchange of ticket the other ones asked me to go up My pass expires and I can't get no ticket but with some rage in my face at least the ticketing office issued me Misunderstanding misleading and nothing special here Rode a cable car for a fee since its slippery and raining 
N Seoul,"I believe it is a most visit place in Seoul .. I love how it is located at top of mountain.. Very beautiful views at the way to Tower very green forest and I saw many people hiking to the tower.. The ticket is not experience and there are many good romantic places that lovers would love to see and leave some memories.. For example writing on walls, Hanging locks.. Also many shop stors that offer beautiful souvenirs but they are expansive.. Also there are areas for children to play "
"Best toilet view, don't be shy","Pulling out your camera and take the best toilet view in Seoul. The sign said you can and encourage you to ( pointing out the windows, of course)"
Extremely gorgeous,"This place was one of the top places that I wanted to visit during my stay in Seoul, and it definitely wasn't a disappointment. As an individual you have the option of taking the bus up the hill or making the hike, but mind you it's a pretty steep and LONG hike. Once at the top there is a fee to go up the tower, but seriously it's only 10 dollars. You should definitely do it! I purchased a lock to put on the famous fence of locks because I'm cheesy like that, but if you're into that kind of stuff it's great for couples. Going to the top of the tower was amazing, but I suggest doing it during the evening to get a few view of Seoul at night, you won't be disappointed. "
Beautiful,"Went with my friends, it was beautiful. Since it rained when we were there, we just bought some ice cream and chilled at one of the covered decks near the restaurants."
Excellent view of Seoul,We booked our Namsan Tower tickets through Trazy.com as it was cheaper than buying on site. We did not have to queue up at the ticket counter and we went up the tower without wasting any time queueing up. The view from the tower at night was breathtaking. There was bus service to the tower from different parts of town. A must visit attraction of Seoul.
Breath Taking Views,"Wow. 88 floors up. Super fast elevators, breath taking views. Even though it was raining on the day we went up the tower it was well worth it."
Great panoramic views of the city,"We walked around 10 minute from Myeongdong station where our hotel was located to the cable car spot. The roundtrip ticket to Seoul tower was W8,000, but the line was a bit long. The views were spectacular at night and there are also lots of cute spots like the tunnel of love and entertainment places. Going up the Seoul tower is also not expensive, but the views are really nice."
"Must Visit, come early... ","A must see for everyone visiting seoul. Hi-Tech elevator! Gives you the feel of ascending up in the sky! Make sure to pose for a nice souvenir picture, you'll have to pay 12,000 won if you like it though. But it's worth it, you'll get to choose different background. The love locks are cute, but gets too crowded, so try to come as early as possible to get a better & clear picture spot! Enjoy! :-)"
Smog,"A good walk to lift, not a good idea if it's a summer's day and humid. We got the single trip up and got the bus back. Good to see traffic when not driving. Unfortunately didn't see to far due to smog . It was still good to see how vast the city is."
Stop in the men's room at the top for the best urinal view! ,"Walked all the way up to the base of the tower through the park (a gondola is also available, but the walk was maybe 40 minutes and some good exercise). Nice views from the top and decent elevator experience, but the Lotte World tower is much better (Though almost triple the price, 27000 won compared to only 10000)."
Best city observatory so far! ,"The observation deck is worth to go! We enjoyed the night view of Seoul City with its complex street lights and beautiful mountains surrounding the city. Some good gimmicks are put on the glass windows, which tells you how far other cities in the world is from the tower. "
amazing view,"amazing view, fun, interesting, pleasant, easy to reach, pleasant walking around, nice souvenir shops"
Put my lock of Love from Hawaii on the fence,"I made sure to bring a Hawaiian charm and a lock with me so I could place it on the fence up at N. Seoul Tower! If you are a Korean Drama fan or on a trip with your loved one, this is a must do activity!!! "
Love Locks and More!,Enjoyed every bit in here. A great place for a photo-op or just chilling at one of the cafes. One of Seoul's landmarks.
First snow,"We went there by cable car, but we only bought one way ticket and we got back by bus. It's recommended to go there because it was very famous especially in korean drama."
Nice but not super impressive,"Our hotel has a shuttle that dropped us off at the cable car so we decided to take that up to the tower. Also because some family members did not wear appropriate shoes... It was earlier in the morning so no line at all. The cable car ride only took about 10 minutes. You're in between trees so the view is just ok. I would have preferred to walk up and recommend it for anyone who is capable and willing.Walking around underneath the tower, there were some areas with ok views. Unfortunately it was a little smoggy that day so you can't see very clearly for long. We got a couple ice cream cones and sat in the back with tables and panoramic glass window looking towards Gangnam. Unfortunately the would be relaxing experience was many times ruined by people dragging chairs across the concrete that creates the most horrific high pitched sound. Given the less than ideal visibility, we didn't pay additional to go up to the top of the tower. I think if the weather was better, especially if you have a clear night, that would have been much nicer."
Good views day or night,"You can visit the N S Tower day or night, there are some great views of the city. There is a metro station at the bottom of the hill but it is a steep walk up, even to get the cable car. It will depend how fit you are. There was a show on during our visit which my husband enjoyed but I found it deafening. There are other viewing towers in Seoul for example the Lotte Tower which is newer and higher but it is more expensive. We didn't go up the Lotte Tower because we had already gone up the N S Tower. My advice would be to choose one tower as to do them all is pricey for a similar view.If there are an Elvis Presley fans reading, There is a small free museum that might be worth 10 minutes of your time. It is run by a husband and wife who are obvious fans. It is at the beginning of the hill on your left going up. Nice Pasta and Pizza, coffee shop on the opposite side of the street. Sorry can't remember the name. There are eating places up in the tower area but they are more expensive."
A 360* View of Seoul,"N Seoul Tower is a must-go-to place when in Seoul. The best time to be there is an hour before sunset. That way, you can see the city daytime and then, transition to nighttime.Be prepared for an uphill walk leading to the cable car and leading to the tower itself. You can get discounts for the cable car when booked online. ."
Go there at night!,"The night view is fabulous. There are several ways to go there. Cable car, buses, taxi, walk! I recomend take buses with a bit of walk to top."
Look out to Beautiful Seoul,"This place is a must when you visit Seoul. The tower can be seen from all over the city. At night it is lit to beatification. In the day it's not as awe inspiring but still a sight for sore eyes. Get to namsan park head towards the cable car and then you're half way up! The park at the bottom of the tower is lovely so if you don't want to go up the tower the park has lots to offer too. Three stages, namsan park, bottom of the tower where you can wander around and eat and choose from a range of restaurants and the final stage the top of the shop! Make sure you head there on a clear day."
Beautiful view from the toilet,"We paid for dinner at Hancock which came with admission to the viewing deck. We were there from 6 and stayed till 8 plus. It allowed us to enjoy both day and night views. The best view of sunset was from the toilet where there was full length glass window to offer wonderful view of Seoul. When we left at night, the tower was beautifully lit and the windy weather made the walk down to the bus area such a joy."
Check out the toilets... ,"Located atop Namsan Hill right in the middle of metropolitan Seoul, the N Seoul Tower is a must-see attraction whenever you are in this city. As with any mighty lofty tower, you can be assured of a breathtaking view all round, but the extent of what you can see is dependent on the weather. Nevertheless, it is still a worthwhile visit as the journey there is an adventure itself - strenuous uphill walking, nervy cable car ride and ear-popping speedy ride up the high-speed lift. Oh, do check out the toilet at the observatory deck, which comes with a view to kill for."
Namsam Tower!,"Visiting N seoul tower was one of the highlights of my trip! - You can jog, walk up the stairs to get to the tower or you can ride the cable car. - We went here at night so seeing the lights of seoul was a good sight to see. - When you get near the N tower, there are different restaurants you can eat in and enjoy the view! There are also stores you can buy different items in. - There are also areas where in you can put ""love locks"".- There are areas you can take pictures where in the ""hallyu"" stars or korean actresses and actors have been in. - There is a mini traditional common area that you can take pictures in- There's a game area, starbucks and alot more interactive parts below the tower.- It's completely free to visit the tower from a view, but if you want more (like go up the tower and eat there...you will have to pay.) :) "
Worth the walk,I decided to walk up and even tho I was lost 1 hour b4 I found the right path I do not regret this site!I walked from my hotel and it was worth the walk. There is lots of stairs up to where the tower is. You can definitely walk. I am not that athletic but it was ok to walk up. I rested few times. There was a place to take pictures half way up....good place to rest your tired legs. Don't forget to bring water!!When I was up there the tower is....i decided NOT to go up on the tower. Bcuz the wiew was so awesome at where I was that the tower it self was not needed. Ofc for those that want to go up to the tower....its worth it I am sure....but I just sat there on til of that mountain...under the tower and watched ppl and the wiew. That was one of my best moments in Seoul...so lovely!I drank coffee at the cafe and the wiew was like a dream!I warmly recommend this experience! I walked down the mountain too....it was much easier to go down 
Great view,Must see this place. You get a great view of the city of Seoul. It's beautiful in the spring as the trees and flowers add a touch of colors to the surrounding and cooler temperature too.
Good for Picture and enjoy the sunset,"We walk from Myeongdong to the Tower, it was little bit tiring, but it was worth for the view on the Seoul tower.We enjoy the sunset and the view, and of course the beautiful night. There's a souvenir shop and few restaurant there. Nice place to visit when u in Seoul."
A must to see if you visited Seoul ,We had our first experiences touching snow here and it's so memorable for us Nice view and a place for couple
Romantic!,"It provides good view of the city. There's a mall inside so you can get some stuff and souvenirs, but a bit pricy. Locks of love is romantic even at day time. We went there by bus which was a good idea than walking since we're not used to long walks and it's uphill. Very tiring! If you plan to put locks there, bring your pen! You have to pay for a pen. We felt shy to borrow. "
Not my cup of tea,"If you are feeling energetic you can walk up to the Tower, if not there's a cable car. The Tower itself is just an excuse to part you from your money with lots of shopping and eating opportunities. The view is probably best at sunset but during the day there's a lot of smog and frankly all there is to see is high rise buildings for miles in all directions."
Prize on top of Namsan Park,"To get to this place you either take a cable car or climb all the way up 1.5 kilometers. This is a tower that can overlook the whole of Seoul. But to access the top you would need an entry fee of about 10,000 won. "
Quite okay,We went in the evening. The observation deck was quite small. Views were quite nice. Public transport can get quite crowded. Toilets have a great view though! :)
Worth a visit,"We walked up to the tower in 20 minutes, it was not as challenging as we originally thought. Once you reach the base of the tower, there are a number of restaurants and shops. The views of Seoul were amazing and it was well worth for a visit.However as the views were so good from the base we decided not to go up the tower."
Good landmark for Seoul,Very good to explore Seoul from the top of the tower. Many restaurants at the tower that you can have dinner with your family in any special occasion.
Great Views !!,The N Seoul Tower is built very recently and gives a fantastic view of the city. I visited the top of the tower at the sunset time and this it would be the best time to visit. The transition of the daylight to night city lights is beautiful.
Great views of Seoul at night,"My wife and I went to the Tower in the evening for 2 reasons - eat at the N Grill restaurant on the top floor and see the views. Luckily we had a sunny evening so we were treated to stunning views of the sunset over Seoul. You are very high up and so the views are amazing. I thought the Observatory Deck was pretty much the only attraction but I was really surprised to see that there is actually quite a bit to see and do there with a lot of shops on each floor. So I recommend you allow for about 2 hours of time there. Getting there is very easy, cable car or a bus. If by bus, take the number 2 bus from Chungmuro Station (outside the cinema) and it takes about 20 minutes to the Tower stop. From there it's a five minute walk uphill to the Tower."
One of the landmarks in seoul,Seoul Namsan tower or N-Seoul tower is one of the popular land mark in Seoul. You can enjoy the whole view of Seoul from the top of the tower. There are traditional program are being held everyday in the evening time. Recommended to visit at good day when the sky is clean. If you want to enjoy the night view visit in evening or night time. You cannot go there by taxi! Take bus form Chungmuro station. 
A brand new namshan tower,Love the new outlook of namshan tower. Fresh air. Love locks expanded. Best place for sunset.Would suggest the route via bus to namshan tower instead of the cable car.
"Go just before sunset to capture both day and night views. Don't need to pay for tower, good city views in free areas",We went to the tower just before sunset so we could capture both day and night views. I have seen this in many k-dramas so it was wonderful to see in person. We decided to take the lift up but didn't realise how long the line was. If you don't mind walking up it may save you some time. The tower is impressive and there are many photo opportunities around. We didn't go up the tower as it was an additional cost and the day we went was foggy hindering good views. We felt it wouldn't add many city views as the free areas had fabulous cityscape views. There are a lot of exhibitions to look at but some are additional costs. The highlight of these exhibition has to be the stunning dresses in the hanbok museum.
Beautiful place for a panaromic view of the city.,"For people who like to write and send out postcards - here's the perfect place to do it. They sell lovely postcards up at the tower and there's a very convenient postbox just for sending out them. It's a great view up there and you'll be able to take beautiful pictures in a fine day. There's also the fence down at the tower for couples to hang their love lockets onto it and take some memorable photos around. Overall, it's a relaxing place to chill out and quite a romantic place for couples to hang out. "
Romantic,"Came here with my boyfriend. During the day it's nice with a lot of vendors and families out walking around eating street food. At night it's more of a date spot with only couples walking around taking photos, writing their initials on love locks and locking them on the bridge, holding hands etc. It's very romantic. "
Nice to go on our first night,"We enjoyed going up to N Tower on our first afternoon. In hindsight, not sure I'd go again. The cable car was OK (after waiting 45mins) & being crammed in. The complex is looking & feeling old. Nice view though, and good place to get your bearings."
Beautiful view of the city,This is a must see attraction. Take the cable car to access it and enjoy the calm even when it is crowded. Vegetation surrounds your path. Soothing
Passable,"It's just a normal observation tower, passable. Nothing really stands out compared to other towers in other big cities. I noticed that there were quite number of shops at the observation deck, selling souvenirs, sweets, popcorn, etc. The area at the bottom of the tower is actually more interesting. There are love locks, cafes, unique shopping area, and empty spaces for performances."
Expensive and not worth the trip ,It is a much better idea to hike to the top and look around the area and then take a bus down again. Do not spend the money getting all the way to the top because there are other ways to see much better views here in Seoul. 
Nice view,There is a nice view also with a cable car.Better if it was sunny. Nice park under the tower so you can walk down
Great Hike/Beautiful View,"This is a great spot, a must-see on your trip to Seoul. The Tower offers the best views of the city, even if you don't pay to go up inside the tower, itself. There are buses and a cable car that will take you mostly to the top of the hill. There are also hiking paths accessible from more than one spot. There is handicapped parking available if you drive, but it isn't exactly clear how to drive up there. Food vendors, Hello Kitty shop and other shops available for souvenirs. And, of course, lots of photos ops. "
Nice path to climb up Namsan Tower ,"Love the view from Namsan Tower, night view definetely the best time to go. I did both day and night. I really recomend night time as it is more calmer and romantic. "
Typical tourist site ,"I am confident that the views are great from the tower, but by just walking around the tower entrance area you can see how it is full of rip offs like expensive museums, sweets, coffee, etc. if that's your thing then do it. I did enjoy the great free views around the park and if the tier itself from the outside though."
Great view with unmotivated staffs,"Went on the cable car ride up to Seoul tower station. Cable car was squeezy full with no space to take a picture. Wonder what's the capacity?Bought a combo for 2 which comes with a popcorn (chose within 4 Flavours) 2 soda drinks. Proceed to the photo taking Station, staff there were rushing through with the crowd. Went up the lift to the observation deck. Deck is reasonably space out with some folks lying on the resting area while waiting for nightfall for the night view. Staffs were talking within themselves and lol probably at their own jokes. Staffs snacking away the candies (Weeny Beeny).Well the view is beautiful, probably the staff needs some motivation to make the tourist to have a more memorable moment.Definitely a great view!!"
N Seoul Tower,"I will said, there is nothing special. Because i was there during day time and you can have some nice view and the weather is cool. "
Not worth the time...,"It was more interesting at the bottom of the tower than the top. Some towers stand out due to architecture, some due to the elevators, some due to the educational value, some due to props inside...Unfortunately, this tower didn't stand out for any positive attributes. It wasn't very educational or special in any way.*Health warning!*: If you have photosensitive epilepsy, DO NOT go to this attraction! There are no warning signs nor does anyone try warn you of anything out of norm. I don't have this condition, but I got really dizzy in the elevator. They turn on really loud thumping music with flashing lights of a fake night sky. I want to say there were mirrors all around to make the elevator feel bigger and it intensified the experience. It felt like a rave party in there and you're trapped until the elevator opens. Due to the discomfort, the ride for me probably felt longer than it really was. In my opinion, the special effects were totally unwarranted. I rather they spend the money into giving some scientific information about the tower and landscape at the top. "
Think before you go (Total waiting time: 3-4 hours),"I was not really interested in going to the tower as the appearance of the tower is not appealing (to me). But with Discover Seoul Pass I can access here for free, so I asked myself: Why not give it a chance?Sadly it just turned out to be disappointing, and even worse than what I have expected. My boyfriend and I went there at night, there were long queues for the lift to the cable car as well as for the cable car itself. It took us almost an hour to reach the entrance of the N Seoul Tower. Upon presenting our Discover Seoul Passes, we were told that we had to wait for another hour before we could queue up for the lift that could take us to the observation deck as crowd control measures (people queue up by batch) was underway. When we finally arrived at the observation deck, we only took a few photos of ordinary cityscape at night and soon decided to depart (stayed for around 10 mins) as we saw that there was another long queue for returning to the ground level. The route reversed but the outcome was the same - we had to wait in a long queue for the cable car again. With tired, aching legs, the already long waiting time seemed like an eternity. I swear I will never go there again as I have already spent an eternity there."
Great Place to Visit,"We went here on our first day in Seoul and it is a good escape from the busy city (it is still busy but as it is set in the mountains and in a forest you escape the built up areas). We went up n the cable car, which can get very busy I'm told, but was a reasonable wait when we went. (Go on weekdays). The views were amazing and it was a really nice experience."
Amazing View of Seoul,"You can see the panoramic view of Seoul from N-Seoul Tower. It will be also very crowded as its one of the main attraction of Seoul. Too much couples everywhere Hahaha (am sad) loljkUnfortunately, didn't try the love lock haha Hmmm maybe next time :P"
Just go,"Located at Mount Namsan right smack in the middles of Seoul, it offers the best 360° view of the whole city. Often the site of Kdrama scenes, it's become more popular lately so I suggest to go there early before bus loads of tourists arrive. The mall below opens at 10am so with the food outlets. There's access via cable car to the tower so you can rest your tired feet and reserve your energy for more of Seoul's other attractions. Namsan is also a popular park where a lot of people jog, walk or just roam around specially in the mornings. For lovers, you can bring a padlock which you can lock and leave there as a similar to Paris. Don't leave Seoul without visiting."
Awesome experience ,"There's just so much to do and pictures to take. A must see in Seoul, but walking up to the tower was a nightmare have some water and good shoes, you'll need it."
Pretty good views ,"You get 360 degree views, it does get busy but worth it there are plenty of shops for eating and buying surveys, they is a cable car that takes you to almost the Base of the tower or you can catch a cab. "
Nice City view of Seoul,Namsan tower is one of the main spot to visit in Seoul. We enjoyed walking up to the tower and the scenery around is very nice. We enjoyed nice city view from the tower.
Namsan Tower - Beautiful view of Seoul,"i would recommend visiting Namsan tower during dusk. That way you get to see Seoul in the daylight and also at night. the view at night is really spectacular. bring a jacket with you. if the wind is strong, you will get cool pretty quick . as it happened to us in May 2017.unfortunately during our visit, the tower was restricted. but the views from the lower floors was just as great. we went there by the municipal bus, which was cheap and easy. we caught the bus near a Myeong Dong metro station and it only took 20 mins and cost us KRW 1,200. The bus will bring you all the way up to the tower. but when you are ready to go home , do get to the bus stop when there is no queue. because if there is a long queue , you might end up standing in the bus due to the large number of passengers also going home. i don't advise walking - its a really long and hard climb from the bottom of the hill to Namsan tower. there are a number of restaurants up there , we ended up eating burgers with a fantastic view of Seoul city. but if you are on a budget, there is a convenience store near the Namsan bus stop , which sells instant noodle pots and some snacks."
Stunning night ,"We came here to see the night view. It's about 10mins by taking cable car(but it's full of people, lined up for 30mins.:() It took us lots of time to line up and take transportation form central city, but the view truly worth waiting. Its a nice place for couples, so romantic to overview the city at night. "
Highly recommend!,"Namsan tower is very nice spot. It is very nice, also challenging path to walk up to the tower but the scenery around is very nice. The views to the city from the tower was pretty awesome, especially at the sunset. However, there were so many tourists round to pose pictures that we couldn't get a space to enjoy the view."
Good - but be prepared!,"So I visit soul city the last week in May for six days. My hotel had a direct view of the north Seoul tower or Namsan tower. I really wanted to spend one day and go visit it so I waited for a Sunday evening thinking this would be a great opportunity and a quiet time. I asked my hotel could I go to the tower by taxi and they say yes it would cost about $30 US. I got into the taxi and pointed at the picture that I had on my cell phone of the North Seoul tower and he departed the hotel. I did not know taxis and Individuals are not allowed to enter and drop you off at the north Seoul tower so he dropped me off at the cable car lift. The line for people waiting was approximately one hour. When I got up to the top of the lift I entered and bought my ticket for the tower observation deck. There was a lot of people upstairs but it was a pretty foggy night so the view was not great. Trying to get back down again you had the lineup for approximately 35 to 45 minutes to get the elevator back down again. All in all it was a good experience but would've been a lot better if it wasn't so foggy. I headed back to the cable car as I had bought a round trip ticket at 10:45 pm because the cable car was closing at 11 PM. The line to get into the cable car was approximately three times longer than the first time I got in coming up. I knew I would be stuck in the line for at least two hours. I ended up walking down the mountain in about 14 minutes. I still recommend this experience but I suggest two things: number one: you go there and make sure it's not a foggy day and number two: don't use the cable car unless you don't mind waiting, just use one of the city buses that are available to go up the side of the mountain to drop you off and return you back down afterwards."
看夜景，約會的地方,夜景很好，有小mall可以逛很適合情侶去可以用鎖鍊鎖在那便，寫上你跟另一半Good for coupleGood night viewingYou can bring a lock and lock at there with you and your partner name in it
Not really worth it,It costs 10000 won to get up there with the elevator and you're glased in a room with a bunch of expensive souvenir- and giftshops. No balconies or rooftop acces. The staff is friendly though.
WOW!,"It's a very big tourist spot. We visited this place on a Wednesday night. It was difficult to find from the Metro. But we had a nice walk through the small winding steep roads. There is an easy access elevator to use, but we were on the wrong path. The views from the tower were great, since it was clear day. The shops were a little pricey. "
excellent scenic spot but nothing much,Nice to visit after getting the namsan cable ride. Nice view fo the city but again nothing to compare to HK Peak view
Great view on a clear day,"Unfortunately in South Korea, very few days are clear...Even with this in mind, NST is a great destination and a must visit if you are on a short trip to Korea! We have been 3 separate times and enjoyed it each one. I definitely recommend being at the top after dark to see all of the city lights!"
A little for everyone ,"This is tge new and improved N Seoul tower. I was amazed by the view as well as the activities. If you go check the schedule as there are live performances. I even got a chance to spear a bamboo pole. The food is great the kids can visit an arcade as well as see how far away they are from home. Don't forget to go on the sky tram, and also have you camera ready. Wasn't expecting it but we spent the entire day there. Great fun and you could actually go for free."
What's the attraction here?,This was a disappointment. There is nothing especially notable in Seoul skyline! You can't see anything due to the smog and the dirty windows.
Nice view,"Better go up by cable car, it's much special. Go in the evening and see the sunset, the view is nice and it's comfortable to walk around the peak. Landmark of Seoul!"
Beautiful at night,This iconic land mark sits high atop the hill in Seoul. Take the tram up. This is particularly spectacular at night when it's lit up with colored lights.
"Line, line and line","Just a line. Took my ticket around 7:30pm and asked if I would have to wait to go up : No! Great let's go ! Ended up waiting 1h to go up.The view is Ok, you can see Seoul by night. But Seoul ain't nothing special to see from an observatory by night. Moreover there are many light on the top floors which give reflect in many pictures...Sky restroom are not skywalk restroom but just with big windows.And then to go down. The queue started on the floor 5F, when the elevator is on the 4F.The complete 4F floor was just a line. Never saw that ! If you wanna go, buy your ticket on the lower area, where you can access the observatory. You can at least see how is the line.But seeing the tower without getting in is enough and you also have the view"
"it is a ""wow"" place",At this place you can spend the whole day. using the cable car is a very nice experience. Arriving at the top gives you the option to walk down or to re-sue the cable car. Every level of the tower has a lot of thing to see including kids activities. The only problem is you need to pay for every thing: $8 to use the cable car and then at each level you may need to pay similar amount to visit some place.
iconic view by night,"Seoul tower by clear weather is really nice ! Seoulite atmosphere by night ! If there is a long queue for the cable car, you can walk as well ! "
Top of the Seoul summit,"I just returned from the tower after not having known what to expect. I'd be underselling the experience if I didn't say it exceeded my best expectations. I've really grown to love Korea and plan on visiting again in the near future. The park itself is immaculate with well maintained trails that are somewhat physically taxing but the average person will be just fine. There are also cable cars for those less inclined to get to the top on foot. Halfway up the trail you'll find a few places to grab a few items to both eat and drink. The view gets increasingly more beautiful as you climb, with the top offering a spectacular and unobstructed view of beautiful Seoul. You'll find plenty of options for both food and drink at the summit and tickets to the observation deck are moderately​ priced. There is a quaint gift shop located here as well as more options to eat and drink. All in all a great experience for solo travelers, such as myself, to couples and entire families of all ages."
Not much there,"Took the cable car up. The views were nice, but the tower felt like an abandoned mall, not much else up there to do. "
Hard walk but worth it,Fantastic views & the haze added to the scene. Dined in the restaurant was surprised by the excellent quality of the foodWell done for a major tourist venue 
An awesome symbol of Seoul,We came here in the afternoon when we arrived from the airport. We took the bus which stopped just near the entrance. One climbs a few meters of quite a hilly portion. We saw the heart locks area. The observation deck is great! Overlooking Seoul. Restos are available. 
N. Seoul Tower,"Good place to visit to see the whole scenic view of Seoul. Especially, please plan to sit down on pizza, spagetti area in 2nd places..You can enjoy the food while watching scenery. "
Expect Crowds,Visited in the evening and hordes of people had the same idea. Long wait to go on cable car. View is so-so . I feel the time could have spent better elsewhere.
Gooooood,It's properly good for me and family for relaxing vacation. I love this and I have plan to go there again
Evening sightseeing,Got the opportunity to go up tower just before dusk and able to see city fully in daylight and then after dark. This should be on everyone's first visit ...time to remember.
Great Views Of Seoul,"It is worth understanding that there are three stages up to the tower but it is all quite worthwhile on clear days when you can enjoy the views. From pavement level and only a few minutes walk from the main shopping area it is a few steps up to the lower funicular station. This is a free lift up to the lower cable car station. The funicular is a single car that shuttles about a dozen people up an incline, very smooth. Stage two is a cable car that shuttles about two dozen people up to the top of the mountain. There are two cars and there is a small charge and also very smooth. The actual tower is the third stage but you do not need to go if you do not wish. The cable car takes you to a small park area (which seemed pleasantly cooler on a hot day) Very nice to wander round, view the city and take pictures. I believe there are events up here sometimes. Worthwhile way for visitors to use a couple of spare hours and get some fresh air."
Iconic attraction,High on a hill above Seoul with panoramic wonderful views and everyone can see it especially at night time from street level
Lots of crazy walking but it was fun,"One thing you need to understand when in South Korea, you need to expect a lot of walking. Like whole day walking!This is a great tourist spot to see Seoul in a panoramic view. Love locks are also everywhere."
Best view!,"N Seoul Tower is just like any other touristy spot that offers a panoramic view of a city but I guess the selling point of this place for me is the journey going up to this tower. The around 45-minute (taking a lot of rests on our way) hike up was a breeze because there are proper, concrete stairs and the surroundings filled with plants and trees definitely took my attention, enough for me to forget that I have actually been climbing up the stairs for a while. Don’t forget to take a picture at one of the vantage points below the tower showing the juxta positioning of the industrial city and the mountains as a huge backdrop. The ‘lovers’ key park’ is also cute. So if you want to have your own key locked-up in that park, I highly suggest to bring your own lock in advance because the locks sold in the area is already so expensive. Then the tower itself is also good. So if you want to see the panoramic view of the city, then the N Seoul Tower is a must-visit place."
Best on a clear day,"The Seoul Tower is a terrific way to see the entire city and surrounding hills. On the way up, the elevator ceiling becomes a video as if you were blasting into outer space. To get to the tower, there are some inclines and steps - my guide knew where the elevator was to avoid the steps. After the tower, there was a live performance going on in the plaza of traditional dances and music, which was wee done. Certainly worth the visit."
Get the promo for the cable car!,"hubby and i vsited in 2012 by taxi bus and a lot of walking. This time with the entire family we chose to ride the cable car. Not much walking as we are already near the tower grounds but the line waiting for the cable car is sooo much boring. We waited for more than an hour to have our turn. First we lined up to ride the walkalator around 15mins, then the elevator for say 10mins, then the cablecar for an hour. Well at least we didnt climb our way up. TIP: its better to get the promo deal for the cable car with meal for two especially if you are planning to eat afterwards. The restaurant offers a better and unobstructed view of the city unlike in the cablecar where we are practically rubbing elbows with each other."
More than just a city view tower ,Must do in Seoul. I have been to viewing towers in most cities we goto but this was different . You obviously see magnificent views of the Seoul city but there is more especially for children. There are video game parlors ...3d reality ...Restaurants ..Nice views etc etc . So plan to spend a good 2-3 hrs up there ..It's worth it 
Better than expected ,After a cable car to access the Tower its 10000 each to get in to the lift to see the observation tower . You can get a discount if you buy a tube pass - 10 percent off . When at the top the windows need a clean - the view could be clearer . Best to go at sunrise to get the nighttime view . It's open till 23 00 hrs . Crowded and very touristy prices for restaurants - avoid that ! Views are good over Seoul . And you can take some nice pictures . There is a chance also to buy a love locket and express your eternal love for your partner . There are thousands of these . The queue to go down can be long and wait could be 10 to 15 mins to access cable car . 
Holiday,"Nice evening, first time visit, I have watched few dramas about this place, we went there late but it's good night out, especially great for couple."
A place to go,"I've been to korea a few times. There is a few ways to get there. Either you can take a short walk from Myeongdong. Then take the oreumi elevator up to the cable car ticket counter. Or take namsam sunhwan shuttle bus no 2, 3 or 5. Both transportation way up will will show you the scenery of korea. It's beautiful all year round and each season have something different to show. "
Must visit ,"Even though going up here need a lot of queuing. From buying the ticket, waiting for the tram, going inside the tower, going back down, back to the team again. But it's all worth it. From up there you can see 360 of Seoul. When we were there we got lucky to see lotte world fire works. It's AWESOME Don't forget to bring your love locks but don't worry they sold those there "
Ten minutes of fun,"Really interesting place, but if you're not with children that will ask you about ice-cream, it'll take 10 to 15 minutes to get everything from this place. Good views when the weather is good."
Must see,A trip through this tallest tower is mind boggling. It has 23 floors and it is is 183 feet. The lift goes up the 19 floors exactly in one minute. Inside the lift and while traveling on the lift the entire lift shows a led description of buildings around and also the sky as it reaches the top
Overlooking Seoul,One can view most or entire Seoul area when you reach this peak. A romantic place where one appreciates the beauty of the city
Astonishing view of the City,"Astonishing view of the City from the Observatory deck. We went at night time and would like to come back during the day. It was more convenient because we went up and down by the cable car. But there one thing we regret, we didn’t wear thicker or warmer coats. It was freezing when we visited. But we enjoyed and took some photos. Saw the famous love locks that I only saw in some Korean dramas."
"Another tourist place, with one allowing you to soar to the sky.","You can start your experience by taking the Namsan Cable Car to N Seoul Tower. If not, you can drive straight up to the tower. I went there quite early, shortly after they opened for operation. The scenery is nice to behold depending on the weather. Personally I feel that night time will be a better timing to visit. "
Great views,Great views of the city and nice place to relax with a beer. I caught the bus up (easy as) and then walked back down
Incredible Views,"Fantastic views and rewarding hike to the top of the hill. Be ready to climb not for folks capable of making the trek from the bottom, there are buses and shuttles available to get you to the top. Night time view of Seoul was particularly enjoyable and made the trip even more memorable."
Nice View,This place had nothing to do. Just enjoy the view and free your mind (but not on the weekend). This place is famous just because of the korean drama.
Seoul Tower,Must see attraction. Make sure you plan for time to explore the park around the the tower. Recommend you plan to spend time in the park and go up the tower a bit before sunset.
Great way to spend a morning,"We walked up the hill from our hotel (Hyatt) and it we had lovely views all the way, through the park. Great views of Seoul and there are things to do up there. We didn't go to the top of the tower but we did plenty of exploring just below."
Nice Views At Night,"This place can give you a breathtaking view of Seoul from the top. Both day and night views are spectacular, though I prefer the night view of Korea. This place is very touristy and it is a bit pricey to go to the top however if it is your first time to visit Seoul then this is a must."
Too crowed ,It is close to the heart of the city. The cable was a interest experience of getting up the the tower. But I would suggest to walk to the N tower from the bottom of the mountain as the park was with a lot of beautiful trees and flower. A great place to refresh in the city. 
Over-rated,"Visited the Seoul Tower in March 2017. I don't see what the appeal is of this attraction. I visited on a clear day I could see ""forever"". However, the views simply are not that impressive. The tower is filled with tourist shops and restaurants with unimaginative menus. The entire experience was quite boring. If you must...see it once. Be prepared to be underwhelmed."
Beautiful at night,This place will give you a captivating sight at night. You will see the beauty of Seoul. The buildings and their lights are just like stars twinkling below and you will feel that you are in the space watching them. 
Nice view of the city (in a clear day),"We went there in the morning and even though it was sunny it was a bit hazy...nevertheless we very much enjoyed the views (360 degrees). On the way back our guide took us to the park below the tower. They have hundreds of colorful locks with names on them (professing eternal love). And of course we left one (we are told they are periodically removed). A few steps away, we dressed up on the traditional Korean costumes....overall, a very nice experience."
Memorable and worth to visit,"It's an amazing N seoul Tower, from our hotel in myeongdong we just take a bus #406 from Namdaemun gate until Namsan Library then we just walk going uphill it's worth walking to see the beautiful ambiance of the namsan park. Very beautiful once we arrived the tower as you can see the beautiful city of Seoul."
Nice views,The best option for panoramic views is the Lottle Worlds sky view but this is cheaper and closer to downtown.
Beautiful place❤️❤️❤️,A park where all kinds of people can go. Go there upon opening and leave during closing time so that you will experience how it look like during the day and during the night. Explore the beauty of the N Seoul Tower as well as the beauty of nature. 
Definitely worth visiting for the views,The tower was one of our stops on the Seoul City Tour Bus hop on hop off course. You climb a slight hill from the base drop off point up to the tower itself. Even without paying the expensive price to go all the way up the tower we had really stunning views for free (just make sure you climb to the highest floor available before you can't go up anymore). Going at sunset would be a great option as you then get to see the city views both during the light as well as after dark with the sparking city lights which is quite magical.
Beautiful view!,Seoul tower view are spectacular!The tower was a wonderful stroll from our hotel and great for evening stroll.Visited on Sunday evening and place was very busy and crowded.Long wait to get the cable car and entrance to the observatory deck! Once there the view was breathtaking.I would definitely recommend!
Unexpected nice view,"I have visited this kind of towers many times, I didn't expect too much.But the tower stands the top of hill, and the view is much more beautiful than the others!"
Spectacular view of Seoul,We had a great time taking pictures at the heart lock area and just enjoying the cool weather (it was about 14 degrees). 
Beautiful but packed,I suggest taking the hike up the mountain. The sky cars we were packed like sardines. We couldn't even move or see anything on the way up or down. All I could think was this can't be safe. So save your money and enjoy the sites. The tower itself has lovely views but make sure it's a clear day or you will be disappointed. It is a rather large tourist attraction so don't be surprised by the amount of people and clutter. It is a nice place to be stopping by and a pretty view to see but there are better sites in Seoul that are way more worth your time. 
A lot of $ for the view,"We had a hard time finding the best way to get there. When we finally found the cable car to the tower we paid 8000 KW each and then had to pay another 10,000KW to go to the top. It was night time and the windows were smudged and the flash reflected off the window, so very poor quality pictures. Maybe it would have been better to go during the day."
Wow,Must in Seoul. Fantastic viwes Go up befaure sunset and stay until dark. You won't regret. Low faire
Good way to spend a few hours ,"The N Seoul Tower area is a good place to take in the beautiful sites of the massive capital. It has the tower itself but also platforms, parks, and nature that is nice to be in too. "
Nice viewing deck,The area gives a nice view of the city especially during the golden hour. There are many restaurants and things you can do in this area. The tower in itself is a landmark of Seoul but a lot of people come here to enjoy the panoramic view. It's good spot for taking great photos as well.
A beautiful view,"I visited this place just right at the moment sun goes down. The beautiful view from the park with the lovelocks, a citylights of seoul, the tower itself, really memorable. But, this place need a scheduled buses to take the visitors from the bottom to the up above. So it will so much helpful without waiting for too long. "
A great view of the city,"There are 2 ways that I know of to get to the top. 1, is to walk up which can be quite taxing if your not quite fit enough, the other, is to catch the cable car. I have used both.The queue for the cable car can be quite long, especially before sunset. Allow plenty of time for this.Once at the top you will need to pay a fee for the tower itself. There are many of locations around the top where you can take some great shots of the city, but inside the tower itself, is where you really see Seoul for its beauty.Buildings with a backdrop of mountains and cars which look like ants! Lots of useful information pointing to different cities around the world.You really want to be up here when the sun is just about to go down. The views and colours are amazing so a camera is a must.The food can be a bit expensive depending on where you eat, but nothing overly expensive. Shop around.This should be your number one place to visit."
Very nice,Very nice view in a clear day or night. We were there at the late after noon and night and it was pretty. 
Nice sunset view!,The view of the city skyline was not great because it was very cloudy when I went up. But on the way down I was rewarded with a beautiful view of the sunset. 
must go place,"As the name Seoul tower,it is a best place to go see the whole town from up there. the view is always great from there even in the night."
Beautiful,"Every time we come to Seoul, we always end up coming to this place, the walk to the tower is like a work out, it's beautiful when you get up there "
Fun!,So much to see! It is quite a bit of walking so be prepared! There is a lot of food and sights to see there! Enjoy! Asp bring a lock to lock while you're there with your loved one!
Beautiful views,Took the cart up to Namsan Tower to see the beautiful views of Seoul from up above. This is a popular tourist attraction as you will see so many people there. There's also restaurants up there so you have a place to eat. There are the locks of love that you will see all over the place. Definitely make sure you bring a camera to capture all of its essence. 
Views of Seoul,"The first time I came to N Seoul Tower, we walked up which was insane. Second time we took the bus and cable car and it was during cherry blossom season which was so, so beautiful. Third time we walked and then took the cable car which was still a bit of a hike as we took the long way to get there but it was still worth it. I would recommend going during cherry blossom season because the road is covered in the petals and it's constantly raining down with petals from the trees, especially when cars and buses come past. You'll see couples on dates most of the time so it's a romantic place to take your partner and go for a nice stroll. "
Great view of,"We took the Namsan Circular Shuttle Bus to the tower, so that we could enjoy the view from Namsan. It would be great if it was not foggy."
Great Views of Seoul,"Namsan Seoul Tower is the BEST place to see Seoul in its entirety all at once...then again, you're 480m up in the sky so you have no choice but to see EVERYTHING ;) The tower has a gift shop, multiple restaurants, and even a game room with individual karaoke rooms for 500 W per song ^^. If you're planning to visit, I highly recommend some decent walking shoes or even hiking shoes if you want to take the 1100m hike from street level near the National Theater to the base of the tower. It's a HELLUVA hike but well worth it...however, make sure you check the weather. I went on a bay air quality day and I felt it! If you can, try to get during the fall to see the foliage OR go at night to see a brightly lit up Seoul."
"Serene Environment, Nice experience",Very beautiful. On top is like being on top of the world! I only had a short time there but it is all worth it. Very lovely and romantic touring the Tower and around it.
Excellent Place to go visit,"It's refreshing to go a place where everyone seems to be in a great mood, and you can enjoy a spectacular view. I did not go inside of the tower, but at the base there are a large amount of vendors including the Teddy Bear Museum (Which is a teddy bear store). They even have ice cream stuffed churros!!!!!"
The walk was more impressive than the tower itself,"The walk up to the tower is up a hill through a forest, which is a really lovely walk. As you get higher you can see different views of the city and it's gorgeous. The tower itself is great to see the views, the windows were really dirty but it wasn't so bad. There are a few refreshments at the top and of course your usual souvenirs. "
♥️ Lovely Place ♥️,A lovely place to visit when in Korea. We took Bus 5 there and walk up to the Tower. It would be nice to visit the tower in the night when all the lights was up. You can see beautiful scenery from the tower and the weather was great in May. No regrets visiting the N Seoul Tower ! It's a romantic place for couples to visit too ! Highly recommended ! 
Good Exercise,"We walked from Myeongdong to Seoul Tower. The walk is uphill. Wear proper shoes. Take a cable car up, it's interesting to see the view. Too many locks there but glad we went there as the scenery is beautiful. "
Beautiful in the day and at night,"I visited here 2 years ago in the day and this year I had the opportunity to visit at night. The view was amazing in the day but there is something about the darkened skies and the bright city lights that makes everything seems so grand! Purchase your tickets at the entrance. There are other attractions here as well so you can decide what sort of tickets you want to purchase. There is a souvenir shop as well as restaurants and cafes. You can purchase locks at the shop at the entrance level. Of you are interested to do tile message, you can only do so inside the tower itself. There are 3 ways for you to get here; one way is to ride a bus all the way up. There are a couple of buses at Myeondong that you can take. You can take a cable car; there was a shuttle bus that picked us up at the same Myeondong bus stop I mentioned just now. If you are up for a walk and an adventure, you may want to hike up. I've tried the first 2 options but I don't think I would want to hike up. "
Stunning,The tower provide a stunning view of Seoul. But I personally think that it is unnecessary to enter the observation area. You have to pay like KRW 8000 for the entrance. And the view is pretty much the same with view you can get on lower level. 
Beautiful views of Seoul,This is a must do when in Seoul. The views are beautiful and a great place to explore. The cable car ride up is quite quick and the wait wasn't too long when I went.
Great views of Seoul,This is well worth a trip but there is quite a steep walk from the parking area. The elevator that goes to the main viewing level is super fast and accompanied by a sound and light show on it ceiling.The 360 degree views from the tower show just how big Seoul is. There was entertainment on a lower level on the day I was there.
good time,"this is a wonderful place to go, you can see the city from the top of hills, eat and have fun I really recommend as a must do in seoul."
Take in the View of Seoul ,You don't realize how large Seoul is until you take in the views. Hopefully the day is clear - otherwise it could be disappointing. You must be fit to walk the trek up to the tower but it's worth taking in the city on the top of a mountain. 
Really nice view. ,"To visit this tower is must. This is the only way, how to realize the size of the city. The lift is very quick. And sky video in the cabin is amazing."
Nice view to city,"Tower on South mountain offers great view to the city. Definitely must to see in Seoul, do not miss it!"
Avoid during public holidays,I went during the Golden Week holiday and it was horrible. I waited one and a half hour to get in and the ONE HOUR in a line to get out using one of the only two elevators available (can you say fire hazard?). The view was good but definitely not worth the wait.
"Nice walk, didn't bother going up the tower","We enjoyed the walk up to the base of the tower. Once at the base, we enjoyed the limited views (due to pollution) and felt that we wouldn't gain much by going up the tower. The entrance fee is overpriced if the view is limited. We got great views a few days earlier from a mountain in bukhansan park. Walk up only took 20 mins. "
A good view abound Seoul,"The view is good. However, before you buy a ticket, go to the so-called Heart lock observatory and check the view, particularly the degree of smog.The ticket is a bit pricey - 10 000 KRW (approximately 10 USD) for an adult.The customer service is bad - rude and almost no English.The way to the tower is clearly signed. It is sometimes steepy but doable. You need about 30 - 60 minutes depending on your fitness. Otherwise you can use a cable car."
Good views by night,"Visited the tower as the sun was setting. Well worth a visit, and the cable car to the top is reasonably priced - though there is normally a queue of around 30-60 minutes. You can walk up to the top but this is a mildly strenuous option and involves lots of steps.Visit the tower at night to see Seoul lit up below - or at least what isn't covered by smog."
Beautiful Tower,"It's a very nice tower to visit. Located on the top of Namsan, that's why they called it Namsan tower. Just take bus #5 or #3 from Cheungmuro you will be straight here. You can see seoul city from the top of the mountain. "
Great Views,"This tower is on top of a mountain in Seoul, It is accessed by an elevator, and the line for the elevator gets longer as afternoon approaches.The view is spectacular from the top, It is best to go in the morning - and on a day that the air quality is good."
Nice sunset view from the observatory,"Better to arrive here around 4 pm. Best to go up at the observatory during that time, and wait for the sunset.Observatory Entrance Fee: 9,000 korean wonDirection: Take Metro Line 4 and get off at Myeongdong Station Exit 3 and take the bus."
The Epitome of Love Locks,"This tower beckons us to visit when we sight it from afar in and around Seoul. And visit we did. There is so much to see and do at this tower and its surrounds. We took bus No 5 from Myeongdong. Cars and taxis are no longer allowed past a certain point. So the recourse is to go by bus or cable car. I'm glad we didn't take the cable car for the queue going back down was insanely long. The bus brings you right up to the base of the tower. This tower should be nicknamed Seoul's or Namsan's Love Lock Tower. The variety of, the shapes they form and the insane number of love locks stretch along different walkways are supported by zones - Heart Lock zone, Shiny Love zone, love seats etc. And if you are lucky, you might catch the filming of a love scene like we did!"
Beautiful spot to view the city!,"The North tower offers you a great view of the city. The ticket for the elevator to take you to the top is inexpensive and they have a coffee shop, a souvenir shop at the top. It is definitely worth the visit!"
Amazing view from top!!,A nice place to have an aerial view of Seoul. It has a nice Souvenir shop and a good restaurant. The elevators roofs are fitted with LED screens that show you amazing space journey while being escalated. The place has got world's first LG OLED tunnel which is amazing too. The place boasts of the highest wash rooms with clear glasses to have a view of city while relieving. This is crazy but a nice idea. Must use wash rooms here. Happy travelling!!
Good view of Seoul,"Nice introduction to Seoul view from the top of the N Tower. We visited the place around 10am when there was less visitors.Additionally, we visited the historical fortress and the smoke signalling chimeys at the base of the tower. We soend around 2 hours at this location before moving to Namdaemun Market. We could visit Seoul Hanok Village from the N Tower as well."
Must visit ,"I took taxi from the hotel to the cable station, book one way ticket if you would like to enjoy the walk down from the top.The cable will take you up to the mountain .I dont recommend at all the observation roof unless you just want to try.I advice you to enjoy the views and explore the area. You can walk down it is around 2k, just follow the signs."
Soul's bird eye view ,"This has been one my most favourite attractions in Seoul. You can go there by cable car, bus, or you can hike up. If you want take cable car, I would suggest going around 10am since it gets really crowded afterwards. Also I would suggest to take cable car for one way that is to reach the tower. You can easily come down by the stairs while enjoying beautiful Seoul landscape. While going to the tower you can also visit Namsan park and Seoul tower complex. There's a lot of things to do there. Gaming zone, restaurants, teddy bear gallery etc. I particularly loved a perfume shop where I could make my own customized perfume. The name of this shop is A'roma Aesthetics. For me the ideal time to visit this place is in the evening although I had to wait an hour to get into cable car at this time. But I guess it's worth it."
Romantic Sunset,"Namsan tower is famous for lover locking their love by the tower. However, the place is suitable for everyone. People also come with their family and friends. I think it's best to catch up sunset on top of the hill especially in spring. You can snap lots of pictures. Also, you can get to see the whole lights of seoul.Best and cheapest way to go is to take bus from dongguk university station, exit 1. The bus will directly take u to the bottom of the tower.Or, you can try taking the cable car for more romantic feeling. Walking up the mountain by passing thru the park towards the tower can be a good exercise"
Crowded,"If you have time, you can head here to see the city from the top of tower. It is crowded and other than the view, not much more to do. "
Tower,"It was ok. If you can drive up or walk up, it might be better. The line for the gondola is long. Walking is hard, all up hill."
Great views of the city.,"Great views of the city. Super packed though.Would recommend visiting via tour though.Our tour guide was able to drop us off all the way to the top. Otherwise, you can take the tram from the bottom or walk. The line for the tram though was outrageously long. "
Seoul view at night,Good thing we went here on weekday less crowded. We rode the cable car getting there and the N tower lights are mesmerizing to view when u get there. From the N tower we viewed the whole seoul citylights.
A place to go,"I walk up and took the cable car down.I recommend this route, it will allow for a nice walk in a park. Not extraordinary but worth it.The tower in itself is very much typical for these sort of attractions.The first level (5F) is very nice with a good view , some restaurants and shops and plenty of opportunities to take pictures.You will need to pay 10000 KEW to go to the top. It is recommended as there is a nice view. A little expensive for teh offereing.Worth going"
360 on Seoul,"Your basic tower experience, a zoomy ride, a full round view and snacks and souvenirs for those who want. Since the tower is already on a hill it does get up there and you can se for miles. The windows are kept clean for photos. At the base there are some zero dollar view points and more kitsch. We also rode the cable car to the base, and added feature."
Korea adeventure,I always see this place in the Korean dramas I often watch. And so when I had the chance to visit Korea this place was one of my must see spot. It was amazing! The love locks that were left were really something to behold! The shops are great and when you reach the top the view was fantabulous! I especially like the photo shop where you can wear their traditional dress called hanbok. I really loved it! I also rode the cable car going up to N Seoul tower and it was fun. The view at night was brilliant! I had a great time visiting N Seoul tower. 
Amazing view with lots of fun activities at the top,"The night view of Korea from the tower is amazing, definitely worth the climb up. Also, there are quite a few activities at the top to do, with dining options as well. Very similar to Victoria's Peak in Hong Kong. Do check out the lover's lock bridge at the top for nice photo taking spots, and the 3D LG screen experience that was really entertaining in bringing you into a 3D world with amazing graphics."
Just a landmark,"I visited the Tower on 4 April evening. I took the cable car, thinking that it would take me right to the bottom of the Tower.However, after waiting for almost 20 minutes because of the long queue, it took me to the car platform only. I still had to take the staircase up to the ticket booth. I did enjoy the sunset view from the observation deck but not too breathtaking. Maybe it's a good place for lovers but for me, it's just a landmark."
Cool tower even on rainy day,So the day that we went a family of 5 the two parents of five-year-old and two teenagers we took a taxi up to the cable car I recommend that as the best way to get to the N Tower. The cable car ride to the tower was jam-packed full so it's very hard to get your window to get good video so you might have to head your way strongly to get to the window to get some good video or pictures. The wait to get on the cable car was not very long so that was very well worth it. I think you can also walk up the hill and take all the steps to get to the in Tower which I would love to do on a nice spring or fall day not a rainy day like we went. Make sure you take a lot of padlock or some kind of lock to add to the locks at the top I forget what they're for but it's really a pretty cool it's a community or World Wide Arts peace you'll understand when you get there but take a log or Google it before you get there to know why you're taking a lot. There are several places to eat at the in Tower all ranges of prices ranging from probably 2 or 3 Bill signs 2425 Bill signs though so nothing really cheap but definitely a place to stop and eat if you want to have time it was crazy busy even on a rainy day. Once you're up in the tower they have names major cities like New York City is so many kilometers away excetera excetera which is pretty cool so you couldn't go all the way around the whole circle and take pictures with you or yourself and your family and with the cities that you've been to or the city that you're from. The little to shop up in the tower was wonderful and we thought the prices were very fair for some very unique gift ideas we opted for the little puzzle with the frame which happened to be on sale and they had multiple items on there like weekly or monthly cell so that was really. The candy store if it's still there was pretty cool also apart everything is impeccably clean and the candy is quite good although a little spendy but it's worth it. I would say if your only choice to go was during rainy weather then it absolutely still is a must go on but if you could go during clearweather then that would be the best although I'm sure that's also the busiest. 
Superb city view from Seoul Tower !!,"The place is perfect for love birds as it's full of signs of love !!You have to walk a lot to reach to the main deck but once you reach on top the city view is very beautiful!!One time visit place, nothing much to explore !! "
Beautiful views ,"The cable car cue was quite long for 5:30 in the evening, nonetheless a quick process! The views are breathtaking and a trip up to the observation deck is a must! Appropriate for children and families as well as solo travelers! The views at sunset are great!!!!"
Not that wowed but offers good views,"The cable car is 8,000W to the Base of the tower however it is easy and free to walk up to the Base. At the Base there are plenty of places to eat with lots of variety and a little shopping. The views from here are also good.If you want to go to the top of the tower it is 10,000W. Obviously the views are great from that height."
Great place to enjoy panoramic view of Seoul,N Seoul Tower being the second highest point in South Korea is a good place to enjoy the panoramic view of the city especially at night where you can see the beautiful color of the city lights.
Amazing view!,"this had been recommended to us as a must-see by a friend. You can get to the tower by walking, bus or cable car. And then go up the tower to see Seoul laid out around you. See all the locks hanging off fences and take photos in love seats. We went up by cable car and walked down through the forest which made a pleasant afternoon."
Easy Hike,"We hiked up instead of riding the cable car, enjoyed the lovely view along the way and saw the tower from afar. "
nice night view,you must go this spot.if you want to see night view of Seoul.amazing view.you can get there with various ways.
A must do in Seoul,To help you get a perspective of this amazing city. Views are breath taking. We walked up to the tower through beautiful gardens then used the cable car down. 
Good view across Seoul,This is a good walk or you can get the cablecar. When you arrive at the top the view is incredible and a great vantage point. A must when visiting Seoul
Very Enjoyable,"We visited the N Seoul Tower at night, the views were fantastic. It was very romantic to see all the thousands of key rings on the fence."
"Walking up to Namsan Tower, worth the Effort !","Namsan Tower is best enjoyed by walking through the gardens and up the track from the park entrance near the Grand Hyatt. The gardens are spectacular in Spring and Autumn with different colors in each season. The trail up to the Tower is clearly marked and there are a number of viewing decks to soak in the sights of Seoul. Our 9 year old kids made it comfortably and there is plenty to keep the kids interested on the way. Kids play parks, fish ponds, exercise areas and a shop at the top to provide incentive for those in need of refreshment. Enjoy!"
Breathtaking ,We went there around 8-9pm... the Q for the cable care only took almost 15min because cable care can occupy almost 30-40 people... when we reach the tower we have to climb the stair... it's exhausting.. im not sure if it's any lifts available... but the climb is worthed...the view ia breathtaking we can spend hours and hours just looking at the view and strolling along the Lock Love Tower... food and drink vendor are also a available there... really recommend 
Plan your visit!,"This a popular tourist attraction and therefore prior planning is highly recommended. It is advisable to go very early during the day if you want to head up to the N Seoul Tower as it can be very crowded. We walked to the ticket office, and the walk up isn't too bad. Waiting time for a ticket is about 30 minutes. Then another 30-45 minutes to the cable car. If you are super fit you can walk up to the N Seoul Tower, otherwise the walk up is not for the faint hearted. When we arrived at the ticket box there was an ambulance collecting someone that had collapsed from the walk. Once you get up to the tower there is a lot to do- shops, eateries, children's activities, marital arts demonstrations and much more. We stayed here for about 3 hours and then walked down. It was about 20 minutes walk down, but you felt sorry for the people walking up, as it is a long walk. This is a must see when in Seoul. "
Wonderful view,"One of our favorite places in Seoul. Spectacular views. We enjoyed seeing the old city wall and small signal towers. Enjoyed seeing a traditional dance performance. Thousands of locks attached to many of the fences by people locking their love. We were dropped off by our little bus in the bus parking lot and walked up the hill. Make sure you check out the window in the bathroom in the tower, very surprised to see that."
Love ❤️ ,"No.1, BRING YOUR OWN KEY IF YOU DONT WANT TO BUY THERE, standby SGD$10 if you wanna buy one, 2nd Help them local korean old man who take picture, 3rd sit at the broken chair & I repeat AND DO THE KOREAN LOVE HAND SIGN, overall i love this place, for sure me & my wife will go there again n again n again"
Slightly overrated,"Went during night time and it was packed with tourists and locals alike. It was freezing when we got to the top of the entrance. You get to experience 360 view of the city, though nothing spectacular. The queue to take the lift up the tower was long and once you are up there, you need to hustle with a lot of people who are trying to view the scenery all at the same time. Would also not recommend this if you can't take stairs as you still have to walk up a few flights of stairs to get to the entrance at the top even by taking the cable car up. "
Very good with one exception,"As you'd expect for a tower over one of the biggest cities in the world. Smooth organization and no time limit. The windows were quite dirty, everyone commented as the saw them, it looked like the residue of dirty rain. "
Fabu spot to watch the sunset,"Recommend! It's a great spot to watch the sunset and the big architectural balance ball is very cool for nerds like me. I loved it. Plus downstairs is that famous dim sum spot. I recommend you take a number before heading up because the wait is so long, that way you should be up when you come back down. Otherwise there is a huge food court with varied options."
Beautiful vista at night.,We took a beautiful Uber car to and from the base of the tower one night. It was a beautiful clear night so we had a wonderful view of Seoul. There are a few cafes and souvenir shops. It is worth visiting the toilets as the view out of floor to ceiling windows in each cubicle is magnificent.
Loved the Performance of Artist,Very Nice place to watch free performance regarding korean culture. I loved the performance . For couples they are selling love locks :) nice place to take picture together woth your loved one. If you are single they also offer painting services :) 
A walk up,"When I went, there were 2 options: to walk up the hill or take the cable car. We did both! Walking up was a journey but a pretty one, it's definitely worth it. Getting back down, was a little wait because we thought there would be multiple cabins but turns out it was only one. At the tower, the view was amazing and there's a lock cage where you and your partner could buy a lock, write your name and attach it to the fence. Pretty cool."
Love lock..,Nice place to visit. couples must have love lock.. Very enjoyable. Cable car to N seoul tower is just short and contains almost 20 people. A little bit scary.. hahahaa.. but its fun..
Great view and lots to do ,We walked to the tower it is 10 minutes walking but was really very challenging walk as it is in elevated street and there are stairs to reached the main entrance of the cable car. There are long long queue for about an hour to ride the cable car. It was crowded own and up as it is the weekend so avoid visiting during weekends. The view is really excellent and there are lots to do there multi stories buildings with lot to do so you can spend hours there and the cherry blossoms trees was marvelous on the mountain give up gorgeous scenically picturistic view with grades of pink to white to green trees. 
Good view of the city...,...depending on the air quality. Quite a hike if you walk (cable-car available at a cost). Food and drink options at the top. Good for a half-day or less.
Amazing views ,"You see incredible views from so high up and it's rather bizarre yet lovely to see such a view high up when you go the the toilets as well so you can still enjoy the view when you go and do what you've got to do. The food there is incredible and there are plenty of souvenirs for you to buy as well. It is only accessible by tour bus, foot or cycling as the city attempts to reduce the emissions up the mountain "
Best place to look over Seoul,"We visited N-Seoul Tower (aka Namsan tower) at noon so it was a bit hot for us though it was early April. The way led from bus stop to the tower was a bit steep but not difficult to walk. The scene around the tower was beautiful as we could see most of Seoul inner city, even the palaces. It seemed to be a ""must see"" so there was a lot of tourists and especially the couples came to hang their love locks. No need to buy the ticket to go to the observation deck (unless you'd like to do so), just go to the T1 floor and a beautiful city of Seoul is in front of your eyes."
An attraction for couples,"It is about 15-20 min uphill walk to the Namsan cable car station from Myeongdon station exit 3. Take the cable car to the base of N Seoul Tower.Nice views when walking to the base of N Seoul Tower from where the cable car stops.There are many photo spots with 'Love' all over the base of the N Seoul tower, a romantic attraction for couples.I went there alone yet still enjoyed myself very much.Buy ticket to go up to the observatory deck of the N Seoul tower at the base. The staff will guide you through.You can buy ticket which includes dining or beer but i did not.I was there from evening til the sky turned dark. Beautiful view.Nice souvenirs at the observatory deck as well."
N Seoul Tower - lots to do!,"As a tourist my friend and I were told we had to go here and I'm glad we did! The tower offers a variety of attractions and although we never made it inside it just shows how much there is to do. We got to the tower by taking the subway to Seoul station and left through exit 9. We then walked a short distance forward and the shuttle bus stand was there where we took a shuttle bus straight to the park. Other ways include the subway to Myeongdong and a cable car. You can't take a taxi or a car there as they are trying to reduce the pollution to protect the area.Once at the location you walk up a HILL to get to the actual tower. Wear good shoes guys! There is lots to do there before even paying to get in the tower (which happened to us because of time constraints). There were different dances and sword fighting displays with a running commentary of South Koreas historical background. This is offered in both Korean and English. They include the audience quite a lot which is great fun! I found myself laughing at the comedic side of it!There is lots to eat ranging from lunch to dessert and snacks so you won't go hungry. The iconic love locks are also there. For 8000 won you can buy one or 12000 won you can buy a set of two locks, both come with a free marker pen. You then go to write whatever you want and lock it up on the tower forever! Its an amazing thing to do as it feels like you're leaving a part of yourself in Seoul. This was all done without paying an entrance fee to get into the tower. Unfortunately we never made it inside due to time constraints but that shows there's a lot of fun stuff to do! Definitely visit there, just give yourself a good amount of time."
Must see!!!,"It was so awesome to see all the locks and to go up into the tower!! It costs about 10,000 won but its worth it. I watched EXO showtime so i had to go up. I also got the fried potato stick that Tao had haha. And there is a cute gift shop at the top of the tower. It is accessible by two ways. You can ride the subway and then get off at a place where you can ride up the ski lift. So you can ride the ski lift or hike up the hill. My sister and I rode up the ski lift and then we hiked the trail down. There are a lot of stairs!! It is a super fun place to play!! You can also get lots of exercises if you want. We got water from the convenience store. There was also a cafe there too."
Thumbs down,"We arrived and my eyes almost popped out to see the queue! We started queuing at 3pm plus and by the time we got up there, it was 8pm plus. We were hungry and i wasn't happy. We ordered a noodle dish to share. Didn't bother, because the place was packed!"
Good View - Lover's Place,"This is a nice place to go to see Seoul in a different perspective. Many people choose to hike from the bottom to the top. Below the tower, there are plenty of places for lovers to take pics and even put locks in the lovers lock area (like the one in Paris)"
Touring Cyclists ,"On the day we visited it was starting to cloud over, so we only went to the base of the tower. From at least four different areas you get a great view of the mountains and city. So like other reviews, save your $10 bucks. Every day there are live shows at the base of the tower, and they are ""Free""."
"Good weather, the lovers locks are magnificent ","Many people, especially tourists there. We took Bus No.5 from Myeongdong subway there and we didn't need to take cable car. There are many locks, which makes the place so special especially for lovers, and the view of Seoul from above is magnificent! However, the elderly may need some time and effort to walk up to the tower. It was a Saturday. There was a performance but I didn't watch it, looks like they have regular performance at the square. "
View From The Top,"We enjoyed a free entry ( as we are Seniors) to The Tower & loved the clear views for miles on a sunny day.Seoul is a large city of over 10,000,000 people & the city covers a huge area.The view from up top of the Tower of the many Palaces is extraordinary & clearly displays there immense size.Well worth a visit on a sunny day."
Amazing views of Seoul,Really good views of Seoul from the tower. There are also live performances in the square outside throughout the day. There is a very steep road from the car park to reach the tower so this may not be suitable for those with limited mobility/fitness
N Seoul Tower to see the entire city,"Go there in the morning to avoid queues. If you do not mind waiting, go just before sunset, so you can see the city in daylight and nighttime. Waiting times can be easily 60 minutes to the cable car and another 30 minutes for the tower lifts."
See it any day!,"This tower is best to visit either at night or by day. Though entrance up there costs a fortune, the view of the entire city from it's deck is breathtaking! "
Must visit if in Seoul ,What a fantastic view over this great city! And in addition they have made a most out of this place. With the possibility to go up in the tower or take a picture with Psy close to the Love tunnel 
Cherry blossom ,"The best time of visiting Seoul Tower are in March, April(Cherry blossom) and Sept., Oct.(Fall).We visited here every time when we come to Korea. You can walk to the tower or take a cable car. Good public transportation is available in the city.And you can check out Myung Dong (the most famous shopping area) and Namdaemoon Market (the oldest market for whole sale rice in everything). You can find good and delicious food with very cheap price in these area."
Great place to spend the evening and see the tower at night,"We took the stairs from the bottom, walked the park to the top and was able to spend the evening and part of the night here. It's so pretty with the lighted tower. It was also very pretty with the sunset and I got great pics. A must come kind of place. "
Great adventure,Went here on a Saturday night and it was an amazing view. The cable car was a bit crowded. We ended the evening with dinner at the French restaurant and it was great. 
Impressive view of seoul,We went there in the morning and decided to take the cable car for the experience.Nice view at the top. You can actually take a 15mins walk from Myeongdong station to the cable car station. There is a love bridge where you can put a love lock.The cafes are decent and have a great viewing area.Remember to bring your lock. The price they are selling is expensive.
Cool tourist attraction,Great views of the city at night. There is a lot of things to see right outside of the tower. We even mailed our kids a letter from the top of the tower!
Tourist view,"Not surprisingly, this is a tourist trap. Yes, the view is fun and the hike up there (do the hike) is nice, especially if you go during cherry blossom season. However, if you are able, I'd highly recommended heading over to Inwangsan Mtn. instead if you want the same view for less money and crowds!"
Nice View of Seoul,Make sure having fine weather before proceeding.Located on top of the hill and can see the whole of Seoul.Best is with Hot coffee in your hand while walking 360 degree absorbing the view of Seoul.
SEOUL City lights at the view from N Tower,We went at this place almost evening. When we rode the cable car going to the N tower i love seeing the whole city of SEOUL with all the city lights at its best view.
Pleasant walk,"Accessible on foot or by shuttle bus, it one of the must-see places in Seoul. The park around the tower is nice and the tower offers a beautiful view of Seoul"
My son's favorite place ,"We toured South Korea for 2 weeks and this was my 15 year olds all time favorite thing we did. We did a lot so that's saying something. The views are incredible, it's a smooth ride to the top and the show was done well. Bring a lock so you can write your name and date on it and leave it with all of those thousands of other locks. "
Best view in Seoul,"One of the best night view in the world! Very romantic atmosphere and nice place for couple to visit. Be careful about the timing, as there is a lot of people were waiting for the cable car."
A Sight to Behold,"Try to come before the sunsets so you can witness the colors of the tower. We hiked all the way up (it was difficult) but the sunlit scenery was beautiful, then took the cable car down. There are observation decks and another tourist spot at the top where they have the ""love locks"" (similar to the one in Paris). As the highest (if not one of the highest points in Seoul) you see a great view of the skyline. Definitely worth the hike up, you can take the cable car up too... but you'd miss out on the pathway going up, tiring as it is, the scenery was well worth it. "
A Must Visit,"Namsan Seoul Tower is an iconic landmark of Seoul which everyone should visit atleast once. For those healthy enough and in spring or fall, walking up Namsan is great exercise and fun. For others, you can always take the bus up located near Dongook University subway station. Near the base of the tower there are usually lots of Korean traditional performances and the eateries are pretty good. Be sure to only go up on a clear day as a good view is key to enjoying this elevation. Another option is to walk along the paths around Namsan which is pretty flat and full of nature. Whether with friends or family or alone, the walk is more than enjoyable. Best part... it's free. Sometimes the best things in life are free...."
Must do but,Can't really go to Seoul without experiencing this symbolic place. It's a bit of a madhouse going up and down because of the queues for the lifts but the view is worth it.
Very crowded with tourists,Our family of 5 stopped here as part of the Seoul City Tour bus hop on hop off route.We arrived about 3pm on a Sunday and was taken aback by the crowd.We looked at the views and checked out the souvenir and other shops in the tower. Didn't get a chance to go on the cable... There was a long queue for that too.Maybe we picked a wrong day to come. I probably would have enjoyed it more if it wasn't so crowded.
Expect very long lines,"It was a really nice visit but the que is quite long. Waited about 1/2 hr to take the elevator ascend (don't know what it's called). We should have walked but wanted to experience it. Another 1 hour wait for the gondola, again wanted the experience. If you don't care just take a bus to the tower or hike. Another que for going up the tower, about 20 min. Very nice view up top. The que to go down was about 45 min tho and no organization to the line so many people cutting in. They had cultural programs going on at the base of the tower and we caught some of it. Had chicken and beer at one of the restaurant there, memmm just ok. Took the bus down. Our only bus ride in Seoul and it was crowded but fine. Would have taken more buses but harder to figure out than the metro. Cabs are pretty cheap too. "
The mountain is more stunning than the tower itself ,Coming from Calgary where we have the Calgary Tower this tower seems small to me however the N Seoul tower is located in a cooler spot on a mountain rather than in the downtown city. It was pouring rain today so I did not bother to go up and view as it was foggy and misty. From what I saw around its ok but not a big deal for me. 
 spent 2 hours there,interestingly we spent 2 hours here.. don't expect something out of the ordinary.. went to the observation deck and one of the toy place with action figures and kids figurines (not worth it)nice place to spend some family time
Good to visit on a sunny and clear day,"The day we visited was too foggy, so we're not able to see much. It seems we should visit again on a sunny and clear day to enjoy the panoramic view of Seoul. "
Calming and Beautiful!,"We took a cable car up to N Seoul Tower and when we reach the top, the view is amazing! You could pay about 500 won to see a better view of Korea! It was calming to see the streets and how small we actually are! The perfect place to snap some good photos to bring home!"
Seoul Tower,It is a great view from the top even if it is a bit hard to get too. Cable car was the option I chose to use. Certainly a popular spot to visit. 
A view to kill for,"Recommended to take the cable car to the top as it offers you a beautiful view of Seoul city. The love lock terrace and the cutely shaped candy floss is a must go for couples before entering the tower. Hello Kitty lovers can have a great time taking pictures with the life-sized Hello Kitty, collect stamps and have memorabilia with the photo booth that imprints your picture on a card. Up at the tower, the aerial view of Seoul takes your breath away. A must go for all tourists. "
Great view of Seoul and the Cherry Blossom,We like high towers from where you can view the city. Taking the cable car up and down to nearby the tower was easy and the view from the tower was great. We like the blooming gardens arount the tower.
Spectacular views ,An amazing hike up to the north Seoul Tower.Beautiful views and the gorgeous canopy of cherry blossom trees.Again worth the walk and the panoramic views of the city
Raining Visit,"The cherry blossom from the road up to the hill top. But it raining on the day which is can't ready admire the flower. There are still many people at the hill top trying their best to enjoy the misty scenery of the city.The lock is also selling well even though it is raining, as visitor is trying to be romantic to lock up their partner.It is waste can't ready enjoy this tower."
Amazing View!,"N Seoul Tower has the most amazing and exhilarating view of Seoul, and there was so much to do around it!"
Worst thing I did in Seoul. ,"Long lines, upsells on pictures and other items. Thereis no outdoor observation deck and the windows were filthy. Photography from the top of the tower was pointless. More long lines to get cable car back down. If you want to go take a taxi to the base and just enjoy the outdoor views from there. It will save you hours of frustration. The only positive thing I can say is that the cable car and tower ticket weren't expensive. I have no problem paying and waiting for a great experience but this wasn't even good. "
Touristy but fun walk,A fun time but very touristy and rather expensive for what you get. The walk up/down is great though and really worth doing. Consider going up on the cable car and walking down.
Not quite the Seattle Needle,"My friend and I ventured here on a cold day, and what a trek. It was hard to find at first and we got ripped off by a taxi driver that drove around in circles. What should've been 3,000 Korean won, turned out to be 10,000 won. The bus is your best bet of transportation. It was a beautiful walk, hilly, and cold but I've crossed it off my bucket list. When it finally came to view, it doesn't compare to the other towers I've been to in the US. It's supposed to be built somewhat on the basis of the Seattle Needle. There is definitely no comparison. Smaller than we thought, and the way to get up the tower seems like a maze and the signs weren't all that clear. VERY small lookout tower. Good variety of eatery and shops. If not anything but to experience it, don't make it your priority. There's plenty of other sights to see. "
"Cool,serene,romantic place","Easily reached by bus from Myeongdong.At nightime,travel by bus allows you to see thhe beauty of Seoul as the bus goes up the trail.."
Best place to visit in Seoul ,This is the only place in Seoul that we appreciate. You can have the best view of the city. Perfect place. Cozy ambiance. Foods are also sold at the place. We decided to walk down back to feel the nature. Well maintained . 
"A view from above, and that's it","We visited the tower since we want to see seoul from above. And we did. It was cold in the beginning of spring and there's not really much up there then the view. There's convenience store, some restaurants, popcorn, candies, and well the view. There's garden below or use the cable car to reach the top. Pay some money again for the tower and on the top is kinda small. Comparing with Tokyo skytree or Tokyo tower, they seem to have more to offer. Still, we enjoy the view from above, it's just gorgeous during sunset and when the nigjt is coming, lights from the city are too. "
Cherry blossom trip up the NamSan mountain. ,"Best is take the tram up, fast and fun. Great view of Seoul, there are parks and coffee, ice cream at the top."
360 sundowner,"I had an absolutely fantastic time watching the sun go down from so high in the sky. Watching the city light up was also incredible. You really get a grand view of the bustling city and while you can't see it, you can feel the city's energy. Oh and it's super romantic. There are some restaurants and bars at the top so you can spend hours up there and there are many places to take photos! "
N Seoul Tower,"This is another must-see stop in central Seoul. Arrive first thing in the morning to take the first cable car to the top, to avoid crowds. If you can, walk back down the mountain. Beautiful views of the city from the tower."
Hmn,It is not the best when you have to stay in long line ane there is a space at the top up to max 200-300 people? Nice view but not the best.
Worth the Uphill Battle,"My family & I went with a friend to N Seoul Tower at night & it is fantastic. According to our friend, the view is normally foggy because of the dessert sand that blows from China but with luck, we werr able to get clear skies & a wonderful view of Seoul.Totally, it was organized & well maintained. The only hindrance we had was that we are not used to the weather because we live in a tropical country so for us, 14 degrees is a bit cold & we had to wait in line outside for our gondola to take us down & we couldn't get shelter from the cold because we would loose our spot.Overall, I would recommend this to any first time travels to South Korea!"
Awesome view of Seoul,It's my second time here. My first time was over 20 years ago. It is an awesome place offering great views of the city. It was very crowded this time round with long lines snaking up the stairs leading to the cable car boarding station. The boarding process could be done better and safer in my opinion like having a holding area with set number of people held in a room or something safer instead of having people stand in long lines along the Verona stairs which I consider as a potential safety hazard. Overall a memorable experience and brought back seeet memories when I was younger then Would have given 5 stars if not for the excrutiatinf long wait times snaking up various stairways. Hope the boarding process will improve. Another thing is when u buy food or snacks I was not able to find a trash can!
Reminds of HK's Peak but better!,"I personally prefer this peak to HK's Peak as the view is better and the selection of restaurants and things to explore are more interesting. It invites people to leave love locks on the railings and has a romantic atmosphere. I went at night and they were many young couples, families exploring the place. The view was great as it oversees the city's lights. I took a bus up from Changdeokgong, but walked down. The walking isn't easy if you have bad knees as it's steps all the way so if you are travelling with elderly, please take a bus or cable car down instead of walking. Walking is nice as you will walk along the old city walls and it brings me to Myeongdong directly so I ended the night with street food."
Namsan night life,Second trip to Namsan. First took the cable car and loved it. Second climbed the mountain. Don't recommend it if you have trouble breathing. Because the breathtaking views will take anything else you need to make it to the top. Fun things to do as shown by a couple of my pics. Italian restaurant was delicious and I felt the price was reasonable considering the atmosphere and relaxing view.
Expensive and similar view at top of nearby hill,"We didn't go up as it was very expensive and there was a set of stairs up a hill pretty much next to the tower which offered a very similar view for free. I would also say it is not the worth the trip to see just the tower, there are a few parks and recreational rooms (karoake, pc rooms, bars etc. ) nearby to make going to this part of Seoul worth it."
Sunset at N Seoul Tower,We took the cable car to reach the Tower. We took beautiful pictures and watched the sun to fade. There were a lot of lovers or tourists chose to walk up or down the hill in order to see the beautiful view alongside. 
Great views of Seoul,We went up on hazy morning in March and it cleared to see a great view of Seoul. It's a bit cheesy with touristy things. But it's worth a visit. Take the cable car up and walk down close to the Seoul wall. 
Great view,If you want to see Seoul - this is a great place to go in order to get an overview.The price is ok and the trip up is efficient! If in Seoul - a must see!
Must see,Symbol of Seoul. Must see. I went for the sunset and that's worth it. Beautiful view even if you dont go up the tower.
Great View,"After a long walk/climb, we reached this cale car center.is a very nice and chilling place in Seoul."
Stunning views at night,Stunning 360° view of Seoul at night. Good public transport connections or the use of a cable car. You can take s walk through the gardens. Plenty of gastronomic choices with a restaurant at the top of the tower affording 'out-of-this-world' views; pricey but worth every penny!
Fantastic!,"We went to N Seoul Tower last Sunday. Apart from the beautiful views we could have at the Tower, there was a traditional Korean performance at the podium. The show was authentic and fantastic! I am not sure if you still can watch the show this week, but sure you can see the cherry blossom!"
Half day visit,"N Seoul Tower can be accessed by two ways, by walking or taking the Namsan Cable Car. Besides providing excellent views of Seoul and beyond, there are also opportunities to try on the traditional Hanbok for some candid shots (Free of charge), as well as for couples who wish to declare their eternal love by leaving locks in specially designated areas.Overall, definitely well worth a visit - at least for half a day."
Great view of the city!,"The N Seoul Tower is a great place to visit when in Seoul. You get a wonderful 360 degree view of the city and it's quite beautiful. You can buy many souvenirs and you can even eat at the restaurant near the top. The price is reasonable, though not cheap. Overall, II'd recommend this to anybody visiting Seoul for sure. "
Night View From The Sky,"If You want go to N Seoul Tower better around afternoon like 5:00 PM or 6:00 PM (South Korea Time) and you must go to the observatory, because night view from observatory is beautiful view"
"Lovely spot, quite touristic too","After a nice and long hike, you arrive in this kind of park with this quite big tower. The view is magnificent, and we took amazing pictures with our friends. It was quite a sunny day so we were also very lucky."
So-so,"Very personal opinion:After getting off the train, we were told we could walk to the cable car, and so we did. At -15C, we walked uphill, and when arrived at the cable car's ticket I was sweating and took off my jacket -- it was quite an uphill walk!!! But of course you have the option to take the cab, and on other side there's an elevator from down the road going to cable car tickets.The cable car ride has nice views esp during the time of our visit -- winter and snowing. I think thats my favorite part. There's another charge to go to the observatory deck which we chose not to because you can already enjoy the view after the cable car. I rate it average because it's just like a mall or some kind of commercial area at the top of the mountain. It's not like you're going ski down. That ""hike"" we did was not compensated with what I saw. Again, just personal opinion. I also dont think this is a good place to visit when you have (even a bit of) walking issues. Average because it's not a place I'd return to even without that uphill walk. "
Great Hike With Great City Views.,"Hiked this area a few times during my visit. Great exercise, great views and a very cool area. Totally enjoyed the whole area around the Tower. "
Worthwhile visit!,Excellent view for the top. Enjoy seeing all the love lockets. Excellent Korean buffet in the dining room.
Great views at dusk,"Went up in the cable car and had time to lock around, get a ton of pics with the love locks(!) and watch the sunset over Seoul.A short trip back down the mountain by cable car as the lights twinkled in the sprawling city below was a great sight.Be sure to head to the nearby night market to indulge in a wide array of Korean street food .... delicious!"
"Great view, but observatory not worthwhile","You get great 360 views of the city. The city lights at night are amazing, but you don't need to pay to see the observatory. You get great views just from outside for free. If you go at night, the lights from the candy shop inside the observatory causes a lot of glare on the windows and interferes with you being able to see much or take good pictures. "
"I'm on top of the world looking, down on creation ",This is a pretty cool place to go to. We took the tram up to the top of this hill. It had about a 45 min wait and it was a 10 min ride. Then walked around and found a place to put a lock on the fence with the tens of thousand other people. Then took the elevator to the observation tower. It was a little overcast but they mark the major cities and the distance. This was pretty cool. When we were done we walked down the hill. It was a really nice afternoon.
N tower,Beautiful sceneryIt's nice place to visit. You can see city view from the top. It's must go places of Seoul. 
Ok place ,Not real crazy about this place. Food was great a bit pricy but to many people and long lines to get down 
Get your Exercise On as well as a Great View of Seoul,"This was a really great part of Seoul to check out. You will get your exercise hiking to the top to check out the views. There are some great deals for tickets at the main office (popcorn & beers, etc). At the top, you can see Seoul 360, as well as some craft beers, foods, and souvenir stores. One of the highlights of my trip, however, once you get to the top, we had issues trying to leave. The line was constantly backed up and took 1-2 hours to actually get out of there. It is open till 11pm, so you can check out a sunset or the skyline all lit up. A good stop to check out if you are in town, rather inexpensive with good views. Bonus: The color of the tower is suppose to coincide with the quality of air (Green = good, Yellow = not so healthy, Red = Bad). "
Nice Place,The place was nice. My kids enjoyed walking around the venue and the love locks are also cute for couples
Suitable for family day out,"We were there last weekend (nice sunny day) and they had a festival on, long queue for the cable car around 40 minutes. Each cable car that arrives are packed to the max. Once at the top, there are a few family friendly attractions near the base of the tower. A few restaurants around if you're hungry. Also, there's actually a lift to go up to the cable car station from the other side near a tollway rather than climbing the hill from train station, we only found it when going down. Worth visiting, maybe better on a weekday when there's less people. "
the best spot to see seoul.. stunning!!,to get to the top you have to climb about 400 metres.....for me.. it's a bit tiring in the beginning...climbing while you deal with very cold weather...but the ambience is sooo beautiful.. the snow that fall everywhere.. on the ground...on the trees.. on the bench.. and the scenery...made this area one of the best place in Seoul... when I reached the top...I'm speechless.. it's stunning!!you can see the whole city!!you can climb to love lock wall by a stair.. but the price of the lock is soo expensive...so.. just enjoy the view...and have a cup of coffee and snack around!!A MUST VISIT.. RECOMMENDED!!
Nice views ,Skyline beautiful of the city. Recomendable. We go half a day and we take the cable car. Very nice trip to do in the city 
Great view of Seoul,"There's not much to say, take the cable car up, unless you enjoy long walks up steep hills....Once you pay for your ticket and head up, it's like every other tower in the world, it provides an excellent view of the surrounding city. Enjoyable way to spend an hour."
fantastic place,"this is an excellent place to visit, the food in the restuarant is very good and has a large range it suit all palates. The view is stunning and it is a must doo when visiting Seoul"
Waste of effort,"Stupid cable car cannot handle the volume of visitors. 40+ Tourists packed into the cable car, no chance to take photographs or enjoy the scenery. Not children friendly at all. Coming down was the same 40+ packed into the cable car after queuing for 30+ mins.... coming down was a relieve. "
Great,It's nice place to visit. You can see city view from the top. It's must go places of Seoul. Near itaewon tourist area 
Must visit place ,"This is a place with a lot of potential. It is a good place with beautiful views, restaurants and a piece of Seoul vibrant."
After the rain,"If you're near, go there! If there's been no rain for some time, skip it...you won't see very much. Go a day or so after a good rain and you'll be able to really see Seoul. And plan on dining there, too!"
Make sure you visit on a clear day!,"We visited N Seoul Tower on a slightly foggy day and the view wasn't all that awe-inspiring to be honest. It was pretty romantic to watch the sun go down and see the city light up though.We had to take a subway, then a taxi and then a cable car to take us to the tower. Overall it cost the two of us around 27000W, only to find out that we would have to pay another 10000W EACH just to go up the bloody thing. Unnecessary extra cost in our opinion as the view from its base was pleasant enough, especially from the cable car. Generally, a nice thing to do in the evening but don't expect to be blown away."
N Seoul Tower amazing,A must in South Korea the N Seoul Tower is a must especially at sunset.You must take the Cable car up to the tower to admire the views going up and of course the views going down. Beautiful shops there. Fantastic pizza place. Hello Kitty fans will enjoy the hello Kitty shop. They have everyone covered. The views are truly spectacular.
"Nice views, not much else","Similar to other towers in Korea. I think they must all be run by the same company. Nice views, but overall, not much else. You walk around, look out, and then go back down. "
Top of Seoul,"Great view. Couples can buy a lock and express their love by writing some nice words on it, then lock it at the bridge. You can visit the tower but nothing special. A few resturant there if you want to take a break. Cable car serve both way and cost 6,000 won for single trip and 8,500 for two way. "
Wonderful night time,"If you're up for a hike, this is one of the places that you can visit. However, if you're not in shape, you can opt to ride the cable car up to the tower where you'll be rewarded with a stunning city view, cold wind and colorful light display. The place can be packed with people, so choose your time and date wisely."
A must visit in Seoul,"A great view, and also very romantic. They sell little writeable padlocks where you write the name of your wife and yours. You then lock the padlock to a specially designated location to symbolize everlasting love. It is very popular with couples. My wife and I added our padlock. "
Awesome city view ,"If you are in Seoul, try to visit the Seoul Tower for a breathtaking view of this vibrant city. Located at the outskirts, this place is little difficult to get in, but provides a grand view overlooking this bustling city "
Most Visit in Seoul,I liked thia place. It was a great place to relax and take pictures. The place was so clean and so refreshing. There are other thing to do and look at on top aside form taking pictures. The addition of the Love Lock Zones gives couples an extra reason to visit this place
it is a good exercise to walking up to the Tower,It is a must visit. View Seoul from the Tower. Do not forget to pledge your love and loyalty to your love one by purchasing the lock and seal it at the Seoul tower. You may come back a few years later and notice..hey my lock is still there. Great view and it is also romantic place to be.
Nice views ,Views from the tower are good. I visited in the late evening where it's almost dark with city lightings can be seen. I would recommend to go around 5 PM depending on the season when there is sunlight and stay until dark to enjoy both views. During spring I heard this mountain one which tower is located is full of flowers like cherry blossoms however I visited in feb and it's bone chilling cold. Also there is a locks areas once you come down from the tower quiet similar to the one in Paris. Views from this locks area is great. 
The best part of our trip,"This is a really must do, the walk from Myeongdong is about ten minutes after that you get like an type of card elevator that takes you to the main area were you purchase ticket for the cable car. You will then take it to the top, you also habe the optiom to hike up. Once you get to the top you can actually see the city and other beautiful things that the tower has to offer. We did not when up to the tower itself because there was so much to see and do. We had the best hot chocolate and they have churros. Best time to go is night time. "
Nice View,"I went there with my kids around December 2016. We took the bus there and it was quite tedious to walk up the slope during cold weather. We had a cup of coffee to warm ourselves up before going to the top point of the tower. There are several shops and restaurants there but unfortunately, one of the store owners (located on the first floor) selling accessories and souvenirs was not friendly. Nevertheless, we didn't let this affect our mood. The scenery at the top is so beautiful. It was nice and we bought quite a few souvenirs from the store there. We also visited the Hello Kitty Island located on the first floor which is so adorable. We all love Hello Kitty & Friends. We spent about an hour there taking pictures. My kids enjoy it so much and have been sharing with their daddy (who missed it) since then lol...he is so jealous about it. We will be going there again (and with daddy this time of course)!"
"Romantic, Engaging, Great views!","Seoul has more romantic attractions seemingly built for couples than any other city I've visited. Namsan tower has great views--either at night or during the day! You can even walk up the hill like we did, and it's not a bad hike."
Family with young kids,Nice view at nite n its super cold.Quite tiring to walk up e hill with the kids but its a great experience.Kids enjoy e place n will come again but by cable car to go up.
Great fun!,"Visited here on the Seoul City Bus Tour. Very fun to go to the top and look out over the city. Definitely a tourist trap, but worth the money! "
Cool,"The time I went there is mid March.. the weather is approx from 0 to 10. temperature go lower after late noon. We take the cable car accross and see the Tower in night time. We didnt go to the top point. However we can see the beautiful scenery from the cable car along the way and reaching point can also see the beautiful Seol scenery, kids game arcade and 3d large screen also available. "
Decent views but gets very busy,"It can be a little tricky for a foreigner to find the cable car access, but of course you can choose to walk all the way up if youre feeling fit ! The views are good from up the top and there are food places to eat. The love locks all over the place make for good photos as well, or even placing one yourself! You can buy them from the gift shop there, so no reason to bring your own. "
Interesting piece of art,They managed to make the ordinary something extraordinary. Koreans are good in making a scratch to form an art. It is nice to see lock pieces transformed into a tree or a nice backdrop of a wall on the bridge.The tower is just a place to have a glimpse of the entire Seoul.
Awesome view,Cable car ride was very nice with a great view. The view from the top of the tower was great. There are some places to have a drink and some food. You will have to climb some stairs but there is an elevator for parts of the climb.
"If in Seoul, you should visit",Nothing fancy but the locks that were displayed to show love was an amazing sight to see. The tower showed the view of Korea and i am not a big fan it. Same like burj khalifa. 
Scenic view,"Enjoyed the trail up. View is fantastic, the feel is so romantic. Dreamlike view @4pm. I bet this place looks better at night w/ all the lights! Will definitely be back & visit this night time "
Worth the visit,Get a great view of the city to see how big Seoul really is.We went at night very cool with all the city lightsThe cable car ride to the tower is nice but if you take the back roads to the cable car you better be in shape cause the hills are very steepNot sure about having dinner up there didn't hear anything or anyone talking about it 
Iconic landmark,"Although I never ventured into the tower, it stands out in the city with such grace and elegance. especially at night time and a great opportunity for photographs.Standing below gives you the perspective of how tall the building it is, I would imagine on a clear day the views would be spectacular."
Nice enough,The tour was hyped as being fun and interactive but it was more.p. Li he than anything else. The sheer magnitude of steps made this challenging.
Visit in spring,The tower is easily accessible. If you don't like to walk the cabs and buses can drop you in frunt of cable car. Otherwise there is a scenic walking path. The scenic beauty is due to cherry blossom trees planted all around the tower. I visited in March. Cherry blossom bloom around april. Unfortunately there was not much to see. If you are visiting in winters . Give the place a miss. View is worth it during spring. 
Beautiful at night,"This is THE landmark in Seoul. You can get there by bus or better still, and if you are up for it, then I would recommend walking. If you find yourself there during the day it is a great walk, uphill though, through the park, relaxing and peaceful. If you get there in the evening then for sure you will find the best spot for some good photos. The tower has different beautiful lights, and on a clear day/night, you will enjoy the view of the city from there."
Seoul searching: a solo traveler's diary,"I woke up early one autumn morning and did a lot of research how to go to Namsan tower. As i was staying near Chungmuro station i just walked to Daehan Theater and waited for the bus that will take me to the tower. Asked a lot of locals where the bus was parked and to no avail, i wasn't able to get a clear answer. Took a taxi instead and a very polite ahjussi dropped me off near the gates of Namsan park and told me that taxi can't go beyond that point and i should take the bus. What a day! I couldn't get into a bus on the first place, now it's the bus again? So i've decided to take a hike and climb my way up. It was the longest 25minutes of my life. The wooden stairs seem so endless as well as the cemented one. I was literally gasping for breath when i reached the foot of tower, but worth the climb once i saw thousands of love locks in different colors and sizes, shown in dramas like Legend of the blue sea, Oh my ghostess and My love from another star. I then rode the elevator going to the observation deck and watched the city of Seoul from up there and the very colorful Namsan mountain. The maple trees were in colors red, orange and yellow. I had a hard time going up, but it was all worth it. For some of you who doesn't want to experience the long walk i did. There's a cable car station in Myeongdong that will take you right up to the foot of the tower. Don't fail to visit this beautiful site when you're in Seoul. I made sure i won't and i didn't."
Great for pictures!,"You can walk over to the lift from Myeongdong subway station. Take the lift/walk up the stairs to get you tickets for the cable car (you could hike up the hill if you want). The cable car ride was fun. Once you arrive, you just have to walk up a couple of stairs and you'll have plenty of places to take pictures. We could see much of the view as we went in the day and it was very hazy. There are F&B options there so you could have lunch/dinner there. We had ours at the restaurant that gives a panoramic view of the skyline. The meal was delicious and the view was unfortunately cloudy because of the haze. But I'd definitely recommend going up at least once. It makes for great pictures!"
pretty night view,"we go in winter season. day view was beautiful with snow covered landscape, but night view was just breathtaking. to see millions colourful light up the city and that tower is just pretty to look up to, especially in cold winter night."
Terrific Night View,"Walking from Myeongdong subway about 15~20 mins, better to go during sunset and at night, romantic view, prepare time for waiting during peak hour about 60 mins but worth it! "
Prepare for a long walk ahead,You may talk a cable car on your way up and down from Namsan Tower. I suggest going there late afternoon/early evening. Take the cable car on your way up and walk the trail on your way down to be amazed of the view that you are about to see. Really worth it!
At long last.... I was finally here.,"I tried different way to get here. Since I arrived very early in Seoul from Busan through a bullet train, walked from Seoul Station to the Seoul Tower... while walking, i passed by locale jogging and exercising in the cold morning. There, I had the most steps recorded in my Samsung Health App: 30,980. The wind was cold, while walking towards the destination, I saw the whole City... it was very beautiful... That trees without leaves yet... oh my God... i really love it."
Worth the long journey,"N seoul tower, have always seen it in korean dramas, definitely worth the reputation and the journey.We all loved it, the view, the locks..everything was amazing.Visited in Summer of 2015"
Fun rides up the tower!,"We decided to visit N (New) Seoul Tower on our first day.It is located on the peak of Mt. Namsan and is one of the most representative landmarks of Seoul.There are three options on how to reach the base of the tower: take the cable car, hike it up for free or take the bus. We chose the first option as it was the sure way we wouldn't miss the sunset from the observation deck. In order to get to the cable car, we took an inclined outdoor elevator from the entrance for free. It took less than 2 minutes to reach the cable car station and 8,500 Won was all for the round-trip ticket. It started to snow on our way up and it was a bumpy ride because of the strong wind but the view was too awesome to even care about it. ^^ We hopped off at the base of the tower and we were greeted by thousands of love padlocks which is frequented by the lovers for their ceremonial confession and proof of love. #SEOULromantic @@MOVING ON we finally entered the base of the tower and proceeded to N Photo Studio where a staff took us a picture and had it photoshopped with the tower in the background. You may or may not buy it but Rachelle ordered one for us. We then aimed for the elevator to take us to the observation deck. Waiting to get in was another trip in itself as they projected a video as if you're about to launch into space. Imagine what it was like when we stepped into the elevator! I've no words, literally. ^^ See it for yourself. Video to be uploaded. ^^Reaching the observatory means taking in an excellent panoramic views of Seoul. The sky wasn't very clear but the sights were still awesome, at least for me! Hehe. I pictured Hyun Bin or Rain might be in one of those buildings. Or possibly Daniel Henney shooting his film. （＾∇＾）Furthermore, it is also the highest post in the world where you can send postcards to your loved ones. Climbing the N. Seoul Tower was a great way to begin our Korea trip. #SEOULfun #SEOULgood"
A must-visit when in Seoul City!,"The Namsan mountain is very popular for its panoramic views, nature park, high-tech facilities and cultural shows.TIPS TO ENJOY YOUR VISIT1. To go up, you can either ride a cable car or, if you’re in the mood for an intense work-out, walk up the pathway.2. Go in the afternoon and stay until early evening, so you can get a view of the city both during the day and the night. The view is so beautiful.2. Check-out the schedules of traditional performances. It's spine-tingling watching the shows especially if you're into K-drama.3. Don't miss the “padlocks of love” attraction. It's a nice area to take photos.4. End the night walking to the Myeongdong area, one of Seoul’s main shopping and tourism district."
looking the famous namsan tower,good place to see view of seoul cityi went there at night so i can see full of light from thereyou should go there if come to seoul. 
Worth the trip ,"We decided to get the cable car up.....waited 40 minutes in the queue! 5 minutes later we were up the top & got some great views of Seoul city. We had a wander around the shops & had a coffee while we waited for the sun to go down. We looked at all the love locks & all the couples taking selfies It was a lovely way to spend a few hours. We didn't go right up the top of the tower though as both of us are not great with heights like that & it cost extra. We did have a burger & chips there which wasn't great & a bit pricey, so don't plan to eat there if you can help it. There was a massive queue to get the cable car down so we decided to walk. So many steps! But so glad we didn't decide to walk up!!!!! I googled it & its about 639 steps!! We loved the walk down, stopping when we felt like it & marveling at the people walking up. Definitely worth a visit! "
Great view of the city,"It's a long uphill walk from myeongdong station to get to the cable car station. We heard that there's an elevator (oerumi) going up the staion but we didn't find it. Apparently it's on the other street from where we are. So from myeongdong station go to the road on the right of pacific hotel.. just go through that path ahead and when you see the CU store on your left, turn right to get to the other side where the elevator is ahead of you. Once you're on the cable car station.. buy your one-way or roundtrip ticket and the loading station is at the 3rd floor.Ride is very quick so even if there's a queu, waiting time is not really long. Once you're up, you'd be greeted by a great view of the city. The rails (and they even formed trees out of it) are filled with love locks! If you're with a love one, it's good to put a lock on it too to signify your unending love :) they sell locks there for 5,000 won to 15,000 won (couple locks). You can also bring your own!! (Budget tip)There are restaurants and other galleries on the plaza which you can also check out."
Nice Tower to Visit,We can reach this place by using tram/cable car or by bus then walking to the top of area. Good scenic here and many trees at the garden.We can see the whole of Seoul city from here
Good for a walk but not necessary to go up,The city view is just so so. Not really necessary to go up to the top of the tower. But good to take a walk to the tower. There's other view point you can take a photo of the city instead of going up. 
nice spot to see seoul,"It's typical tower. Go there at night to see amazing panoramic view of Seoul. It’s also accessible by bus and cable car but best way is by walking from Namsan Park, for about 20 minutes. The place has this Love lock like in france. So cute."
Korea beautiful Seoul tower ,"Amazing view from the TOP of Seoul tower ,have restaurant, arcades, photos taking in hanbok, and during the winter season visit is nice and wonderful. Can take a lot of nice pictures;-)!"
Not much to see inside but the walking trail up/down to the tower is beautiful,"I went when it was raining and cold at night but there were still lot of people.There isn't much in the tower to see. Shops and dining places are kind of lame. But the Starbucks in there has windows and balcony with.a good view.After getting there on a cable car, i decided to walk down. I walked pretty briskly and it took less than half an hour to get down to the cable station on the ground level. Pretty dark when I descended in a rainy day and I was a little worried about safety but as I walked down I saw quite a few local couples taking a walk up. The pathway gives you pretty good view of the city. And the trees along the path make the walk very refreshing. Strongly recommended!"
Best Viewpoint to see Seoul,I wish i could have seen the place during an evening tour because the view from up there is spectacular. Unfortunately my visit was not for leisure and was for work. There are love locks everywhere so be sure to purchase a lock set and place a mark there. There is also a beautiful scenic bus/car ride down.Definitely a must do while in Seoul !
Beautiful view ,Go there in the night at God weather and you will have a beautiful view of Seoul. A must visit of you are around
A must go Place,"Instead of taking the cable car, I went there by climbing the stairs...it was a bad choice BUT I'm not regretting my choice because it was a spectacular view and experiences! I mean I know you can get the same view if you're using the cable car but it is all up to you..but for me, it was really close to nature and you can see the eldest holding hands like a real relationship goal..duh...since my guesthouse just around the corner so it's really handy. When I was there, I went for 3 packages which includes the Hello Kitty Island (a too much pink-ish place for people who are hate pink), Ssen Toy Museum (yassss! Marvel fan, Star Wars alert!) and Observation deck!..Surprisingly at the Hello Kitty Island was a fun place to enjoy..while the Ssen Toy Museum a place that so amazing..imagine the life size of iron man..okay i need to stop..so the last stop will be the observation deck was well yeah..if you used to go any ob.deck so just the same...when i went down, the surrounding for this tower as you already knew, the lock-ish for couple things, but also good for taking pictures!"
Beautiful views,"Such a cool place to see the entire city. Loved the ""lock of love"". We rode the bus up and walked all over. It's a must see in Seoul. "
The view is fantanstic!,We went there at night. You can either purchase a ticket for the cable or just walk up to the tower. The waiting line wasn't that long. Bring your own lock or purchase one at the store if you are planning to put love lock there. 
Stunning views of Seoul,"Went to the top on the hop on hop off bus tower, worth the ticket price 12,000Kwon on its own! Clear day. Highly recommended. Suggest do early in your trip, to help get your bearings."
Eh,"To be honest, it is not worth going all the way to the top of the tower. My boyfriend and I have been there and we would've rather stayed on the base of the tower and just ride the cable cars! There is a small teddy bear museum tho."
"Touristy, ""Must-See"" List at least once","I admit - I've only come here once in my 4 trips to South Korea - however, if you're just visitng for the first time - you can't NOT do it... it's a tourist ""trap"" but also a must-do. During the day you cant take the ride up the mountain via cable car, and there are buses you can take back down."
"Must See, Great Views",Seoul Tower is a must see in Seoul! There are great views and lots of different things to do while visiting the sight. Lots of couples visit and place there love locks around the area as well. 
Visit at night to enjoy stunning views of Seoul city,You need to negotiate a steep climb of about 100 meters from the last point where you disembark from your bus/car to be greeted with this mammoth structure built in 1969 for telecommunication purpose. A superfast elevator will take you up the observatory from where you can enjoy stunning beauty of Seoul city at night. 
Stunning view at night,"We took the cable car up, and the view from the cable car was beautiful. Needless to say the view from Seoul Tower was beyond words. They even have a loo with a view :)"
Not impressed,Went up and unfortunately the glass panes were all dirty and could hardly enjoy the view unless it is seen at night which is unfortunate.
nice tourist area,"Everyone at one point must see the N Seoul Tower. It's one of those places that you just need to see. It's great for views. Go on a clear day. It's a lot of walking, so be prepared. It's also a steep climb, either with or without steps. Depends upon which side you walk. This is definitely one of those places that you need to see. "
Great views,Easy access to the tower.Cable car and elevator. You can take great pictures on a clear day.Nice view and souvenir shop.
MUST GO & MUST SEE!!,"The Admission: 10,000 won for the observatory entry. If you are not going up to the observatory, there is no fee to check out the surrounding area. There is cafe, shop and the famous love locket walls. The Tower: Standing at 236.7 meters tall, this is Namsan's main tourist attraction spot! You can enjoy a complete view of Seoul. Enjoy the laser show and beautiful nightscape of Seoul from the observatory on the second and third floors or in the revolving restaurant. The Location: Board Namsam Circular Bus 2, 3 or 5 or Namsam Cable Car"
Too crowded,"There are two common ways to go up to N Seoul Tower. 1) By cable car. The queue is long but it is moving quite fast. The only gripe is that you are being packed like sardines in the cable car and I didn't quite enjoy that. 2) By bus. Cheaper option as well. The bus is not crowded like the cable car. But the uphill hike of 5 mins is quite strenuous.Overall it is a great place to visit if you haven't been up. But otherwise, nothing too special."
Lovely view of Seoul,"You can take a buss or car.. or hike or ride a bike to it.. The tower is just a tower durring the day but is nicely lid durring the eveing.But the view of the city from the platforms at the bottom of the tower and at the top of the tower is very nice.We arrived early and it was quite crowded at the botom platforms.. When we came down from top of the tower it was very crowded.There are cofefee shop and a restaurant at the top, so you can recharge and have a nice view before you continue to explore Seoul."
Good call for a sunny day,"Very nice outside activity for a sunny day! To go there, just head to Myeongdong subway station, get exit 3 and grab bus number 5 at the bus stop outside this exit. The bus takes you to the top of the Nansam hill, it’s an excellent alternative if your are not in the mood for hiking. At the summit, there is a great infrastructure for tourists (restaurants, toilets, etc.). "
"Hike, Run, Walk.....then SEE ","Check the weather for your days in Seoul. On the most beautiful day forecast, make a day for Seoul Tower. You can access it from multiple directions in Namsan Park. You can hike up single track Trails, or walk up concrete stairs and wood stairs. You can even take a trolley if you spent too much time shopping.The restaurants are average, but the views are amazing! You can see all of Seoul from 360 degrees depending on where you are standing. If you are a couple, bring a lock you think you are with THE ONE. ;)"
Romantic Place to Visit,"A MUST Place to Visit, perfect for both day and night view.If you are a couple, night is the best time to visit N Seoul Tower, and during day time, it is advisable to be at the place around 10am at least due to group tours."
Beautiful tower!,"When I went there, it was snowing and I got so excited to take the pictures there and of course enjoy an amazing seoul from there."
Amazing view from the tower,This is the city landmark where all the tourist (and all couples) in Korea go. Went there on early March at night with super cold weather but still it was very crowded! You can reach to tower area by hiking or cable car. The view is amazing at night and there are many cafes and shops around the area 
A must see! Make sure to bring a lock!,"Located about 15 minutes from the subway, you can ride a cable car to the top, absolutely not recommended for those who are claustrophobic, or you can take a bus to the top. You can even walk to the top if you want but it's a rather steep climb. At the top you can purchase a lock to lock on the fences around the tower. There's plenty of shopping and food at the top, but I recommend eating elsewhere as it is cheaper. Some areas are crowded, but it was easy for us to find a quieter area."
Great experience,"I've been to KL Tower before, and it's just the same as N Seoul. I guess it's the typical tower experience. However the love locks area besides the N tower was so beautiful. "
Locks,"They have love locks here. ❤ If you are planning to go here, you can ride a bus and also walk from Myeongdong station. We did the walking. It was a 10 min uphill walk. If you also love walking, the. Try the walking, you'll see guesthouses on way up. But if you easily lose breath, go with the bus. Getting there was easy, so if you are planning to do the Cable car it is around 15,000krw for a 2-way trip. There is a fee of more or less 10,000krw in entering the observatory tower and they have a package that comes with popcorn and drink. You can also purchase a bundle ticket where in you'll be able to enter the other museums there but it will be a lot more pricey. I suggest, that if you're planning to go at top, go there before sunset. You can stay up until the sun sets. At night, it has a different scenic view as you can see the night lights but you'll have a hard time taking pictures because of the light inside the observatory, it reflects on the glass windows."
Check out the trail near the tower,"As a local tower itself, I think, is not that attractive. You can find a few nice mountain trails near the tower.. The short - walk mountain trails can take you to Grand Hyatt hotel, Shilla hotel and down town Seoul... From the most of short mountain trails you can meet nice picture of Seoul sky-lines of East, West, South and North... Get the fresh air in the mountain trails especially during Spring and Autumn times. In the early morning you can view nice sun-rise from the top of mountain trails (not hard to reach the top..)"
get ready for a hike to reach the cable car area,great place to lounge around and see seoul from above a tower.there is a great place for kids to play and a 4g screen open to anyonelots of tourists
Birds-eye view of Seoul,"This is the best place for a 360 degree view of Seoul. It really helps appreciate the size of this city. The available facilities are good, enabling visitors to decide the pace. If you enjoy uphill walks and have the time, then walk up the path from the park below. If you are short on time, then opt for the cable car to the tower. You will need tickets for everything, same as such towers elsewhere in the world."
Super Cold visiting the Seoul Tower,"Its super colder visiting here during winter time !! But the queue is not too long, just 10-15 minute waiting."
Stunning,"You don't have to spend any money unless you want to here, which is nice. We walked up from the millennium Hilton and it was about 1.5 miles....but a ton o stairs obviously. Some great shops and some amazing views at the top. There must be over a billion locks at the top secured to various places with writing on them for love. The cool this is you can buy a lock up there for about $8 and they give you a marker to write on it as you like."
Superlative of Seoul,"Yeah, it's the highest point in Seoul, making it one of the best destination you must go to as a traveller. This is a must see place if you just want to unwind and take a look at the vast sea of city lights sparkling in front of you. Couples, friends and visitors make time to visit the Love Locks to lock the infinite chance to fall in love with this loving place."
Breathtaking!!,One of the most beautiful places I've ever seen. Be sure to go up the cable car in the daytime. At night you can take a trolley to the top. Just wonderful. Don't miss it!!
Amazing view of Seoul,"it was 10 minutes walk from our hotel in myeongdong going to cable car station. we both two way ticket for the cable car. the two way ticket price has discount. i think the One way ticket is 6,000 won, while the 2 way (back & forth) ticket is 8,500 won, which is cheaper. If it was not that chilly cold, we could have just bought the one way ticket and walk down the hill and enjoy the amazing view. On our way via cable car, you see the amazing view of the city, we waited until evening even it was bone chilling to see the light of the N Seoul Tower. We explored the ground of the tower. Separate entrance fee for the hello kitty, but since we're not fan of hello kitty and we did not want to pay additional entrance fee, we didn't bother going inside. and also a separate entrance fee to go up the observatory. There was a traditional culture show, dance number when we arrived. Guests were invited to try the spear throwing activity, i was lucky to be one of the selected guests, even though i was not able to hit the bamboo in front with the heavy and long spear they gave me, I think I need more practice, I will sure hit it next time, haha :) There were restaurants and cafes around the tower.There is also a souvenir shop inside.There were shops that sell different colors of love-locks, but we brought our own locks. we hope to find it when we come back.We hope to be back on spring time or on cherry blossom."
It's a nice walk up and you'll have plenty of nice views at the top,walk up. it's a short hike and you should not turn around and enjoy the view before you're at the top! there's a free bus going down (if I remember correctly). This is a must-do in Seoul.
Walking from euljiro 3-ga to namsan s tower,Need more fitness to walking from guesthouse to this tower to see all the nature n surround of this area. Euljiro-myeongdong- namsan seoul tower
A Must Do!,"N Seoul Tower is one of South Korea's most iconic landmark, and is accessible through Namsan park, or by walking trail on the other side of the hill. Upon arriving to the top of the hill, there is a mini-mart where you can purchase that well-deserved Milkis after the hike up, or some common Korean souvenirs such as magnets, mini fans, and dolls. The actual tower has more of the higher end (read: higher priced) souvenirs you find at any national landmark. Hello Kitty Island was a bit disappointing, but am sure if you're a die-hard Hello Kitty fan, that won't matter. Up top, there is a French restaurant similar to the Stratosphere dining experience in Las Vegas. "
Vacation ,"I can't say that it's a great place, but not bad. On top you can see the whole city. But please be prepared to walk a lot and stand in a long queue. In Seoul, few people speak English and it was very strained. But overall it was exciting. I am not sure if I will come back again. "
Great view of the city,"Definite visit on the 1st day so you can get your bearings, and see the city in a Birdseye view. Also nice walk either up or my preference down the hill with blossoms everywhere"
a great place to hang out,"the n seoul tower is landmark of seoul, located on the top of the hill, you can go there either by cable car or bus. it is romantic place for couple"
Great view of Seoul,We went up on a nice sunny day but wi dows too dirty to get any good photos. Outside shots at base of tower were good though. 
Beautiful view,"Really recommending visiting Seoul Tower, a beautiful view from the top of the tower and around outside. A cool experience."
Awesome view and nice tourist spot,"The North Tower at Seoul was an interesting and fun place to visit. It was within walking distance from our hotel and took us about 25mins on foot. The cable car was fun to ride, which took us to and fro up the hill although you can hike it up or down. We purchsed love locks from up there and is hoping to visit it again in the near future to locate our locks! One can purchase locks from elsewhere, which I suppose would be cheaper rather than buying it from up there. Certainly one of the best places to visit when in Seoul. Cheers!"
Nice panoramic view of Seoul,"You can either get up to the tower by walking or by taking a cable car. We were going to walk but couldn't find the right path so we took the cable car instead. Even though the cable car service was quite organized, there was a long line and we had to wait for about half an hour before we could go up. The way up was nice and I got a lot of cool videos and pictures. We didn't have time to explore the ground floor of the tower (I did see a hello kitty store tho) but Im pretty sure there were a couple of restaurants or cafes down there. We quickly discovered that you also had to pay to actually go up in the tower which was annoying (since we had already payed for the cable car) but it didn't cost that much. We also had to wait in line to get to the elevator, maybe 15 minutes or so. The view is very pretty once you actually get up. You can see the whole city!! Everybody was taking pictures but the windows till didn't get too crowded. There was a candy store and a souvenir shop on the inner side, I didn't buy anything but there was a wide range of different goods. Overall the trip was fun. I've been to Burj Khalifa so it wasn't that mind-blowing for me but you got a cool view :) We decided to walk down but you can obviously also take the cable car. I think our experience would have been much nicer in the summer, when it's warm and the plants are green. I do recommend coming to the tower... but maybe not in the winter. *visited with my dad*"
Amazing views at night.,Didn't go all the way to the top as was too late for it. But pretty sure that I wouldn't spend that much with 4 of us just to go a bit more to the top. Walk and views are great from that point already 
Great place to visit,Went here with my wife before we got married. It was a very nice place to walk around and enjoyed the experience a lot. Remember going up by cable car and it provided a very nice view. Couples would usually sign a lock with a message and lock it on the fence. Totally surprise seeing all the locks on the fences..
"Nice view, it was snowing in February 2017","The tower was part of a tour package we purchased. The have a fence at the bottom with locks of love where they gave thousands of locks from couples, photo attached. The view from the tower is great, next time I will go at night"
Scenic view of the city,This is a good spot to go to when you have done a lot of walking for the day & just want to slow down. It has a great 360 degree view of Seoul including it's skyscrapers & mountains. I took the Seoul City Tour Bus to N Seoul Tower which stopped just under the hill to the tower. Once there you will purchase a ticket to the observation deck which is on Level 5 & there will be a time slot allocated when you can go in.Upon existing you will see the love locks that are quite famous at this tower & take some more photos here.
N-Grill,"Very romantic restaurant. You might think it gets old to go to the same expensive restaurant for special occasions but it doesn't. That panoramic view will keep you coming back time and time again, just like it has for my wife and I."
Terrible Experience!,"Go during the day. Night views aren't so great and the windows are very dirty, which inhibit good photos from being taken. Be prepared to wait....and wait...and wait...40 minutes to go inside, 30 minutes to get to elevator to go up, and 30 minutes to come back down. Too many people and very unorganized compared to all the other world towers we've been to. Such a shame :( "
Great climb and view at night,"Climbed the hill to the tower at night from the Cable car station as queue was very long. Great views all the way up. Took the lift to the observation deck on the tower (8,000 won). Note last entrance about 10.30 at night. Tower was crowded but good views over the city. Make sure you visit the toilets for the good view!! Also you can send a postcard from the tower. Caught the shuttle bus down. "
Not a must-do but a good time filler,"Being regular visitors to Seoul, we figured we should go and see N Seoul Tower eventually and were not disappointed. The tower features beautiful views of the city and is a great starting point for a walk in Namsan Park. Having said that, it would not make it onto my bucket list for a first visit. "
beautiful,view from up ..i can see part of seoul..lovelock are very colorful and its so beautiful..souvenirs are available too...
Must see,"The views are impressive, but it is kind of tacky. Perhaps if you don't take the cable car, and instead walk the trails, it would be more rewarding."
Awesome view of city skyline ,Nice place to hangout.... with friends is fun ..... with girlfriend is even more awesome.... must go place 
impressive view around!,"Nice view from the top, around a lot of shops and nice restaurants. Perfect to visit this place in the sunny day. "
Great,Went there one night in January so it was FREAKING COLD. I think it would be better to visit in the morning.
Highest place in Seoul,This is the highest place in Seoul whose top observatory is really proper to see around the Mega city. You can also enjoy lunch in the tower.
Nice view,"If you would like to have a pleasant view of the metropolitan Seoul, here is the place. The top of the mountain gives you a good view around, and on a good day, you can see as far as Incheon port, a neighboring sea port to the Yellow sea. Top of the tower gives you an observation deck and above it, a rotating restaurant. The food or the price at the restaurant is nothing to boast about. The whole place is usually overrun with Chinese tourists and tour buses, therefore if you choose a exercising walk up the slope, you might have to cope with the fume coming out of the buses."
Good to go by hiking course,"Namsan Tower is MUST visit place if you visit seoul for sightseeing. I really recommend climb to the top of the hill by walk. It take about one ~ one and half hour depends on the course. Several courses are well arranged and very ecological. Recommend to start to walk around sunset time and enjoy night sightseeing at the tower. When you go down, if you think you lost the right path, do not worry. Just go down any way, you will meet any road you can take taxi or bus. Just relax and enjoy. Total estimate hours for this hiking will be four to five hours. "
K-drama lovers must visit place,"Famous romantic place in Seoul. I'm glad that I took shuttle bus instead of cable car to reach mountain top of N Seoul Tower. The shuttle bus drove along the Namsan Park and the cherry blossoms is amazing, deeply amazed by the cherry blossom rain as the wind blows. The scene on top of N Seoul Tower was great. Recommend to go during evening so that you can see both Day and Night Seoul City's scenery. Definitely worth the visit. "
Dining with a spectacular view,"Upon entering the tower, you walk into an elevator that ""shoot"" you up the tower to the level where there is a beautifully laid out restaurant with a 360° view around it, overlooking the beautiful city of Seoul. The elevator has a screen on the ceiling that plays a video that entices you in feeling like you have been launched in a rocket up and out of the tower - spectacular!!The restaurant serves a wonderful variety of both Korean and Western cuisine, and as rivalled only by the spectacular views - especially in the evening, where the city lights form a bright kaleidoscope of colour!It is a wonderful experience, and a must in your to do's whilst experiencing a spectacular city."
Average touristy tower,We went there on a very clear night. The night lights of Seoul is average and the sight from the tower is nothing spectacular. The only interesting thing is the cable car which takes you to the tower. But expect long queues. You'd get bored on the tower after 30min. 
Nice,"A special attraction and is located on a hill. We can also see the sights of the city of Seoul which is very beautiful and lovely. Here also we can see performances of traditional Korean culture diverse and can try traditional Korean clothes for free. But the road to the tower, had to climb steep and not suitable for the elderly."
Nice to visit,"You can go there by cable car. Good place to visit, you can find a lot restaurants to eat something, should to visit if you go to seoul"
A must visit sight ,The trip was nice. Honestly I feel like Daegu Tower is a lot nicer and there's more to see but if you're in Seoul definitely stop by and get a picture at the needle. There was a good hamburger place inside that was super packed but other than that I spent about an hour touring the needle when in Daegu I usually spend about 2 hours or so. 
Spectacular,"Just like what other reviews have mentioned, it's the best to go when the sun is going to set and slowly go towards night. The view is the best! "
Romantic stop with great city views,"N Seoul Tower is a very popular place, where people put love locks all around the tower. When I visited last week it was extremely cold, so be prepared with warm clothes. There was a stand next to the fort offering free opportunity to put traditional Korean clothes and take pictures with the guards. I was luck to arrive just a few minutes before noon and I could put the hanbok on and participate in the drum ceremony. One of the guards was super nice and taught me how to play the huge drum and another person took pictures for me, it was super cool!You have nice views of the city from the tower and there are several locations with its distance in the windows. You can buy a postcard and mail from there to a loved one.The bottom of the tower has several floors underneath with a lot of restaurant and café options for food. I visited during the day, but it must have beautiful views of the city at night too."
Great walking trails ,I walked from the Grand Hyatt up to the Seoul Tower. Great trails and some amazing views of the city. I would recommend this for walking or jogging and just a nice place to catch some beautiful views.
Great site for night pictures,"Recommend going at night. I have gone up a handful of times now and it is great. Personally I have walked up each time while many people elect to catch a ride up. Not a back walk from USAG Yongsan and quite enjoyable views. The best views will be at night though. We brought our daughter along and she loved it as well. Stroller friendly and a great time. If you have never been up before, you need to go. "
Wonderful city view,"Namsan Tower is a landmark of Seoul. It is one of the tallest tower in the world and it has an elevator which takes you from the ground floor to the Observatory desk (236 meters high) in 25 seconds. Very, very quickly. From the top you can see all parts of Seoul. The view from there is wonderful."
Seoul view from the top!!,Seoul tower was among must visit place in our list during our south Korea visit. On reaching the top after going through a lot of queues we realized it has to be a must visit in Seoul. A complete 360 degree view of the city along with good options to dine and drink on the top. Do not forget to get your picture clicked with your city name on the glass around the wall.You can also experience the best undisturbed view from the washrooms. Try to reach before evening so that you can get beautiful sunset view as well.Would surely recommend this place while your visit to Seoul.
Lots of Climbing,"Not for the disabled. Getting to the tram station can be quite the hike uphill. Once you pay for your ticket, you queue up. It can take some time to get on the tram (30 minutes for us on a cold Friday night). When you get to the top of the tram more stairs to the Tower. I have to admit though the view is beautiful from here!"
Premium views on good days,"Before you head up to the tower, look around on the horizon, if you can see that it is clear, then a good day to head up, If it is hazy then leave the tower for another day. You can either walk up (free), take one of the 3 bus routes that go to the top (w1250), take the cable car (w8500) or a Taxi. The tower is open from 10am until well after sunset so great views of the city day and night. There are good views on either side without going up the tower, but for only w10000 go to the top and have a look all the way round."
Best view ever...,It was super cold that time when we visit...The view was amazing....Got a chance to make a souvenir wood photo of my family....Thank you...Great destination...
Amazing seoul view,This is the best place to get an amazing view of the city! It is well worth the walk and the cable car ride. We were here twice as we decided to view it again in the dark and it was incredible! I would recommend the night option!
So colourful locks,"This place is not only for lovers and couples but also for families. Other than the tower, they also have other attraction like hello kitty island. No halal food option for muslim. The tower itself is great. Great view of Seoul. Will surely come again when we are in Seoul."
It hard long walks to go up there,"I got misconduct from the google maps to go here then take the wrong bus, cause me to walk up there but it worth...45 minutes walk..there also got many old peoples walk and jogging there, at there if you lucky enough you can change to the free wear korean cloth, i forgot what was the name of the attire, and you may see the guard changing place, please buy souvenirs here, because some of the items there are rare..im regretting not buying teddy bears as i teddy bear collectors, at night this place amazing,shining changing light...dont comehere as solo it make you want the other half ;)"
Amazing dinner ❤️️,I love this place and I would like to live in Seul for to be a regular customer in this place ! I ❤️️ Korea !!! 
Beautiful place,Very beautiful place recommended to visit at night. Many tourist in there and many food if u hungry u can eat there.we use cable car to reach there.
"""lovely sight""",""" my family really enjoyed this place, although it's really cold when we got there last dec. 22,1016 but it's all worth it, we just can't help ourselves to take pictures, such a lovely place"""
Night view was awesome!!!!,"Recommended to visit at night for better view.Need really good stamina to climb at namsan tower, because no transport allowed at namsan tower area."
A lot tourist these days,Half the people here are tourists. The crowd of people is quite large. Otherwise it nice to visit either during day time or night time. 
Good place to see seoul,Good place to see seoulyou can see mega city seoul in a viewunder the tower are locks to remember lovers love
Nice to see but I wouldn't say it is a must do,"This tower offers a nice view on the whole city but well; there isn't much to see. To be honest, the city doesn't look exceptional from the observation floor... A bit disappointed. But the night view is nice! Small tip: if you bought the t-money card (for transportation in Seoul), you have a small -10% coupon to the price of your entrence ticket in the small box. ~"
Great View,"View from the Tower is awesome Better to go on a clear day to get the most of the view. Activities around the tower are great, very technology orient also fun for the kids."
To see the entire city,"As the N Seoul Tower is very central in Seoul, it enables you to see the entire city from a 360 degree view. If you are in Seoul for the first time, try the cable car that takes you to the top without having to do the big hike from the bus stop!"
well worth the visit,"This was an amazing place to visit, well worth braving the -12C temperatures! With breathtaking views of Seoul and a great restaurant I would recommend anyone to go. We went at night and the lights across the city were spectacular"
Amazing to see over Seoul ,"This again is one of those must see places in Seoul.. you must take an adventurous steep walk to get up but once your up the view is amazing. Might be difficult for those having difficulty walking distances. One of the things I loved most was buying the locks with two keys and attaching it to the millions of others while keeping the key.. Nice snacks, ice cream and churos await you at the top and plenty of photo opps "
Great sunset!,"I was not too enthusiastic about going to this tower, I have been to just so many over the years, for me they're not that special anymore tbh. You can catch some local buses to the top of the tower, green buses 2, 3 and 5. The bus routes are in English and Korean at the bus stops, super cheap!! 1200won I think. Much cheaper than the cable car and, if you're lazy like me, easier than walking!!When we arrived there was a traditional military performance, swords, pikes and other such things. Highly entertaining! Not sure if it is a common occurrence or I was lucky because it was the lunar new year. But there was also a chance to try on the traditional dresses for free! These experiences really made the trip to the tower special.There are a lot of whimsical romantic things to do. Me and my boyfriend are not really interested in the love locks (they are very expensive and they get taken off after a short while to make room for more) so the whole thing stank like a money grab, guilt trip hoax. But that's just us =P many people there seemed to enjoy the ""romantic"" stuff. Different strokes I guess.Try and go on a clear day, the sunset is very nice. Windows are dirty though!!! My iPhone SE took way better photos than my boyfriends expensive camera!"
Great views for sunset/nightime,worth taking the Namsam cable car up to the tower. inside there are plenty of resturants and shops even if you dont intend to go up the tower. 
Great view,"Sensational view from the top. We were using the hop on hop off Seoul city bus and bought our ticket with our bus ticket and saved 1000KRW per person. Not much up there, but it's a great view. Just shows you how huge Seoul really is! There's places to eat but they aren't cheap. Recommend going there after lunch, and having a beer at the twosome cafe at the top. It's the level down, where you catch the lift back to ground. There's a cable car that takes you up there which we didn't utilize but wished we had. Don't know much about it but look into it. Namsam cable car? "
Nice view and chocolate drink,"We enjoyed the view of seoul city during our winter trip, u have to climb a lil bit to get to observatory area, Dont forget to sip a chocolate drink as it is a must and eat fries as they are very delicious! Went there by subway and "
A place to get view of the city,"i visited this tower in the morning so the air was very fresh, and slightly colder because it's located up near the mountain.you can get a view of the city from the tower, but unfortunately it was kind of foggy that day. Actually there wasnt much to see but i'm still loving the view and the air! i think it's a nice place for a stroll :)"
Nothing Special.,"The view from the tower was just mediocre. We went there and a lot of kids hung out there. It was mostly just gift shops and cafes. It is not worth your time to visit this ""landmark"". "
Lovely Tower in the Middle of the City,"Visited on a weekend. If you want to travel wisely, you can reach the tower via bus. It's cheaper and less hassle (no long lines) Great place but no need to go up the deck. "
A must!,"Don't leave Seoul without at least visiting it once. The view from the top is 360 degrees, and worth the 8500 won cable car fare. To get to the cable car station, we walked from Myeongdong station exit 3 but it was a steep climb for around 25 minutes. Best to take the lift along Sogong-ro, its the major intersection between Hoehyeon and Myeongdong stations. Bus no 3 or 5 also go up there but we opted to take the lift down then walk to Myeongdong shopping district which takes around 20 minutes from the base of the cable car station."
Pretty at night!,This tower is very pretty at night. If like to watch the city from the top this experience is for you! Before you go just make sure to find out the closing time. Taxis are scarce at this time as well so plan ahead for public transport. It is worth a visit at least once when you are in Seoul.
The windows weren't clear,We went during quite cold weather so it was a bit difficult until we got up the viewing floor. I was particularly disappointed that the windows weren't very clear so I didn't get good photos. Just on a side note: if you go to the women's and probably men's toilet too there is a breath taking view inside the actual cubicles!! So that's an enjoyable moment to take in while you do your business!! 
Good place to get a feel for the city!,I have been to better lookout spots in the world but still this is not too bad. It is nice in the evening! Don't take the cable car (rip-off)Don't go up the tower itself it isn't worth it.
Love it! A must see place in Seoul!,You may feel the love is in the air! I just loved to be here see people full of smile during winter (including me off course).I wish to visit this place again with my families!
Romantic trip with great view,N Seoul Tower has amazing views of Seoul and the mountains. You take a cable car up to the tower. There are some cafes and souvenir shops there and it is heavily decorated for couple to take cute pictures. They sell heart shaped love locks to hang in several dedicated places around the base of the tower. It is inexpensive and worth the trip for the views and photo-ops.
Amazing ,My daughter and I visited the N Seoul Tower.We took the cable car up and back. You can walk but it was freezing cold.The views are amazing. There are also multiple places to eat.The place is lined with padlocks. You can buy them for about 8000 won or buy a cheap one and write a message and leave it somewhere.
"I would definately recommend this, but...","Before you go, make sure the forecast says it is going to be a clear sunny day and the yellow dust forecast is low, otherwise you wont have a good, clear view of beautiful Seoul from up there. I would also recommend you plan it so that you get up to the top of the tower before sunset( its beautiful) but are still there after sunset (the lights of Seoul make for a totally different experience."
Seoul Landmark,"if you want to see Seoul and it's panoramic view, then Seoul Tower should be included in your itinerary. It is an easy hike and on the way up there are different places to stop and enjoy the view. If you don't like to hike, there's also the cable car that will take you to the tower. But I am not recommending this. The wait time is very long. When you reached the base of the tower, there are different restaurants and cafes and themed children's museums. "
there's no better view to be had of Seoul,while I don't remember the floor you can access for free (ask) take the elevator there and walk around. Lots to see. It's an interesting place. We took a bus up there; would be a long walk otherwise.
Love lock,"Great view from top. Also there are shops that selling a padlocks (if you wanna write your couples name ), souvenirs, ice cream, and so on."
went on the snowfall day ,it was beautiful with snow covered all over the trees and landscape. we went up and down by the cable car which was quick. the snow covered all over the area however we did not go further into the building due to limited time.
Overview of Seoul ,"You can capture 360 degree of the city line of Seoul. It's winter in Feb. We went up on a sunny day even though the temperature is at -4 deg. It's really cold when we exited the cable car that took us up to the N. Seoul Plaza area. That's where all the love locks are hung along almost every inch of visible railings. Some even resorted to hang on the pine trees. You should try the all famous roasted sweet potatoes (goguma) at the plaza entrance. Very well done. It's piping hot and just right for a cold weather. We went just at the right moment when there is a free try-on habok session. Of course we had fun looking like traditional Korean ladies in period dramas. But it's really cold, we hastily took some pictures with our costumes and changed it out. "
Unique place!,Great experience to climb up to the tower at night. Breathtaking views of the city of Seoul from the top of the towers. Very popular amongst the local and tourist from other countries all around the world.
Worth going up,"Enjoyed seeing viwes of Seoul. , Also of interst were all thelocks that were entertwined on the gates just like the bridges in Paris. It was cold and possibly not the best time of year to visit but the grounds were still very attractive I would think even more so in spring time"
 Visiting namsan Seoul tower,Take bus to reach there as walking could be difficult as it on namsan mountain. Visit at night time and enjoy the view
Nice visit during night time,"It's nice to go there during night time. Can see good view of Seoul. Also, you can buy some souvenirs."
Nice place! ,You need to see for yourself! From this Seoul Tower can see the entire Seoul city! One very unique is the lock!Going up to the tower will costs around 7000-10000 won depending on package. 
Beautiful views. Some dining options. Good to go at night for the light up. ,"Google maps told us to take a train to Chungmuro station and walk. But kind locals told us it's too far to walk. Indeed! We took a bus and it went meandering up the mountain! Go to chungmuro exit 2, take bus #2 outside the Popeye chicken and it takes you all the way up to Seoul Tower. We went in the evening time, sunset was gorgeous. The walk up is abit slopey, I'm not so sure it's good for elderly or young kids. There are many viewing terraces there for great photos. The night lights were pretty and made the place feel special. No wonder they have attractions for lovers such as the lovers locks, benches and special lighting display for couple to take photographs. There are many dining options from casual to expensive, also paid entry for the observatory but we didn't go up. Wanted to have some Korean food but the restaurant said they were closed (only 6pm!)There's also teddy bear gallery and Korean traditional hanbok culture experience areas there. Quite an interactive attraction for all ages. Recommended! "
freezing cold,Snow started to fall when we reached the top. the place was crowded and floor was slippery because of the snow and ice. Took a lot of nice and memorable photos and enjoyed good coffee and burgers at the top!
Romantic Spot,"Been to Namsan Tower twice. The first time was during evening time and my friend and I took the bus to get to the place of which we continued by walking uphill to get to the main area which was quite an exercise haha! The view was really beautiful during evening/night time and I was so overwhelmed with everything that I had tears in my eyes (yes that dramatic haha) but of course, do expect a bit more crowd during night time. Second time my friend and I went there during noon time on a weekend so we waited for as long as 2 hours to get to the cable car and everything. Make sure you plan well and avoid the weekends as much as possible if you're planning to visit Namsan Tower. However, day time visit offers a different view and better overall experience so it really depends on what you're looking for.Had a great time on both visits, and one thing is for sure, lots of couples visit Namsan Tower for their dates so if you're single, you might feel a little bit awkward haha :P"
Not to be missed (especially by couples) on your visit to Seoul,"Certainly one of my favorites in Seoul! Though it was a chilly winter night when we went here, I enjoyed everything in N Seoul Tower from the long uphill walk from Myeongdong Subway Station to the Namsan Cable Car, though it was a bit touristy and the cable car got really crowded (pick the door side to capture better pictures). The tower is situated on top of Mt. Namsan (hence the name), so you can have a better view of the city (which, for me is best at night). Couples should not miss this attraction and the chance to hang your love locks in the thousands of love locks in the tower railings. Don't worry if you forgot your pens and padlocks, these are available at the convenience store at the Namsan Cable Car station and at the N Seoul Tower. Cafe and restaurant are also located in the area. You may purchase one way or two-way ticket via cable car but I suggest getting the 2-way on winter as it can really get freezing cold."
A must see,"Seoul tower is a must see. The tower itself not so exciting, but its not just the tower. You can take a cable car up, watch the view, and on top the garden and layout is very nice. Few eateries and convenience stores, and locks for couples to leave behind their memory. Excellent place for couples."
Beautiful Tower,"Seoul Tower is a beautiful tower. We took the cable car to the tower. The walk to the cable car is very difficult as the road heading there is very steep. Better to take a taxi to the cable car station. When we reached the tower, again there were lots of stairs to climb. Only when we were coming back that we noticed the lift down to the cable car. From the cable car station, we took a taxi to the subway station."
"Beautiful Views, romantic spot","At the base of the tower before you take the lift up, you can see alot of locks and it is a really amazing. At the top, there is 2 levels of observatory and both offer great view of seoul. There is a souvenir shop at the observatory which have some nice stuff to buy for memories. The place is not huge so 1-2 hours should be enough. If you go at nice, the tower lights up and it is really beautiful too!"
View of the city from the mountain area,"This place is great for all kinds of groups. Families, couples, or friends. You can also buy a lock to put into the heart and write a note to keep there. It's not easy to get up there because there's quite a line to take the lift up. There's actually 2 sections. First, take the lift up to the base tower. Second, buy a ticket to go up to the top and get a view. Depending on your interest, my friends and I felt the base was already enough. There's a gift shop at the top and 360 window view."
A Great Landmark in Seoul,This is a great romantic spit to go to with your significant other. The view in the fall is especially marvelous with all of the changing leaves (just be sure to watch out for hordes of other tourists who will manhandle you out of the way for a snap shot). There is a great Italian joint there and you can also leave a love lock if you can find a good enough spot. This place is an iconic part of the Seoul skyline for a reason.
Great views of faraway mountains,Quite a small circumference of Seoul Tower but with great views of different mountain. You can even purchase f&b at level 1 before you head up to the highest floor. Enjoy your popcorn with the good scenery.
Great Seoul view...,"...on a clear day. Bit of a bummer to get up there and have the view obstructed by fog or haze. On a clear day though, fantastic view of the city and all therein, and the hills (mountains?) surrounding the city."
romantic place,we got there just before sunset..it's nice & romantic place..we can put out love lock with our name on it at the wall provided..very crowded and long queue at the cable car station
nice place,"you can go hike to the tower or take cable car. I took cable car going up, the I walk down. It's a nice place to visit. Don't forget to put a lock there if you visit it with your love one"
Fun morning ,"Visited with husband and our 2 boys (12 and 9). We bought a round trip ticket for the cable car and climbed to the top (get a taxi from your hotel to the cable car station; cheap and hassle free). Once at the top (base of N Tower) there are various things to look at and a good selection of decent cafes for snacks and good coffee. You then buy another ticket which allows you to go in the lift to the 360 degree observation deck. It's all well done and you also get a novelty green screen photo taken (extra cost). The view (on a cool, blue skied day) was amazing and well worth it. Pay a visit to the toilets...you get a floor to ceiling window to look out of while you do your business!! There are 3 restaurants to choose from (quite expensive) but we chose to go back down the tower and have a gourmet burger at N Burger. Well worth a few hours, but make sure you go on a clear day or night!"
Great views ,"Awesome views from the tower, short but expensive cable cart ride to the top but panoramic views of Seoul when you get there. Must do attraction "
Not-For-Single,"Namsan Tower is good to visit during spring and fall, since you can see the cherry blossoms or colorful autumn leaves during those times. If you're taking a cable car there, it's a good way to enjoy the view of Seoul from top, surrounded with mountains and hills.The only problem is, this place is not too exciting for single. Why?It's actually okay for singles to go there, but since this place ALWAYS packed with couples, this might make singles grow uncomfortable with the surroundings.Good for leisure, taking pictures and appreciating nature."
Fun trip,Great views if the day is clear. There is a cost to get around if you want to take the sky lift up and to take the elevator up the tower. Personally I thought the combined $18 was worth it.
Very Neat,Best feature of the tower is the markings on the glass describing where things are located in the North. Cool thing to see.
"Illuminated views, colorful love locks :)","With the top half all the way up to the big antenna above beautifully lit up after dark, the Tower also offers from its Observation Deck above ""360-degree views"" of the city with its illuminated skyline or just generally illuminated landscape in all directions which kind of gave me a ""surreal feeling"" (totally used to going up the towers in various countries but mostly only in daytime, so this night time view was sort of ""new"" for me); and yes, on this tower, it's not just to look out the windows but also to ""look up"" the windows where you'll see distances (assuming in those specific directions) to various major cities of the world and also to the North & South Poles; and taking up the whole space on three of the windows are a drawing of a big postage stamp with the words 'Seoul's highest post office' on it (not sure if you can actually buy those stamps on the Observation Deck), a drawing of the old city wall (with an ""actual part"" of the wall directly below if you look out that window) and a drawing that portrays the city gates (three of which that I actually got to on the ground).And yes, not just up the Tower but the base area with a spacious wooden floor is great to hang out too with a nice big gift shop right inside the Tower (a bigger shop than the one up above on the Observation Deck), a restaurant on the floor right above the gift shop, a little pavilion on one side of the wooden floor and a love-locks deck with tons of colorful love locks (which offers good city views as well) on the higher ground right beside the floor. But for a great photo-op of the Tower (or with the Tower) itself, the best spot is a little further from that base area, specifically the love-locks deck near the top cable car station from which you'll get an ""all-inclusive"" view of the Tower not quite possible from the base area since it's too close to the Tower.Coming by subway, the station to get off is Myeong-dong (on Line 4) from which it's about a 15-minute walk south (slightly uphill) to the bottom cable car station of Namsan Mountain followed by a short 5-minute ride to the top station from which it's about a 5-minute walk to the base of the Tower; the total of 18,500 won or the equivalent of US$ 18.50 (8,500 won for the roundtrip cable car for the mountain & 10,000 won for the elevator ride to the Observation Deck on top of the Tower) is a pretty good deal really compared to ""just-for-the-deck"" prices for the towers such as Tokyo Skytree, Petronas in Kuala Lumpur & Singapore's Marina Bay Sands Skypark, and you can even save the cost of the cable car by walking up Namsan Mountain (or just do the cable car one-way for 6,000 won instead of 8,500) in which case it will be only 10,000 won to go up the Tower itself."
Whole view of Seoul City,Quite impressive by always seeing Korean drama filming this lovely place. First I can take the glass elevator up. Then take the tram up to the tower. You can see the best view of Seoul there:) love locks nice restaurants are also up at the tower. Very romantic and memorable place for my bf and I.
Great,We had a great time. And we so lucky to see and play with the snow. The cable car to seoul tower on time. Will visit again and will recommend to all.
Romantic and beautiful scenery,"Great for families, friends and couples. Love locks can be found within the area. I went during winter, but still amazingly beautiful especially at sunset! "
Good view of Seoul. Beware of add-ons,"Came by the N Seoul Tower the other day and it offered great views of Seoul for 10k entrance fee. There were plenty of add-ons available including museums, meals etc.To get to the boarding area of the tower an optional 8k won tram is an alternative to walking for 10-15 minutes in -10C winter. There's also an elevator that goes to the tram that is free although hard to locate...The top of the N Seoul Tower also has a bunch of souvenir shops promoting merchandise...Which is typical touristy stuff..."
Excellen views but beware of haze,A great place to see a large part of the very large city of Seoul.It would be good if they cleaned the windows better
Great views,Visited on a cold snowy night in Seoul. Great views across the city and interesting history about the location. We accessed it very a the Namsan Cable Car which was 34000 won for three adults. Lots of food and shops if they s s what you are looking for. Very pleased we took the time to visit
Hard to judge,It is one of those things where you should go at least once and it is good. However I have seen several amazing towers and buildings in my day and this is not as spectacular. However it is a nice view of the city on a good night. And it is probably a very good place for dating. Don't go up the tower itself it will just cost you money and it is not worth your money.
Come here on a weekday,"Not much to say but wow! You can get spectacular views of the city from up here. Not such a good idea to go here during weekends. I went on a Monday and there weren't a lot of people so I was able to enjoy the view.To get here, get off at Myeongdong station. I went through Exit 3 and made a 15-min hike up to the cable car station to get to the tower. Quite an exercise, but it was worth it!"
Epic structure,"Such a wonderful landscape, standing tall in Seoul. A place you should not miss making a stop-over while visiting the capital and take some epic photos..for an everlasting memory of South Korea and its beauties. "
So much fun!,Beautiful place to experience the incredible views of Seoul. The tower itself is well maintained and a fun stop on the tour of Seoul!
SUNSET CITY VIEW,"you gotta come here when it's sunset , the view is magnificent . you can see the whole city with a glimpse of sunset . definitely you have to put it in your list if you ever went to seoul "
Namsan CableCar - Seoul N-Tower - Bus ride,Great combination for this tour: Namsan CableCar (Through Orumi elevator) - Namsan Park (upper station of elevator) - N-Tower - bus to Namdaemun market.
One of the better towers,Nice display at night on the tower walls. Some nice food establishments and shops there..pleasant place for a date or excitable kids. :)
Beautiful sight from atop!,"U have to take a lift or otherwise climb up the stairs to get to the cable car station. the ride was smooth and fast, the sight atop was breathtaking! As it was in Dec that we went, it was cold when the wind blows. Get yr portraits hand sketched by the 5 master artist. I will want to go again!"
A must in Seoul,This place is amazing. You have a great view of Seoul from the top. And the stores in there are good for souvenirs. And I would love to dinner with my wife at the restaurant on the top!!!And is good they close late after all my meetings. 
Great view of Seoul,Great landscape view of Seoul city during sunset. Cable car ride was good. Lots of picture taking opportunity. Nice place to start off Seoul holidays.
Amazing view from the top. Perfect for couples.,"You will witness an awesome panoramic view of the whole city of Seoul. The park is very nice which is perfect for sight-seeing, the love locks is a great picture perfect as well."
Very Good Panoramic View of Seoul,Offers a very good panoramic view of Seoul. Requires a lot of walking but it is worth the visit. We took the No.3 bus that stops by the base of the Namsan Park and walk for about 10 minutes from there to the top. The new attraction OLed tunnel was amazing.
Beautiful view ! ,"The place is crowded with tourists. We walked up and took the cable car down. Good exercise. The queue to buy tickets for the cable car was long. There is a mall with restaurants which you can have your meal. Went there late afternoon and enjoyed the view of the day and night. There is the ""love lock"" - where you can take pictures. Didn't enter the tower- there is entrance fee. "
Wonderful 360º view of the city of Seoul!,"We've heard that there are days when you cannot see anything, but we were lucky enough to get there on a clear day and the view was wonderful!"
Too... Cold at End of December,"One of the tourist photo vintage is this Tower, Nice Place, Beautiful view, Good Managed, ... we arrived to this tower before dark, and we could see beautiful lighting along walking u[p...to the tower.. around 25 minutes, good but in end December is too cold...."
Waste of time,"The tower is much better viewed from a distance as part of the city view. Hordes of people visited the tower I was there; you are herded into an elevator that doesn't even have glass sides for the view. Once you are at the top the entire area is taken with junk food and stalls selling tourist trinkets. In three minutes you have seen everything - and then you get to stand outside for a long time waiting for the next bus down to the city! Not worth the time.The length of recommended time i have indicated includes the bus trip - the time needed to ""see"" the tour is about 5 minutes....."
At the Top,We choose to visit this tourist attraction at night.Place needs some walking before you can get the ride to the tower.But all worthy.
A must to visit!,"We are glad to have come on a weekday morning, took the advices/tips from reviewers to avoid weekend. Observation deck was lovely. You have to come here by cable car. We managed to stay at the sides for both trips and got a beautiful view. Will definitely come here again for my next visit to Seoul. And this time at night. :)"
You can see Seoul from the air,On foot or by cable car you can get to the tower. In front of the tower on the hill is a large space for various events. It shows the fight with swords in traditional costumes. At the top of the tower where you can see the whole city going up fast elevator. At the top you can enjoy the view and have a drink at the bar.
Cold but good view,"I went there on a cold day. I went there at around 3pm by the cable car. It's a great time as we can enjoy the beautiful view of day and night. The view is really great. If you go to myeongdong, don't forget to go there."
Beautiful night view,"N Seoul Tower is the landmark of Seoul, very worth to see during sunset or night time, especially for couples^^ Many shops, cafes, restaurants and there is a love lock plaza!"
Namsan Seoul tower,A must place to visit in Seoul. Fascinated with so many locks!!!Beautiful scenery also! How I wish I can come back again 
Great view of the city!!!,N Seoul Tower is one of the places to visit when you're in Seoul. Walking from the parking to the tower is a little bit tiring since the road is uphill. But if you get tired there's bleachers on your right side before going inside the tower itself.Inside there were cafes and souvenir shops. On the top floor itself you see a great view of the city. There were also padlock trees where you take photos.It was a busy day when we went but nonetheless you can still enjoy the view.
Really enjoyed the travel up to it,"I had no idea that the surrounding city was so big until I climbed the mountain. It's completely not necessary to enter the tower itself, although I suspect it's also quite nice at the peak."
Rather Small Tower,"I was expecting more from N Seoul Tower. The tower is considered small as compared to many other towers I have visited.Only took me less than 30min to finish touring the Tower and this includes photo taking time.One thing good thou, you can hang your love locks just below the N Seoul Tower and of course more photos."
Nice night views but can get pricey,"Went at night via cable car - more expensive than I would have liked, but the view was spectacular. Kind of hard to get a good picture from the top because there are so many lights inside producing a glare. There is a shop at the top where you can buy a postcard and stamps and mail a memento home (took about three weeks to reach USA). A fun way to spend an hour or two, but I would walk next time."
Lovely place,It's a must place to go if you are in Seoul. Nice place specifically at night but has a better view during daylight. Must take the cable car going up just to feel the place. Went there during autumn and it was cold. 
Best at night!,"-I recommend you ride the cable car to N Seoul Tower at night. You will see how beautiful Seoul is with all the city lights.-There are always a lot of people, which is why it's kind of hard to take pictures.-You will also see a lot of love locks formed like a tree or locked on railings.-There are several shops and restaurants around-Overall, the place is lovely!"
Really enjoyed this!,This was really fun. Great views and a nice hike down. Fun to get the popcorn/beer packages. Our kids loved it.
a picnic with my parents,"It was very good experience. My parents were very happy with me. You could see central Seoul in the cable car and the tower.The tower offers a little discount to foreigners, I guess.I didn't go to the tower restaurant, but it offers lunch or dinner package.You could try Hanbok, Korean traditional clothes in the tower."
Pretty Cool. ,I agree with other reviews. It wasn't phenomenal from a distance or from inside BUT these are the small things that I found very cool. 1. Gift shop and candy store. Very clean. Decent prices. Modern and unique gifts. Not the same stuff as on the streets of Seoul. I suggest buying the small puzzle and frame. 2. Locks. Bring a lock. Put your name wish or prayer on it and lock it to the fence or one of many places. I've never seen this before. I can't explain it. Just bring one. 3. Restaurants. They were a bit pricey but lots of options. 4. Elevator. Cool video shown on ceiling of elevator with video going up or down. Reminded me of Willy Wonka with Depp. 5. Cable car going up and down. Cool but packed. 6. I think you can actually will or hike up to the tower. That would be very cool to do in the future. Lastly. We went with 4 year old up to 16 year olds. We all enjoyed it. 
Go during sunset,"A lot of people, almost impossible to get a pic without photobomb by other tourists/locals. Recommended to go near sunset timing, in this case you can get to see the day sets and the night fall in entire different view and feel. "
Love it!,"Slope from the bus stop to the square is very steep. There was some filming going on. The view of Seoul city is very picturesque. The observatory is a bit disappointing, crowded and touristy. Overall, a lovely place!"
Like any observatory tower...,"Nothing special compared to any other, but its ok I guess... plenty of scribbles for those looking to leave a note on their walls..."
Great place to begin our time in Seoul,We visited the N tower on Christmas Day and it was a lovely way to start our celebrations. The view is awesome! Definitely a must see attraction in Seoul. Other reviews mention that it gets too busy so I'd recommend going in the morning. We got there at around 10am and it didn't seem too crowded but it was getting busier by the time we left. Getting the cable car up to the top will save you the uphill walk but it was great walking back down - there seemed to be a few different routes to take and the path we chose had great scenery.
Great night view of Seoul city,It is a great place to visit particularly at night. There are cable cars to go up to the tower but the queue were unbelievably long on Christmas Eve. We ended up walking up and not using the cable car. It is quite easy to walk as there are other tourist doing that too. There are several viewing platforms along the way and some benches to sit down and take a rest. There are amusement parks and eating places once you reach the top. I must say it is extremely busy and we couldn't even get a place to eat. Perhaps going off peak or not major festive season might be less crowded. 
Good view!!,Typical tower experience. Its a must do to get a good idea of how big Seoul is. It was a clear day so we got to see as far as possible with the smog. 
Great city views on clear days,"Located on top of a hill (or is it considered a mountain?), Namsan tower is a bit of a hike from Myeongdong station but visitors can opt to take the bus or cable car. We enjoyed the city views and the free cultural dances when we were there."
Winter has prevented us to explore more @ N tower,"We went there ... it is freezingNo cable car operating during freezing time ? or only because our tour organizer just skipped it ?...not sure...,as many other tower landmark..such as Macau Shanghai and many others..It is just the view only mattersAccept tower with adrenaline pumping attraction where you can walk along side on the outside of tower platform... not so sure about this N tower Other than that... either daylight or night it is really up to your choice... but during snowy time..all I can see just white :))"
Amazing view!,"Went at night, beautiful view!. I got up there using the cable train and went down by bus, in my opinion is better to use the bus because is cheaper, pluss you don't really get a view from the cable train."
night at namsan,came at early night...but already crowded..quite tire to climb all the stairs.. manage to leave the lock and take a pictures at love chairs...able to see Seoul at night..try few snacks..
"Corny attraction zone, lots to see.","I love cornball tourist attractions, and giant towers usually fit the bill perfectly. This is no exception with a lot of legit scenic beauty and views from the tower to go along with like 5 floors of weird attractions from arcades to a Hello Kitty museum. I happened to be there at the moment some historical recreation lunacy was going on and it was super cool. Protip: Cable car up, walk down for a fun trip."
A Typical Observatory Tower,"VIsited N Seoul Tower 30 December 2016 with my family coming from a package tour in Seoul. The Tower is just a usual Observatory Deck. Not too much impression compared to other Towers such as Taipei 101, Macau Tower, Menara Tower in KL, etc. Though there is an outdoor Deck at the lower level, the N Seoul Tower could still be developed to become more prominent and appealing to Tourists. Overall, the visit is fine and we also enjoyed the tour."
"Foggy view , too crowded","We made a mistake by visiting the tower on a Saturday. The entrance was crowded and the line to go up the small elevator is also long. Eventually we made it to the top and the view was disappointing. The tower is not very high. The view would be great if its not that foggy. No doubt the view will be great if its a clear day. I am just not comfortable crowding with group tourists for focal photo shoots. We rounded the place the left in less than 30 mins. Word of advise, go on a week day. It should be less crowded and maybe go at night. The night view will be more impressive. "
Must visit,"Went there on 1 Jan 17 and we had to queue for an hour to board the cable car to N Seoul Tower (including buying of cable car tickets). The day was foggy, hence there wasn't much view from the observation deck of the tower. What made up for it was the Ssentoy exhibition which my boyfriend enjoyed very much, and the sending of postcards from the observation deck of the tower. There is also a mini photo studio where you can wear hanbok and pay for the photo shoot. We gave it a miss as the costumes did not look very nice. There were some people queuing for the photo shoot though."
N Seoul Tower,"Romantic place to be if you're a couple. A gondola ride up to almost the peak would be a fast way to reach the top. Remember to bring a colourful padlock along too to lock up memories of your visit there! Overall, a lovely experience indeed to take a walk along the grounds there in nice cool weather and superb views once up the tower. Also visited the Hello Kitty Museum at the base of N Seoul Tower, and it was as pretty as can be! Hello Kitty!"
Great views on a sunny day,Get the cable car from the station to the top of this tower. The views are amazing. Bring a padlock as there are loads of them clipped to random statues here.
Remarkable Views,Well worth the time to visit. Great views of Seoul. Well worth the time to see the tremendous progress this city has made in the past 40 yearsThe sites are stunning with a good vibrancy surrounding it
Great view,It offers the best of the city and we could see all the cherry blossoms as well. It was not crowded when we visited which was very convenient. It's something first time visitors should want to include in their itinerary in Seoul. 
The typical TV Tower,The place is very crowded. It is located on a mountain so from there you can have a nice view over Seoul for free.
Check the weather forecast,"Obviously check the forecast. On a cloudy day you simpyl will not see much. It also gets really cold and windy on some occassionsThough if you simply like walking around a bit, it still is ok to go. With the love locks, a pagoda and a bit of shopping and some restos you can still do stuff even without the view. The cable car ride to the tower is really short. Slightly expensive for its length. Can still offer good views. "
Must visit ,It's worth it on a clear day Get the full ticket with your hop on off if you are using it Great views of the city But so commercialiséIt's all about buy buy buy 
Fascinating N Seoul Tower in Cold Winter!,"It was a nice visit with Top Korea Tour that I have arranged to visit Namsan Park and N Seoul Tower. In this tower, you could enjoy the view going to the top with a package tickets price. There were many floors and you can't believe it there's Hello Kitty Shop and Bears Museum too! Many more and it is you to find out! It is never regret to go to the Tower visit although it was a misty day. Thanks to Juno our private tour guide for bringing us there and along the Namsan Park. Freezing cold during Winter. Check this place out and you will truly enjoy some little lovey-dovey moment on one of the floor."
A place to relax,"Went here twice, spring 2014 and December 2016. Although there were always a lot of people here I still think this one is a place to chill and relax from the busy city of Seoul. I love the view and atmosphere here."
A must see landmark in Seoul.,"This place is a must see landmark. So many dramas have used this as their location. More than that, the place has so many things to offer on every floor. There's restaurants, arcade, shopping, selfie friendly places and culture. Must not miss the deck area where all the padlocks are. There is a restaurant on the top floor that will not serve you pizza if you order only one and you will share. That was the only downside of our trip to this place."
Great view of the city,"Worth the visit, great way to get a view of the layout of the city. Make sure you take the cable car up - reduces the walk and a nice ride. "
Amazing View,We came here with some Korean college students on a tour. It is a bit like the Space Needle here in Seattle. It was so cool because there was a bit of culture in it. It was an amazing experience.
Good view from N tower,"Although the location is not good, it is worth to visit there. You an see veru far away of Seoul form here. On the way to there you can see a lot of lover's lock. It is very amazing. The entry fee of tower is low. And the restaurant' food is nice. "
Not well worth the price and trip,I think you need to get a perfect day from a weather side. We spent 3 days in Seoul and there was too much fog everyday. We finally went up. It was nice but nothing special compared to other observation building around the world. Hard to see much and not worth the price.
Wonderful experience ,This is a significant landmark to visit as you can have a nice eye view for Seoul. The area is not big and it take us less than an hour to explore this area. 
Seoul's Landmark,"Very lucky coz there is an exhibition during our visit. We try local korean clothes called hanbok and snap few photos. The scenery was fabulous, with colourful trees surrounding up here. Try to take the stones path when going down and you will amaze."
Good view!,"We took bus there so there was a bit of walking uphill (steep road) and it was snowing the night before so the road is quite slippery. Nonetheless, view was good. I would recommend taking a bus there since it is way cheaper (around 1500 won) than the cable car (8500 won). There are few mrts with N Seoul tower bus (myeongdong, Seoul, Chungmuro stations)"
"""Romantic Island""","Had a spectacular view of Seoul on top on the 360 degrees viewing gallery/platform. A family friendly, weather proof venue with many activities, cafes and restaurants within the tower building. It is also know as the ""Romantic Island"" as it is a favorite hang out place for lovers, pledging their love for each other with love locks, love tiles, love benches scribbles. A must go for love birds!"
Magnificent views of the city!,The bus ride up to the N Seoul Park is quite crowded but definitely an economical option to ride up the hill. The base of the tower gives breathtaking views of the city. Bring your camera and enjoy the views of Seoul at night.
View of Seoul,Its a must to visit this place. Very nice view of Seoul. Its nice to visit the place at night.I love the love lock that they have.
Great view and experience ,The ride up the gondola was very exciting - get to the front so that you can see the view on the way up and down. Then the line up for the lift to the top of the tower - we met some more international visitors. Great view. 
Classic Night View of Seoul City,"I had been for a conference at Seoul and on our day of outing we were treated to this wonderful sight!!! :) It is situated on a height and one gets a clear and beautiful view of the ever bustling and lively Seoul city from here!They also have this concept of Love Lock here where youngsters purchase the locks and write the names of their partner and once they lock it, they throw the key so the 'love is locked forever'!!! Although I did not do any of that, watching the colorful locks in itself was a sight!Besides they also have a shopping arena, restaurant, 4D screens, photo booths and a lot of entertainment stuff to do here!!!"
Lovely environment going up,"We got lost finding the cable car site and turned out walking all the way to the top, one hilarious moment for me. On the other hand we got to enjoy the nature and refreshing environment on our way up. Really good place to exercise! Also got to try putting on a love lock with by then-boyfriend"
Average attraction,"Really an average attraction. The cable car left me bewildered as the cable car didn't lift you to the top of the mountain. You still have to climb some stairs in order to reach the peak. I saw alot of elderly gashing for their breath while climbing up. When you are at the peak, the view is ok ok in the day but very breathtaking at night. I guess this is why there is more crowd in the night time."
Nice view of Seoul skyline,"We were here during last of the year,as it had extended the visiting hours until 1am. There is a cultural show daily at the pavilion on 3pm to 4pm. Ensure to download the Seoul Pass app in your phone to have a better chance of discount for entry to the tower. Tower was surprisingly small compared to my country's towers, but you may find it lovely to see the skyline of Seoul."
Colorful tower,I found the viisit to the tower very interesting for you can read the distance to most of the cities in the world!!!I met many interesting people over there!
Average scenery and view compare to other towers,"Perhaps i expected too much, but i felt that the N Seoul Tower paled in comparison with other attractions in other cities (e.g. The Peak at Hong Kong). The view, was average and the ""locking of love"" gimmick was overwhelming. The restaurants and museums there perhaps could offer a saving grace, but I didnt enter due to time constraints."
NTower,"Nice place to visit, beautiful and a good experience especially in winter time. However, the visit to the observatory tower is a waste of time and money. I think they carry too many people in the cable car."
Nice view,One of Seoul attractions.You could take bus or cable car to N Seoul Tower.Go on weekdays since there are going to be long queue on weekend.
Amazing night view away from city center,"After rising the cable car uphill, you will find th N Tower coming closer and appear in front of you in a manificient view, in particular when you are going at night. No worries, it close at midnight, and cable car service stop prior to it. When it matched with the lighting of Christmas tree and an older TV tower, it comes out sharp and stand for the signature of the city. A good place to go definitely!"
Most recommended place,"If you are located in Seoul, first place to see is Seoul Tower, even if you are in seoul for 1 day, you should visit this place. You save your time and money, you can see all seoul from top of the rock. "
Great view of Seoul city,An iconic site for Seoul tourism where you can have great view of Seoul City from 360 degrees angle and can put some love lock with your loved ones believe to tie any couples together.
Please take the cable car up there!,The view was great once we got up there but the lack of signs and direction made it hard to navigate and get up to the tower. 
pretty,the tower itself is average but it is pretty an night as it lights up. never got a chance to get up there as the day I was going to go it was raining.
Great when you eventually get there,"The tower was great with fantastic views on the day I visited, but for me I struggled to find how to get into the tower by foot. Unbeknown to me on one side there is a cable car that takes you up there, not widely advertised, as most appeared to arrive by organised tours in coaches. "
Iconic N tower,"If you are in seoul this is a must visit. Site of many Korean variety shows as well as ""my love from the stars"" it attracts both locals and tourists. I didnt go up the tower but hanged out below and at the love lock corner. Make sure to take many photos!"
Get ready to queue like crazy,"Crazy queue just to take the ride up to the tower, especially on public holidays. I went on New Year's day so it was extra crazy. waste of time in my opinion"
Romantic Night,It's best to go here at night where the lights are turned on and it's good for you to look at the sky and try the observatory. Seoul is one of good light cities other than Hongkong so it's worth a try to be there. Restaurants here are expensive but it's a famous spot for proposal and dating spots. Try to lock a key here. It's not a good choice to go here at night if you want to take pictures only so think of what you want to do here in N Seoul Tower.
Excellent@,We climbed up the staircases all the way up to the Namsan Tower for the first time in Dec during winter morning. It was a great experience since we didnt want to take the cable car like other tourists. The view were magnificient n refreshing since the weather was extremely cold. It was a great experience. Will do it again when we are back in Korea again. Advise.. dont climb during winter. Its extreme cold. 
Beautiful tower,This was a great experience! The view is amazing and I absolutely loved the love lock section! It wasn't hard to get to. We decided to walk up but there is a lift that will take you up as well. 
One good stop,"This is one place to visit when in Seoul, nice view from the top. From myeongdong station exit 2 we take a long (inclined) walk going to the cable car. The cable car is around krw 8,000/pax (roundtrip) that only takes few minutes to get you there. The love lock is also located here. Good view of Seoul."
The tower,There is nothing special with the tower. You should take a walk from Nam Shan park to the tower and visit the live bridge with tones of locks.
Awesome panoramic view! Recommended ,"Really cool to see seoul in a 360 panoramic view. It's cool to see on each window to which city in the word it points to. Also very informative. On lower level there are some explanations about different locations in seoul. There are snacks, food and restaurants to choose from to dine and drink. After that you can take the cable car to Namsan and continue the day there. Really fun experience and great for photos. "
Beautiful Attaction,"You will most likely ride the cable car from Namsan Park to get up to this structure which sits on top of a hill. On a clear day, you can get a good panoramic view of Seoul. There are also metal rail walls at the base of the tower where many people leave their ""mark"" in the form of padlocks being locked into the railings (copied from certain bridges in France). Just be aware that they will remove these walls every few years due to the sheer weight of the locks becoming a potential safety hazard of falling over onto someone. :)"
Worth a look but expensive,If you have towers on your list to do while travelling then this is a must do.. we went to the Korean village below the tower and climbed the hill and this was a better option than the tower itself.. plus had the benefit of some exercise.. 
Great view,I've been to the Seoul tower twice and it doesn't disappoint me. Make sure to pay and go up to see the full view of Seoul! The toilet up on the sky deck was impressive. Couples can also buy their love lock to put on the barrier. Good for family and couples.
N Seoul Tower,"Can be a physical walk to get up to the base. Alternative is a perambulator thar gets you to the olwer level elevator.Once up there are great views, shops, eateries and a show as they change the guards. Beware that view from the top costs more money and depends of the haze. Copy of the Paris lock wish is also found here. Locks available in the store."
Majestic View of Seoul,Just like any other towers in other countries eg Japan. You can only expect the majestic view of the city especially in the night and during Xmas season with all the glittering lights. This Seoul Tower have to take cable car ride up to the foot of the tower or if not you have to walk around 1.5 to 2km up the steep hill to reach the foot of the tower.
Best views of the Seoul,Love going up towers so this was a must during my stay in Seoul. Price is less than £5 to take the lift to the viewing deck. Not the easiest attraction to access as it is located on top of Namsan mountain. Two ways to get up there is by walking or taking the cable car (approx. £8 return journey). During Oct/Nov the walk has the added attraction of autumn foliage to view. Be bemused by the thousand upon thousands of 'love-locks that now adorn the railings - a tradition for couples to declare their love to each other - originally sparked off by a Korean TV sitcom! On a good day you can obviously get great views of the city and its environs.
Seoul tower wasn't as good as some other towers,"We visited in October. It was pretty bus that day. The tour is not very tall in stature due to it being on a hillside instead of in the middle of the city. Tokyo Skytree was more impressive for the experience. Also, it's more on the outskirts of Seoul. There were souvenir shops, but they just didn't have the variety of items like postcards or magnets that other towers have. There was also only 1 observation area, so you can imagine it gets pretty crowded for those trying to catch a view of Seoul and hard to get a photo op without others in your shot. The walk up the hill to the tour is manageable, not too steep. The trees along the hill path were turning for fall in late October. Down the hill, there is the Seoul City tour bus stop along with other tour buses. "
A must visit place,"Seoul Tower is located in Myeong Dong. You can go up using cable car or by walking up. If you need to buy souvenir for your friends etc., you can purchase fridge magnet there because it is sooooo cheap!! I bought 10 packets! 1 packet include 3 Seoul Tower magnet & it cost only 1000 won per packet!"
"Didn't expect walk uphill to be so steep, but","it made the experience so much more fun! But ohh boy was it a workout. We even had to take a break halfway! Make sure to hold the side railing, I'd imagine the trip back down would be unpleasant if you slipped and fell. Would be a faster way down though haha"
Overview of Seoul,"A great view of Seoul. It was a bit cloudy when I visited the tower. Otherwise, the night scene will be very nice. Taking photo with the camera was challenging unless you place the lens against the glass. "
Lovely for sunset,"This was a must-see for me during my short stay in Seoul and, on the recommendation of local friends, we caught the cable car up and hiked down. Being late afternoon/early evening it was predictably busy - about 45-50 minutes wait for the cable car although the trip was then very quick. We paid extra for the observation deck and the 360 degree views were fantastic. We stayed long enough to see the City light up beneath us. It was very busy and quite crowded but the views more than compensated.We chose to hike down which took about twenty five minutes. One thing I would suggest is warm clothes as it was very windy as well as cold!"
Excellent hike up N.Seoul Tower,"I visited this tower during a Sunday while on business trip. You can take subway upto myeongdong and then walk towards the tower, which is difficult to miss. Just make sure you select the right exit when coming out of subway. The hike up the tower is not very challenging but you are advised to take cable car if extremely unfit or need special care. The on-deck visit is amazing with lovely 360 degree views of Seoul and tell you the distance for major cities in all directions. I enjoyed my visit to the N. Seoul Tower"
Must visit ,"This place is so well set up! There is restraunts, places to buy souvenirs and coffee. Many places to take photos, great view all over. Great modern atmosphere. A must see in Seoul "
On top,"Prepare yourself for some climbing. But it's worth it, good view while climbing up and down the hill and of course, good exercise. Visit the area to see the city from the highest point Seoul. If you find love locks romantic, have it there too."
Okay for family trip,"You can see the tower from the bottom. If you want a bird eye view of the city, you can pay to go up the tower's viewing deck. Other than that there's nothing much you could do"
Ok Attraction,It's an okay attraction for family. There are lots of restaurants in the park at the bottom of the tower. You have to pay money to go up the tower though. Good for couples for a romantic evening.
A Must Go Spot,"Compared with other towers in different countries, it's rather cheap to go to the highest level of N Seoul Tower, and The shops on ground or top floor are also good places to pick up souvenirs. The night view from the top floor is superb! It's a wonderful experience to visit, and good choice of sightseeing spots."
More at the top than u expect,"Took the cable car up here and I have to say there was a lot more to do than we expected. Lots of padlocks of love attached to so many structures, available to buy at the top. Cafes, shops, couple of small children's museums; (hello kitty and other toys museums). Great view at the top. Hot chocolate at N Burger was great!"
"Ok, if you run out of places to see in Seul","It's just a big tower to look at Seoul from above. But it lacks a character and kind of ""soul"" that similar towers in other places have - Eiffel, Ostankino, Pearl Tower, Taipei 101, CN of Toronto, Sears, Seattle Tower gave me a much more powerful experience. Important hint: don't go for a ""air-train"" that brings you to the foundation of the tower - use the stairs. Considering the long lines it is much faster."
Prepare your love lock when visiting this place,"N seoul tower is not something to be missed when you visit Seoul. Not only will the tower allows you to have an aerial view of the city, theres also a gift shop at the top for you to buy some souvenirs. This place reminded me of dubai burj al arab but it has a distinct uniqueness of its own namely the love lock wall which cant be compared with other places. The love lock wall is for couples to express their love and to place a lock on it.Do check out my photos!!!."
"N Seoul Tower, Yongsandong 2(i)-ga, Seoul","Not going to lie... If you intend to climb up prepare your softest shoe because more than 500 steps awaits you. But the view is breathtaking! 10 million people from the eyes of the Gods!Interactive and interesting museums. Scheduled traditional martial shows. It's a wow!The Tower also provides different beverages, coffee and places to relax or have some romantic moments."
View,Nice view over Seoul. Easy to access by walking to Nan San cable car station. Everywhere you can see the lover lock.
superb view to the city,"Start the the tour in Itaewon or the shopping area and walk to the tower in the park. The view to this big city is awesome, watch the coreans and tourists, drink a coffee and enjoy your stay"
No notice for foggy weather,"As a famous hot tourist spot, I could not accept that they don't have any notice / announcement for guests at the ticket office for cold wet weather - which the mirror at the tower was all cover by moist and nothing could be seen from inside! So what is the point for letting guest to go up and cannot see any view expect fog?"
Great Night Activity,"We went at night the view was amazing, I'm sure doing the day would be lovely as well. The night we went there weren't too many people there."
Great view and nice walk,"There are different ways of going up the hill.. driving up, public transports, cable car, jog through the track or even walking up the flights of stairs.Great sunset and night view of Seoul in 360 degree.Love locks for the couples."
Beware of stairs,A great view awaits you at the top but accessibility is questionable as we could not find a way to the top without at least a couple of flights of stairs. Uber was the best way to get to the cable car then it is a short ride to the top and several flights of stairs to the tower. Good activity for a clear day (or night).
Excellent view of Seoul ,I love this place. It is extremely easy to get here by public transport. Breathtaking view of Seoul city n a sunny day. 
Lovely sunset and night view,We used the escalator to get to the cable car station and it was easy to find our way from Myeongdong. We chose to take the cable car up instead of walking as we had the young and old. The timing to visit N Seoul tower is critical too - try to catch the sunset and stay for the night view. The admission fee to the observatory is not expensive and we purchased discounted tickets via KLook which had instant confirmation. Also love the postcard service available at the observatory souvenir shop. 
"Get a decent 360' view of Old Seoul, but beware the huge crowds","For those that wouldn't pay for the charges to head up to the observation deck of the tower, just making your way up to the 5th floor of the facility should get you to the top of the hill, and give you a decent view. (you'd have to walk about to get views of all sides)However, beware of huge crowds and queues during the peak hours. I wouldn't recommend heading there with the elderly or young toddlers and it'd be a real hassle.Nonetheless, it is one of the touristy places in Seoul. Visit if you have to."
N Seoul Tower,It is a must go for first timers in Seoul.The buffet at the tower is reasonably price with a great view. Nothing can beat it.
Amazing view,"It is too expensive to go up the tower but the view is amazing, though. You should go there at night to see the lights. Also, the restrooms have panorama views. The tower is placed on the top of a mountain, so try to find a shuttlebus - it is a very steep way. You can find this kind of view at other places in Seoul, therefore, think about if you want to spend your money on this."
Only good for a short visit,Good for seeing night view of Seoul but will be a bit cold in winter night. 30 minutes to walk around will be good enough.
Amazing view of an amazing city!,Go at sunset or at night.There's a cable car for a fee but it's worth it in my opinion - it takes quite some time walking up there.The tickets for the actual tower can be bought inside the bottom floor of the tower and we bought some popcorn and sodas to bring with us. Actually we ate it during the rather long queue.When you get to the top you can gaze out at the city in every direction.A must if you visit Seoul!
Seoul Tower evening visit,"The cable car was short and slow, you may want to take bus on the way back as this is cheaper option It many things to do and quite boring, the viewing glass dirty with fingerprints, can't have good viewsThe restaurants is very expensive and not many alternatives for the cheaper onesThe q is slow and long, the bear museum was closed for good"
Nice view,"Accessible. With old folk and young children, we took namsan bus 5 from Myeongdong (next to subway exit 3)- without much walking can enjoy the nice view along the way. Love Lock and good view. Worth the trip. "
"Top of Seoul, ma!",A must see for all visitors! It offers unsurpassed and unique views of Seoul and the immediate surroundings. Cable cars take you to the base of the tower - a lovely park with spectacular views. High speed elevators take you to the viewing platform where you can enjoy the view with - get this - popcorn and drinks that come with your ticket!
"For Best Experience, Go At Night","N Seoul Tower is best to go at night.I believe during off-peak tourism period, this place is still very crowded. Prepared to walk up a very steep slope. There are a couple of public bus services that go there. I believe Google can share more info on getting there.Besides the phenomenal number of love locks, the place can be quite disappointing if you have been to a couple of towers in famous cities. Compared to the Sydney Eye and Shanghai Oriental Pearl TV Tower, the view of the city is that fantastic. You can buy the ticket to the Tower at a discounted price if you buy it together with a ticket to the Hello Kitty mini museum. Unless you are a great fan of Hello Kitty, the museum is very small and serves more like a couple of photo spots for visitors."
Great view of Seoul,"Could not appreciate the size and scale of Seoul until up high, on the mountain, and being able to see 360 degrees. Bonus was live traditional music and acrobatic type performance on the viewing level in a small outdoor amphitheater type setting. Great for an hour, not more probably, but worth going up."
Night tour,"The night view from the top was awesome! No need to buy admission tickets as there are alternative viewing points which our personal local guide from 'tours by locals', Denny taught us. Saved time n money doing that. His vehicle could also bring us all the way up to the building unlike big bus tours which had to stop a few metres away. There was also a 3D roller coaster ride in the building for 5000won per person and a free 3D short clips. That gave an overall awesome experience! "
N seoul tower,"The view from that place is breathtaking. Must-see location in Seoul, at Any time no matter what the weather is like, it's always beautiful"
Climbed the 649 steps to the top & the view that waited was so worth it!,"Staying @ the Millenium Hilton, we watched the cable car(s) & the beautiful sunrises & sunsets that made the Seoul Tower look so much more amazing from the Ex lounge. My husband & I decided to take the stairs, all 649 steps. The air was nice & cool, we took our time & most of all, enjoyed the sceneries /view especially at the observation deck. Walking down ( the easy part ), took sunset photos made more beautiful & dramatic taken through the trees & the Wall. The views climbing up & going down was so worth it & not to forget mentioning, the workout is great for our hearts.❤️"
Good overview of surroundings. ,"Having been to Towers in different countries, there's not much novelty left. Unsure if I had missed certain sections.....but I preferred Towers with some 'openness' - Seoul Tower seems entirely enclosed. Still, whenever possible, we do make a point to visit the Towers in different places. Personally I do like the 'lovers' pathway with all the locks hanging at the railings - would have done it myself if I were younger :) "
LOVELY VIEW & MEMORY TREES,"For starters, if you love hiking - they have a perfect trail for you to hike on from the bottom of the hill to the top where the Tower sits. You can make stops along the way to snap awesome photographs. I am definitely not a hiker so I grumbled and puffed all the way up to where the Tower was located (you can catch a bus if you're like me and you dislike hiking or you can go by cable car as well). Even though I disliked hiking and climbing stairs, I have to admit the view was to die for at every stop you make. Venturing into the Tower itself was an experience of its own. My favorite part of the trip up to the Tower was leaving behind a piece of memory in the beautifully designed memory trees (you can buy locks to write on where you can stick to a tree or you can just enjoy reading other people's memory locks). It's a must visit, the walk down from the Tower was magical in the night time (during winter as well). Will definitely visit the Tower again soon."
What a View!,"We started our walk from The Hyatt hotel, and it was just all up! Fantastic and lovely walk thru this park. Loved how there were 2 gym areas to do you workouts, lovely clean areas everywhere - this is how ALL of Korea is CLEAN AND TIDY. Whilst walking we past a lovely small lake which has heaps of 'gold' fish in it - however the lake was frozen - rather funny as we tried to drop stones on it to confirm it was frozen"" ❄️as it was -6"" and we were loving it. There was also a lovely kids playground and some interesting signs around the park. Then came the huge steep hills, they have steps or ramps to get up them, which I had to do the ramp. (Definitely need shoes with a good grip). Once we finally got to the top we found out that there was a bus that could take you to the top. I'd recommend this if you couldn't do the walk as it's definitely something that you should see. From the top we found this incredible view 360"" of Seoul. We had a lovely cheap lunch - pizza & drink - I was there with my brother & the restaurant took us to an area which was for couples - love seat with an amazing view. Would've been great if I was with my husband, so we got up & went to another area which was heaps cheaper & perfect for what we needed. When heading into the tower be ready to gave your photo taken & to make a pose. Unfortunately we didn't do it in time so we got a crappie photo. There are shops underneath the tower however most of them went finished being built, only a couple open, so not really worth going into until they're finished. Enjoy the return walk as it's mostly down hill, we actually went thru a dirt track coming back and it went straight down the side of the mountain - extremely quickly considering it took as about 45 minutes to get to the top and about 20mins to go back down. If taking the short cut be very careful but definitely worth it."
Tower and romantic love locks,Luckily we bought the tickets online before we reach Seoul and the tickets were cheaper than from the ticket booths there. Try to purchase the ticket from Klook or Kday as they are definitely cheaper and can skip the queue. The cable car was quite packed and needed to queue for about 20 mins when we were heading down. Love locks are just mere away from the N Seoul tower. Do note that you will need to climb a lot of steps.
Beautiful day and night view,"Must visit with family or friends, there is a photo booth before the lift lobby and a restaurant at the top."
Great views,"The views from the tower are the reason to take the 30 second elevator ride to the observation deck. On a cloudy day, the view was not as clear. There are restaurants at the top as well as a candy store and souvenir area that you can purchase a post card and mail it anywhere in the world. Kids enjoyed that and being able to send to their grandparents. "
Great view,Great view over the city. Very very very hot in the building.... it was not real busy so you could watch everywhere without always people in your comfort zone.
Multuple sites to have fun in a single visit,"We came here only hope to visit the Namsan Park (place the famous lovers lock) and take the cable car to visit the Seoul Tower. However, at the ticket area, we got to know that we can purchase a package deal that includes two additional museum, namely Hello Kitty and Sensory Museum. Both Museum has kept us occupied with great photo opportunities and some interactive activities. We decided to start our visit at Namsan from 2pm onwards so that we can get to see both day and night view from Seoul Tower. First, The children were excited about the cable car ride. Next, we bought the locks for them to add in the collection at the infamous bridge. We had fun as a family with four locks together. Both Sisters even made a deal to be back one day to see the locks together. Next, after the surprise discovery of the two additional museums, we managed to had fun for another hour. Then, we went up the Tower. Took a picture before we take the lift. Once we arrive, the photo is ready. Reasonably priced at 1 for 12k₩ and 2 for 16k₩. As we still had some time before night fall, we decided to have dinner at Han Cook Korean Restaurant. We had buffet at 45k₩ for adult and Children (7-12) at 18k₩. Dinner was nice and great view as we transit to see the night view.Overall, very enjoyable day for the family. "
Fantastic Scenary,"You need to walk up a slope to get up to Seoul tower, upon reaching the top, you are ""greeted"" with the fantastic view of Seoul city. There are a few places for great photo taking, There are some gift shops in the basement of the tower"
Great view--fun ride up in tram,There is no better view in Seoul than from here. We went at night--which was spectacular. Take the tram to the tower--it is fun ride. We actually did dinner in the tower. The restaurant revolves so you see all of Seoul over one hour. There are lots of stores etc here also.
Crowded & Freezing cold,"It was very crowded, we waited for about one hour to board the cable car which journey lasted about 5 minute. Upon arrival the wind was very strong and made it too uncomfortable for us to walk around. I believe day view is nicer."
Beautiful at Night,"My husband and I went here at night because during the day of our visit, it was really hazy. We figured it wouldn't be as bad at night. It was still hazy, but we did enjoy the view. We try to go to different towers at different cities. I didn't really enjoy being squished in the gondola on the way up to the tower and the line to get back on it was long though. The windows were very dirty from people's forehead oils and kids fingerprints - so that made it harder to see and take pictures from the tower. The best pictures we took of the city was just outside the tower actually. Besides that we did enjoy it, but wouldn't do it again."
Pretty scenery ,"Visited this landmark and on top of the view over the city we also got to appreciate some red leaves. We took bus 002 up n bus 005 down, skipping cable car as read somewhere else that there might be long queues at cable car."
Crowded,"After a steep climb up the slope, you take the elevator to the top of the tower. Weather is not very clear hence reduced visibility. Otherwise it's a bird'a eye view of Seoul city. But crowded with tourists. "
Fantastic at night!,I already walked up to the foot of the Seoul Tower in the week so this time with my wife we rode the cable car up & walked down (very easy!) Best visiting in the evening just after sunset. Amazing views of the city at night :)
Good view,"If you going to soul, you need to see the city from the tower, its a beautiful view and you can appreciate the city"
Nice way to have a look over Seoul ,"This is one of the main landmarks in Seoul and a normal stop on any city tour.It is a nice and convenient way to see the city, but it is quiet busy. The surrounding park is nice for a little walk too."
Very nice park on the foot of this climb. Excellent views throughout,"This was a very quaint trip to N Seoul tower. The tower itself is located in a Park with lots of interesting monuments and views looking over the city. I would recommend to do the climb to the top rather than getting the cable car. It is well worth it just to see the views of the surrounding areas. The toweer itself is located at the top and has a small stone area in front where a martial arts demonstration was taking place when I arrived. Very nice views, would recommend if you have a few hours to spare."
Seoul Tower,It is best to visit at night - to look at the city night view or visit the observatory. You can visit by bus or the cable car (in Myeongdong).
Good view from top,It was good views of the Seoul city. I specially liked the ritual of putting a lock here for your love.
Nice place,We took the fairy going up and returning nice place to spend the sun set many attract toon up and you can hang the locks there to 
Wow,Omg this is definately a must see. We went at night and the view was soo beautiful. It is definately a hike to the tower but there is alot of things to do there. You have to pay to go to the top of the tower but the lines were really long so we did not go all the way to the top. We did get to see all the locks and the view from there was already breath taking. Definately do not skip out on this. I would have gone at night and in the morning if i had time. This was one of the highlights of my seoul trip. 
best view of Seoul,"We rode the cable car going here and the view was just amazing.This is a great spot to visit with family and friends.There's the famous love locks and the iconic N Seoul Tower,which are a must for every tourist visiting Seoul."
"sparkling view of the city , visit after dark.","One starts enjoying the moment S/he enters with the wonderful colourful lights. The lifts take us to the upper deck like any other towers and the shops up there commonly found. It may sound very funny but -don't miss the toilets,particularly if your visit is during night. Its a different experience you dont get in any other towers. The walkway downwards is also very easy and enjoyable. "
"Nice view at night and day, not far from myeongdong","If you are into towers and seeing views from above then this is a great place. Nicer at night however once you get up there it takes only 20mins to walk around, take photos and admire the view. There is a postbox upstairs where a gift store is located and postcards are sold. Postcards are hard to fine, illustration ones and view point ones anyways so if your a postcard collector, might be worth purchasing the variety of cards there that's available. When your done, walk down to myeongdong strip down the stairs and walkway prob a 10min walk otherwise you would be paying an overcharge for set price taxis that are available on top. Taxis are hard to come by on the top of you don't have a car. "
Good for Photography,"Visited Seoul Tower during autumn (November). Great place for picture-taking. You can take a bus from Myeongdong to Seoul Tower at about 1500won (adult). After alighting, take a slow walk up the slope to Seoul Tower. You can take many beautiful pictures while climbing the slope. Beside the Seoul Tower, there are rows of railing for people to put their love padlocks. You can have coffee at the Seoul Tower and view the sunset at the same time. They have Starbucks and other coffee bistro."
Just like your average tower,"Came here cause when i visit a new city, is customary to visit the tallest tower and see the view. Up a mountain, its about 40 min bus ride from Myeondong, and its ok. Its not bad view and i guess theres places to shop and eat but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this again"
use the toilet when you are up in the N Seoul Tower! bring your own lock!,"went on a clear day if possible, so you could have a marvelous view of Seoulwe purchased a package that allowed us to visit exhibitions that were at the bottom of N Seoul Tower and enter the tower as well. the love lock that is selling at N Seoul Tower is about 8000won each (~SGD $9.70) cant remember the price well, but i bought mine from Daiso in Singapore for SGD $2. Pen down my wishes on the lock in permanent marker prior the trip and brought it over to N Seoul tower.We then took the lift up to N Seoul tower, a little ear block due to the pressure, but it was fine. there is souvenir shop on top of the N Seoul tower and my friend bought a nanoblock version of the N Seoul tower, i guess it was an exclusive item as i did not see it elsewhere in seoul.i did a touristy thing by buying a postcard and stamp to mail back home to Singapore (: the price of the postcard varies, depending on the design you choose, and the stamp is about 100won? (it is such a small amount, so i cant rem accurately). There is a red mail box just next to it, so after writing my postcard, i just drop it inside.i posted on 1st november 2016 and received it back in Singapore on 23rd november 2016. it was kinda fun to see the postcard again, brought back nice memories of the place.before we head down, we went to the washroom (we are still at the top of N Seoul Tower) and boy, we had a surprise! we could view the scenery from the cubicle inside! and it felt like i was given my own private piece of serenity paradise while being inside the cubicle. so i cant help by taking scenery photo inside the cubicle (after i finished my business of course) (: we went down and visited two exhibitions. according to my friends, the exhibitions might vary from time to time, so during our visit on 1st november 2016, so one is about Hello Kitty & another one contained Marvel superheroes & Disney related characters. we spent about 1-2 hours at the exhibitions (not inclusive of the duration up in the tower), there are also little merchanise corners as well.it was worthwhile spending the time there (: i really enjoyed myself at N Seoul Tower, especially with the autumn leaves changing colours, they add vibrant colours to the pictures."
Tourist Attractions,I visited N Seoul Tower during Chuseok holiday in September. You have an option to go up by bus or cable car which you must try it both. A little bit crowded but well worth to visit.
Great place to get a lay of the land. ,"A good half day outing right near downtown Seoul. We took the cable car up, visited the tower and walked back down, which, even in late fall, I found quite pretty. "
"One way ticket to go up, walk the way back","I was trying to find the right amount of reviews to find out the best way to visit the tower or if its worth to buy roundtrip tickets for the cable car. We were a group of 7 people and not all of us are physically fit for a hike, especially during winter. After some deliberation, we ended up buying a one way ticket up and decided to walk down going back. It was a great decision. The walk back offers a nice lovely stroll even if its relatively short in distance. I would recommend walking down instead of hiking up. I see a lot of people doing it the other way around and see them panting like crazy. Take the cable car to ascend to the base of the tower instead. Note though that even if it says it is open till 11pm (some sites even say midnight), the cable car operates until 1030 pm only. We went during winter and the place was freezing but its still a nice little spot above the seoul skyline. Also, you gotta join the lovelock bandwagon. The locks cost around 6000 to 10000 won without the permanent marker. That costs another 1000 won. :) I would say that witer time and night time would be best for lovers. Not a lot of people and you can find a nice sweet spot somewhere everywhere."
Pretty cool,"We chose to walk up, it's a pretty hefty climb but you get some stunning views on the way up. If walking is a problem, the cable car costs 10000 won, one way. Definitely recommend going at night to see the beauty of South Korea with all its lights, but I imagine it would look just as incredible with clear skies. Entrance is 10000, we got the combo deal, which was 20000ish for entry for 2, 2 drinks and a popcorn (drinks aren't alcoholic which we thought). I believe you can eat there too for a price, there is also a separate hello kitty room and what looked like a marvel type superhero room, which again is extra money "
Major Seoul attraction.,"Yes, KR is cold & colder in the mountains. Bring sweater, jacket, scarf, gloves, & hat for no regrets. Beautiful on a good night. We went during the day since too tired the beautiful night before. Although, it was super attractive that night.To get to Namsan Orumi elevator to Tower cable car, get off at shopping district metro stop, Myeongdong. Use exit 4 to pop up at the McDs. Enter small street next to it bearing right to deadend. Go left & make 1st right to major cross street. At cross street, look left to see elevator. It's about 5 mins walking through back streets.Seoul Tower was one of the highlights of our Seoul experience. I'll be surprised to hear any disappointments. Expect a half day evolution."
The wow effect,"A 20 minute ride by taxi from Gangnam district to the cable car station where you get a ticket to go to the base of the tower.Keep in mind that there aren't a lot of cable cars and the queue can be a long one.You can pay for the tickets by credit cards.An enchanting wall with love locks at the base of the tower is a must in Seoul where you can buy the lock from the top.Scenic images from the top with the city skyline are priceless.On your way down, you can walk and grab a coffee at the many coffee shops on the road to the bottom."
Great view of Seoul,"We went with our two small children and it was great. From the top of the tower there are some amazing views of Seoul. Unfortunately it wasn't super clear, but we still had a good view. We took the Namsan Cable Car up to the top, it would be a huge hike to get there if you don't take the cable car. If you go in the winter, wear layers, it was really hot in the observation area. There is also a place buy a love lock, so bring WON or bring a lock with you. "
Cold,I came in october. And really cold. But a great scene up there in the tower... we have a cup of coffee there to warming... 
Go during the day,"Go during the day as it is even more crowded at night. I visited early during the day around 10.30am and it was not so bad - the crowds only starting coming in at noon.The observatory was, in my opinion not really worth it even though I got my ticket at a discount."
Place to view the city scenery,"I come to namsan tower by bus and the bus is very crowded,the queue is very long.view of the sunset at Namsan tower is very beautiful."
nice walk,It's very good experience to walk up the steps of Namsan to reach the N Seoul Tower. Very fresh air and nice scenery along the way. It will the best time to go before sunset to enjoy the view. 
Beautiful view ,This place is great at night. Beautiful views over the city. Highly recommend as part of the visit when in Seoul. 
A bit underwhelming but the walk was good,"Maybe because I was there alone but I feel that N Seoul tower is a tad too touristy and the view up was great but spoilt by the cloudy weather in the autumn morning.You do have to pay to go up to the TOP of N Seoul tower (this is an addition to the cable car ride from Namsan CAble to the tower which is perched on TOP of Namsan mountain). However, if the view is already cloudy as you could have observed from the cable car ride up, you may want to skip paying to go up the tower. Instead, spend some time strolling around the area and have a nice slow walk down back to myeong dong area (a relatively short walk from namsan cable if you are fit for walking ) for lunch. It will make quite a good morning work- out. :)Oh before I forget--- do check out the toilet in N Seoul tower if you did spend the money to go up - it has amazing view from the cubicle --- I took quite a few pictures just being inside the toilet!"
LOVE STORY,"Seoul tower, is one of the attractions to South Korea will go to, to walk for an hour in the mountain road, remember is a running activity, while taking pictures play ground to walk, finally came to the bottom, overlooking the scenery of Seoul is very good, buy tickets, tower, the scenery is pretty good, city night scene is very beautiful, and across all kinds of tower at night, however, do not too big difference. Tower outside the night scene lighting is great, have contemporary feeling, looking forward to the stage of the shop a lot, but the pictures of the reflective has affected people, probably because there is no thought of a lot of people want to take pictures, but behind the glass reflects light On the glass with different angles on the name of the city and the distance from a distance, you can see through the distance, it is need to take the elevator to the attic, an elevator has film, not boring. On the first floor on the ground beside lover lock, Taipei 101, Tokyo sky tower, Malaysia has a twin, while Seoul with Seoul tower!"
A great spot to enjoy the view of Seoul!,"Personally, the best time to visit is in the evening. It feels amazing to see the sun goes down and the city slowly wakes up! "
Nice scenery,"Beautiful scenery and relaxing place. Seoul Tower have nice scenery esp during autumn and spring seasons, a great place for all family, couples and friends."
หอคอยแห่งกรุงโซล Seoul Tower,จากจุดจอดรถ จนถึงลานกว้างบริเวณรอบหอคอย เป็นระยะทางราว 500 เมตร เดินขึ้นทางลาดชัน เหนื่อยได้เหงื่อกันเลย แต่ก็เป็นจุดชมวิวที่คุ้มค่าแก่การไปเยือนแห่งหนึ่ง มุมถ่ายภาพสวย ๆ เยอะมากFrom car park area to the tower base is about 500 m. with the slope up walkway. The viewpoint you can see around Seoul so beautiful.
An evening at N Seoul Tower,Have been to Korea few times but first trip to N Seoul Tower.Was planning to visit in the afternoon to see the Autumn leaves. But was told that evening view would be better.Got up there at about 5.30 PM. Met up with the beautiful sunset. Like a sea of rainbow.
romantic place,"N Seoul Tower is one of the famous scenic spots in Korea. We can choose cable car or walking up to the top of the mountain. The most special is that there are thousands of locks full of the handrail like a wall. The lock represents lover’s lock. The couples will write their name and something they want to say in the lock. After they locked the lock in there, they believed they like the lover’s lock will lock together and will love each other forever. This is a romantic place and full of couple love in there. It makes us want to take a picture and also want a boyfriend. Moreover, we can go the top of the tower. We can view the whole Seoul in there. But we didn’t stay until at night. It is to be regretted that we miss the night scene. I guess it must be great. Besides, there are also some restaurant and café shop let people take a rest. Next time, I want to go to there again."
Great Views a Must-Do,"This is a fabulous tower accessed by either walking up a lovely park or using the cable car. Visited early in the morning, so no queues, however allow plenty of time if you want to go up at night, as it is very popular. It has a variety of food outlets and viewing areas and is a place all tourists should visit."
"must visit, especially during red leaf and cherry blossom period","Location is convenient, many routes can go up from busy shopping area. Cable car is the fastest, convenient but expensive about 8000won 2 ways. Better buy 2 ways, much cheaper than1 way. Walk from Myeondong to take free escalator to the cable car station. Or take bus, many routes, cheap as 1250won, also can see beautiful trees when going up, will also pass the walking trail."
the whole city under your eyes,"I was taken to this restaurant for lunch by Chinese hosts. The restaurant rotates very slowly with great views of Shanghai, which is the main attraction. The core of the restaurant is a circular buffet with everything imaginable arranged into stations. I didn't taste any standouts, but I imagine that most people are here for the view and not the food. On the tower there were crowded with many people, they were likely to lock the locks over here. I took lots of photos with my two best friends, due to the season of tourism, we had to queue in order to take the photos in some views that we always saw in Korean drama. Finally we also bought some postcards and stamps in souvenirs shop, these were quite deserve to buy it but experience, at the shop there also was crowded with people. However, I standed on N Seoul with cool weather, but I felt Seoul city is beautiful and big city when you saw at here. If you came with couple, it was romantic place."
Nice view of the city,Went there for a quick trip during the day. Decided to have lunch at the Korean restaurant. It was US$25-30/person which isn't bad since entrance to the place itself is around US$15. The lunch buffet was really good so it was worth the money. We took the gondola to the top of the tower which cost around US$8/round trip. It was a nice experience. Great view of the city. 
not super worth it,"it was nice, but i think it was a bit expensive. i think it's a good place for tourists to go, similar to the pearl tower in china."
A Place that travelers travel to Korea have to visit,"Before I visited Korea, I usually saw this place in Korean drama. Many couples come here to lock their heart.It is a touristy place where one can get a view of the city. We can enjoy the whole great views of Korea at night, it is so amazing!We went here in that afternoon. On the tower there were crowded with many people, they were likely to lock the locks over here. I took lots of photos with my two best friends, due to the season of tourism, we had to queue in order to take the photos in some views that we always saw in Korean drama.Finally we also bought some postcards and stamps in souvenirs shop, these were quite deserve to buy it but experience, at the shop there also was crowded with people."
Visit Seoul day and night,"I would highly recommend couples to go Seoul Tower. There is a symbol for lover to visit. You can take pictures in everywhere. There are three main parts, which are Seoul tower, bear meseum and lock bridge. No matter you go in the morning or at night. The view is really nice. At that time I went at night, so I don't have chance to show how it looks like in the morning. Every time when I go there, there are a lot of people, such as tourists, visitors and even local residents. You can choose take bus and walk to the tower, or take the cable car. I like walking up to the hill because you can see different sides of view of Seoul. But just for reminded, it is kinda hard to walk the slope. This time I took the cable car to leave Seoul tower, it's amazing. Because you can see the other side of Seoul. You can see in the picture. The view is really nice. But the picture couldn't show it clearly. I didn't have time to visit the bear museum. But I walked around outside. There is a souvenir shop that you can buy the model of Seoul tower. And there is a store that you can paste your picture on the wooden board. But it takes at least 20minutes to produce one."
Night At N Souel Tower,"I have gone N Seoul at Saturday night and i were surprised that many people waited for cable car at station to the Tower that took time so much. However, I standed on N Seoul with cool weather, but I felt Seoul city is beautiful and big city when you saw at here. If you came with couple, it was romantic place. "
Nice View,"Take a cable car to reach. For couple, there is a ""lock""bridge which u can use pad lock to lock on the bridge for ""forever"" mean. hahaha... need to buy ticket for observatory. "
Beautiful Love Locks,Beautiful and romantic place to see. Dont forget to visit the love locks and take a photo of it. the view is very nice and awesome.
Best viewpoint,"Got there during bad weather, there was thick fog and it was raining. While i was drinking some tea in one of local cafes weather improved and i decided to go up. Did some really nice timelapses with my phone during daytime and some really nice pictures of night Seoul in the evening. A must place to visit for everyone, especially photographers. "
What views!,"A beautiful spot with incredible views of the city made even more beautiful by the bright fall colors. Watch your little ones because the fences wouldn't be up to the building code in the US, and the hillside is steep."
touristy,"its a touristy place where one can get a view of the city. If you go there by bus 05 from myeongdong/chungmuro metro station, be prepared to walk a bit as the bus will drop you at a stop station near the entrance where you will need to walk uphill for around 10 min. The bus ride/waiting itself is about an hour +, hence if you dont have much time, you would want to consider taking the cable car.There are a few restaurants at the deck/base of the tower. we took a return one way cable car ride costing 6000won. A return ticket will be 8000won."
Nice city view ,"This is actually anothe one telco tower used in the past, renovated to serve as a tourist attraction. The view is great if the sky is clear or you can go nite time to enjoy the city lights. Other than that nothing really special. Surrounding area is v beatiful and has some interesting trails to walk."
Watch packages,The tower was ok. Nice views. But I was disappointed in package I bought. Two beers -popcorn-ride up for two. Sounds like the top would be a nice place to have a beer. Wrong--- you carry the beers and popcorn up the elevator-- stand in crowd drinking the beers.
What a waste,"The N Seoul Tower is a MUST-SEE! But you got to think twice about paying extra to enter the observatory. it is indeed such a waste! When went to the N Seoul Tower, we were ecstatic! The view from outside is just amazing. We did go around the place, took photos in their Locks of Love, the outdoor ground/deck was very nice. As we were happy with it, we didn't feel bad to pay for the Observatory; I mean, if the ground/deck that is accessible for free is pretty nice, the observatory which charges per person could be a lot nicer to go to and pay extra for. But just when we entered, THERE WAS NOTHING TO SEE THERE AT ALL! We went there in the evening as they say that the view is pretty amazing at night; but really, there was nothing at all! All the other tourists that we were with were all like ""What did we just pay for?"" It is kind of funny and annoying; it's like throwing your money in the sink. LOLShould you want to throw your money in the sink, you've got to do it in the morning, at least you get to see where that money go. In the evening, all you'll ever see is fog fog fog. And you'll keep wondering, where did my money go???"
"Beautiful views, but very crowded and touristy",We waited 1 hr to ride the the tram up the hill to the tower. Once there the view of the city is gorgeous but then there's not much else to do. Very touristy place and high prices. 
Towering N Seoul Tower over the city,"The N Seoul tower complex includes restaurants, a viewing deck, a tunnel of love and some shops. We went to the shops, took pictures at the tunnel of love which is a staircase with a led ceiling. Then we went to the viewing deck to take some night shots. Passing there you'll notice that there are thousands of love locks attached to anything. We then went to the N Burger restaurant. We basically saw everything but did not take the elevator to the top of the tower because reading from the reviews it's not that worth once you are on the viewing deck and we got happy with the view from the deck. If you are in Seoul you will probably enjoy this place."
Must do!,"You can't go to Seoul and not going up to Seoul Tower.I am so glad that we decided to go up there by walk, but there is also the cable car option, but you will still have some stairs to climb though. It is quite a lot of stairs, but you can stop from time to time and watch people going up and down. You walk in a nice pedestrian road in the forest, and you can stop sometimes to enjoy a nice view on the city down there. At the top, you can have coffee, drinks, food.... we saw a traditional Korean dance show, which was very nice. Then you can go up to the observatory room, which I recommend. It is 360degree. The view is beautiful."
Great exercise and amazing view of the city,I travel a lot for conferences and meetings world wide. That most includes a lot of sitting and inactivity. So it was a real pleasure to work the many steps to the Seoul Tower. And the view of this gigantic city - twice the size as my country - was amazing.
Seoul sightseeing,"The views from the tower would be great if the weather is good, unfortunately for me it was very cloudy and foggy, so couldnt see much. Anyways the ride up on the cable car was interesting. "
Have a Glimpse of Seoul at Night,"My friend and I went at night time. It's easy to get there but if you want to catch the free shuttle from myeongdong station to where the cable cars are better check the time schedule of the shuttle before hand. My friend and I missed it so we took a cab and paid 3,000 won for the ride. Actually it's pretty close because my friend and I just walked back when we went home but those are your options. The waiting line can get pretty long for the cable car ride but it moves fast. It can get pretty windy and cold once you get on the tower area cause it's high up so I'd suggest bringing a jacket even if you're there during summer or spring. The night time view is really pretty! It gives you a view of Seoul and I bet it also looks great during the day as it is at night. If you are going with your lover, you might want to try the famous love locks."
Nice place,"I came twice in my first time to seoul,,, I'm so happy whene I came here for the second time I got free magic show that so funny..If you go there You can use bus no. 5 from myengdong st exit 3 and from chungmoro st bus. No.2And if go there by cable car, from myengdong sr exit 3 or exit 4 to cable car station.."
Wedding Anniversary Dinner,"A lovely place to celebrate our wedding anniversary. From dinner at n.Grill's revolving restaurant to the placement of our padlock with the thousand others or the cable car ride to and from the tower, this is a most memorable place to visit."
Beautiful park,I have walked around this park several times. You can make it up to the top in less then an hour depending on how fast you want to make the trip. Great trails both on asphalt and through the woods. So nice variety. Amazing 360 degree views around the city. Can take the tram down as well. 
Popular tourist place of interest,"The actual tower viewing platform is quite small. Recommend to visit at least once, but might not warrant a second visit. The park below the tower is quite scenic and also has some performance on occasion. "
Great view!,A must-see and don't forget to bring your own pad locks with your names and dates on it. They do have locks for purchase at a reasonable price. It's an awesome sight to see. You can either go up with the cable car or walk up which is very steep. Very hot during the summer.
Not worth the trip up...,"Perhaps it was my poor experience at the buffet restaurant (HanCook), the long wait at the Namsan cable car station, or getting ripped off by taxi drivers at the Namsan cable car station taxi stop - that led me to such a poor rating.N Seoul Tower is one of your typical observation towers among its brethren - e.g. Space Needle, CN Tower, Calgary Tower, etc. And like these other observation towers, they do provide nice views of the city (probably the best time to arrive to these towers is a little before sunset) at a steep cost.My first annoyance was the shuttle that they provide from Myeondong (line 1) is very confusing. I waited at the stop and the Namsan Cable Car station shuttle came by. My original intention was to take the bus directly to the tower as it was cheaper than the cable car and I heard not so positive reviews of the cable car. The bus driver, who was clearly English deficient or purposely deceitful, told me I was in the correct bus - then promptly dropped me off at the cable car station. I have to imagine that this is a scam, as you then have no other alternative to get to the tower other than using the cable car. The cable car cost is approximately $7.50 USD vs app. $2 USD for the bus ride. So I relented to buy tickets, only to have to wait around 30-45 minutes for a chance to ride the cable car up (be aware of the Disney-like lines which hide the true wait time).The cable car itself was standing room only. The views going up were a bit disappointing and IMHO not worth the extra $5.50 USD. You can see a nice view of Myeongdong, but you don't get that super wide panoramic view of the other parts of Seoul. The ride is short as well - app. 3 minutes!I arrived a little after sunset, so that may have tempered my opinion of the place as the views were much more limited at that time. You do have views of various areas of Seoul, as well as an area where people chained these love locks to a fence (similar to a bridge in Seattle), various restaurants, souvenir shops, etc. I didn't realize the Alive Museum is there (I went to the one in Jeju and wasn't too impressed).We decided to purchase dinner for HanCook restaurant, the buffet restaurant at the tower for approximately $88 USD for two. The only nice thing about this is that the price includes a trip to the top of the tower. I have a separate review of the restaurant, but I can easily summarize the restaurant as terrible. I was able to walk around the tower after dinner - there isn't too much unique to see in the tower itself. We then took a walk around the area at the base of the tower - and again, there isn't much unique to see in terms of shops or restaurant.We took the cable car back down - the wait was much less. The trip down was uneventful. However, I arrived back at the cable car station base a little after 8:30 PM and unfortunately, the last bus to Myeongdong departs at 8:30 PM! Obviously, the cable car station ticket office doesn't warn you about this. Accordingly, you are left to the wolves - in this case, the taxi drivers. I didn't want to walk back to Myeongdong so I approached a taxi driver for a ride back to Myeongdong. The taxi driver immediately indicated it would cost me a 20000 won rate up front, $17 USD for essentially driving less than a few miles (and actually, Myeongdong is literally only a mile or two away from the Namsan cable car station)! I should have called an UberBlack car at that time instead of taking the taxi... But the lesson is - beware of the Seoul taxi drivers!Anyway, N Seoul Tower should probably low on your priority list of Seoul attractions as there are many other worthwhile attractions to go to."
Good!,How beautiful night view!!Little bit hard to go to the tower but clean air. You can take the bus to the tower also!
Beautiful place,"The way up to N tower look like heaven covered by yellow and red colour of autumn. It's wonderful to be there. The lock bridge is colorful. Luckily it was sunshine, I took hundreds pictures there. :)"
A place worth going to,We took the cable car to get to N Seoul Tower. It was a nice ride overlooking Seoul. The place is really nice. It's also perfect for couples as it has a romantic feel. 
Beautiful scenery & romantic for couples,I highly recommend N Seoul Tower visit at night time to capture the night life of Seoul city. It is a romantic place for couples to snap their photos & definitely a tourist attraction.
Gives you a gorgeous view of the city!,"Seoul Tower is one of the places I constantly come to each time I visit Seoul. The best times to visit are at sunset, but beware of the long queues at the cable car starting from about an hour before (depending on what season you're there). In spring, daytime is lovely as there are many cherry blossom trees along the way up and in the surrounding areas (you can choose to hike up to enjoy the greenery but the cable car offers a view as well). If you're there till late, the tower will be lighted up and you can also get a lovely night time view of the city! You can choose to hang love locks in the designated areas and there are also restaurants and gift shops for you to spend your time in. You can also pay a fee to go up to the tower peak but the view from the public area is good enough for us."
beautiful view!,Take the cable car up to the top of the mountain to the tower. Besides going up the tower there are a couple other stuff to see or do there with occasional cultural performances happening outside.Bring your own lock or buy a love lock there to add to the millions already chained there. The view at day and night are worlds apart and if you have time you should def see both or possibly go slightly before sunset so you can get them both in one visit. Definitely add this to the to-do list. 
Beautiful view of Seoul on a clear fall day,Great views of Seoul from the tower and surrounding park area. Take the street level elevator up instead of the climb along steep streets.
Lights up at night,This is of course a very touristic place to visit. Be prepared to walk up long hills just to get to the top. Not for those with health problems or bad knees. The tower itself is just like any other tower in any other city. The locks are nice to look at around the tower. It is definitely something to see if visiting Seoul. 
Not open air. Smudgy windows. Therefore awful. ,"I went up on a misty night, and somehow I assumed it was an open air deck. It was not. And the windows were all dirty from smudges. The view was therefore nothing to write home about. Had I known it was a windowed deck I wouldn't have paid 10,000 KRW for it. Absolutely not worth it. Any observation deck that is not open air is in my opinion an obscene injustice to the actual view. The view from the bottom of the tower is far better. "
Recommended for couples,It is better if you come here with your lover. You can buy locks to lock on or go to the top of the tower.
Fun for friends,"Easy to find from the subway. Lots of coffee shops and food at the bottom. 10 minute walk to cable car. Great view! Wouldn't recommend paying an extra 10,000 won to go to the top. "
where will you be in seoul. if it ai't here.,"sure there are many people, but this wont stop you at all from enjoying this beautiful place. it's hard to say either this place itself or what this place can show you is real beautiful. try to have a peek in everything single things around here. it definitely worth your time."
Do try their restaurant,during the sunset is the most romantic moment to sit with your partner in the restaurant to watch the sunset over a nice dinner. transportation to reach here is very well coordinated.
Bonding trip w daughter,"My daughter N I planned to spend half of our day in Seoul Tower. At the end, we were there from day till night. There were many pictures spot and cultural shows which we enjoyed tremendously, please check the timing for the show. You may consider bringing a lock along to lock up so lovely notes along the way. If you had forgotten, you may purchase one in a store nearby. "
One of the best towers,Every major city has a tower now which lights up in the night and gives a wonderful view of the city. Seoul tower is unique because it is situated on a beautiful hill and therefore is good even on day. You can take a bus or walk if you are very brave and it is very nice Must go 
Endless queues,"We started our visit in N Seoul Tower at 4pm in the afternoon. My friends and I spend more than an hour in queue just to get to the Tower via the cable car. Another hour to buy our ticket and wait for our turn to go up the Tower. 15minutes at the top of the Tower. 30minutes to get down the Tower Another hour in queue to ride the cable car. In short, our time was wasted in queue and the entrance fee and the cable car fare were not cheap. We're not sure if we're simply unlucky that the queues were extra long or if it's normal. If it's normal, I wouldn't suggest going here."
Great view of the city,"Set in a lovely park, the view is everything you would expect. It is touristy. You have to pay extra to go right to the top. There is quite a bit of the normal tourist trash there but the view is great. Would be nice to have a bit more information about what you are looking at but a good way to spend a few hours. We walked to the top and got a tram down. "
"View is great, prices for admission is misleading ","While we thought that when we paid to ride the gondola up to the tower, it included all fees to go into the tower. Sadly, you have to pay admission again when you reach the tower base. There are restaurants, shoppettes, coffee and juice stands and the base and in the tower as well. All in all for the price it was ok. We went at night so it was a bit cold. "
Perfect for those who love to hike and see the city from above,"We walked from our hotel (N. Fourseason) to the N Seoul Tower. If you don't like walking the seemingly endless steps, you might as well take the cable car. We walked because the queue for the cable car was so long. We wanted to see the sights before sunset as well as the view at night. Bad idea to go on a weekend if you hate crowds and long queues. The walk up, although tiring, was still an exhilarating and a wonderful experience. The views are breathtaking. There are nice restaurants up there as well as a mall (it was not yet complete the time we visited)."
Amazing Views from the top,Love these experiences and try and do this each trip I take to cities that offer this. The entire experience from going up and up to coming down and down was fun.
A popular spot with a nice gift shop,"To tell you the truth, I was not so interested, but my host wanted to take me there. We took the cable car up and walked down on the way back. If there's a long line, don't panic, in Seoul long lines dissolve very quickly and the longest you might need to wait is 20 minutes.When we visited, the institute was decorated for Halloween and had some Halloween themed extra products and services.The view is nice and interesting, distances from other countries displayed on the windows.The gift shop is great, albeit expensive - compared to other museum gift shops!You can buy a postcard with a stamp (it's a package) and send it.Once outside, don't miss the other sights - we did.Bonus: the toilets are Instagram spots (there's an Instagram frame on the windows)."
Nice,"Enjoyed a lot with friends to see the Seoul view . Suggest to go clear day . We enjoyed the cool environment ,fresh air abs walk ."
Touristy but Well Done,Generally not big on these attractions but gave it a try - tickets reasonable. Total touristy attraction but great views. Never seen so many gift shops. Well done with ceiling video on elevator ride.
Nice view,"If you have been to the Shanghai Pearl Tower or Tokyo Tower, this is another must to visit when you in Seoul. We bought a super cool Seoul Tower model in a snow ball as a souvenir from the bottom shop."
Amazing view,"Amazing view and unforgettable visit especially in winter , a must see in Seoul where you can enjoy the Cable car ride to reach there"
Super nice view of Seoul. Gets very chilly at night. Might be cheaper to take the bus,"Super nice view of Seoul. Gets very chilly at night, though.Might be cheaper to take the bus from Myeongdong than take the cable car, especially if you're not a fan of cable cars :P"
Superb tower,N Seoul tower is must see attraction for tourists. Adjacent to green plush Namasan park this attraction is full day activity. In night you will see colourfull view of Tower. Food snacks and drinks options available.Government as well as tourist buses operates here. No personal vehicle allowed near Namasan park in order to maintain green park and environment.Superb and must visit location.In order to show love to your soul mate or girlfriend or boyfriend you can tie clock 
Seoul landmark,A very popular landmark for tourists n Korean drama film shoots. It was mid afternoon when we decided to walk from Nadaemun market to Seoul Tower. It's about 10 plus minutes to get to Namsan Oreumi Elevator (inclined elevator). The free ride was about 1 or 2 minutes. This ride provides a tremendous reprieve for elderly like me n my wife. This ride takes u to the cable car station from where u can purchase a return ticket for 8500 won. Senior citizen age 65 year n above get a discounted 6000 won.This site is famous for courting couples to eternally seal their love by literally locking their pledges here for all to see. How romantic :).You go up the observatory tower for a fee or you can choose to buy a dining package with the restaurant there which includes free access up the observation tower. The night views from the tower is awesome so I was told. I think so too.Myeongdong is also nearby and can be reached in under 15 minutes on foot. In fact there is an underground shopping link all the way from Myeongdong to City Hall station.  Try it! Ask around! Explore! The subway station are really close to each other with many links underground. ..:)
Seoul Tower,"It looks more like a radio mast from a distance but I would strongly recommend visitors go here.The views are fabulous, there are normally shows of some sort on the platform, there are nice walks round the tower/hill and cafes for a snack. Take a loved one and add your padlock to the trees and just relax.Then take the cable car back down and watch as the scenery opens up as you drop out of the tree line.Great!"
Panaromic View of Seoul City,"Generally it is the place to go if you want a panaromic view of the city. Taking a cable ride is the faster and easiest way to get to the top but for the more adventurous and fitter ones, a hike up and down will be more fun."
very not high,it is not high but worth going please gogood view in night timedon't get lost or loose you childif you do loose your child contact the police imminently or check with the people around.but loosing your child is very rare
Busy but relaxed site with great views of the City,"The N Seoul Tower was an interesting site in that it seemed to offer different people different things. There was an element of fun mixed in to the back drop of the great views of the city plus the trees and nature that is the Namsan Park.I didn't go up to the observation deck itself. I chose to stick to the viewing platforms around the tower which provided multi level views of different sides of the city. One of the striking elements would be the love locks that are pretty much every where. A lot of couples come up here and the sheer number of locks is a testament to that. Whilst I came here during the day time you can imagine during sunset and the evening that this would be site for many couples seeking a romantic respite from the city below.Around the tower itself, aside from the park, are restaurants and cafes that give you the opportunity to just relax and enjoy the environment. For families aside from letting the kids run around for a bit there are fun characters to take photos with.Whilst I wouldn't necessarily say it's a must see I'd suggest choosing a time of day that meets the objectives of your visit whether it be as a group, family, couple orIndividual and just enjoy chill out and enjoy yourself.Note: I took the cable car up and a bus down. The walk from the metro station to the cable car station is very steep so take it slow walking up or consider getting a taxi if you're with people less mobile."
Must go,"I like its location, easy and accessible, if you go to Seoul this place must go, quite interesting and from there you can see many places of Seoul. Just that need to line up for at least 1-2 hrs "
High point ,To visit Seoul tower is a most because The view from The top is magnificent. If The weather is clear you can see allmost The hole city. And dont forget to buy a love lock before you go up(it's much cheaper down in the city). The lock is for couples in love and you can put The on allmost antingen upthere 
Beautiful evening visit!,It was a beautiful place to visit in Seoul. You must walk up quite a steep hill. Be prepare for that hike. The garden of love is beautiful with the puff heart shaped structure and the surroundings. This view is probably better during the day but the view from the observation deck is better at night.
Wonderful view,This is a nice tourist attraction that the family can spend 2 or 3 hours easily. There are several stories at the base of the tower with food and souvenirs. 
Love locks!,The MUST SEE place when you are in Seoul Korea. You can see beautiful Seoul from the tower. Very peaceful and unique. 
Nice views of the city,"Not a fan in particular of observation towers such as this one, and wouldn't usually pay to go up but was dragged along by friends this trip. Once up on the observation deck, it does give you nice views of the city and the tower is very visible even on a smoggy day in Seoul.Personally, I actually enjoyed the experience walking around the base of the tower more. There were many local families and lovebirds walking around during the night so it's not just a tourist-y spot."
Must Visit,"Go on a bright sunny morning & be prepared to walk. You can always take the cablecar down. From the hotel I stayed in, there is a nice view of the tower from the restaurant & watching the cable cars going up & down in the cheerful sunshine makes you want to go up to the tower. When I did make the trip up, the fresh air & very good views made it an enjoyable morning. Just visit the tower & see it for yourself. Form your own impression."
Fabulous view,"I was amazed at how much stuff is up on top of the mountain from which this tower arises. Restaurants galore, and not cheesy. Seems to be popular outing spot for locals, not just tourists. "
Amazing view ,"If you have time , it's nice to visit . The view was amazing but it's quite nice to have coffee when you see view "
Breath taking view of the City from here.,"We went up there in the evening before it got dark. It is the best time to see the city both in the day and night. Being autumn, the garden was filled with colours. Good photo taking spots."
Hi-Tech plus Nature,"Want to see the city from above but don't want to be overwhelmed by concrete buildings? This tower is surrounded by trees from Namsan park. Before heading to elevator, you'll have a quick picture taking and one reached the top, your picture is done with few different backgrounds of Seoul tower for a fee. Exiting tower, there's a restaurant down below the stairs and you'll find 3D show from ceiling and huge TV wall. Nice!! It's nice to be in nature park but the tourist can be overwhelming. Just wish they can limit the number of people to enter the tower and park."
Night view of the city,It's a good place to have a night view of the city but the tower observatory level was crowded with people. You could actually enjoy the city night view at Namsan Park if you don't want to pay entrance fee and spending much time to queue up for the observatory.
Steep trail,"We took the Seoul city bus (hop on hop off bus) and it brought us to all the main attraction sites. This particular stop dropped us off at the foot of the mountain. We took the trail up to the tower. It was actually steeper than I thought. I was a bit afraid that my 2y/o son might roll down the trail. Took us less than 10 minutes to get up to the foot of the tower. There is a few restaurants,a square that has entertainment and lots of love locks. Tip: there are 2 trails 1 is the main steep trail that everyone takes (on the right). On the left it's more like the ""back"" trail it is less steep and it leads you to an elevator (wheelchair accessible) you can also take the stairs up. We took the stairs down. There was practically no one so we are able to take some great pictures. There's also a Hanbok store that you can rent at a hefty price. "
plain of life,"great experience you shouldnt skip. dont forget to buy your lock (is a Korean young people custom). although the line takes at least 30 minutes, it's worth the wait"
Fun mountain climb!,"K-drama fans will know this site well. Walk up the mountain and see the locks placed by lovers (which are apparently cleared out occasionally). Walk up is advanced cardio, but there are stopping points along the way. There are also bus trips that go most of the way up the mountain. Shops and eateries are at the base of the tower."
Tallest point in Seoul,"On the top of a mountain, the tallest tower in Seoul gives u a spectacular 360 degree view of the city. You reach the tower via cable car, which costs 10000 won per person and around the same amount for entry into the tower itself. Food isn't great and the souvenirs are a bit tacky. But the experience itself is really nice."
Good view at sunset,"For a first time visit to Seoul, it would be good to consider the N Seoul Tower as one of your destinations. Of course, there are other similar places such as 63 Building for instance, but N Seoul Tower would be the easiest for a first time visitor.To get up to N Seoul Tower, you would have to get to the Namsan Cable Car first. The cable car itself is about 15 minutes walk from Myeongdong Station. The cable car will get you up to the top of Namsan Park in about less than 5 minutes. However, be prepared for a wait of about 30 minutes at least during peak hours. Of course, there is the walking option from the bottom if you do not wish to wait that long.If you wish to take a good shot at sunset or at night, I would say that it is actually better to take it from Namsan Park right outside the N Seoul Tower, rather than at N Seoul Tower itself. As we went during sunset time, it was quite crowded even outside N Seoul Tower itself, but the views are quite amazing even then. I would advise coming early to get a good view.We went up to N Seoul Tower and found that the views are great, but there is not really too much difference from the views outside N Seoul Tower though. Because of the glass panels at the observation deck, it can be a little difficult to take photos without having reflection in it. It is better to go during the daytime if you wish to go up to the N Seoul Tower in my opinion.There are a few restaurants serving those who are hungry for a reasonable price, along with a good view of the Seoul skyline as well. Overall, I would say N Seoul Tower would be good to visit once, but there are probably other better places to view the Seoul skyline, perhaps even for free too without the crowds."
I been there for the first time.,"I love this place, and I like to visit there again. If I have a chance I could visit there with my girlfriend."
Nice and place,I went there at night. this place is suitable for everybody. The facilities are awesome. View from above are so nice. With the view of love lock everywhere makes this place so romantic and very suitable for couples.
"Romantic, Tourist attraction",Able to sightsee Seoul's night views and there's romantic restaurants up and down of the tower. Able to go for jog or ride on cable car
"Awesome night view, but lighting not suitable for photos","Perfect night scene overlooking Seoul city. However, if you're into taking pretty photos, I would recommend that you go in the day instead. Must-buys at Seoul tower would be the teddy bears dressed in traditional hanbok at the teddy bear museum. Good as gifts or a keepsake."
worthwhile visit,"It was a hazy day when I went. Despite that, it was a worthwhile visit. The park at the base of the tower is very beautifully decorated by thousands and thousands and thousands of colorful locks. It was incredibly spacious with lots of trees, flowers and sculptures. We didn't take the elevator to top of the tower due to the weather. I enjoyed the view and the walk around the park, the souvenir shops etc "
Touristy attractive but very pretty at night,"Want the city view? I don't think you need to go up the tower. Just climbing up the hill will be enough. The wind can be pretty strong. If you don't wish to walk, you can opt to take a bus up. The bus drivers tend to be rough. Making the bus ride pretty adventurous. Remember to hold on tight if you r standing. The night view is pretty. Very windy during spring, so he sure to keep warm. Try the korean style Chinese food restaurant in the tower. Sit near the window for view. The tang su yuk ( sweet n sour pork) and jampong ( seafood spicy ramen soup) is fantastic. "
View not great seen better view in Seoul to see where read on and it's FREE....,If you are looking for a great view at night I would not recommend the Namsam tower. The experience of the cable car ok but not worth paying extra to go up there for a view that could be better. So don't waste your money at the N tower.I recommend going to the Eungbong Mountain! It was more of an adventure going up and it's completely FREE for a better view.I have posted two photos to compare the view from the N tower and Eungbong Mountain.
Seoul Tower,From Seoul Tower you have the best view ever for Seoul . Easy access with several buses taking you there . All facilities as good coffee and a meal while being there. And of course you take the elevator all the way to the top . 
Must See and Do,"Be sure to go to the N Seoul Tower. Options include walking up limitless stairs or taking the gondola up to the tower - suggested. Once there, 360 degree views of Seoul. A variety of restaurants available for all tastes. Good experience for a couple or a family."
great views,There's a free open deck to see amazing views over the city! It's not necessary to pay to go up to the top of the tower! You can reach by bus or walking! The park is really beautiful!
Great view,"Great view from a high place. Going all the way up the tower is a little pricey and not really worth the money as you could probably see the scenary even from the base of the tower. Nevertheless, scenary is amazing. "
Good place to see,Nam San Seoul Tower is a must to see while you're in Seoul. You can use cable car and hiking to go there. If you not a hiking person it's best to use cable car and they will offer cheaper price for return ticket. What i really love is the view from above.. you can look mostly all Seoul city and if you're a lover / couple.. dont forget to buy a padlock and lock in the padlock area.. where you can put your wish together.. There is some trees which different color.. and looks like autumn color even though it's summer season.. weird.. but really good to see the color.. 
Wonderful outing!,"Arrived early-10am and took the cable car up the mountain, walked around the observation deck. Lots of places to take pictures, and a few stores for those souvenirs! Wonderful walk down the mountain!"
Climb or take cable car? ,"This place if you are staying at any of the hostel near nansan, you can just climb up to the cable car area to take cable car or climb all the way up! . "
Better Appreciated at Night,"This is one of the highlights of my trip to Korea. From the subway, had a long walk and took a cable car to the N-TOWER. Offers great panoramic views of the city.Went to the topmost portion of the tower which they call the OBSERVATORY. They have several decors where thosein a relationship sealed them with padlocks.At the ONSERVATORY, there are souvenir shops, some sort of museum and an Illusion show."
Nice view,"I suggested you to take the cable car if you would like to climb using the hundred or I thought its million stairs! But if you reach the top that would be a great experience nice view saw a lot off lock love,flowers ahhh sweet"
get a nice overview of Seoul,"We walked there on one of the hottest days in Korea. It was so hard to get on top of the mountain, the heat nearly killed us. So I recommend everyone not to walk there, unless the weather is nice (= not hot) or you want to die of exhaustion like we nearly did.But nevertheless, when you are on top of the tower and you can see Seoul from above, all your worries are forgotten.The windows were a bit dirty though, so the view wasn't the best. The price was OK, for a small fee you even get a popcorn and coke (about 1$ I think)."
Seoul Namsan Tower,"We are residents in Seoul since 4 years and we went every year more as twice up to the tower. It was a nice green place within a busy town. I remember 3 years ago it was a relaxing walk up and down and also the tower area was quite peaceful. Somehow I have the feeling it is worsening year by year. The operator has started to renovate and offer now several floors with shops, restaurants and whatsoever. Some of them opened and just closed again. LOL. Why? Because probably not many people will spend a penny there. There are mainly interested in making selfies. That's it. And who shall buy all these things you really don't need? We went there and left every time at least 50k for tower entrance and a beer, coffee or ice cream. There were a few shops totally enough to serve visitors. And usually you climb up to have a nice few and not to drink and eat whole day long. Anyway this time is over for us spending any coin there. This year every time we visited the place it was totally over crowded. If you want to visit tower's upper floor you shall wait at least an hour or even more. Especially on the weekends. Same way down. I can be wrong but since 2015 it changed dramatically. We usually walking either up or down along the small road. I remember the time when we saw many people using the bike to go up. Time is over. Now every minute some old diesel engine is rushing uphill to unload and to come back to collect again. Some of them are driving fast and reckless. If you have kids you are mainly busy with watching them because you are afraid that something happened. I really wonder why Seoul citizens are not doing much about it. Did they gave up already? Do they like how it is? This place becomes really disgusting. It has nothing to do anymore with a nice, beautiful, quiet, green, park and place. It just became a polluted place of commerce. We will not visit again. We are done with this tower. Have fun."
Hardly worth it,"Useful for getting a feel of the layout of the city, but not much more than that as a foreign visitor. There aren't really any landmarks I was particularly interested in seeing. And it's not even in the top 5 of the tallest towers in the world. The smoggy haze also limited what would be seen. The best part was seeing Hello Kitty World with my daughter. We were the only ones in there at the time and had a blast being silly, and taking a ton of silly pictures. Coming from the US, Hello Kitty World is a novelty item for us."
Good but not necessary,Its a good spot to admire whole Seoul (expecially at the evening/night). You cand get there by a cable car or bus. There may be a really long queue for the calbe car. A lot of people during weekends and holidays. Nice place but it is not a must see in my opinion.
"Over Priced, Over Crowded, Over Played - Tourist Trap - AVOID WEEEKENDS","Sure, there is a great view of the city from Seoul Tower, but be aware of what it will require to see it. I strongly recommend NOT going on a Friday or Saturday night. I was here before, and it was just a long wait. This Saturday night, it was a hideous wait.... around 1.5+ hours to get up the cable car, then another one hour (minimal) to go up in the tower. The cable car is around $10/each, the tower is more than $20/each. At the tower, you will be bombarded by over priced/under quality food selections, like N Burger, the worst burger in my life.... I hear there is a bus you can take to the tower, maybe that would be better.. Taxi's cannot take you there or back from there, so that's a real bummer. I would not do this again unless I had some assurance of a shorter wait. In total, took us over 3 hours to get to the top of the tower, maybe a bit more, not worth it!!!!"
good view from the top,"very good maintenance system, there is two times entrance fee, for the cable car to the top that bring you to the high peak area and another entrance to the namsan tower."
Ahhhhhmazing 360 degree view of Seoul,"We rode the bus to the top...but many people were huffing and puffing their way up the steep and winding road. Once on top, you can walk around a bit to get your bearings, and head over to the ticket counter to buy tickets to the observation deck. The elevator takes you to the top and you can spend as much time as you like taking in the view of a very, very crowded city of skyscrapers. It is hard to believe the amount of people (10 million) who live in the city until you see the vast spread of high rise living.Next, go down a level, that I think is actually better than the top level. Go down to the bottom and spend time looking at all the love locks.....they are EVERYWHERE.We rode the cable car down ..just for the fun of it. Otherwise you can use the steps to get back down to street level or catch the bus."
average tower ,when I say average I mean it's the typical tower that many cities have with the city view and the souvenir shops. but what's there really to complain about really. if you want the view of the city and some snacks and a Keychain etc. photo op etc. go here 
N Seoul Tower,"great place, you can go to hill by transport, but I did walk & it was amazing. you can see Seoul in 360 degrees"
Great view and cardio,Walking up the mountain and viewing the city from the tower waa a great experience. *aim to get there by 5PM. That way you can witness the view both in daylight abd2 then in night
Best views of Seoul,The views from the restaurant near the top of the N Seoul tower were breathtaking. Be prepared to walked up a very steep hill to enjoy the views. 
"If your visiting, you probably should do it","You can view all of the city on a clear day. The day that I went it was cloudy and you could barely see past the river, but still a worth while trip. I took the train to Myeong-Dong station and walked to the tram that will take you up to the Seoul Tower and I bought a round trip ticket. On a nice day I would have done one way up and walked down. It's a fairly steep trek up. Once off the tram at the next viewing area love locks were placed everywhere, so if that something you would like to do you may want purchase it before getting there or pay 8000 won. As you proceed it does get a bit commercial and you can pay to go up to the observation deck. There are several places to eat at and I opted for HanCook which is inside the Seoul tower, but that's another review and I'm happy with that decision."
Amazing!!,"Has an incredible view, the pictures from there are fantastic. Highly recommended.Would undoubtedly."
Nice view during day and night~,Very busy at night up the tower. Pretty view during the day but more spectacular at night. We were lucky enough to go whilst there was a Hello Kitty museum exhibition held inside.
Nice Surroundings,"Went there and spent 45mins there. Gave the tower a miss as the day was very foggy. So took a walk around the tower and there lots of 'love locks' bought by couples and after writing some message, will locked onto the fence provided. The locks were Low quality type and with many colors. It also helps to decorate the fencing, and adds lots of colors into the surroundings. The lock cost 8000 Korean dollars and a free marker pen will be provided. That's expensive for a lousy lock. I suggest one must visit as its the Seoul tower, but whether to go up really depends on the weather. There's also food and restaurants around it."
Must see,"Difficult to imagine the lay out of this huge city from the ground. Come up to the tower and enjoy a 360 view of Seoul. If the weather is fine, walk down the path instead of using the cable car"
Watch Seoul from the hill,"Go to the top of the hill and we can watch Seoul. If you like to watch Seoul's lights go to N Seoul tower at night. If you go with your couple, bring a padlock."
Breathtaking view of Seoul,"Namsan Tower is the must see attraction of Seoul. I personally did not go up into the tower itself because there was a waiting period of 2 hours and it was already quite late when I got there. But the view from the deck was beautiful enough for me. The sight of the tower itself and the view of the city of Seoul really made my heart skip a beat. I understand why a lot of couples go there.There are several buses going to Namsan, I myself took bus 3 from Itaewon.Ps. It is sort of a tradition to buy a lock, write on it and hang it up on the fence on the deck. I just brought it back home with me as a souvenir lol"
Worth doing but not over the top,"This attraction was interesting in and of itself. However, it was one of the most confusing places I've visited in Korea. Starting at the bus stop, it wasn't clear how to get to and enter the tower grounds. Then it was obvious where to buy tickets for the observation deck. Ticket buying came with a bunch of weird options for combos like observation deck/beer/popcorn, etc. We just got tickets for the observation deck. Then it was a mystery where to go to catch the elevator to the observation deck. There was a system with a monitor to tell you when you could go up. Only one elevator was being used so the line was slow. When we got up it was a glassed in gift shop with fantastic views of the city at night time. The line to go back down was VERY long and wrapped on itself and was not well defined. Thank goodness Koreans are excellent at queuing up and behaving in general. When we got back down, we ate at some restaurants that were oddly laid out and extremely slow.I know that all sounds like complaining and it is but, in spite of the drawbacks, we still had a good time and were glad we went."
Must see,"Towers can often be kitchy, and there is kitch here. But it's set in a wonderful park with lots of people out for exercise, and the views are amazing. Seoul is a big city and one really gets a good idea of how big the city is, how everything is connected, where the river goes and the many little mountains in town."
Great views of Seoul,Short walk from Myeongdong and a must to visit. There is a free show of martial arts in the afternoon which is quite impressive. Lots of places to eat. You have a very good aerial view of whole of Seoul and can take great photos..
Interesting but touristy,"Came here in the evening to see the night skyline. The cab fare from Myeondong area to cable car station is about 4800 won. Beware on return there were some cab drivers who demanded 20000 won because these are the waiting cabs. Don't give in, just wait for those that drop off passengers to this spot. It is a bit much to walk up in the dark narrow road. So take the cable car. Be sure to stand at the windows of the cable car to see the view going or coming down.You have to pay a separate entrance fee to go up the Seoul Tower. The sight up there is just ok, but I guess as a one time visitor you ought to try. The souvenir shop at the top and the lighting inside distract the view towards outside at night.While there, do not miss the locks of love at the foot of the tower. Now that the famous love locks at the bridge in Paris near Notre Dame cathedral had been cut and removed, you should visit this one."
Great for the whole family.,"It was a nice hike up the stairs to the top of the tower. Plenty of photo opportunities along the way. Quite a few stairs, and there is a small exercise park included on the trail as well. Getting closer to the tower, there are food stands, a monorail where you can ride to the top, and usually the traffic is pretty heavy. Further up there's a landing where you can buy a lock and attach it to the rails and stairs, wherever there's open space. It's a really popular thing for couples/tourists. The view at the top is great and you can see all around! Lots of souvenir shops and restaurants too. Great to visit day or night."
Nice tower,First you need to take a cable car to the bottom of the tower where you can find some restaurant .coffee shop and many lovers locks.similar to france where young couple express their love for each other.
Lovely place,Very entertaining place. So happy seeing padlock love and walking around namsan tower. There hello kitty island when we visit. 
Beautifull at night!,"A visit to this tower is a must do while you are staying in Seoul. You can go by stairs, quit a walk, or by lift. There are also many restaurants at the tower but a bit too touristic for what they offer. You must go there at night. Seoul by night is nice to overview. Entrance is not expensive. "
View from Above,Great view of the city from above. We got there late in the evening and the elevator line was 50 minutes as everyone wanted to be up there for the sunset. I am guessing the line would be shorter in mid day? But still a worthwile destination.
Amazing View of Seoul,"Seoul Tower is a must. Recommended route is to take a cable car up this mountain. After that , take a trek down towards Hilton direction and visit Nandaemun.It's a good view from the top down to Seoul. Recommended to do it in the morning or evening with the sun shining down."
"Smoggy, but good","Went to N Seoul Tower on the first day in Seoul. It was interesting trying to get to it, as we were on foot and decided to tackle the train and the bus. We ended up just outside of Namsan Park (by a public library) and found a map. Once we oriented ourselves, we saw there was a tram and made our way to it. We were a little touristy here and paid for the 2 beers and popcorn. A little on the excessive side, but it made the experience a little more interesting. Afterwards, we did some geocaching and went back down on the tram.Overall, it was a really nice tower and definitely something to check out in Seoul. "
Take the stairs!,"You can take a long paved route (40-60min), shorter stairs (20 minutes), or pay 8$ for a cable car to the top. The stairs aren't bad at all. We did it with 4 young kids (9,7,4,1). The views are wonderful even if you don't pay Togo to the top of the tower! The locks of love are really cool and there are great spots to get snacks, dinner, hot chocolate,etc. we hike up before dusk and watched the sunset and it was stunning! "
Not one of the best towers I've been so far,I've visited many cities and enjoyed city views from many towers and definitely this is not one of the best towers I've been so far. Once you buy your ticket at the counter you are asked to wait 40-50 minutes to get into the tower's elevator. Once upstairs the windows were a bit dirty so the view is not the best. Lights inside the deck are on all the time so is difficult to take good pictures because of the reflect on the windows. Waiting time to get into the elevator to go down was more than 40 minutes.I didn't find any positive point to talk about. 
Great Views,"Awesome 360 degree views of Seoul! First you need to take a cable car to the bottom of the tower where you find some restaurants, coffee shops and many ""lovers locks"", similar to France where young couples express their love for each other.The view on top of the tower is awesome, make sure to go on a clear and sunny day!"
Breath-taking view and long wait,"We got off at the Myeongdong metro station and walked up to the cable car station, which was a 5min walk. At the cable car station there was a huge wait (approx 1.5hours), so we decided to hike up, which ended up taking mere 40 minutes in a very slow pace. It was a very nice hike with few viewpoints to take pictures and enjoy the view. When we arrived at the socket, there was a bad surprise waiting for us: 2.5hrs wait. But this was only for people not holding a museum ticket. So we bought a museum ticker (had to walk through the museum) and then got up within 35min. And...WOW. The view is breath-taking and was well worth the wait. Be careful about which ticket you buy and try to go a day with little fog/pollution, I also recommend dawn/sunset and night time"
Great Views All Around,"The N Seoul Tower is great for all ages, has great views of Seoul City. You can take the cable car ride up to N Seoul Tower (from Myeongdong Station, look out for the Namsan Cable Car direction, take the elevator up if you do not wish to climb up a steep slope up to the cable car entrance)."
Great view of Seoul,I am a little disappointed with this attraction. Except for the great view of Seoul. There is nothing too impressive compares with Tokyo Sky Tree. 
A good visit but not great,"We visited the N Seoul Tower at night. The view of the city was great but there was a wait to go up to the observation deck, and a huge line to wait for an elevator to come back down. Also, the lights from the shop and food stand reflected off the glass making it hard to take good photos or just to see the view clearly. I did like the fact that you could skip the photo taking which most tourist spots try to force you to do. It was great to see the city all lit up at night but it wasn't a stress-free and completely enjoyable experience."
Good entertainment ,"Actually nothing special with this place. Just ordinary tower. But the special things is entertainment inside (special effect lift and the keylock park). You should try the popcorn sold near the ticket box, it was very delicious!"
Great for sightseeing,"So let me start by saying we did not do the tower tour. We went up to the top of the mountain on a shuttle bus from myeongdong- took in the view and turned and walked down the same way we came up. We hopped on the shuttle bus expecting to head to myeongdong but these shuttle buses do not run on a loop! To leave from the mountain you will need to go the opposite way down and you can ride the bus down if you want. It was horrible busy when we were up there and the buses were beyond full, so I recommend going on non-peak times if this is an issue for you. "
Do it since you're here!,"We didn't even know it existed. There was a booth at a festival promoting, so we went on a whim. Catching the subway and then bus to get there was fun. The practically 15 minute vertical hike up the last stretch to the entrance was a real task! The tower itself is average as ""tour towers"" go, but it's something to do. It was a foggy/smoggy day so the view was just OK.They've mimicked Paris with this lock & key program for couples. Cute. We took the cable car down. It was fun because it was a new adventure. But it's got family appeal. I'm glad we did it."
Great Views,"This is a great place to see the whole city from. On a clear day I am sure you would be able to see into North Korea, but as I went up at night I can't confirm. The area outside has some attractions of their own as well, such as an old temple and walls full of padlocks. "
Amazing night views of a vast city,We accessed this area from the Myeondong region using the cable car. Nice lighted walks and view points scattered around. The view from the tower is expansive and well worth seeing. Go on a calm clear night. Recommended.
Blur view at night,"The views at night were uninpressive comparing to other observation towers in the world (New York, Toronto, Chicago, London or Paris) - maybe because of the distance. Probably better to be visited during daytime."
holiday,its a landmark that most couple will visit to lock their love. scenery was awesome and there is a few restaurant there. 
Great view of Seoul at night time!,Nice to visit with your significant other for a romantic night out. They sell locks in the stores there for you as well as permanent markers. Great view. There's an entrance fee for the trolley to go up the mountain ($17 Canadian for 2 people).This place closes around 11 or 11:30pm.
Nice atmosphere and (should be) nice views ,"Well, staying nearby at Banyan Tree Seould we decided to walk up there. Got lost on the way but then saw the nice sunday crowd of families and friends planning to go up.They are offering a combo set for 2 which includes 2 beers and popcorn...just like for a movie so we settled for that.Views are obviously the best in town but it was slightly foggy on the day.A real 360 views as you can walk around. Direction of international cities on the windows are a smart addition.Worth the visit but not unforgettable!"
Good view,Has good view of the city but bit over crowded. There is bus transport near the spot and then a 10 minutes uphill walk to the top.
Beautiful scenery at night...,"A really nice place to relax but be prepared for the coldness (I went here during autumn) and the stairs after taking the cable car to the tower. There's Teddy Bear Museum, hanbok rental, and love lock shop too."
Not so nice view because of smog,"It could be one of the most beautiful places here, but unfortunately, usually there is fog or smog in the city, so the view is not so nice. And it costs some fee just to get to the tower foundation as well as to get to the top."
A space needle like the others,"It seemed like the thing to do, so we booked a tour that included the N Seoul Tower. It was nice, but basically like any other space needle. Our guide had us up to the top pretty quickly, but if you have to wait in those 1-2 hour lines, find something else to do. "
Seoul ,"Sightseeing on the top of hill overlooking whole citywide .Most of the year of visitors from China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Europe and the other side of the world."
Great view with love locks,"We got here by taxi from Seoul Station. If you walk, the nearest station is Myeong Dong. To get on the top we bought cable car ticket. 8k/person. There's nothing to view in the cable because it's a lot of people. The view on top is also nothing much. The most interesting maybe the love lock bridge which is similar to the one in Paris. "
Seoul Tower,Access only by public transport : bus or by telepheric. To visit around sunset and following a rainy day as to have a view as far as Incheon airport.The access to the tower is free when you dine at the top. Reservations are necessary. It is a revolving restaurant and it takes about one hour.
"Must see, the top view is fantastic!","We did the visit by walking all the distance to the tower and get back by cable, great experience. All the stuff very well organized, all for your pleasure and experience. Crowded in the weekends. "
Nice view but foggy on that day,"It was a foggy day, so we can't see too far away. My son loved it as there was performance nearby the N Seoul tower. We took two cabs to the tower and found out that cabs cannot go up directly. One cab dropped my family nearby the cable car area and the other cab dropped me off at the bus station that goes up, which is two different end. Please communicate with your friends or families on the dropoff point if taking more than one cab."
Impressive Site and Tower,We visited the Tower by taking the cable car. That was really Nice. Nice view from this area and even better from the Tower. Nice Food also at the burger restaurant
Great way to start your visit to Seoul,"Either by walking or taking the gondola, you will get a great view of the city and enjoy some history on the way. Beautiful park. The local Koreans seem to enjoy it immensely. It is a real family affair for them. Wear comfortable shoes if you decide to hike up. It will take you about 1 hour to make the trip up. Avoid if foggy or hazy as you will not be able to see anything"
There are many ways to get to the top of the hill. Food available,"Look up several paths throughout Namsan Park. Several food options and nice public bathrooms. Hello Kitty Museum, gift shops, touristy things to do at the top. Pictures with people dressed in Korean clothing is a fun activity."
Great view of the city,Great view of Seoul city from Seoul tower. Taking a cable car to the tower is recommended unless u have a very good stamina. The environment around the tower is good but sometimes it can be pack with lots of tourists. 
Just for the view,Kind of disappointed when I came to this place. The shipping area is almost deserted. Only the upper deck was busy with visitors. Come here only for the view (there are other places you can go to for a better view of the city skyline and it's free) or if you want to have some romantic time with your other half and immortalize your love with a lock on the fence (gag)
Clear days are better,Like most cities with observation spots this is no different. We went to this one after a rain and the views were great. Looking through the mountain ranges around what would normally be river views were actually towers of apartment buildings. It really brings home how many people live here. It has a 360 degree platform and world cities with their distances on the windows so that adds a little fun to things.
Great View of Seoul,"it's a great way to see Seoul from above.We go this tower around 7.30 pm, so you can see the sunset and night view of Seoul (the sunset is around 8 pm).The view is beautifull, though it's quite difficult to take a picture with glass around you.Don't forget to take a pee in the toilet (if you're men) because you can also see the great view while you pee :D.And please bring a lock with you, so you can express your feeling, by putting that lock at the botom of tower.And last, don't forget to take a picture at the edge of the clliff in in the bottom of the tower. The photo is more beautiful.Instagram : @adjimantoro"
Fantastic views of Seoul.,Take the gondola to top of the tallest mountain in Seoul and then take the elevator to the top of Seoul tower and enjoy the fantastic view. Its worth it !
Can see a great view of seoul,"You should visit N Tower if you want to look at the view of seoul. It's the landmark of seoul. The entrance fee is 9000 KRW, the observatory is opened from 10:00 to 23:00 pm. You can take on the namsan circle buses # 2 or 3 or 5 or namsan cable car. "
A must-visit in Seoul,"It is a great experience to visit the N Seoul Tower at night. One could see the city from the tower and there is a light show (on the tower body). It is important to do some research on the transport before going there. My first (unplanned) visit was quite troublesome. It was at night and I took a taxi from the city. The driver dropped me off and told me that was it. It was a dark road and there was not a single person around. Neither could I see any tower. Luckily I found a young couple later on and was told that I had to take a shuttle bus to go up the hill. After the trouble, it was an enjoyable experience. Please also bear in mind that most taxi drivers do not understand English and would not bother to look at your map. I ended up drawing a tower. Now, one could install Google Translate on the mobile phone to help moving around in a place like Seoul."
Good place and if you take bus go up then you have walk around 4km just can reach the tower ,It's fun and good place You can see view of the Seoul city :) but is pretty cold xDIf you no take bus go up then you have to walk around 4km and I choose the way to walk up its very tired but is a good experience Cause the bus is Long q so we walk down too You will walk down is very very fast 
Best view of Seoul!,Going up by foot it's quite a struggle especially if don't like walking. It'll take 20-30 mins walk uphill. Better to ride the bus or the cable car going up.
Nice foral along the way and view of city on top,"An easy place to visit to get the overall city view of Seoul. Also taking this chance to experience Korea's bus ride. Travel by Namsan yellow buses No. 2, 3 and 5 that circle the hill.The walk to tower is very pleasant in the spring air and beautiful floral exhibit along the way up.On the way down you can chose a bus that stop at Namdaemun market where there are quite a few food alley"
We also love Seoul Tower .,"Another attraction with our tour. Inline for the elevator , we waited and were asked to take a photo. great photo should take one.the elevator it self was fun to be on , it was like a 3 D show for you to see look up they told us and before you know it you there. It was a good experience. "
The most iconic landmark in Seoul!,"While in Seoul, you can see the North Tower from almost any location. Visit here in the fall or winter for the best photos. The restaurant inside has an amazing view, but is a bit pricy. "
Breathtaking view and free sword fight show!,"We took the hop on hop off bus to stop at N Tower. The view is amazing, unfortunately it was hazy the day we went.They have an entertaining show of music, juggling and sword fighting at 3pm which we were lucky to catch! The children had a blast watching the show. You can take photos with the performers afterwards but have to be quick as they only cater for that for the next 5 minutes after the show. "
Awesome place with a great view!,A must see. This place is pretty huge. Much bigger than I expected. Has a great view of Seoul City and is very clean. Went during the day and will go during the night on my next visit.
360 view of seoul,"went there by subway train and got off at myeongdong station exit 3. walked about 20 minutes uphill to the cable car. paid about 8,500 won for return tickets per person. could be crowded at times but definitely worth the scenic view of seoul. added attraction would be the locks of love and bear museum. ticket to the observatory cost us 10,000 won per person. "
A rip off! Pointless,"We went there to have , as everyone, a nice view of seoul. So as we thought, the higher the better, we bought tickets to have access to the tower.Let me simply say that a nice walk in the park around is as better as going up in the tower.The tower is expensive for what it is, does not go higher than 10 th floor , and you will have to queue forever. Ironic enough , you will queue longer to get out than to get in.Ccl,Go to the park not to the tower, save your money for a nice korean bbq!"
Catch the sunset from Seoul Tower,Spending time at the observation deck of the Seoul Tower is a great way to spend the evening and watch the sun set over the Seoul city skyline. I visited in October and the wind can be rather strong but it added to the wonderful experience 
it's landmark of the big city anywhere.,"if you wanna see the view of the city ,esp at nighttime with glittering skyscrapers and lights from the highways and running cars, it worths going to this attraction at night. the lookout provides different angle of city ,hill, skyscrapers and Han river. If you are bored with tower or something highest in the city,Just forget it . looking around Namsan park at ground level is also recommmended."
Nice view,"The view is nice but not of the most exciting I have seen. Between the cable car and the tower itself there is quite a climb. Not easy if you have physical limitations. During week ends can be very crowded.When you buy a ticket for the tower elevator, they have a very convenient system by which they tell you at what time to take the elevator. If in doubt, there is a screen at the entrance which says which ticket numbers are being admitted"
Stunning views of the city!,Don't go on a public holiday or you will be waiting a LONG time. Get the cable car to the base then get a ticket to the top. There is a candy bar at the top in case you get hungry!
worth the visit specially late afternoon to night time,Went here around 4pm to catch the sunset which was a sight to see. Took the cable car both ways but if you are adventurous you can walk it specially going back. The view was spectacular and worth climbing up to. Food here can be a little pricey so would recommend to have a bottle of water and some snacks with you since it's all walking and climbing.
Evening visit ,The place is so romantic in the late evening when the sun is setting . Climb up to reach the Seoul tower is steep and uphill for about 5 mins . Prepare good walking shoe. Great place for couples and Photographers . Well kept Pläce and amazing view of Seoul for me as my last day memory there. Great end of 10 days in Seoul and Jeju 
Nice place,Its good to be there. Specially if your are good at walking. If going during winter take care of the kids as it gets windy and chilly. But an excellent place for couples.Valuable Tip: Walk to the tower is more fun than being on top of the tower.
Nice view from the top of Seoul Tower,"We took the short ride with the cable car to go to Seoul Tower. The love lock balcony was great, very colorful. After reaching the top of the Tower, the view of the city was amazing,"
A must visit,"I have been to N Seoul Tower 4 times - all on a different season.. If it is your first time to Seoul, N Seoul Tower is definitely a must visit attraction. You can choose to walk up, take a bus or cable car - queue for the cable car usually quite long, be prepared to wait for an hour or so.. sometimes even longer."
Weather rules the day,As with all my reviews to sights in Seoul I will preface this by advising visitors to carefully check opening days and times and whether timed entry tickets are needed to access certain parts of the attraction and also the times for booking guided tours in their language of preference – bearing in mind that numbers can be limitedI was in Seoul for nearly 3 weeks and had only 2 days when skies could be declared relatively clear. A combination of poor weather and pollution means visibility can be poor and that would not be good for a visit to the Tower. Luckily the day I chose views were quite goodIt is possible to walk all the way from Seoul to the base of the Tower. But it's a long steep uphill trek and most people go by bus or take the cable car. Even to/from the cable car station there is a challenging flight of stairsThe attraction is popular and busy. Entrance tickets are timed to avoid overcrowding and it is possible to reserve tables at the various restaurants at the summit where expensive set price menus are offered.The observation decks are well thought out with each window containing a description of the direction you are looking. Gentlemen must check out the lavatories on the observation level - the views are great!!Visitor amenities are excellent. Outside there are pleasant grounds and further vantage points to observe the panoramic views of the city and beyond
great view from the top,worth to come here. you can go around late evening or at night. you can either walk till the top or use the cable car. you can enjoy the view of the Seoul.
Excellent View of the City!,"Not to be missed. You get a good view of Seoul and there are quaint attractions at the top too! Noteworthy are the relatively reasonably priced souvenir items that would have cost triple in cities like Singapore or Hong Kong, and the quality of the trinkets are actually good. "
You've got to see the restrooms!,"We went to the tower at 11 am and there were no lines, not even for the cable cars. The view from the tower was outstanding, and to me, well worth the cost. If you go, check out the restrooms on the fourth floor. One wall is a window, and the other wall is a mirror. We also enjoyed the burgers served at the outdoor restaurant."
amazing part,walking up takes around 15 minutes. on top you have an amazing view. Taking the cable car on the other side down to seoul city. 
Great way to end the day,I would recommend going to this place around late afternoon so you can see the sunset and enjoy the night lights Of the city. There are restaurants around the area as well. Beautiful place and it was certainly worth the trip going up the top of the tower
tower of power,"never miss this place if you are in seoul. although there's a long walk uphill to reach the tower, it's worth the climb. stay as long as you like to maximize every spot that is picture-worthy."
unobstructed 360 degree view of the city ,"Having visited other towers such as the Stratosphere in Vegas and the Space Needle in Seattle, I went to the Seoul Tower with low expectations.  Glad to say the trip was worth it! You must purchase two tickets. One for the cable ride up to the tower and then the ticket to go atop the tower itself.  The Seoul Tower provides a completely unobstructed view of the city. Unlike other towers, this is a glass partition from floor to ceiling so there are no metal rails to block any part of the view.  All I can say is that the city is smaller than o had thought and prettier than anticipated.  I highly recommend it "
Definitely worth it,Getting to the place wasn't as simple as taking a bus directly there. it is a cable car right up and if you are afraid of heights- this is definitely a ride of your life. the view was amazing during the time i visit. you get a glimpse of what you will be experiencing as you ascend when you reach the top! give yourself at least half-day and preferably catch the sunset while you are up there. don't forget to bring locks for couples and of course there are lots of photo opportunities with the teddies at the teddy bear museum.
Exciting city - exciting view,Fantastic view on the megapolis at night. Authentic korean cuisine (Hancook restaurant). Beautiful park around.
Best view of Seoul,"This is a ""must"" stop in Seoul. Get a cab to Seoul Tower (tell the driver Seoul Towa), DO NOT try to climb that hill, it is a lot further than what it looks like. You'll need to pay for a ferry ride RT to the base (8500w), then around 6000w for the tower."
Good place to visit.,"As we realize that most big cities have their own tower, this applies with Seoul as well. Namsan Seoul Tower is located at Namsan Hills where we can see part of Seoul city for the above. If you happen to have more time in Seoul, please have a chance to visit here. Nothing much to see unless the view of the city, if you are lucky you can have crystal view from the top of the tower but probably you can have haze sometime."
No better view of Seoul.,"I recommend this stop to anyone visiting Seoul!This is the best vantage point to take in the enormity of Seoul which is one of the largest cities in the world (Greater Seoul Metropolitan Area consists of around 25 million people). There are multiple places to eat in the tower that cater to various budgets. There are always festivities going on in and around the tower throughout the year. There are also multiple ways to get to the tower including walking trails, public bus transportation, and a sky-tram. Tip - Plan accordingly on special dates. We tried to go to the French restaurant located in tower on Valentines Day and that turned out to be a nightmare. Seemed like half of Seoul had the same idea."
"Best view from toilet, ever","Well, it takes quite a while of queuing until we could finally enjoy the view. It is a nice view, especially from the toilet on the way down.. Don't miss it. "
N Seoul Tower,"It is my first time went to Korea. I am longing for the country is Korea. I heard something from the person have been to Korea. She said N Seoul Tower is a symbol in Seoul. If I go to Korea must visit the Seoul Tower. I waited for the bus in a long time. If you do not know which station you should get on or get off, just follow the crowd. A lot of people go to the Seoul Tower by bus. When we arrived at Seoul Tower almost 6:30 p.m. Therefore, we can enjoyed the sunset on the bus. There are a lot of couples and thousands of love locks on fences. It is really a wonderful view. Many people take pictures to keep the beautiful moments. The view of Seoul from the top of Tower is stunning. It offers a great view of the Seoul city scapes."
Great views; bit pricey,"The views from the tower are outstanding, but it's a bit pricey. It costs about $8 to ride from the ground to the base of the tower, but another $10 to ride from the base of the tower to the observation deck. There are restaurants both at the base and on the observation deck, and the deck has a coffee shop and souvenir shop to purchase items to remember your stop. Otherwise, it was a great visit and easily reachable by the subway, though it is a bit of a hike up hills (on sidewalks) "
Seoul Tower ,"This place was very busy! I suggest taking the hop on hop off bus up there which is what we did as we spent the day using it to see things. The bus drops you off and it is a steep hill to the top. There you can see beautiful views of the city. There is a love lock area which is nice fo couples and some cafes and eating places. We did not go up the actual tower, it was about 10 AUD. We decided not to as there was a beautiful view without having to go up and it looked very busy - our experiences with these towers is that it is so busy up the top you can't really sit down to take in the view, however you can decide for yourself."
Do NOT visit during China Holidays,"I came by when it was a China long holiday period. This visit became a total Nightmare!! Queue 30 minutes to get onto the bus to get to the tower. Missed the first bus as it was packed full. After which, obtaining my ticket at 8pm, i had to wait another 44 minutes just to go up the tower. the time written on my ticket was the time set for me to get up to the tower.So I just sat around waiting.After given entry, had to wait and qued another 20 minutes to get into the lift.Finally got to the top only to find the observation deck packed with people. Its hard to take selfies due to the reflections from lights on the observation deck.The whole mood was ruined. Me and my wife just wanted to leave after less than 5 minutes of reaching the deck.Getting back down from the tower again was another nightmare. Queued for another 30minutes just to get on the elevator. Any activities was stopped due to the packed crowd.After which, queued another 30minutes just to get on the bus back to the city. Despite all of that, I still saw droves of tour busses full of China tourists pouring in as we left. If u ever plan to visit South Korea, please make sure it does not coincide with a China holiday. Total time spent on observation deck: 5 minutes (not including waiting for lift to get back down)Time spent waiting: 3+ hours. Summary: DO NOT VISIT WHEN ITS A CHINA HOLIDAY. "
Nice place,Nice place to visit.you get to see Seoul from the top. I recommend visiting. However when we came down that the taxi drivers asked for higher fare than normal which was unusual in Seoul
Wonderful view!,"While in Seoul, one of my Korean friend invited me to visit N Seoul Tower. It's located in Namsan and you will see spectacular views from the top. I also enjoyed the cable car ride. I really love the ambiance and the whole experience. You can have a photo taken after the tour as part of your souvenir at an additional cost. "
Cool Place To Visit,"I went to the Tower and did not expect there to be so much at the top! There were great picture opportunities, many restaurants, and nice places to sit and take in the view. I made the mistake of not doing my research and going on a Korean national holiday, so it was really crowded. I waited an hour and a half to get to the top, and when I got there the NBurger restaurant had run out of burgers. So, if you can, make sure to go on a weekday when there isn't a holiday. It was well worth the trip up. "
Mr,The tower is not very high. For myself i feel its not very impressive. There were some features but generally i didnt feel it was worth the time and money. Maybe for the youger generation its awesome and fun. 
Top of Seoul,"You can see breathtaking city views from Seoul Tower. We purchased tickets for the tower, but realized we saw everything from the top of the hill that we saw from the tower. We bought a love lock to leave behind, there were many options of food to choose from, and the cable car made the trip up and back very quick and convenient."
worth visit,"View from the top is fantastic, especially in the evening when lights are illuminated. Go couple of hours before dark to appreciate the lights of seoul. "
Nice skyline view of the city,Seoul Tower offers good 360 degree view of the city.It is a charming place. The outlets there sells good souvenirs.
Good at both night and day,"If you want to have clear view of Seoul from above, you should come in the daytime. But night-time will show you the city light. The price quite high, now is w8500 for the cable cab and w10000 for the tower ticketMake sure to visit the love-locker outside :)"
Really busy and was cloudy,Pick a non cloudy day otherwise there is not a great view. We also went on a holiday and it was 1.5 hours to get up to the top.
Stumbled upon a traditional fighting demonstration,"We have been up to the N Seoul tower several times, and it is always an amazing time. This time there was a really cool traditional dance, and fighting/battle demo going on. What a treat that was!! Make sure to have a couple ""locks of love"" to put on the wall. "
Beautiful scenery of Seoul,The N Seoul tower gives you the city view of Seoul. I saw the famous love locks which i only saw on google. It has restaurants and souvenir shops. The night view was awesome since the tower was lighted.
Long Wait,"If you're planning to watch the sunset, go early. You'll have to queue for the lift up to the cable car, queue to buy the cable car tickets, queue for the cable car...and then climb up to the Tower. It took us at least 1.5 hours just to reach the viewing decks!It's possible to bypass the cable car and drive/walk all the way up, but I'm not sure how long that will take."
Really hard to get there,"It's really hard, the tower is located in a hill, w tried with many buses but it was almost impossible. The best option is a taxi or the specific buses that go there. Even though, the tower is nice"
Beautiful scenary,It's a must go for all couples! it's so romantic up there with a spectacular view of Seoul. remember to get the locks too!
"Fabulous vieuw, and so many love locks.","Nice trip up to the tower. Here you can see Seoul, the inner circles, but also the outskirts with hundreds of white sky scrapers in a circle around the city where probably millions of families live. And notmto forget the love locks, probably more than one the bridges in Paris."
Colourful Tower,"We took a taxi to the Tram Station and after the tram ride to the top, climbed up the steps to the tower entrance. We had an enjoyable time at the Tower. The views were amazing and we enjoyed taking pictures and spotting features of Seoul. Although we couldn't spend a lot of time at the top of the tower, we felt that it was worth our time and money. Throughout the rest of our time in Seoul, seeing the tower above us was a lovely reminder of our visit."
Way too crowded,"Went N Seoul tower in September during the South Korean thanksgiving holidays. Place was way too crowded with tourists. Didn't even go up the tower due to the long queues. If you plan to go, do avoid public holidays such as this. Qq"
Great views of a stunning city,"We walked up as the cable car was not running because of the earlier lightening.Although it was a long way up there were plenty of rest stops and the scenery on the way up kept you going.Lovely view sober the city,amazing views from the toilets!!Was nice to go up again for night photos but cable cars very busy on way down."
A must see if you are visiting Seoul.,"This is one of the must see's when visiting Seoul. The park, Namsan, that the Tower is located in is a real breath of fresh air in the otherwise quite polluted Seoul. There are many walk paths and things to see in the park so make a day trip out of this attraction."
Its a tower...,This tower gives a great view of seoul but its not much more than that. Take the cable car up to the tower. the plaza surrounding the tower is probably more interesting since they sometimes have shows going on there
More suited for couples / groups,"Came here as a solo backpacker at night time. Stunning views of Seoul, even better from the top of the tower. It was extremely busy on a weekend night so I spent most of my night waiting in lines. The whole area is geared towards couples e.g. love lock walls, photo ops with love hearts, seats on an angle that make you lean into each other so I guess would make a good date spot.Would suggest not bothering with the ticket packages that include drinks and popcorn, by the time you are done with lines you will be nearly finished it. Would give it a 5/5 if i had a significant other with me lol."
Good place to exercise.,"I was alone in Seoul, so I didn't feel romantic being up there. What I found awesome about this place was that I could walk from the bottom to the top, using the forest trail (not the main road). The air was so fresh and I felt so relieved walking up to the top. It took me about an hour or so. "
Supertower,"If you go to Seoul you must go to the Seoul tower: you see all the city, you can do a lot of things inside and you can take a very beautiful ropeway"
Long but beautiful walk to the top,"We ""accidentally"" walk d to the top whilst looking for the gondola station, oh well it was a nice walk and was quite a clear day when we got to the top so we could see for ages - great view of all Seoul. We bought a combo ticket and got free popcorn and drinks - bargain!"
Great view... ,I visited around 6pm and it was great to see the view on top.. I took a bus no 05 from myeongdong.. Around the tower many spot to take a picture.. The weather was perfect.. And also you can take a selfie on the restroom because you can alsoSee the view.. 
Panoramic view of the city,Definitely take the cable car as its more dramatic to get up and go ride the fast elevators to the top. Great view of Seoul 360 of Seoul and the surrounding communities.
"Excellent, but lines are long","This is an excellent experience, but the lines are long lines were too much for me to cope. Seems to be that an excellent experience attracts too many people, so I cannot blame them."
Great view!,My husband and I visited the N Seoul tower on a weekday at around 7pm. We waited about half an hour for the cable car. We were packed in like sardines. Don't expect much from this ride except transportation only. We bought the round ticket. I would recommend only getting a one way ticket. It's quite an easy walk down. It takes about 15-30 mins. There are lots of photo points along the way which the cable car does not offer. Also the wait for the way down was at least 30 mins. It was chaos. We did go up the tower in the elevator. I have to say this part was a waste of money. The views from the first level were amazing. Going up the tower doesn't enhance the view that much. Also it was mayhem in the observation deck. You barely could make it to a window spot and the glass was covered in handprints and smudges. Don't be fooled. The wait for the elevator up was only 15 mins. Coming down was over an hour! Overall tho I would recommend at least going up the cable car. But that's as far as I would go. 
Seoul Tower,"I went there with a best friend and we arrived at 10 AM, the weather was perfect during September, not much people in that time, so you can enjoy the 360 degree site seeing from the top. Also the restaurant on the top provides a very delicious food with many types of (Kimchi). I totally recommended for visitors to go and enjoy the magical view, especially from the cable car on the way to the tower."
It's cool,"You'll have to be patient during the long line to use the cable car, but once you get to the Namsan tower, the view will be worth it.If you want to access the revolving restaurant at the top of the tower, you'll have to make sure to make a reservation weeks before you head there."
Go there late in the afternoon!,"Super nice to have the look over Seoul. We chose to go there late in the afternoon and have dinner there later, cause like that we could both see the view in the daylight and at nighttime. It's free to go to the top of the hill, but it costs 10,000 won to go all the way up to the tower (I didn't do that though, since I thought the view was good enough - my friend on the other hand did it, and he thought it was absolutely worth it). We took one of the many buses to downtown and it was super easy and cheap.Besides from that I can highly recommend to have dinner at the N Burger place - it was cheap and sooo delicious!"
Seoul: 360 Degree View of Seoul,"The best time to visit N Seoul Tower would be around 5pm; this way you would be able to see Seoul in 3 perspectives: day, sunset/dusk, night. Typically, the Namsan Cable Car is recommended as a means to go to the tower; however, personally, I'd rather save money and take a tourist bus. This is because they cram too many passengers in a cable car that there's not enough room to actually appreciate the sights. Though the bus takes longer, it does give you a scenic tour around the city.There are other attractions aside from the observatory deck so while waiting for sunset or evening to arrive; you can use the time to explore the other facilities. A feature that really won me over would be the country viewpoints that it had; wherein a window is labeled with names of countries and their respective distances from the tower. My friends and I were just crowding over the Manila window the entire time."
Best place to enjoy Seoul's view,"Seems to be the proudest tourist attraction, do not forget to use the cable cars to reach the tower otherwise you could maybe not arrive ;-)"
mixed feelings about it,"let me start by saying no matter what, this is a must when you visit Seoul. when we first get there, the line for the cable car was so long, it extended well out into the sidewalk. we opted for the hike instead. it's not easy. once you get there, there's another long line to get your tickets to go up. once you get your ticket, the wait is about 2 hours for your group to be called. (pay attention to group numbers because the lady told me it would be a 2hr 45min wait). after they call your group, it's another long line for the elevator to get up there. once you get up there, there's a ton of people crowding the glass areas, even eating in front of it. it's also very noisy. souvenir shops also take up most of the floor space so ppl don't really have much elbow room. once you're done with taking pictures, yup, there's another long line to get back down. at this point, you can tell everyone is cranky and tired. it's not all bad tho. views were pretty good and there there are plenty of things to do while you wait for your group to be called. make sure to wear comfortable sneakers because this will be a rough one..."
Great Views,"Recommend taking the cable car to the top. The walk isn't worth it...I mean it. great views, kind of expensive but the restaurant at the top was very delicious. "
Why I prefer the Building 63,"I visited Seoul Tower ten days ago, it was the last attraction in Seoul I did not visit.But It was a little disappointing.If you want to see Seoul, to experience it, to comprehend its greatness and beauty, it is better to visit Building 63, places of Han riverside. You will see the turns of river, parts of this huge and beautiful town, you will really comprehend it easier than visiting Seoul tower"
Nice view,It's not easy to get there if you have problems walking but the view is a reward you you do. Awesome view :)
They need to improve their service and cable car too,"There were very long line when we get there but it's ok since it was early evening and people might want to see night veiw of Seoul but I could not believe the cable car. It sounded abnormal and made me and my family scared since it was trembling a lot when it arrived at the top. I thought it was very old cable car so it must be replaced with new one. If you are afraid of height,dont try it. The N seoul tower itself was good to look around entire Seoul night veiw."
Mixed feelings,"The feeling being up there is great as the air is clean and refreshing. The views are beautiful too. On the downside, I feel that it is overcrowded and very noisy with many tour groups and visitors. There was an event there on my day of visit which further worsen the situation. The charm of the place somehow is discounted due to this reason. Not sure for couples looking for a quiet and romantic time. Maybe along the way up as it is less travelled. Perhaps the management have to think of a way to control the influx for sustainability. Please keep it well as it is a great attraction!"
Amazing Views,A trip to Seoul is not complete without a visit to the N. Seoul Tower. The day we went it was very hot so we took the Nasam Orumi to the Namsan Cable to get to the tower. The price was so reasonable especially compared to other towers in major cities. The elevator ride to the top of the tower was made interesting with a video on the ceiling. The views from the tower are incredible. I highly recommend it if you are interested in great city views.
Great view of Seoul city especially at night but try to avoid weekend ..,"Me and my friend, walked all the way from myeongdong with all the shopping stuffs in our hand to see the night view of Seoul city at N Seoul tower as it was near.The cable car wait was more then 70 minutes so decided to climb up the stairs. It took us around 40 minutes to reach to the tower Base. Being weekend, it was really crowded even on the way up.I can't exactly remember but I think it was 10,000 won per person for the observatory deck view. In addition, we had to wait for 90 minutes to go up the observatory deck. Meanwhile, hanging around the love lock area was awesome but recommend with a loved one.At the end, it was worth it. The night was clear and whole Seoul city looked amazing.Took only 15 minutes to climb down the hill. N Seoul tower worth to be visited in the evening time with your loved one with already purchase lock at weekdays ( no heavy shopping bags as well ). At last but not the least, worth using the restrooms in the observatory deck of N Seoul tower. It is unexpectedly surprising."
This is really good for night veiw!,"Recommend to visit at night, you can find the real beauty of Seoul on the top! FYI you can find restaurants on the tower, which is really good to try! Oh it's closed around 10pm as far as I expenrienced!"
Why not?,Seoul is described as the coolest city of Asia and it is!! it is a perfect mix of old and new and the tower is a perfect example of the new present in the city. It is really high and I higly reccomend to visit the tower during the sunset it is really amazing to see the city from another point of view and maybe only from that view you realize how big and wonderful Seoul is.
A good view of Seoul when the weather is clear ,Good place when the weather is fine but you don't actually need to enter the tower. The views are similarly good from the top of the hill. However the highlight was the view from the men's urinals. Best toilet break ever. Food is pricy also so stay away. You can be a tourist and get a padlock with your love to keep there for ever. 
"Amazing views at night, must visit!","The hike up to the cable car itself was quite a journey so wear comfortable shoes if you come. We went on a weekend so we spent an hour queuing for the cable car so my advise is to come on a weekday when it is less crowded. It is definitely worth coming during sunset/ nighttime to witness the glorious views of Seoul. Also a famous place for couples. There are couples everywhere so if you're alone and is bothered by pda, this is not be a place for you. Then again, couples are everywhere in Seoul."
Great experience,Easy to reach and worth to visit! I visited by bus from Myeondong area and choose to walk to reach the peak of Namsan.I visited N-tower at night and it still wonderful to enjoy the scenery of the town.
Not really spectacular except for the nice trekking if you reach the top by foot,"First of all: don't go to the N tower if it is cloudy or the pollution dominates Seoul. During my stay I was very unlucky as I did not see the sun during 5 days, the air was something between very misty and polluted. Indeed the view from the N tower was quite disappointing. On the other way it was nice climbing up to the N Tower basement starting the walk from Namsangol Park."
"Touristy, but worthwhile",We hiked through the woods in surrounding park up to the tower entrance. I would call it an easy to moderate hike. The tower itself was crowded but the city views were outstanding.
Must do when in Seoul!,"The best views of the city of Seoul by far! I would recommend going late afternoon so you can see the view of the city in day time, then see just how far the city is spread out on the landscape at night - further than you can see during the day! We did the touristy thing and put a lock on the fence with our wedding date (you can see that there are so many they must cut them off regularly!), explored the grounds and then headed up to the top of the tower. We also had dinner at the restaurant up the top and it was very enjoyable. Would highly recommend spending part of an afternoon & evening at the North Seoul Tower."
For Lovers,"If you will not go to the observatory and you are single, this place is not for you. Riding their cable car is overpriced. The place is good, overlooking, cold. :)Bring your own lock if you want to ""lock your love"". You might hesitate to bought their designed lock after seeing its tag. haha! But overall. you will enjoy the place because of nature, lots of locks and the tower. :)"
dont miss it,"don't miss this place if you want to visit Seoul , you can see the city from the top tower ,it worth to visit this place ,before going up to the tower you have to come by the cable car to the NAMSAN PARK ,you will see a huge collection of the love locks .I highly recommend to visit this place"
Very touristy,"This is one of the most touristy places we've been to in Seoul. It provides a good view of the city. The love locks and the benches (designed the way they are to ""force"" shy couples to sit together) are also cute!The price to get to the viewing deck is 10,000won per person and 21,000 for two with popcorn and drinks. The place is ease to reach by bus or by cable car. We also saw some people hike so I think that's also an option and a fun way to get to the top. :)"
Nice view but over-priced,"So you basically go up the tower, walk around a bit to see the view, but after that you don't really have a lot to do. The gift shop is super expensive. They do have a cafe right there, so having breakfast near the view is highly recommended. "
Nice area,"My husband and I went here on our own one afternoon. We took the cable cars over, but we think because it was a holiday (Thanksgiving day), it was very crowded and we waited about 90 minutes to get on. Once we got to the tower, it was a nice area with a lot going on. The views were amazing from the top, but it wasn't the best night for views being a bit cloudy and it was getting dark at this point. We ended up having dinner at the Korean buffet restaurant in the tower, which is below the observatory floor. We wanted to have dinner above the observatory floor, but you need reservations for that Italian restaurant which we did not have. Being in Seoul, we wanted Korean food so it worked out. It cost us 50,000 won each for dinner, which included getting us up in the tower as well. Our dinner ticket also got us to the front of the line. We ended up walking down even though we had bought tickets for the cable car because the line was so long and we just couldn't wait in another line. It wasn't so bad walking down but our feet were already hurting. The views on the way down were very nice, however, and we ended up just walking to our hotel, the Lotte Hotel Seoul. It was a nice experience but unfortunately we didn't learn anything about the history of the N Seoul Tower."
GREAT VIEW,"Take the trolley. You may have to wait but, the walk is brutal. Very nice view you won't get anywhere else. We didn't go up in the tower itself (extra) but, I don't think we missed much."
Marvelous view of seoul,Really worth it to go up and enjoy the nature of rocky mountain by cable car to reach to the tower to enjoy the city seeing
Post Office at the top!,"Like most ""tallest towers"" in the world this was a very busy place, even on weeknight. There is an impressive collection of love locks and a post office at the top of the tower, that sells postcards, with stamps, so you can write home to mum!"
Its ok,"We got to the bottom of the tower and they told us to go back down on the street and wait for the bus, waited for 30 mins and its packed have to squeeze in Got on top beautiful place, you can see the whole city of seoul (night time is better) Overall its just ok nothing really much to do. "
Dinner at the Tower at Sunset,"We went to the Tower to celebrate our son's 15 the birthday. We had dinner at Hancook restaurant. The food was good, and the view looking toward the Han River and the city were fantastic. We would certainly do this again. "
Beautiful place to see the panoramic view of Seoul,"I went to this place with one of my colleague and we spent very good time there.We went to this tower by the Namsan Cable car (ropeway). Alternately, if you love trekking you can climb up the stairs and go to the tower also. There was fees to take the cable car ride but it was an awesome experience. I visited this place in July. Many recommended us that it is not the proper time to visit as we would not be able to see the panoramic view due to fog. But we were lucky that for few seconds the fog went away and we could take the glimpse of the beautiful view of the entire Seoul. We were very happy when the fog got cleared. When we get down from the cable car there were colourful locks everywhere which was called as ""lock of love"" . I think those people whose wishes were fullfilled had tied them. But it was a very colourful view, everywhere colourful locks. we we went the top most point of the tower, there was a post office, which was the highest post office of Seoul and there in a shop postcards were being sold. Young girls were posting love letters from the highest post office to their love. It was a very fun filled visit. I liked the place and would recommend every visitor of Seoul should visit this place but you should check the weather first."
Popular with couples,I believe this must see place has been made more popular by Korean version of Hana Yori Dango (Boys Over Flower). There are a lot of local couples here to attach love locks at the designated area. 
"It was something we wanted to experience from our Kdramas,","It was okay, the staff were courteous. The many stairs were tiring but worth the experience. There were lots of choices for food after we got off the trolley. Which made us wish we hadn't eaten at the Korean restaurant at the base of the mountain. The adjummas there were surly and looked as if they were having a rough time!"
"Amazing views, very interesting","Take the cable car up to the base of the N Seoul Tower. You'll find a number of shops and cafés, great views and literally thousands of padlocks! Most importantly you'll find the ticket office to buy a ticket to go up in the elevator in the Tower level 5 (observation deck) where the 360 views over Seoul are very impressive. On the observation deck you can send a postcard and buy sweets and gifts. Level 7 of the tower hosts an up-market French restaurant which I did not visit myself. Take the elevator back down and treat yourself to an ice cream, a coffee or a bite to eat. It's a great way to spend an hour or two."
Cold and romantic.. ,"Highest place (I think) in Seoul. The air is cold, even on summer months. Romantic place to be since you can lock your heart with someone you love on their love lock. "
Nice view,You can see north part and south part of South Korea from this tower. They have some performance when we was there.Kids enjoyed so much!The love lock are arranged nicely. 
Nice view,Nice view. Located on a hill with woody area around. Does not have a sense of history or feel monumental. Felt industrial and built to a purpose. Could be perceived as boring unless you're into selfies.
Breathtaking Hike and view,"We waited in the massive queue for the cable car, ten mins. Then decided to walk up the hill instead rather than wait any longer. The queue was down the street outside the building. Anyway the walk was great, hard work but you felt great at the top 20mins later after the lactic acid subsided. Lift to observation deck was cool. Kinda disappointing, as way to busy to enjoy at night although nice n cool. The padlock thing, is mental here. More than I've seen in Sydney or Amsterdam put together."
Seoul Tour ,"Excellent place to visit with family. The bridge is full of love locks where visitors locking them all over the bridge. Also, they do some traditional show close to tower "
Beautiful view on Seoul,We loved to watch the entire city of Seoul from above! The sight by night was amazing and brings a good sense of the size of the city! Huge!!Must do! 
Great Hike,We hiked from the bottom of the mountain to the tower. Very scenic and good exercise. Some shops and restaurants up top. It cost about $15 to go to the top of the tower so we skipped that. Very nice time!
Nice visit ,Go here at night because the light from the city is splendid. The only thing bringing my rate down from a 5 is that the fact that there is to much background light in the tower which is ruining the photos if you don't press your camera against the window. It would have been nice with an open air platform without a window. 
"Loved it, but too busy","I wne tot he Tower on a Sunday, and it was very busy - Did not go in and to the Top, the view from the top of the cable car was really beautiful and I did not feel the need to go all the way!"
Great views,"Here you can enjoy a great landscape of Seoul were the city starts to crawl the mountains around the centre.Went during the day and the view was amazing, there is also places to eat in here.You can walk all the way from the train station or take the cable car."
An impressive and great bird eye's view on Seoul!,"Well, we have visited many Sky Towers in different cities in our walk around the world and every time when we come across a new one, we would not hesitate to visit it because the view on the city will be different and will gain unique and wonderful experience.So in our recent Seoul trip, we decided to visit the N Seoul Tower. It was about past 4.00pm when we arrived and the place was still crowded with visitors mostly foreigners. The viewing point on the ground floor was already awesome and it was built on top on the hill. Along the way, we saw trees with ""LOVE LOCKS"" besides the the mental railings that also have such locks too! It was so colourful and impressive! Unlike the love lock bridges in European cities, mostly located above a river where one would throw the keys into the river after locking it, right here, there is no river but one can throw the keys down the hill! Haha. (you can actually buy a lock in the souvenir shop)Upon entering the tower via the main entrance, we immediately saw a souvenir and gift shop with a lovely Hello Kitty display at its entrance and no one could withstand the temptation for not taking a photo with it.Our fullday city tour guide had gone to the ticketing booth to get us the ticket to the top while we were busy taking photos with the Hello Kitty!Then we took the elevator to the top (according to our guide, the tower was about 250m tall, about 80 storeys if I didn't remember wrongly). While most elevators in other Towers are standard and quite ""boring"" while moving upwards, the ceiling of the elevator here has astonishing moving animations (that depicted moving into the space galaxy) and it was indeed impressive. So everyone in the elevator were kept occupied and so focused on it and forgot the ""time spent"" in getting up there. (anyway, it was quite fast too, think less than a minute)When we arrived at the top, wow! The view here was spectacular! We walked around 360 degree and really have had a great bird eye's view on Seoul, could see the Gangnam area (South of the Han River), Myeongdong etc. As the sky was still bright, the view was cleared! We really enjoyed the view so much!There is also a souvenir and gift store right well where you could grab some candies, t-shirts, postcards etc here. Though the place is touristy but they had some promotions and so the items we grabbed here were still reasonable in price.After our visit here, we took the elevator down to the 1st storey where we had to walk through a ""tunnel"" with LED TVs on both sides featuring Seoul in different times and development phases via computer graphics and animations (on the other side, they also have TV screens that show the history of the country as one walks around). It was very interesting and fascinating and no doubt why Korea is so advance in IT and technology!Well, if you like heights and good city view from the top of the world, this place will be relevant and good for you. As mentioned earlier, each sky tower is different and offer different and unique views on the city and so it's unfair to compare with one to another. Visit with an open mind and with the feeling to see and experience new and different things, your visit here will be fun, interesting and wonderful!"
Touristy must ,A touristy must in Seoul. Go up during sundown and catch the city in lights. The love locks area under the tower is highly popular and perhaps a must do if you are visiting with your love. Evenings are a little crowded but the best time to visit. 
N Seoul Tower - Best View Ever!,My family and I went to visit this iconic place and can say that I truly enjoy the view that the tower has! You can see all of the city from the top and the sunset is amazing. I really recommend visiting this place. 
N Seoul Tower on a budget,"i went to the N Seoul Tower via bus 02 from Myeongdong Cathedral. It's cheaper than taking the cable car that tends to be overcrowded. taking a bus takes you from the bottom of the Namsan Mountain and a little winding road going to the tower. few notable places are in the Namsan Mountain such as a school and a library i think (not sure). from the bus stop you need to hike, but hiking gives you a nice vantage point for picture taking (wink wink). "
Great views,"I don't do heights so I didn't go up the tower, but walked around the base - and that is a cable car ride up the hill and lots of stairs!There's a burger restaurant, churros and ice cream also on offer at the base. And a small gift shop. There are also many artistic displays featuring padlocks. Very colorful!There were about 50 of us in our group, the rest all went up the tower and loved it!"
So so. Tourist spot. Good for lovers,Share you lover locks view isn't as spectacular. Mostly another tourist spot. Busan tower was better.
Breathtaking views of the city and a fun place to spend time,"Some friends and I had a blast last weekend hiking around Namsan park to get to the N Seoul Tower. The tower is spectacular from every angle and there are lots of cool views of the tower from Namsan park. Once we reached the tower, we enjoyed some live music by the temple and had dinner & ice cream at the shops near the base of the tower. There are lots of fun and affordable souvenirs available at the gift shop there, too. We would recommend arriving at the tour around 5pm to be able to see the view of the city transition from day to night. It was really exciting to see the lights of the city come on as daylight fell. We were also lucky enough to witness a beautiful, pink late summer sunset from the top of the tower! This is an amazing place and a must-see for anyone visiting Seoul."
Bird's eye view of Seoul,"We visited early in the morning at around 10am and there were already a lot of tourists there. We went up and it seems like most of the tourists were still below taking photo as it was quite empty above. We have the entire observatory deck to ourselves. However, we could not really see far as it was quite foggy.Couples can pen down their love messages and put up both love locks and love tiles at the love lock section and the love tiles section in the tower.A must visit for couples."
Get a full view of this massive city,You can not get a full appreciation of the size of Seoul and its many districts until you go up the tower. The views are not always clear because of the haze but stil worth the visit. We went up during the day however some recommend a night visit to see the city lights.If you visit during the day you may consider walking up the hill instead of taking the cable car. It is a peaceful walk and mostly shaded but you will need a moderate level of fitness. I suggest an 8:30am start and the 1.5 hour hike will get you to the tower at opening time at 10am. Good to escape the bussle of the city or to fill in a few hours before the shops open.
Good view but squeezy cable car ride,The staff kept pushing the passengers into the cable car till we couldn't move our hands to take pictures. It was as if we were plainly taking the cable car to the tower but I didn't think that was the case for most of passengers. We were not able to move to other side of cable car as we were packed like sardines. The view was nice but certainly not the ride. 
It's fun to visit but eat before you go,It's interesting and fun to visit the Seoul Tower. Take a bus to get there. Once you get to the tower you'll find some gift shops and restaurants. The gift shops are good but the restaurants are overpriced. 
My tour,The tour is good to visit. It will give you a nice view of Seoul from all direction. The visit to the tower worth it. However getting there wasn't convenenet as no train station near and the bus drop you a little far from the tower. 
Great Views,"The views from the tower are amazing. I came here at sunset, so got to see sunset over the city and then stayed around for it to get dark to see the city lights. I recommend doing this as the views are breathtaking."
Great viewing from here,We seem to visit a city tower wherever we visit & this one didn't disappoint. Catching the cable car up is the easy way and it's a short uphill walk from Myeongdong MRT. The view over the city areas to the mountains was very good. You can take a walk back down or do part of the city wall from here. The garden area around Namsan park is attractive. There's plenty of benches to sit on & refreshments available. We went during the day but it's open in the evenings.
Nice view over Seoul!,I actually enjoyed the view from the deck below the tower better than inside the tower. Especially for taking pictures. In the tower you have a lot of windows (not all that clean) so you can't really make a good picture. So if you take the cable cart you have access to some good views! not to crowded when we where there. So you can get there for free (if you walk and not take the cable cart) and still have a good view over Seoul.It will take you about 30 min to get up there. And if you spend about 1 hour up there (not going into the tower) you will be done.
Good place,You can see this from the city since it very tallGreat view from there to over look the city with all the high building and also the old part of the city. We had a good walk from hotel to this tower. Good
Go at night,"N Seoul Tower is a photo opportunity only. No history, no culture, but some nice photos at night. It's worth going to once but I can't imagine a reason to go more than once."
Beatiful View,My first time to visit Seoul and N Tower was my buckelist. Must do in Seoul and we will never regret. We visited both day and night and both views were just perfect.
Symbol of Seoul,We prefer night visit as the tower looks amazing with its colourful lightings. There isn't much to see inside the tower except admiring the city of Seoul in 360 deg. Of course you can leave without noticing the Love locks everywhere.
Beautiful Seoul Night View,"I walked from Myeongdong street to Namsan Oreumi (around 10 - 15 mins) and took the elevator up to cable car station. The cable car priced 6000 won for one way up. After riding the cable car, you will still need to climb stairs before arriving at the tower. The tower will light up at night so the view will be more outstanding. You can go up to the observatory for a payment of 10000 won per adult and from the observatory you can view the Seoul city. To go back to Myeongdong station, I took No. 5 bus from the bus stop which required me walk down the hill."
Unbelievable view ,"My last visit to Seoul was nearly 26 yrs ago. Back then we had to climb stairs to the Lobby area of the tower. Now there is a lift that takes you from the base of the hill to the lobby area. We caught the cable car up to the tower and the view was breathtaking. Too bad it was a smoggy day but we could still see the city. There were little shops and a restaurant at the base of the tower.On the first level there was a locks of love fence. It was as impressive as the one in Italy! Locks of all colors and shapes with names, dates and messages lined the fences. On certain days there are cultural performances on the second level (weather permitting). "
Awesome family fun in the centre of Seoul!,"Our family really enjoyed our visit to the Seoul Tower. on the day of our visit, there was a reenactment of middle ages sword and pole fighting. Once up in the tower we were amazed by wonderful views of Seoul. There was also a candy and souvenir shop and a small museum in the tower, together with fast food options. Truly a wonderful experience, though crowded."
All Seoul under your eye!!,"Amazing, even the way to the tower is very nice full greenish & going gradually to high, you can spend the whole day there.موقع جميل جدا جدا ملي بالخضرة وحتي الطريق للبرج مدرج واخضر ويمكنك قضاء جميع يومك هناكGo up with very advance left, just they will ask you to look top of the left for the panorama & you will find yourself on the top."
Great views of Seoul,"Going up any tower like this will provide the best views of the city. You can walk up but is a hard climb. Alternatively you can get the cable car up. The prices are moderate, but you can't miss this. There are tours which also take you up, this cost much more."
Weekday visit before noon not crowded. ,"My first i walked up from the market, today i took the tram with 8-yr old son. That saved the trip, he enjoyed it immensely. When he's older i hope to walk up. Visit the park just north-west cornet of the tower within the psrk limits..Great little restauarant you follow the pathway by the 1392 wall down to the corner, cross the walkway, its right there. Across from the street from the hotel. "
Great view,"If you want to see the 360 degree view of seoul, this is the place you have to visit. I won't mind visit a second time."
Place with Excellent View,"The Tower is at the center of Seoul and provides an excellent view of the city skyscrapers.The platform as well as the tower area provides excellent opportunity and views for photography,A must visit place in Seoul."
For first time visit,"This one you should try to go up on your first time, although there's nothing very spectacular it is a must-see because it's one of the most recognisable landmarks of Seoul. We took the stairs going up and it was so tiring, it is almost 4k steps good things the stairs were really well maintained. Took the cable car on the way down"
Very crowded ,"We went there on a Saturday night. The place was very crowded. So, it was very difficult to take photos and really admire the scenary. We abort the plan to go up the tower as we were told that the waiting time is at least 45 min."
Tower on top of a mountain,"You get amazing views of the city. Worth the tram ride up and then the elevator up the tower. In total spent about $25 CAD round trip using the tram to the tower, up the tower and back down. The park around the tower is nice as well."
Night View,I highly recommend to visit the N Seoul Tower at night around 9:00pm. The line wasnt bad at all but keep in mind the ticket booth for the actual tower for viewing closes at 1030pm. 
Nice views,"We took the tram up to the top because it was way too hot and humid to hike up during the day with our five year old. While we didn't end up going to the top of the tower this time, the views from the hill, and base of the tower are still very good. We will go back next time we are in Seoul and visit at night."
Beautiful,"It is part of a broad Worldwide tower program - The Great Towers. Though a bit hard to get to if by walking (quite steep to go by foot), there is plenty of other choices. A nive combination is walking and riding the cable car!"
Towel lo,"Got a entrance package that cost W26,000 with 2 entrance tic, 2 beer and a popcorn. That was the worst pop corn i ever had! But the rest was good. Not a very fascinating tower with a lot of people fighting to take picture at the window, so not much peaceful place for you to get a peaceful high view from top. Which I believe is the same in most part of the towel in the world. If you do not want to buy a ticket, just walk around the towel at the place where the tourist hang the lock. Is another nice place also, but free. Oh, the towel has transparent toilet.... "
N Seoul Tower,"This Namsan park is just behind the hotel we stay. It take us 10 minutes walk to the cable car stations. You can walk up to the Tower which many local did as morning and evening walk. When you reach the tower, you shall take the lift up to the tower. The views from there able to see Seoul city."
Hike up if there's a long wait for the tram,"We went on a Monday evening and so did everyone else! The line up was all the way down the road and it took us 1.5 hours of waiting before we got on the tram. Had we known that the path to hike up the mountain only takes 30-40 min (2.4 km), we would have hiked it in a heart beat even in the scorching heat. On the way down, there was also a huge line up so we opted to forfeit our purchased tickets and walked down. At first, I was very hesitant as it was late out and I wasn’t sure how lit the paths were. Well, this has got to be the best laid out hiking path ever. It was paved with stairs and tons of lighting and signs to direct you in the right direction. In fact, there were still tons of families with young ones in tow that were hiking up the mountain as we were coming down at around 10:30pm. There’s tons to do and see up there, so give your self some time. We ate at one of the restaurants which were reasonably priced being on top of a mountain. Best advice: wear good runners, bring water, hike up if the line is ridiculously long."
Nice views by night. Too many people ,Guess it's one of Seoul's must-see places. Was a bit disappointed though. It was overcrowded and there is no outside terrace or something which means you can't really take a nice pic. Bought tickets with popcorn and Heinekens - liked that option.
Didn't go to the top,"I didn't go up the tower but the walk itself is amazing, especially if you go before the sunset.. You can see the sunset from the hill. There are also so many couples, and so many locks everywhere, so if you have a S/O you can lock your locks. But other than that, there's a watching deck and some cafe's on top, also the walk down is nice, but if you do not like walking there is a service which takes you up. I forgot how it was called. Either way, it is worth a visit. A really nice place for a date :)"
Best view of Seoul,Went there after baseball game. Note it's a long walk. The bus takes you there for 1100 WON and worth it. The basic ticket is 10000 WON per person. Views are great and well worth going. 
Crowded but under control,"A very touristy landmark and crowded over the weekend, I was there on a Saturday. A very windy area with a good vantage point overlooking the city, with basic facilities like car park and public toilets, coffee shop, convenient stores and souvenir shopping. It requires a little bit of climbing but on tarmac so it's okay, very children friendly area, but watch out for cyclists on the way down as they come from behind you, keep to the side of the road and hold on to your kids."
Crowded.,"Fun, fun fun. Long lines on the cable car. Thousands of Crazy love locks on fences, blocking views. Probably don't need to go to the top of The tower."
very cool,We took the cable car up to the tower. We opted for beer and popcorn with our admission and sat up in the tower to enjoy the view of Seoul. We did it at night to see the lights. 
Great Tower ... To See the Smog,"The Namsan Tower is a great tower which is situated on the Namsan, which literally means ""Southern Mountain."" It is similar to the observatory towers in Seattle and Toronto and Niagara Falls and other places. It offers a great view of the Seoul city scapes. Regrettably however most of the time Seoul is so covered in smog(both emanating from China and from its own creation) that theoretical visibility does not mean actual visibility. Enjoy!"
"Must visit, but not too exciting","N seoul tower is one of the must visit places in Seoul. It is one.of the main attractions. I have been their twice, one on cable car, which was crowded. This time we caught the number 2 bus, which was much cheaper. There are shops and restaurants up there, but you can see everything in about 1 to 2 hours. Visit Seoul tower if you have never been."
Lotte Mall Visit,"I love this place. Great shopping mall for branded good. If you can't afford to shop there but at least come to enjoy the nice restaurant, beautiful view of Seoul Tower and Aquarium too."
A Must See,This was one of the highlights of our tour. The 360 degree view of the city was just amazing. Be sure to go on a clear day to really enjoy.
Beautiful and wonderful Tower,"Beautiful and wonderful tower in a wonderful place and over MountAnd it can be reached by bus and there are many restaurants and cafes, and can a good timeIt is through the tower you can see the city and landmarks"
"Hyped up, and not much of a scenery","I went to Seoul Tower with a group of friends. Even though it was a weekday, it was quite crowded throughout, which gave us some expectations about the view on top of the tower. However, paying ~10000 won to go up is really a waste of money. The windows are not well maintained, meaning that whatever nice view of the city would go through this dirty filter before it reaches your eyes."
Well worth the walk,"Fascinating place to visit. So much more than just the view, which would be worth the visit on it's own. The walk through the park was very peaceful, but very steep in parts. If that is a concern the cable car is a less strenuous way of getting to the top."
Just average,"You can go to the cable car place by car, cab, bus, or by foot. After you reach at the edge of the mountain, you get to take cable car or climb up the mountain.Pros1) You get to see Seoul in one site2) though the cable car is expensive, you can climb up the mountain to reach there3) have cool performance in the afternoonCons1) Ticket for observation deck is not worth the price. If you wish to go, i recommend you to get combo stuffs. Pay some more and grab some snacks2) When climbing from Myeongdong, the slope is too high. If your shoes are uncomfy, just take cab or bus up thereTipsIf you wish to go for observation deck, i recommend you to look for tickets online.It's nice when you go there at night or during sunset I wouldn't really recommend you to go up to the observation deck as there is nothing much to do up there. There are weekly basis performances and benches just below the tower and it is good enough to have to sight when you are climbing up the mountain.If you're not a local, and love makeups, it would be good to visit Myeongdong when visiting Seoul Tower. Myeongdong is right below the mountain area, walkable distance."
Romantic dinner,"We went for the fixed course dinner at the top, good food, good service, table for couple have couch facing the window and fantastic view, a wonderful enjoyable evening. Best for anniversary or proposing. "
fabulous views,The kids loved the cable car ride to the tower. Go on a clear day for the best views of the city. Still a lot of steps to walk despite the lift to the top.
Good view of the city,"Worth a visit to get some great views of the city, both during the day and evening. It's easy to get to with the cable car taking you up the hill to the base of the tower. Got some great pics from up there"
Decent place to stop by if you have time to spare,"Crowds, crowds and more crowds... This place is really crowded with tourists and locals. Seems like a very popular place with youngsters as they have 'love padlock' trees and all around.The view of Seoul from here is good but maybe obscured a bit by foliage and geography. Lots of hills between the tower and Seoul. Again with a guide the experience is better as he was able to explain the gates of Seoul and how the city was like in the past."
Not sure if it was worth the hassle of getting there...,"Hiking uphill from the subway station to the tram station was daunting in the stifling heat of July. There must have been an easier way to get there, but we didn't find it. The traditional music and dance performances were so-so, but the view from the top of the tower was nice."
Good Seoul City View from above,Recomended Place for people who go to Seoul expecially who likes korean Drama. There are many korean drama use this place for Shooting location. 
Must do,"This is a great way to see all of Seoul in one hit and work out your bearings on a map. Cable car ride up was enjoyable, 10 mins in between each one going up and down. Try and pick a clear day when going up to make it worthwhile, like a lot of other people say, you don't need to go up the tower, we didn't and saw plenty. Has a small selection of bars, restaurants and shops up there, great for a sunset drink."
Tower's fan,"The N Seoul Tower, especially at night, looks amazing. It's not expensive to go up in it so you can enjoy hands down to best view of the whole city, which is huge."
The view is worth it,"If you are in Seoul you should visit it because the view is very good.Inconvenient: at the top you have many shops so it annoys the ones who want to enjoy the view.Very touristic.But again, the view is great.Important : remember to see when the last bus is coming because if not you'll have to walk all the way down."
Not as good as what I've imagined ,The view up on the tower was quite unsatisfying due to the bad weather. Seeing up on the tower doesn't make you feel like being so high up there. The only thing that impressed me was the screen at the ceiling of the elevator when going upstairs
Seoul Tower,"Rest up before you go as you can challenge the hills up to the tower. At the base of the tower you will find food, souvenirs, and drinks and for the children toys. The ride up to the top of the tower is the main attraction and you will be able to see a 360 degree view of Seoul. There is a revolving restaurant at the top so you can eat and enjoy the view. And now for the children, take the elevator to the basement and there is a kiddie corner of rides, games and food. There is also a little aquarium, You can make this a day event.. "
Beautiful and impress ,"It was worth the time to visit , I went on Apr so it was a bit cool at night time , so please prepare your jumper if you come same month :) "
Great views,This tower had great views of Seoul and was intetesting to see the beautiful city. It didnt seem that high but i guess thsts because you get the cable car first. We ended up here at lunch time so it was less crowded which was a good idea. Would recommend that. 
Tower In seoul,I just take a photo from the outside. Its very cold here and so windy. U can find a lock park in here. Bring ur couple
"Fun Walk, Excellent Views!","My friend and I made the great choice to walk up the hill to the tower, instead of riding the cable car. The walk really wasn't bad, and the weather was pretty temperate for us. The night we went, it was very clear, so we could see really far. The views were beautiful and we had a great time!"
Seoul bucket list must,For sure every visitor should get up the N Tower. The view is amazing day and night and is worth the wait and the super-touristic appeal. I recommend walking up the Namsan...
Early start beats the queue,This was worth the trip. Fantastic view. We tried the previous day in the afternoon but the queue was very long.
Free portion is good enough,"Overall:- there is an observatory deck free to the public which is quite high up. The view from here is good enough and the lover's lock area is also here- worth the visit but only on a clear dayPros:- free area is great- view is fantastic- great atmosphere where the couples place their locks- lots of photo opportunityCons:- there is a fee (10,000 KRW or around $11 CAD) to go up to the highest observatory deck (higher than the free observatory deck)TIPS!- only go on a clear day. If there is fine dust or if it is cloudy, the view is not as great because of limited visibility- check out the free observatory deck first before buying tickets to go up to the paid observatory deck, since the free one might be good enough for you!"
Beautiful views and romantic atmosphere,"Both the early evening and night views from atop the N Seoul Tower are absolutely breathtaking! The views are especially romantic if you are with your significant other, yet it is still suitable for families.The tower boasts a 360 degree viewing area, a number of restaurants, a gift shop and a lovers' walkway. Lovers can attach a love lock to the lovers' walkway to symbolise their eternal love. The tower is a must-see on your trip to Seoul! "
Nice view,"It is a nice view even from the decks without going up the tower. You can have a beautiful view of Seoul especially when the weather is bright and clear. When we were up there, there was also a performance and also the opportunity to wear Hanbok (traditional Korean attire) for those who are interested. Namsan is the place where people would put their lock of love and leave it there. If you forgot to buy one prior to your visit, there is a souvenir shop which sells those locks and gifts too.I would say you can buy cheaper locks before you get up but I guess the locks up there are fancier. My family and I decided to not go up the tower since it was foggy the day we visit. We figured it wouldn't be worth a visit as we couldn't see much, either. I would strongly recommended to go either at night or on a clear day so that you can get the most out of your visit. A foggy day isn't exactly they best but if that is the only choice you have, just staying at the deck would be enough."
Panoramic view,As in any city the high rise building or landmark towers give you an excellent view of the city and a better understanding of its size and N Seoul tower is no exception. The atmosphere around the tower base is energetic and lively specifically around the love locks and there is nice cafeterias at the base and in the tower itself with souvenirs shop too. I suggest you go in the early morning or at sunset where you can have a better view of the city and not abstracted by the high sun light specifically in summer months. 
Korea's City Lights,View is great! Do not expect much in the observatory. Two ways to get to the tower:1. ride the cable car which is very expensive because you'll be standing with 49 other people2. use stairs via Namsan Park 
"Climb the hill, avoid the tower","The top of the hill is accessible on foot, by cable car or by bus, and the view of the city from up here is good. Be prepared to queue for the cable car.The tower provides a significantly higher view of the city but at the top it's tacky and disappointing. In particular, if you want to take good photos then it's near impossible because of the reflections in the windows. There isn't an outdoor viewing point to get around this.At the top it's a sales pitch. You can buy the green screen photo, souvenirs, postcards, drinks, memorabilia...I didn't think the tower was worth the extra cash and the issue with taking photos made it more disappointing. In hindsight, the view from the top of the hill is good enough."
Enjoyable visit,"We were able to walk to the cable car station and bought tickets for round trip. The cable car is just one carriage and packs more than 10 people (not sure if there were 20) each time. Good to go in the late afternoon so you can hang around at the Observation Tower (lots of people had the same idea) till sun sets. This way, we got the daytime panoramic view of the city as well as the night scene. We had gone for a Nanta show earlier and bought package deal which came with admission tickets to the tower. When we wanted to go back, there was quite a long line of people waiting for the cable car."
Beautiful ,The way towards tower is on little height. From bus stop it is almost 15 min walk towards tower. Buy love locks from market else you need to pay high price at the Tower. You will see thousands of love locks there. You can print your photo on wood also. The city view from this height is awesome. 
Great view,The love locks are just normal nothing special. We went there during the day and there were a comedy going on on top which was great. Transport was convenient too. We took the public bus got here during the day spend half day here and sat on the deck with amazing view.
great views go at night if possible,went during the day but would think that the night would be better a photo is taken of you whilst there and you can select a night or day view which is interesting
Good view of the city,"The tower is unimpressive, the climb up is steep and the entrance fee is rather high, but once up there it is a great view of the city!"
Spectacular,"The N Seoul Tower gives an outstanding panoramic view over Seoul.There are numerous organised trips that can be quite expensive - just get the train right to the tower, you don't need a guide."
Great night view,I arrived here at night because of the long queues to get in the cable car. Wait for almost 2 hours. It was packed but still can found good spot for good photos. Love the view!
Great for catching sunset !,It's a great place to catch the sunset! Just be prepared to walk up quite a number of flight of steps to get up here. In fact we walked up multiple slopes and stairs just to get to the cable car station and up to N Seoul tower. Come with proper footwear.
Just like a normal tower,There is nothing special as a visitor about this tower. cable car experience was good. view from the tower is also good.
Yes for first timer,"Landmark in Seoul, you can see it in many places. Take the cable car or do a little hiking to the top of Namsan. There are shops and restaurants around the tower. Many couples like to buy a lock and tie it on the fences, meaning they are locked together, never apart. It became more popular after a recent extremely well-received Korean drama. So try it if you and your loved one fancy this little playful act!"
Don't visit during foggy weather!,"Went a day after it rained, during late afternoon, and the weather was quite foggy. Hence, we decided to only take the cable car up & down, and not up the tower (to save some money). There's plenty of things to see at the observatory deck itself as well. To add on, instead of going up the tower, we decided to hang around the observatory deck to wait for the lights at night to come alive. It was quite a pretty sight to take in.Also, the place can be quite cold (even during the summer) as there were tons of strong frequent gusts of wind."
The views are Seoul (So) splendid!,"My family and I had an early dinner and intentionally arrived at the onset of sunset on a sunny day at the N Seoul Tower (‘N’ stands for ‘Namsan’ or 'new' tower after its re-modelling in 2005) and left at about 8:30pm. N Seoul Tower is the highest ‘point’ in Seoul.Getting there and fees: After exiting from Chungmuro Station (Subway Lines 3 & 4) Exit 2, walk to the bus stop and take either Namsan yellow bus number 2 or 5 or after exiting from Myeongdong Station (Subway Line 4) Exit 3, walk to the bus stop and take bus number 5. These buses would take you right to the base of the Tower, where cars are prohibited. Alternatively, after exiting from Myeongdong station Exit 3, you could walk about 10 minutes following the street to the right of Pacific Hotel and take the cable car. Lastly if taking bus and cable car do not appeal to the adventurous you, then you could also walk for about 30-45 minutes to the N Seoul Tower.My family and I took the bus because we anticipated long queues for the cable car as N Seoul Tower (or Namsan Hill for that matter) is a very popular tourist attraction. On both ascent and descent, we found empty seats on the bus. Entrance fee to N Seoul Tower is 9000 won for adult and 7000 won for children.The Tower: The ride up on the elevator with the commentary generated our expectation of something exciting to see. Indeed, we got a splendid 360 panoramic view of Seoul. During sunset, you could catch the majestic sun setting behind the mountains. During the night, you could enjoy the city of Seoul in its vibrancy and splendour.There’s also a snack café, a sweets shop (Weeney Beeney) and a souvenir/gift shop (BA:NG) on the observatory. However, I was disappointed with 3 things at the observatory: Firstly, while there are directions to South Pole, Jeju Island, Jakarta, Singapore etc, there was no information or placards to tell me about Seoul city that I was viewing at (e.g. the name of buildings, landmarks, river etc); to get round this, you have to rent the audio guide (3000 won). Secondly, because of the reflections of the lighting from the shops, the photos of the night scenery of Seoul landscape included the lightings too! Lastly, it was pretty crowded such that the available seats were all fully taken and some people had to sit on the floor.There are more things to see at the base of the tower, including a gift shop, an open air viewing platform and a ""Locks of Love,"" area where thousands of personalised padlocks have been attached by romantic couples as a symbol of undying affection for each other.I would recommend a visit in the late afternoon just before sunset and leave in the night. Do check the weather before going because you wouldn’t see or photograph much when it’s raining or when it’s hazy or misty. And if you decide to “dine-and-view” at the N Seoul Tower, then there’s n.Grill (French Restaurant at the top), Hancook (Korean restaurant), N Burger and N Terrace (Lounge Café); be prepared for expensive menus. Nevertheless, this is a must-see attraction in Seoul!"
A good place,A good place to visit if you are in Seoul which offers some great views of the city. Lot of eating options available here. You can buy some souvenirs from here. 
relaxing,i like this because it reminds me boys over flower scene with jandi haha. romantic atmosphere. make sure to take the metro rail going up. the stairs is pretty tiring so glad we took the ride up. there also a small restaurant on top of the tower. i think you have 3 options.
Not much to do,"We went up with the cable car, overall nice view but nothing more. There's the lock your love thing going on there where couple pot locks on practically anything willing to hold it around the tower and promise their love to one another.It's nice but nothing too much"
Fantastic!,"A must-see. The view of Seoul from the tower is absolutely amazing. In the observatory deck there is a souvenir shop full of candy, cards, mugs, etc. There's even a few tables to fill out a postcard and send it back home! (Once purchased, the postcards come with stamps). Now, there are a lot of lines involved in this. Since I was visiting Namsangol Hanok Village nearby, my friends and I decided to do the N Seoul Tower next. You can walk from the Village (probably around an hour+?), all up-hill. I decided not to do this after walking half-way up. The first line we encountered was the line to use the gondola to bring us to the top of the hill (where the N Seoul Tower is located). The line to buy the ticket and get on the gondola was probably an hour.Once we arrived at the N Seoul Tower there was tons of people touring around. If you're a couple planning on visit, bring an (engraved) lock! There are fences and sculptures lined with locks. The next lineup was the lineup to take the elevator to the top of the Seoul Tower. The lineup wasn't too bad, probably around 15-30 minutes. Once inside the conservatory, the area was packed with people. Note: We went around late-afternoon just as the sun was setting. The sitting areas were taken up and it was hard to find a good spot to stand by the window for the view. However, once the sun set the view was beautiful.Once all was said and done, there was a line up to go back down the tower, and another one to take the gondola back. All in all, a great view, cool souvenirs, and pretty budget friendly."
Nice view of Seoul and romantic thing to do <3,"Watched any Korean dramas? If you have, chances are it has featured N Seoul Tower at some point. A popular couples place to go to, make sure you buy a lock and leave it up there! "
Wow,It is best at night. SPECTACULAR! It is a must see. You can bring everyone. All ages. Have a great time everybody!! Have fun!
Amazing city view,This is a MUST SEE of South Korea. Leaving without visiting the Seoul tower is like not coming at all. Take a lock with you because locks are really expensive there. Eat before going since there are not many options to eat there. 
nice and crowded,"went there during spring, full of people. Very nice view and on the way walking up, we were caught by the beautiful flowers. Many vendor taking picture for you, so if u would like to have nice picture, pay between 5000-8000 won and you can have one. "
Great views,"I've been there in the evening, when the sun was already down, and the views are amazing! The only downside is that you have to wait a while (for me it was an hour) between buying the ticket and going up. But they tell you that in advance and you can wonder around during that time (there's a lot of open space with also good views of the city) or have a drink or a meal in one of the cafes there. The tower looks amazing in the evening too!"
The love locks are impressive,"Did not have the chance to go up the elevator to the viewing deck, but the location already gives you quite a good view of the city. The number of love locks around the area was mind blowing. Locks are attached to fence like structures - multi layered, or to tree structures - making them like Christmas trees. If you do not bring a lock with you, you can buy one right there at the gift shop, and attach it to any lock that is already there, to symbolize your lasting love to your loved one."
A MUST SEE,"This place is a MUST SEE. It's so beautiful especially at night. Waiting for the cable car can be a little discouraging BUT, once you get up there, it is truly breath taking to look at Seoul from the top.  Highly recommend this place. "
A must see by night! ,"Went there in evening hours, the 360 degrees sight of shiny Seoul is definitely worth every penny to pay for the ticket. Don't miss out photo shoot at the entrance, and enjoy the movie in elevator "
Top of seoul,You can go there to see Seoul from the top it is very amazing up there epically when it is cloudy or at the sunset time
skytowerr,"Must see in korea, bit of a wait for cable car but it's worth it once et the top, great views and exciting timr"
Salim ,I had been here many years back but I went there again in this trip ITS always refreshing to go there and see Seoul from a top. 
Not worth going all the way up the tower.,"It's worth walking up the mountain as you will have a great view over Seoul from the top of the mountain. But going up the tower, it isn't really worth the price. It's crowded and noisy. You will not be able to enjoy the beautiful night scenery of Seoul here. Rather go to Palgakjung or Han River for that!"
Nice trip and view of Seoul,"There's only a handful of days in Korea, where it's clear out. And luckily, when my family and I traveled to the N Seoul Tower, we happened to go on one of these days. It's as expected, it's tower on top of a hill overlooking a large city. So, it's definitely worth going at least once while in South Korea. After you're done with the views, there's plenty of restaurants available in the tower and even great views outside of it."
Great view from the top!,"You get to go on cable car to the top, which can be a one way trip or a round trip (one way estimated: 6 US dollars; round trip estimated: 8.5 US dollars). If you buy one way trip, you need to return by walking down through a passage, where you can enjoy the natural scenery and breathe the fresh air as well. You can also bring your partner to lock your ""love lock"", a symbolism of your long lasting relationship. Ultimately, the view on the top is really worth it, especially if you watch it during the night!"
Great views across Seoul,"Well worth a visit. Go early in the morning before the smog/ haze develops and enjoy the amazing views across Seoul. Take the cable car, or if feeling energetic it's possible to walk up to the tower!"
average scenic view,"well i went to tower , end of the the time i just look 360 view which was average , cost is high to pay "
Pretty tower views,"N seoul tower was nice- lovely views from the top. Go just before sunset so you can see views in the day, during sunset and at night.. hiwever this is a very crowded time. The surrounding food areas were totally overpriced with minimal variety. I suggest you eat before you get there. It's quite a walk Uphill to get to the tower so wear comfortable shoes. "
Iconic View,"We took the cable car up the hill and found the fences of love padlocks and then went to the various ticket booths.We had considered eating at the top of the tower but the various dining options were expensive and there didn't appear to be any menus to allow you to decide whether the prices were justified.We obtained 2 lift tickets that also included drinks and popcorn. From then on the experience was spoiled somewhat because it just seemed like a tacky cinema. You do get some amazing views from the base of the tower and from the tower itself, though the windows are filthy. At the top there is a massive sweet shop and a small coffee bar. There are few places to sit and it is crowded.The men's urinal is definitely worth a visit.I think that a visit to the top should be on everybody's to do list but it was the only tourist attraction that we paid for in Seoul and yet it was the worst thing that we did."
Not for rainy weather ,Very beautiful place. The biggest in Seoul. Because of rain it was smog that day. I cannot see all the city.
"See it Once, at Night","A one time experience. Take the cable car up and down. Long waits for cable car and sometimes to get into the city view part of the tower. Food and drink pricey up top, as you might expect. You'll be glad you went, but I doubt you'll do it again."
Great place to view Seoul,"walked up the tower, rather than the cable car. Great views and view points going up and on the way downAt the top there are masses and masses of padlocks, with moving words of love and positivity. If only the world could be this caring! There are plenty of photo opportunities both of the breathtaking views, and the colourful padlocks. At the tower there are a number of restaurants and gift shops. You can buy the padlocks at the tower, but obviously at a premium price. "
Nice ,Nice views. However the views from the cable car might be enough and you might not need to go up. The cost is not too expensive as well
Must do when visiting Seoul,"N Seoul Tower is a delight to visit at night - providing excellent views across different aspects of the city, as well as views of the colourfully lit tower. You'll see a striking display of Korean 'love' in the tens of thousands of love locks cladding the fences and tree-like frameworks. There are multiple levels with various eateries and places for a beer, alongside great views. If you visit in Summer, be sure to take a cab to the cable car to avoid any extra sweaty walking. The climb to the top is steep and around 1.3K. not something to do in 30 degree heat and 100% humidity. Take the cable car - 8,500 Won return. Do allow for long queues | wait times. Once you're at the Tower, note - there's another 10,000 Won or so to actually go up it, and very long queues. So plan well ahead.We only tried the burger place (due to wait time to get up the tower) - and it was pretty ordinary. So avoid it if you can.Walking down is a treat - still very sweaty in Summer, but a great way for the city to unfold in different levels and vistas than you will have seen."
Busy,"Excellent view of the city. Incredibly busy, we waited 30-40 mins in line to purchase tickets for the cable car. Walking is another option but it was too hot for a hike. Add another 20 mins to board the cable car and 10 to get to the top of the tower. Overall it was still pretty awesome. "
Nice place to seing Seoul....,"Wanna go to N Seoul....you can try cable car (station around myeongdong) but in the bad weather, it will be closed. You can try go another way.When arrived in N Seoul Tower, you can see 'love locked' around there. Go up the tower, we can see Seoul 360°. You better go in the evening. The beautiful city of seoul with glamorous light..."
Just for fun,"Just so-so. If you've been to Taipei 101 observatory or others, then don't bother coming. Pretty small compared to 101. No malls or other places of attractions that are within walking distance.Maybe the more attractive part is the locks area where kdrama was filmed there(just for kpop fans)"
Seoul Tower,Be sure to set out enough time for standing in line. Copious amounts of people visit this attraction. The view is great (the windows should just be cleaned from time to time) and worth the wait. 
Amazing night views of Seoul with a few strings attached,"Visited on the evening on August 1st so the temps had cooled down to a tolerable level. A few of our group took the stairs up which was a great little workout. Highly recommend taking the bus if you don't want to get all sweaty as there are a lot of steps in a steep incline. A few members of our group took the bus and had to wait over an hour to get on a very crowded bus. The night views were well worth the effort though. Be aware of the mosquitoes, moths and cicadas as they were all out in force. Our entire group chose to walk down to avoid the bus crowds. We obviously visited during peak domestic and foreign tourist season."
Great View,"Not cheap just for a look. but we got the couple package for 21,000 won with beer and popcorn so its not too bad. you also need to add the cost of the cable car up to the bottom of the tower as well. Great view from the top over the entire city that sprawls as far as you can see"
Can't Finding a Better View in Seoul. I dare you to hike it!,"Breathtaking views. Fresh air. I dare you to attempt to hike all the way up. Great for a workout and build up an appetite. Expect crowds during weekends and Korean holidays. If you don't wish to climb it, you can pay for a cable car to take you to the top and escort you down. But I don't know how much it costs because I hiked the whole thing."
Awesome experience!,But my sea bass tasted fishy. Not the kind of quality I expected from such an upscale kind of place. Other than that though? Simply spectacular. Period.
"A nice spot, but too expensive","Namsan is a beautiful small mountain in the heart of the city, and its tower is above the city giving the visitors an incredible vue. But it costs 10 000 won, a bit too expensive...But there is too others nice paths inside the forest of the mountain, it's wildly and safe at the same time. I saw butterflies, birds, and other kind of insects and animal I didn't know. I really recommend people to go down the mountain by these paths, and not taking the bus."
Nice View,"Namsan or N seoul tower is 15 minutes at most to myeongdong depending on transport. Yu can walk from myeongdong and take the sky train, ride the bus or for some (which is crazy for me) walk all the way to the top. It's scenic and beautiful mainly oriented to couples. It features restaurants, a pagoda, and the famous love locks."
Night time vist.,This is accessed via a cable car. The wait for the car is quite long. When we arrived all at the ticket office had gone for their break! Having said that when they returned the queue went down more quickly. The charge for the cable car doesn't include the trip up the tower this is an additional cost. There are places to eat at the base of the tower. The queue to return in the cable car was huge so we decided to walk down the mountain. This took about 20 minutes. There are some great viewing platforms on the way down.
Great place,"It was a very nice and romantic place :) We will def. come back.Best time to go is in the afternoon till night :) For couples, bring tripod for great shots so you wont need strangers to take shots for you.We love this place :) it was near our hotel too :)"
Good place for couples,You will need to ride their elevator up to the hill to reach the ticket counter. The elevator is free. You buy a ticket and ride cable car to the Seoul Tower. There is a place to sell locks and you can write on it and lock on the fence around the place. And there's a lot of people too.
What a view,"We took the city loop bus up to the tower. The day we went was busy, but I have since been told that there is no off peak time, even when its misty. The views are spectacular. You get a sense of the true size of Seoul. Its a massive spread out city. My only complaint is that everyone touches the class and its hard to avoid the smudges while trying to get a good picture. There is a post office box in the tower, so for a small fee you can buy a postcard and send to friends. When you have had enough of the view you can venture back to the ground level to buy food and drinks. Its the usual tourist food, but its not too bad. If you are with your partner you can then buy a small padlock and place it with thousands of other locks. Its a pretty amazing sight and nice to see people getting into the spirit."
Awful queue to ascend,"Went in the evening to view the nightline. Basically waited in queue behind a whole village, takes almost an hour waiting in line to get on a cable car that takes 5 minutes to ascend. Had to get tickets to head up to the observatory which was another 30 minute wait. View would have been amazing if not for the fog present as it had rained beforehand. Descend was more comforting (20 minutes in line) and a lot quicker than I had thought (villagers were mostly not present)."
The history is not to be missed! ,"We waited for a day with less haze, and my daughter and I (and her preschoolers) took the cable car to the top of the hill while our adventurous hubbies climbed. The cable car was crowded and quick... simply a means of transportation vs a sightseeing bonus. Upon arriving to the top, we did buy passage to the top of the Tower. We enjoyed views of the old and new city, and we enjoyed spotting several locations we had visited. We also bought the crazy pose tourism photos as this was our first and probably only trip to Seoul. But outside on the hilltop we really enjoyed the glimpses of the ancient wall and the warning beacons (reminiscent of Lord of the Rings)! We also bought a set of ""love locks"" and wrote our message, latched them onto the wall, and threw the key over the side to the chuckles and shutter clicks of many Koreans who were amused by our participation in their tradition :-) We finished our time on the mountain with a decent lunch at N Burger."
No other view of Seoul like it! ,"Just spectacular! You will not see Seoul like this unless you take a helicopter tour which no doubt would cost significantly more than catching the cable car to the tower and paying the extra (just 10,000w) to go up the tower to the observation decks. You MUST do this!!! We'd eaten before heading up and would recommend using the toilet just after you've paid for the cable car. We waited about 45 mins, through patches of no air con and lovely air con... need to be patient. It's worth it! The main area at the base of the tower is lovely. Despite lots of visitors, it feels relaxed and there's space to step back and take it all in. Lovely planting and pergolas, some of which provide scenic backdrops for photo opportunities. Of course, plenty of opportunity to buy a padlock, personalise and add it to your choice of locations dotted around... Tastefully done by the way. On the top observation there are sweet and souvenir shops and opportunity to buy, write and post postcards... Perfect! This area is REALLY busy! Once you're done, take the stairs down a level. Here it is MUCH quieter. You learn more from the info quotes on the windows and can buy a drink and sit peacefully taking in the stunning views. It's from this level you catch the lift to return to the base of the tower. This really is a 'must do' if you're exploring Seoul and really want to see just how significant, sprawling and stunning a city it is!"
Best place to see Seoul at night!,N Seoul Tower is famous because of the view. It's the best place to see Seoul at night cause it's located at uphill and you need to walk around 5minutes from the bus stop to the ground of the tower. People also call it as lock tower.
Exciting!,"We wanted to be there early to avoid the crowds, so we got to the cable car early. There are still a bunch if steps to the Tower proper. There is quiet a haze over the city, which doesn't make for clear pictures. It is a fun and amazing place."
A decent view but nothing too spectacular,"There's 2 parts to get to the top. If you're coming from ground level, the first elevator is free of charge. Then you have a choice of paying for the next elevator, or walking up the stairs for free. On a hot or humid day or evening I would not recommend the stairs, but the option is there.The final ascent to the top of the tower does cost you an extra fee though, which is where the Teddy Bear Museum was also located. The view isn't that exciting, just lots of buildings. I think that's the only reason to go up to the top as I can't imagine the view of skyscrapers and residential towers would be that exciting from a few metres higher.So, you could do everything for free if you really wanted to, or end up spending around 10,000 to 20,000 won."
Nice view of Seoul,"I visited the tower recently and I would say it was worth it (and I would do it again) although not nearly as impressive as similar attractions, for example one world trade center. I think I decided to go there because it was my first time in Seoul, and I am glad I did, but I would not go there again. I would recommend take the cable car to the base of the tower."
"A ""Need to See"", while in Seoul","Overall Very nice attraction. Offers a great view if the city, like the tower in Seattle, a MUST see when in the area.ValueA good value attraction, especially when compared to a similar attraction in the U.SAreaAn oasis in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Seoul. You can also grab a bite to eat one of the restaurants on site."
Would have been better to see at night.,"We went up to see the view from the tower, but all we could see was the haze and pollution coming from China to Korea. Would have been much better at night to see the lights."
Nothing special,"I was visited this tower on night time, when i reached top floor, nothing special on this tower. Unless u come to this tower with your couple. Buy a lock and lock it. Thats all. Not really good place to visit. "
Walk up the hill and love life!,"The day I went it was absolutely raining cats and dogs, man it was wet. So naturally I decided to walk up the hill.The path is well paved and wide, and not too steep either. The forest is lovely and the base of the tower has plenty of facilities.I ate a yummy burger and bought a delightful fridge magnet. Happy days.But I didn't bother going up the tower because it was too cloudy."
Great view of Seoul,This is a lovely place to see the city. If taking the tram is within walking distance of the Myeongdong station. The view is spectacular. 
N Seoul Tower,"My partner and I WALKED through the park to see N Seoul Tower and that was a MISTAKE! We didn't plan enough in advance to know which subway station to get off at that put us closer to the tram that takes you up. So we decided to get off at the closest subway station to the park and hoped to find the tram. We didn't and ended up walking the entire way up. Be bought the combined ticket which included 2 observation tickets, 1 large popcorn and 2 medium drink for 21,000 won! FANTASTIC DEAL, because one observation ticket was 10,000 won. So we paid 1,000 won for our popcorn and drinks. Also when purchasing our tickets, we were told that the restroom on at the observation deck was out of order, so plan accordingly. On the observation deck, there was plenty of room to sit and enjoy our snack and cool off. There was a gift shop, coffee bar and treat bar. The view of Seoul was hazy, of course. However, N Seoul Tower is a most stop if visiting Seoul!"
It's Ok,Gives you a nice view of Seoul. It was our first time to ride a cable car so that was fun but a bit scary for me. There were too many visitors both locals and tourists. There was a small area for lovelocks just like in Paris. Nothing really much to do there except take photos. No need to go up the tower really.
It could be a nice place to visit,"You get there by an elevator. The waiting room is not clean, it has no air conditioner, and they get all people inside. So you can't enjoy the view on the way up. When you get there, you see everything dirty, and when you hope to the city, before getting in the Tower, you don't see a thing because the city is very polluted. You have a lot of places to sit down but not clean, so you don't enjoy it. It could be something so nice..."
Good views,Worth a visit to see the park. View from tower ok if visibility is good. No need to go up tower. Namsan park walking/running track is a great place for a run. 
"Nice View, Too crowded!","Although, the views are pretty good, the observatory is extremely crowded and its impossible to actually enjoy the skyline."
Hike/Lunch,"This is nice to do on a weekend day! If you like hiking you can hike up the stairs, if not you can pay for the lift! We opted to hike and it took us about 15 minutes with a 10 year old. Once we got up there we were able to watch a show that included traditional Korean style dances and weapons demonstration of old fighting styles. There are gift shops and a few choices for food and snacks with good variety. There is a wonderful view of downtown Seoul. Don't forget to bring a lock to place at the top of the tower!"
Good views and lots of locks,"We visited in the rain so the view wasn't great. But in a clear day it would be awesome. Interesting restaurants and lots of ""love locks""Worth a visit if you are in Seoul ."
Nice views,"We purchased specified date tickets from Klook ticket discount App. Although it was a foggy night and we could not change the date, we still dined at Han Cook, one floor below the observation floor, to wait for the clear of the sky. Luckily, we did not leave early and the clouds cleared on their own half way through. Meanwhile, there was a roar of crowd of surprise. Therefore, we could still admire the fascinating night views of Seoul. The buffet at Han Cook offered and included each diner one main dish as well. Some main dishes were designed to be shared by two diners. My teen children like the main dishes."
View all of Seoul,Great view over entire Seoul and a great way to understand how big the city is when planning your sightseeing. Take the lift and the cable car from the down town area for some extra fun.
Great view and show,"Upon arriving to the base of the tower there are a couple of reataurants, shops, a different look out points for great photos. There are plenty of walls for you to place a ""love locket"" if you so choose to. During my visit, I was able to catch a show in the center area at the top of the hill. They were exhibiting traditional Korean martial arts performance which began at 3 pm. Not sure if this is an ongoing thing or not. The view from the top of the tower gives you a perfect panoramic view of Seoul."
Crowded but beautiful,"If you come here during a popular time (e.g. in the late afternoon) then be prepared for long lines up and down. The cable car as well will have long long lines. N Seoul tower offers some gorgeous views of the city around it, if you don't want to fight the crowds for a good photo, go downstairs to the exit level and you'll find the same views but almost no people. You can also send a post card from on top of the tower."
Not amazing but can be visited ,Not best place to visit but gives a good overview of the city .I believe it is nicer to visit wit kids and family
Nice place to hang out,"We walked up the hill to ride the cable car towards N Seoul Tower. Can explore for 1-2 hours. We're there quite late, near closing time but still bustling with people especially couples and families. Most of the shops are closed. My friend and I really enjoyed the HD tunnel from LG. So stunning and real!"
It is what it is,We went to Nam San tower because everybody said you had to see Nam San Tower. Maybe everybody built it up for me. But it was just Ok. Its the highest point in Seoul and you get to see the whole city. Be prepared to hike. We have some awesome pictures from this spot. But not sure if it is a MUST see experience.
One of the things you have to see while in Korea,"Take a few hours after visiting Itaewon or Myeongdong, and go up the hill to visit. Best time to visit is sunset. Expect crowds, but great for the family. A definite must for your visit."
A bit disappointing,"We have visited a number of towers in various cities worldwide. Unfortunately we didn’t think this compared particularly favourably. The place was crowded and noisy, and it appeared to consist more of numerous retail outlets, rather than a tourist attraction. Much of the tourist industry was focused on the practice of love padlocks – quite interesting to see chained everywhere, but obviously a good opportunity for selling these items.At the top of the tower was noisy with very loud pop music. The windows were not totally clear, and no local landmarks were indicated. The deck one floor below showed some local landmarks, but it was not possible to walk all the way round.The cable car offered an efficient service to avoid a hot lengthy claim, and it afforded some reasonable views – we managed to get in the front on the way down.The visit was by no means a disaster. There were quite good views of the city, and it was worth the visit. However, are less commercialised site, and more indications of the local geography would have enhanced our experience."
Great view of the spawl,"The N Seoul Tower is a bit of a trek north of the city, with optional cable car to carry you up the hill to the peak. Views are spectacular with a great vista in all directions you get so see the sea of buildings across the green hills of Seoul metropolitan area, surrounded by mountains in the distance. A great place to watch the sunset.Dining options include a restaurant (book in advance) and a Korean food buffet (remarkably good value and high quality food)."
Great view of Seoul,"This is a nice thing to do at night, you can see Seoul, it is really beautiful! You can either take the bus or walk, it is quite a walk, but nice to do."
Late night visit,"I arrived quite late there 21:30 / 22:00 Was worth to see it at night, amazing 360 view of seoulUnfortunatly the viewing decks are closed with glass, which makes it difficult for pictures"
You can miss it!,"If you can go on a clear day, then make the trip, otherwise, don't worry.On the top you can do a full circle to see the surroundings and the view is lovely but too often there's bad visibility.There's the usual opportunities to buy souvenirs, candy, coffee on several floors! "
Great view,"N Seoul tower was fun. Great views as expected. Easy trip up there. Didn't take long to get up and back. Not crowded, and clean like everything else in Korea. "
Another tower,It's quite short and there was nothing much interesting to see inside nor it has a nice view. Quite disappointed.
Great views,"Well worth a visit with great 360 views of Seoul, distances to many major city's on the viewing Windows , the area around the tower is also good with actors dressed in traditional costumes.The hop on hop off bus stops at the tower.For me this was one of the better city tower viewing experiences"
Very nice for family outings and couples!,"I really liked this, I went with my mum and it was a very nice day out. This was one of the highlights of my trip to Seoul as the cable car was a really fun experience. Make sure to bring a unique padlock! The tower itself was interest, and very peaceful. I liked how on the windows it told you which direction and the distance certain countries are from each window pane. The show was also decent."
Love it,Very romantic place. I think it was definitely worth a visit. Pretty good eats below the building too!
Seoul Tower,Spectacular view of the Seoul city from top of the tower . It takes less than 25 second to reach the top with elevator . Lots of soveniour shop on top oc the tower . Must visit place when you are in Seoul
A nice view of seoul if the weather permits,A short journey up up up on the hilly top before arriving to the platform to go all the way up to the observatory. Once there awaits a beautiful scenery if the weather is clear or just fog and nothing but smog. Better be here at night as its more beautiful scenery. Just avoid tourist time as its very noisy and overcrowded.
Great for family ans couple,"Love locket to express your love. I think it would b better to bring ur own lock, they sell the lock from 7500-15000won. can b expensive, the tower has 5 levels, each level has different of view. From tower level 1 fee will apply, but if u only stay downstairs u still can see lots of stuff, view and nice food."
amazing sunset and night view,worthwhile going up the tower during sunset and or evening as there is stunning view of Seoul from the tower. There are several restaurants if you wish to have a meal there.
Expensive but fun,"Went here on a hot, hazy day. Took the subway from Insadong and walked 15 minutes up to the Cable car (worth every penny on a day like this!)The tower itself is expensive (the restaurants more so). But we had a great time, even though fog and smog covered some of our view. Bathrooms were being renovated so make sure you go before you enter the tower. Plaza was a typical tourist trap, but crowd pleasing martial arts and traditional music demonstrations, art installations and the local park made for a nice promenade. Leave a lock for the love of your life, if you feel so inclined!"
Night views of seoul,"Seoul at night is beautiful. Go to the observation deck to get the full view of seoul at night. I suggest going earlier like 6 or 7pm since there are a lot of people waiting for the cable car or if you don't like to wait or use the cable car, go walk up the tower. But it's better to take the cable car going up and walk down. Walking down won't be as difficult plus you'll get to appreciate the walk down the mountain too!"
the view wow,either walk up or take the cable there are 2 levels 1 takes u to the base then lift up to the top well worth it .
A must in good weather,"A nice look (a bit foggy) of the city the Hangang river and the closer neighborhood. There is a small tourist shop for small souvenirs, one can buy and send a postcard with a special stamp of the tower.At our arrival, before entering the tower, at the square,there was a local folklore show with musical accompaniment "
Nice in the evening ,"We went with the last cable car up at night and avoided the crowds and lines, but we could only come back by bus (or 20min walk), which was very convenient (bus took less than 10min to get to Myeong-dong). Beautiful view at night, however we missed to go into the tower, as the last entrance is at 10.30pm and the area closes at 11pm. Plenty of people up after 11pm, although dark and in the middle of a national park, it feels safe and we enjoyed it. "
Seeing Seoul from above,"Very nice atmosphere Stores and restaurants are kind of priceyMy family climbed the stairs, and took the trolley down. The trolley was over packed but appeared to be safeAll in all it was great to see the city of Seoul from above at night time.Crossed off the Bucket List"
Worth to visit ,"I went there during the night. I spent at least 2 hours to queue the cables, bought the ticket n to get to the tower. There are different options to get to the tower i.e. Including good or popcorn. I chose the plain one. It s a very popular place for both tourist n local people. The couples alyways go for a date to out their lock in. The view is really beautiful. You can walk via the pacific hotel. There are lot of cartoon characters around the suburb."
Great view,Enjoyed the performance at the base. Love the idea of selling the ticket to tower top with popcorn and drinks. Spend good 20minutes enjoying the view. Complete the experience with a coffee before continuing your trip.
Worth it,"Worth it to spend the time walking up the big hill to get to the tower and then take the elevator up. Spectacular views! Best before sunset, then watch the sun go down from on top of Seoul,"
Good if you wan a view of city,"A bit over-priced and crowdy.. If you have any difficulties walking a warning because last bit you have to walk uphills to get to this place if you don't take the sky lift. We used bus to get there, and sky-lift down, recommend your o to the other way around or just sky-lift up and down. Buses stop a bit away, but well there it is really nice to see the entire city. Worth the money "
Great Site to Visit,The experience to Seoul Tower was memorable. Parking in the area surrounding the cable car station was pretty hectic so be prepared to find alternate parking and walk to the cable car station. The cable car ride up was pretty quick however there was quite a long line to get on it. Once at the top the Locks of Love was an interesting feature and then seeing the Seoul Tower was unforgettable. Lots to see and do even before entering the Seoul Tower and definitely worth paying to go all the way up to the obsevation deck.
A great visit to Seoul tower,"The stairs are tough, but a good workouf. Take your time to explore the park around the tower. Lots of things to do overhere."
Place for couples,Nothing interesting but offers good view of Seoul. The price is 8500 won for the round trip cablr car
Perfect place,"Here you can see great view of seoul city. I prefer to visit at sunset time and if you are photographer take your tripod with you. Also use the cable car it's lovely you can take round trip or single trip, but for single trip you will walk till you reaching the main road. Enjoy it and don't miss it"
best visit before sunset,queue for cable car is usually long. next option besides trekking uphill is bus. you can take bus here from many tourist place like insadong/myeongdong etc. the best time to visit namsan tower is 5pm before sunset. fantastic view. stay here until night
Beautiful~,"Me and my group of friends came here and it was great! There was an amazing view of the city and we just simply loved it! It's a bit of work getting to the top though,as you need to walk up a steep hill,but it's totally worth it~At the top there's a cute little post office where you can send postcards,and I thought it was really cool.There were quite a lot of couples there,which explains why they sold a lot of love-themed merchandise.My boyfriend and I bought these adorable key rings~I'll definitely be coming back during my next visit to Seoul!"
awesome sunset,"when we arrived at the top of N Seoul tower, we see the sunset. everybody was ready with camera & video to capture the sunset.... so awesome...the distance between n seoul tower to a car park about 30 minutes walk , but the scenery is very fantastic...you must try it..."
It doesn't pay off at all ,"You can get very nice views without going to the top of the tower. The queue for leaving the tower can be even longer that the one to get in. Moreover, if you go by night, it, the reflection of the indoor lights makes really difficult to get any picture."
Wonderful viewv,Enjoyed a great view from the tower and included posting postcards from here. The elevator runs smoothly and all staff are more than helpful. Great on a fine visibility day. 
Beautiful view. Must go place in Seoul,N Seoul Tower is easy to get to. You can take taxi or just walk from Myeongdong subway station. The view at night is just beautiful! Pay a little to visit the top and you could see Seoul in 360 degrees. Remember to bring a lock here and lock your memories with your loved one here.You may visit the N-Grill fine dining restaurant if you have budget. Set dinner around US$100. It is popular for special occasions even for local Korean.
Seoul Tower Amazing,"That was amazing time..!! specially in the night ..!! i suggest if u going to South Korea..don,t miss Seoul Tower !!"
"擁擠,垃圾很多","非常多的觀光團,很多垃圾,塗鴉噪音尤其是公車站附近的商店,外面好多垃圾人少一點會更好沒甚麼好逛的地方,僅紀念品店及一些小餐廳 so many tourists groups, a lot of trash and graffiti and noisy , especially the CVS near the bus station, trash everywhere and pretty dirty :( would be much better if less people go. not too much to see actually. only souvenir store ,some restaurant that is it. you do not need to go up to the towel to see the whole view. Easy to go by bus. I would not to go again... a place just visit once and it is enough."
Beautiful Views & Much More!,"The views of Seoul from the top of the tower are spectacular. It costs 10,000 won to travel to the top and there are numerous places to get snacks at the tower as well as a restaurant (we didn't use). If you take the public bus it will take you near the base of tower. At the base of of the tower there are picturesque views and many settings that are used for K-drama that my wife was familiar with. If you are with your lover and so inclined, bring a lock. And don't forget your camera!If you benefited from this review, please click the ""helpful"" button."
amazing,"I recommended to do it during the night because the view of seoul is just amazing ! you can discover this part of Séoul that you can't see in general ! Just do it by walk , its a little bit long but at the end you're happy "
Beautiful View,You have to go to the top to admire the city view. Go for dinner at one of the restaurants and you can go to the top for free. If you love seeing the city from high up it is a must see!!
Nice Place,I visit Seoul tower and one of interesting thing same as India i saw in India peoples tied a trade on tree and wish i in Seoul Tower young boys and girls lock a locker and wish and keep the keys 
Fantastic city view of Seoul!,"Dont miss the chance to visit one of the landmarks in Seoul and catch a view of the city from above the N Seoul Tower! If it's not a rainy or foggy day, you should definitely go up the tower. Otherwise, you'll still have picture perfect photos without going up. Plus you get a chance to leave your own love lock."
My love from the Star,"Oh how beautiful is the view!! Most importantly, the TV series 'My Love from the Star' all the romantic scenes were taken from here. It was so fun to sit on the same chair where the main characters sat...able to experience the same view...how wonderful."
Long queues,"Long queues to go up by cable car and enter the observatory and back marred the experience for us. I would suggest coming on weekday mornings when there wouldn't be so many people. Or you could come in the evening, and see the Seoul skyline change from day to night. Do note that as of now, there are no restrooms on the observatory levels, so if you're planning to stay there for a while, keep that in mind. The view itself was fantastic."
Get to the top of Namsan mountain,"Panoramic views but do not choose a misty, dull or rainy day.Shuttle bus for the less energetic but trails go up from the shopping district of Myeongdong for those who want to trek. "
Great View!,"Was able to visit the tower during the evening/night, then again during the day. I enjoyed both visits, though I enjoyed the night views a bit more. Still, well worth the visit(s)! And it was walking distance back to our hotel!"
Seoul Tower Seoul Top,"Visted there with business partners, nice view there, can see nice sunset and they have area for lovers to place those love charm locks, some even use phone case for writing more messages. Can also dinner there, is new so not very crowd. Good Food but rmb no smoking there, if really need a smoke pls do it before the cable car."
A great way to view the Seoul skyline,"We visited the Seoul tower as one of the stops during a day tour of the city. It was a good experience but the trek from the bus drop off point to the tower itself was one heck of a walk. That incline was no joke. The fee for the tower itself was inclusive in our tour so I don't really know how much it costs. Once at the top of the tower, you can use coin operated viewing binoculars to view the city surroundings. There are also other photo ops in and around the tower are. There are promise padlocks (similar to the ones in Paris) and other viewing decks for picture taking. There are also gift shops and food concessionaires in the area."
Top of Seoul.,"OK so you are in Seoul, that's awesome! And if you are deciding if you should visit this place then think no more and just do it! I went there during night time and what a view you get, it's very similar to the view you get from on top of the eiffel tower. There are lots of stores to buy merchant and food so don't worry about eating. I suggest you either catch a bus or taxi to the nearest point and walking up as it only takes 20mins. If you can't be bothered then you can wait for the cable ride but be warned that you might have to wait for 1 ~2 hours. "
"No need to go up to the tower, great view from the hill","You can take the cable car, bus or walk up to the hill where the tower is located. If the day is clear from pollution you have great views to all direction from under the tower. So we didn't go up to the tower because the view was amazing enough from the hill.For couples: There are plenty of places where to put a lock with your names or even a picture of you."
Just another tower,"Seoul N tower is just other tower, where you can see the view of the city. When we came, it was drizzling, and sky was cloudy and so we could not see much. in my view eventhoug it was a pefect sunny day, the view was ok, nothing special. But they were very creative with the padlocks that visitors put on the fence and places, that create interesting decorations."
Fun family activity,"Our family really enjoyed going to Seoul Tower. The cable car ride was a fun experience in itself, although they definitely crowd people in it. There's also no AC so if you are hot and/or claustrophobic you may just want to walk up the mountain trail. Once at the top, there are shops and cafes. You can also buy a lock to write your name on and hang on one of the many fences, railings, trees, etc. that are around the park. The tower itself had a fun elevator ride with a video that plays as you ascend and descend. The views were great, even for a smoggy afternoon. We spent the 12,000 won for a souvenir photo because why not?! If you happen to go when it's not insanely hot or rainy, the park at the base of the tower is a really nice area to picnic, jog, or just people watch."
Mr,It is a beautiful place to spend time with your lover. We watched the sunset an took photos of the night of Seoul city. There are public eye transport to and from the N Seoul Tower. But the waiting time for bus is about 20 mins.
Very romantic place,"I liked this place and atmosphere, there are lots of padlocks of lovers. We went there by cableway, I guess it''s quite difficult go by foot, but there is a nice park and a great view, so if you have enough time and energy better go by foot, because there is a big quite on the cableway and a lot of people in a cabin. The tower didn't inmates on me because it's not very high, but view is nice and it's an interesting idea with signs of cities and destinations to them on windows. "
Nice place to visit,The view from the tower is excellent! This is one high ground area every tourist should visit. The best way to get here is to walk through the park. Taking a tourist bus to this location spoils the ambiance!
Beautiful Tower,"I'm sure that people focus on the view from the top tower which is spectacular, especially at night. The trip up the cable car is awesome. The grounds around the bottom of the tower are very pretty and offer similar views without the dirty glass view from the top. It's fun to look around at all the padlocks which is creating fun and interesting shapes. This is the thing. The tower its self viewed from a distance and up close looking up at it is stunning. The added bonus for us was the half mile walk up from the subway which was beautiful, offered great views, and some great restaurants along the way."
First time in seoul,N seoul tower vert recomended place for tourist to take picture & experience ride by cable car to the top of N seoul tower.
Please take the cable car!,"We were stupidly enough to try to climb up from Namsan to N Seoul Tower back in April, but please take the cable car instead. The experience was okay, the tower itself was ok, things were pricey in there. The only thing that avoided me to have a good time was the crowd. It was very crowded and I was there in April around 6pm to night.It was a nice view from up there though."
Fun with pop corns and drinks,"This is a must visit to me, it was very cold in the winter season,windy but we had fun just hang out at the tower and bought a package that comes with pop corns and drinks.  We took a cable car as it was quite late if we walked from Namsan Park.There were lots of people with family and also couples there to enjoy the view from above."
Is ok ,"It is a nice place to visit, nothing out of the ordinary, mostly if you compare it with other of its kind, but it is definitely worth going as it is a landmark of seoul.You get a very nice view of the city if is a nice day, if it is a rainy or cloudy day it is not worth to go at all since you wont be able to se anything.The entrance fee is very good price and it includes drinks and pop corn for 21000 hkd for 2 person ( note that the pop corn and drinks is one big of each to be shared with the 2 persons )Have in mind that from the subway station myeong-dong exit 3 there is a free shuttel that takes you to the entrance of the cable car that takes to the tower. "
Okay..,It's not that tall. but you can see the city. and you need to climb a lot of stairs just to get to this tower as it is located in a hill
Good place for couples ,"If u r in a relationship, this place is recommended for you. The place can bring great memorable with the beautiful scenery & the ""Couple Lock"" that hold you together. However if u r single like me, u still can enjoyed the place with family or friends. The lock is available for everyone & every kind of wishes. "
Nice Walk - views not great,"A nice walk up from Myeong Dong (about 40 mins slow pace). Lovely restaurant half way as well as a gym. At the top they are building a mall with restaurants, a mini zoo and a really cool 3D viewing platform. Even on a good day, views are clouded with pollution but it's very green and pretty up there. Often cultural exhibitions from 3-4. "
Fabulous lunch at the N Grill revolving restaurant which gave free entrance to the N Tower,"We spent the best part of a day, walking up to the N Tower, enjoying the free cultural experiences that were offered at the base of the tower and then the fabulous, unrushed set priced meal whilst taking in the amazing views over Seoul and beyond. Lunch prices are considerably cheaper than the evening meal which made this an affordable and very special treat."
Beautiful walk up the hill,My daughter was looking forward to see this place and it did not disappoint. We walked up instead of taking the cable car. It was a good walk. The view is great. 
Interesting experience...,"I'm in two minds about N Seoul Tower; while the actual location is really quite cool, the tower experience itself was a tad underwhelming. By the time you get to the tower proper, you are already high above the city and going up to the observation deck does not really add to the overall experience. If I go again, I would stick to the restaurants on the main concourse for a beer or a snack, even the Family Mart for a cold Hite and a bag of Kimchi potato chips at one of the picnic tables is quite OK, and forego the observation deck part. Access is via a short, but steep walk from the bus parking lot and takes 15 minutes or so; should be no problem unless you have mobility issues. There is no direct access to the concourse at the tower itself by bus or taxi. As always in Korea, there are lots of immaculate washrooms close by."
Forever waiting!!!!!!!!!,"I have been to the tower in Osaka, Tokyo, Shanghai, Macau, Hong Kong, this made us to wait the longest ..... First you ll have to wait 30mins to BUY a cable car ticket, then another 30mins to get on the cable car, the cable car a box for at least 30 standing people ... , somehow, the cable car travel was short.. Just able 5mins... But it's not the end ... We will have to walk to the top of a small hill , line up for buying tower ticket again, which is short , 10mins I guess, then we start the 20mins waiting for getting up into "" waiting line for the elevator"" ( there is only one elevator operating) ... So another 15mins for line to get on the elevator.... Even going back down.. We waited 15mins in the tower and 30mins for the cable car... Make a cal... 2 hours plus spent just on waiting ..."
Good,A nice place to see Seoul cityview and lock the love key for couples. But i can't found special thing inside the tower. It will better to reach the tower bu cablecar than by walk.
Neat but underwhelming,"Fun for a little outing. Some restaurants and shops. The view is neat from the tower but overall nothing mind blowing. Still, this is a must do for any visitor or resident of Seoul. It is a good romantic spot, so bring a padlock to place on the designated ""trees"" by the tower."
Date Site,I went once with friends and once with my significant other. Expect a lot of couples in the evening and enjoy the great view. Try to go on a clear day! The night and day view are both great.
excellent view of the city,"We took the cable car going to the tower to save some time lol. Really loved the place. It was kinda crowded when we went there since it was on a Sunday. Really loved the love locks too. I must go back when I get a boyfriend one day lol. Did not have the opportunity to go inside the tower and the teddy bear museum, since my and my friend were on a tight budget."
Walk up but be rested,"I thought I'd walk up vs take the cable car ... It's quite a hike up the many many stairs, so get ready for some exercise ... But there are these mango popsicles you can get at the top so that helps !"
Really amazing.,"The view of the city is superf from this point. You must go there at the evening, taking advantage of the sunset and the night view. The price is not expansive taking into account the view. You can use a cable car to get the N Tower, which is the best way to go there. The price is about 12€ (Cable car + N Tower). There is a Queue that you must win before reach the tower, which lasts about 60 minutes."
Great Experience,Definitely a must see if in the core Seoul area. We were excited to take the cable car up and leave our love locks.
Day and night visit 2 separate trips ,There are three option to go to the top of mountain. 1-cable car 2-bus no 2& 53- walk/hike approx 1400m climb. If you have already been in a cable car I reckon take the track. Because on the way up there are couple of nice place to see and photo island where you can take photos of city skyline. The track will take approx 30-40 mins. Wear comfortable clothes and trainers and in case take an umbrella as rainy season. Both views are good the day and night . But if you don't have time and only can visit one time then please go around 6pm so you can see the city skyline at night too as Sun sets at 8pm. To go to the observatory the ticket is 10k won and you need to wait like 30 mins or more on weekends. There are plenty to facilities for snacks and food up there. 
Stunned!,"My husband and I enjoyed the view at the top of N Tower . I was stunned to see city of Seoul at night . We've used a telescope and saw the buildings clearly from afar . In the end , we felt so attached with the place and promised to come back very soon."
Wonderful view of Seoul ,"It is a wonderful experience to watch the city from the tower top... it has small shopping area and you can look for memento and gifts..the sky scrapers of Seoul, the river and the lush greenery are all a sight to see. For those looking for a sight seeing holiday Seoul could be an option "
Nice night view from N tower,"It was so nice to reach to the top of the tower, i recommend you go at night to see the view. It was much more exciting. I bought the ticket from TravoAsia, just search it online or mobile app. they offer better discount. They seems focus on Korea and JP only at the moment. Anyway, i believe its worth to check out. Good Luck "
"Magical views, and they give you popcorn!","It was a cold winter's night in Seoul, and after an evening out walking through the street markets (also a lot of fun, the food!!!) we thought that we may as well go and check out the tower.There is a gondola ride you can take to get up the hill which has some pretty awesome views all by itself. At the top there are a few stores and some neat old buildings. The whole place has a really magical feeling to it. The lighting was beautiful, and looking back out over the city was just breathtaking.The view from the tower was even better, and a tub of popcorn was included in the ticket price.The perfect way to cap off a really great night in Seoul."
"Good view of the city, but better at evening/night","We took the dinner package and had our afternoon meal at the North tower. It is better to be here during the sunset as Seoul is quite smoggy during the day, so it is hard to get the complete view of the city. There are lines for both the tram going up and down, and also for the elevator up in the tower.. so do exepect some waiting time. The food is overpriced, but remember that you are mostly paying for the view."
Disappointing due to service & facilities,A tower with no elevator facility for disabled from the parking for them should not be operating until it offers the facility! Service staff were not warm and their English skill was very poor. Not a pleasant experience.
Amazing view of Seoul,Well worth the effort - panoramic views over Seoul. Reasonably priced mementos. Night or day view - both quite spectacular.
Spectacular View and So Much Love!,"N Seoul Tower or Namsan Tower is a must destination for lovers due to their famous love locks, similar with those in France. Though, these are not the only one that attracts every tourist and locals alike. It gives you the opportunity to have a glimpse of Seoul. Being in the peak, the observatory of the tower would definitely give you a scenery to remember!"
Great place to visit,"So many things to do! There are a lot of restaurants, so many angles to see the city, and if you go lower to the park, there are lots of places to exercise, chill, see. It is impossible to do all in just one visit! "
"Nice hike, beautiful view of Seoul","After a lot of stairs and many hills, you finally reach the top of Seoul. tower. The view is breathtaking. You can see all of Seoul. Make sure to bring a lock so that you can leave A message on it and place it on one of the fences. "
Nice place ,It's a food place to check out the panorama view of seoul city from the top. Lots of good food available there and the hike is surreal. 
N Seoul Tower,"1. nice place to visit with love ones, but go there during off peak period as there were too many people during summer.2. another thing to highlight is the car park - there is not enough of parking lots.3. signage of new/additional tourist highlight (if any) so that we can look out for it when we are at N Seoul Tower.4. overall a nice experience."
Awesome workout!,"Don't wait in the lines or pay for all the tickets. Hike up that sucker. The pathway is gorgeous and along the way the Koreans will pass you in skirts and sandals, with babies and children strapped to their backs.Up top, there's plenty to eat, see and do! To go all the way up to the very top, it was 50,000 won per person to get a ticket and eat. We decided to use that cash to buy a cute lock and eat tons food. Better than the palace changing of the guards, in my opinion. "
Just like every tower,"It's good to see Seoul from N Seoul Tower, but it's just like other towers in other countries. You should expect 1-2 hours of queueing if you come here during peak season. Make sure you don't come when it's cloudy to get the best view."
Great view ,"The tower sits right inside of Namsan Park, which is beautiful. Getting to the top can be interesting. After a few miscalculations we wound up taking the stairs. Don't take the stairs if you are not ready for a good hike. The tower is 1650 meters from the bottom of the stairs. The ascent is about 30-40 stories. I would probably recommend the cable car, which can be accessed through the Myeandong subway exit, or you can take a city bus and get dropped off at the cable car station. The tower gives a great view of Seoul and really shows you how large the city is. It cost about 10,000 won to go up. "
"Namsan (N Seoul) Tower, Seoul","The N. Seoul Tower (also known as the Namsan Tower or Seoul Tower), is a communication and observation tower. At 236m, it marks the highest point in Seoul. It was built in 1969. The tower is excellent for photography and provides a panoramic view the city. The tower is divided into three main parts, including the N Lobby, N Plaza, and the N Tower. The N Plaza consists of two floors, while the N Tower includes four floors. Situated on the Roof Terrace (N. Plaza) is a spacious wooden viewing deck and this is an area where courting couples snap ""Locks of Love,"" onto the wire fencing. There are literally thousands of padlocks attached to the fence and this is meant to symbolize the couple’s undying affection. Once you get up there you can visit the Tower or just stay below and relax. You can still get amazing views without going up the Tower."
Go when it's clear and also at night,It's a nice walk up to the cable cars which will take you to the tower. It's very crowded up the top and you have to pay to go up to the observatory (extra to the cable car ticket). There is a bit to do up there though so highly recommend visiting to see how vast Seoul is. Go during the day and at night.
Nice view,"You'll have the opportunity to see the city from above. The elevator was really fast. Good photo opportunity there, although it is a bit crowded."
Nice View of city,very high. It has lift facility as well along with stairs. It needs 40 mins to go to top from stairs. You can enjoy nice view of city. Very high.
lots to see up there,Make sure you take the sideways elevator to go up and down to the cable car instead of walking all the way around like we mistakenly did. At the base of the tower there is plenty of food and things to see. Bring some locks to hang - that was fun for our kids. We ate at an awesome restaurant at the first place where there are locks before getting up to the main base. It had an awesome view and great tonkasu and omerice. 
"Misty view, commercial experience","The best part about this was getting to the base of the tower and soaking up the romantic atmosphere. The love locks are quite a spectacle added to by the love seats. There is a whole new entertainment complex with 3D display, LED tunnel and photo pith with the stars. Quite kitsch and touristy but good for families and young couples to explore. Going up the tower was a quick elevator ride distracted by music and overhead movie. The tower observation deck itself is sparse populated with money making sweet shops and touristy stuff. The views are limited due to foggy misty pollution. Go downstairs where there are better explanations of the views before taking elevator back down. This whole part can be skipped as views are goodnight enough from base of the tower. Best thing about it is the people watching. "
Go early morning or late afternoon during summer,Easy to find walking route from Myeongdong. Was quite hot when we went at 2pm. Bring your own locks of you don't want to pay 8000won onwards to commemorate your visit. 
N Seoul Tower,Nice view but a bit folky during our visited on June 20. Love Padlock can found along the way upstairs that represent commitment and love between two people.
Amazing view,"I climbed til the tower through the stairs as a goal. You can use the cable car too to go up. but when u go by yourself and with energy and time, to go through the stairs is a good excercise with the opportunity to have an amazing view from the city without mirrors. The best is to go during the sunset, it is so beautiful. You can buy drinks before going up."
Nice view,"We arrived here on a sunny day, thus the scenery from the tower was really clear. We had coffee at the cafe on the observatory level and spent time admiring Seoul from bird's eye."
You have to see this,We took the cable car up and walked down. I wouldn't recommend walking up unless you were really fit. The cable car was busy and crowded and if you're a bit claustrophobic like me you just hold your breath for the duration of the trip. It's a very popular tourist place with great views of the city. But once you've done it you've done it and you don't have to do it again.
Excellent View,The place gives you the vantage point view of the city. Great photo opportunity especially near the gardens and the love locks area. 
Romantic,Fell in love with the view of Seoul. The night lights are awesome. The locks are very romantic. There are already many things to do there and many places you can eat at.
I'm on the Top of Seoul,This is my very first time visiting the N Seoul Tower. It is a beautiful place for tourists and there's a new shopping area coming. Although it is pretty crowded but still worth going. It is easy to reach because you just have to take the subway and walk around 10 mins to get to Namshan Park. Remember to take the cable car because the view is pretty dope! There's a love lock bridge that couples write their wishes on the lock then lock it on the bridge. Good for them~
Crowded but spectacular view of the city and surrounding areas,"Can be a bit crowded (our wait to ride the aerial tram was 60 minutes), but there are various ways to get up the hill to the bottom of N Seoul Tower so if the wait is too long for your taste seek other options including hiking. The tram ride has brilliant views from the car as you ascend to the top of the hill. The best views are actually from the back of the car looking back down at the north side of the city and hillsides. The front of the car has views of the tower which you will see soon enough. Once at the base of the tower, you once again have to pay to ride the elevator to the viewing area up top. The views from the base are amazing and if you are looking to save some money, this will be enough for some great photographs and 360* views of the city. Especially beautiful at sunset. There are shops and a few places to eat and get drinks. We at at the burger restaurant and was quite good with reasonable prices. We opted to go to the top and got there just before sunset. It was crowded as it was a Saturday, but the views were worth it. Watching the sky turn colors and the lights of the city brightening was unforgettable. We bought a lock at the souvenir shop, added a personal touch with the pen given and attached it to one of the Lock-trees at the top (you have to see them to understand). It was a unique way to remember the moment and one we really enjoyed."
Magnificent,Must see place the view is breathtaking also the park is amazing the view is a must see. The restaurants are all good. This is an amazing place
N Seoul tower,"There is distance going there .so if there are children n elderly, might need to take cab there .Cable car ticket reasonable. View/scenery are awesome Fresh air Overall good "
Can't beat the view,This is truly an important part of Seoul's personality and history but honestly you can't beat the view from the top. If you want to really understand the size and layout of this city get yourself up to the top of the tower. The cable car goign up in an excellent choice but walking takes about 45 minutes at a slow pace - just head to jimjilbang after to clean up and you've got the perfect day.Make sure you try and see the performers at the top doing weapons displays and traditional music + dance. It's free in the open courtyard and fun to watch with some popcorn from near the elevator :)
"The geographical centre of Seoul, with great city views","You can walk, take the cable car or a shuttle bus to reach the top of the mountain on which Seoul Tower was erected.It's often hazy, but the views are nevertheless worth the climb. Buy a love lock and put it on the railings on the viewing platforms like thousands of visitors before.The observation deck of the Tower can be accessed for a fee."
Night tour spot,You should go this with your lover not just firendsat the night time you can see fantastic night view
Good views but the journey is more interesting,"The views from the tower are good but I found that the journey to the tower was more interesting. There are buses that take you to the tower but I caught the cable car to get up. You then pass by the locks of love on which people write messages of love. Once you get to the top, I found that you can walk around the tower very quickly. A package deal can be bought so that you can go to the Alive Museum which is fun if you have two or more people.If you want to buy a souvenir, my advice is to purchase it from the gift shop downstairs because items are cheaper than the shop in the tower. I guess it costs money to get the items up to the top! I got off a the Chungmuro subway station and walked up to the cable car."
nice view,"Extremely crowded on weekend nights, as it is a popular dating spot for local couples. Waiting time for the cable car was 40 min. at around 22:00 on a Saturday night. But the view on the illuminated city was worth it! "
The lovers locks were the most interesting part,"Perhaps the cloudy June day dampened the experience for us, but we made the most of our time. We took the cable car and spent some time with the lovers locks on top. We also took the combo ticket to the top of the tower which was an overpriced experience, particularly given the overcast day. Next time might suggest cable car up and walk down."
Beautiful view,The Seoul Tower is a nice attraction of Seoul. The ticket costs around 10 dollars and the view of the entire cityis amazing!
Landmark of Seoul,A good view of the city from here. You can get the cable car and then walk to the tower. There are many attractions one of which is the LOCKS OF LOVE were people hang locks as a teen of their eternal love. Many souvenir shops selling the locks.
Love Locks,"A pretty place to visit. Take a picture of the numerous locks - it looks like Christmas Trees with colorful decors. I heard the Burgers there is good, but did not have time to check it out. Maybe next visit will do that."
Romantic and Beautiful Tower at Seoul,"Namsan tower is a very beautiful place to visit at night, especially for couple, you will be impressed with the scenery, we can see seoul city view from the top of the tower. You can put a lock love in a place that has been provided, a very romantic place and suitable for taking photos. If you are korea drama addicted, you must be love this place. It's good for you do not until late at night, around 10 pm there are no public bus, but you can use the cable car with a very long queue. You can visit the website korea tourism organization, to get a discounted admission."
better visit in the morning,"visited seoul tower at night time as its my only free time. though paying less for entrance for night time, the view from the top would be better appreciated in the daytime. the cable car is too crowded. i hope they make one for smaller groups also and not just lump all tourist at one go. waiting time is reasonable. the place is super clean and nice place to have photos taken ! "
Beautiful place to see the city and traditions,"I was here during the weekend and there were folk dances and sings, very impressive for foreigners. I saw samurai dances, I've listened the famous ""Arirang"" song."
Breathtaking view,"If you want to see great views of Seoul, Seoul Tower is a MUST to go attraction. Standing proudly above the city it offers breathtaking panoramic views of the City. It gets a bit chilly in the evening there due to mountains hight, so better have hoodie or jacket with you ☺ "
It is a romantic place,"I would recommend to buy the couple tickets with soft drink and popcorn and it is value for money. Also you could go there around 5-7pm that you can see the both view of sunset and night. I extremely love the gift shop, the most of product were so cute. "
Slow Q and nothing interesting,Went up by the cable car and waited for at least 30min for each trip so spent at least 60mins in total. Nothing to see and the love locks idea is silly. Impressed that the local people used the park for exercising. It's looks tough o walk up so many fleets of stairs.
A glimpse of Seoul city from the height,"It lays in Namsan Hill with spectacular view of Seoul city. Wish to see visit it again at night.There's a place for love locks where couple can buy locks and write their names on it and lock it on fences or provided public fixture, to wish love endurance and happiness as so they believe.There's a cafe and souvenir shop, so if you tired of walking up you can take a rest for a while. Probably because I was so excited, I did not feel exhausted. Just want to maximize my time before the travel ended since it's only short visit.Next time will bring my family to pay a visit again."
Long queue,"Very dirt window of tower. When you look for night view. Indoor lighting is brighten than outside as there is a souvenir shop. You can't really to enjoy view. Besides, take long queue for cable car. If you travel with baby and stroller. The staff only let mother and baby to take elevator and father to queue in separate line. Staff cannot speaks in English for explanation. It is really poor service."
"If you like views from high places, it is well worth it.","The cable car ride to the top is fairly short, but I enjoyed it, I always do though. I enjoyed traveling over the heavily treed park and raising higher over the city. At the top it is a bit of a climb up stairs to the tower, but I took my time and took photos of the millions of love locks attached to fences & structures made for the purpose.There are plenty of over priced locks for sale too. I suggest if you want to put a lock there, take your own, then it will be different from all the others. Maybe.They have a good idea for the elevator lift to the top of the tower, something a little different, but I won't spoil it by telling you. There are the usual shops and restaurants.At the base of the tower, around the other side is a Starbucks, but it is a little hard to find.A short walk downhill to a nice bus stop with a small convenience store and plenty of seating, and you can catch a but to another part of town to explore."
Nice area to visit,Generally too touristy but if you're lucky you can get in when it's quiet and enjoy some performances. Even at the bottom you have some great views of Seoul so don't feel like you need to go all the way to the observatory deck to have a view! I usually walk down to Myeongdong area from the Cable Car entrance via the horizontal elevator. Can do the same going up if you want to save on taxi fare.
N Seoul Tower - must visit,"I can see the Tower from my hotel and it was very close to get there. I took the cable car as it was very steep to climb! Really like the cable car as it gives you a very good view while going up and down. Once you get up there you can visit the Tower or just stay below and relax. You can still get amazing views without going up the Tower. :)When I arrive at 11am, they had free to try traditional costumes which was great! They gave you 5 mins to take photos etc.I also had korean all you eat buffet for $16,000 WON within the Tower itself on level 4 I think. No seafood though but it was good and there were many koreans there. No tourist though which was weird. hehe... :)I didn't go at night. Next time when I visit Korea, i will go at night to see the lights!"
Nice night view ,"We took the free glass Namsan Oreumi elevator (accommodates 20 people) to the Namsan Mountain Cable Car Station to go from the base of Namsan Mountain to N Seoul Tower. We went after a whole day shopping and were delighted to find lockers at the cable car ticket office. The staff there was very helpful.Cable car costed 8,500 won per person (return tickets) and it took just a short while to wait for a cable car (accommodates up to 48 people). After the cable car ride and walking a short flight of stairs you will arrive at the roof terrace. You can see padlocks and lovers everywhere. We also went up to the Observatory in the tower. It was 10,000 per person. The night view of the city from the Observatory was pretty."
Lovely experience ,Seoul is amazing!People are so kind and respectful on top of that it is very safe. Getting up to the Tower was a fun experience. Everywhere we went people were friendly kind helpful and loved showing us around. 
Fun,"Was great! Awesome views! But it's worth it the money for the cable car. It's a steep hike up, so it's hard if you aren't use to walking a long way. "
Beautiful view of city,"It is very beautiful place. The view of the city is quite breathtaking. They have 360 degrees glass walls offering a good view, however the inside is very brightly lit, so good luck taking any bird eye photos in the night! However, I presume it would be good before/during sunset. The love-locks area is also quite good. Overall recommended place."
Dissapointing,It looks good till the time you reach the top. The excitement in the cable car and the temple before the entry is quite dramatic and raises your expectation. But once you are on the top and with the stunning view of the city - is totally spoilt with the bright neon light and absolutely not possible to take any picture. Its a total waste if you plan to visit the place to take some good picture. This is in the evening - I am not sure what happens in the day time though.
N Seoul Tower,"by day, its just a tall tower. by night, its lighted up and so can we viewed from far away. you can either take the cable car or public bus to go up the fill. for us, we took bus #2 in front of grand ambassador seoul hotel. you can use your t-money card to pay for the ride. most famous would be the thousands of locks which couples write notes on and then locked them on the structures provided. view from the top is also spectacular. good for our photographers friends. there are restaurants up there but during our trip, as we were there late (around 9.30pm), most of the restaurants are closed.if you want to view from the observatory, you need to pay an entrance fee."
Wonderful View on a Nice Clear Day,"We went up to the tower to have dinner at the NGrill at the top of the Tower but we looked around the base first prior to taking the elevator to the observation deck. Lots of nice views and a huge area at the base of the tower where traditional Korean folk dancers performed. We boarded the elevator and hung out on the observation deck which gives you a 360 degree view of the greater Seoul metropolitan area. You can see the Blue House (Korea's version of our White House), The World Cup Stadium and the world's 5th largest building in the world at Lotte World to mention a few of the sights you can see on a clear day. After looking around we headed up to the NGrill which was one level up from the observation deck for our dinner reservation. We had a fantastic dinner while the restaurant rotated. The dinner is scheduled for about 1 hour and 50 minutes which is roughly the time your table will make the complete 360 rotation to take in all the views of Seoul. I highly recommend this place for anyone that goes to Seoul.Everything you do at the base of the tower is free but to ride up to the observation deck requires buying a ticket unless you have dinner reservations at Ngrill. This will always be a special place as I proposed to my now fiancée in front of her family while dining at Ngrill. One other item of note is that you can take a bus up the mountain to the base of the tower or you can walk up it. This is a popular place for people to jog up and down and to hit some of the exercise equipment along the way. There is also a cable car you can take to the top as well as back down. You can also walk back down or take a bus back down the mountain. Seoul Tower is pretty much in the heart of Seoul and right above Itaweon which is a popular foreigner area to hang out in for dining, pubs or dancing."
Great View,"Take bus(or gondola from mingdong) to the peak and must go the top of tower for great view, but the museum not worth money, even if they come with the set ticket. Btw, if you want, you could buy the locker form vendor to lock on the wall, would be interesting finding next time :) we did last year, and it's take us 45 mins to find it..... how lucky we are!!and last but not least, better go the afternoon, one hour before sunset, enjoy the view from different three."
The View Was Worth Every Effort - A Walk Through,"There are many things to do and places to visit in Seoul, but I think N Seoul Tower should be on everyone's list, especially if you're a visitor. It's the only place that offers a 360-degree view of the entire city from that height. But, how much you enjoy it will depend largely on how successful you are at actually getting up to the top. Here, I'll walk you through the best way to ensure you have a great experience and make the most of your time.First thing is to go during the weekdays, not the weekend. I made that mistake the first time I tried going 2 years ago, and I was not successful. The line for the cable car is simply too long, with locals pouring in, especially in the evening. This time around, I went on a Wednesday, late afternoon. Second, don't bother taking the mini elevator that brings you to the cable car station. It's a complete waste of time waiting for it and you can take the stairs to the cable car in 10 minutes with a bit of legwork. Once you get to the cable car station, I would recommend buying a roundtrip ticket, because you'll likely want to take the cable car back down the mountain (unless you want to hike it down). At this point, assuming there isn't a gigantic line out the door, it's just a matter of waiting in line for the cable car and enjoying the ride up. When you get to the top of the mountain, you still have to make your way up to the tower and then buy another ticket for entry. Before going into the tower, though, I would recommend taking some time to walk around the platform and take some pictures from the landing.Once you're on the observation deck of the tower, you're free to take as much time as you want to look around. My goal was to see the sunset from up there, and if your's is too, then you better be prepared to stake your spot on the appropriate side of the tower. Many other visitors will be thinking the same thing. Pro-tip: there's a level below the main observation deck that has fewer people and virtually the same view (though the windows look a bit dirtier). A good choice if you want to avoid the crowds...and it can get pretty crowded pretty fast in the evening.I took my time (spent 4 hours up there) and got the shots I wanted, but if you're satisfied after an hour or two, I would say make your way down because you'll have to get in line for the cable car again. The closer it is to closing time, the longer the line gets, so plan accordingly. I waited in a fairly long line for about 20-30 minutes to take it back down the mountain.There is an alternative to the cable car, and that's trekking up the mountain. If you have time, it's actually a pleasant climb (I made it half way up the first time). You can also take a bus, but I have no experience with that. Overall, it's a really nice and unique place to check out, whether it be a date or photography session or just sightseeing. Make sure to plan ahead and you'll have a great experience."
Spectacular View,"A friend and I were in Itaewon and randomly decided to walk up to Seoul Tower. Once we reached the Grand Hyatt, we cut through the park and followed the signs/paths/steps to the paved bus lanes and walked the remainder of the way up.Making it to the top and seeing the view was well worth the effort. There's restaurants, shopping, and plenty of snacks to be purchased once you make it to the tower. If you want to go into the spire, you have to come out of pocket.We decided to take a cable car down the opposite side of the mountain and cabbed it back to Itaewon later that evening.Great experience, but I can't say it's something I'd do often."
"as you are in Seoul,it's worth visiting","An usual tower you find in any modern city but it's worth visiting as you are already in Seoul.You may walk up hill to the tower or ride a cable car.preferred walking.Do not buy the photo sold on the gate,it's costly and umworthy.Beautiful scenes around including skyscrapers. Take a few photogrph from top."
"Good visitor handling capability, variety of souvenirs, breath taking view of Seoul","They manage to keep visitors to que in line and crowds move smoothly even though there were thousands of vistors coming through out the day. The souvenirs offered were affordable, nice and have variety of selection. Those who have knee-joint problems are not advise to visit this place as you need to walk up the hill which is quite high for an average person to reach the tower entrance. "
Leave it to the locals,Its a very steep walk up the hill to the tower but if you can afford the 90 minute wait you can take the aerial cable car. Give the tower a miss and explore the delights of the extensive parklands as you stroll back down to the city.
we did not go up to the tower itself,"WE took the cable car in the evening so as to catch the sunset view, it was a bit hazy so we called off going up the tower, nevertheless at the foot of the tower you still get a pretty good view of the city, the restaurants were also reasonably priced so we ate there. We had no problem hailing a taxi on the way down as our initial fear was that there were too many tourists like us who went there on our own."
High Place,We can see a whole view of Seoul. Especially at night. It is also a nice place for a couple visiting for a better relation.
Be fit or don't go!,"You park at the beginning of a 'walk from Hell' up a VERY steep road to reach the Tower. Take your time and the view from the top is lovely. The night we visited, there were a ridiculous number of people there, and the platform you stand on to view the city lights has a few steps (small) going up, which can't be seen in the dark. Very dangerous, and a trip hazard. The fence is covered with love locks, which should be removed on a regular basis, as they will weaken the fence. City lights..."
saw as part of tour,A day trip exploring seoul took us to the tower and many palacesRecommended the lifts in the tower lead to a good view without much walking
Don't go on a Saturday night!,"Great views, but super crowded on the weekends, so if you go then plan to stand in line for up to 45 minutes in each directions, on the tram and again for the elevator. Buy a lock to add your love link to the massive display! Nice little restaurant and bar at the top if you want to linger."
amazing cherry blossoms,i went there at spring time and you can see amazing cherry blossom everywhere...they also have little tulips garden that not to be missed...maybe the only thing that matter is too crowded of buses that park...
Nice panoramic Seoul city from top ,"It cost about 22,000 won to go on top of the tower and it comes with free drink n big size popcorn. They offers few packages tower tour. There will be a mini studio for photo session at the entrance, u can buy ur photo 1pc at 12k won and 2pcs for 15k won. They have 3 michelin star restaurant but u have to booking online to dine in. There's no much different of panoramic view from the bottom and top of the tower. Countless of love lock hanging on the wall of a terrace attached to the tower. You can buy the love lock from souvenir shop but its very expensive. We get to the tower by bus. It was heavy rain and windy so they closed the cable car and the hiking trail as well. Nothing much we can do, it was too cold and raining. Maybe summer is the best time to visit N tower."
"Decent Sights, but not exactly worth the trip up.","Getting on the tower requires either robust legs/ vehicular transport/ paying for and squeezing inside a cable car.Atop the tower, you have to pay to get on the observation deck, and worse, its nothing much to see on a cloudy day..."
towering seoul,a very romantic place in seoul. one of the highest place in the city.. lovelocks are the best. perfect for picture takings and breathless views. awesome seoul tower!!
Hiking and views,Just to remind please get prepare to get your self fit b4 visit.Kindly wear good sport shoes .... There are many alternatives way to climb up to tower..by bus (ramainya org)...hiking for sure...Try to buy tower ticket using promotion korea tourism might be a lot of discount....happy visiting
Love lock,"Use cable car round tour for 8,500 won. Should be more beautiful during night view...not really must can see and many peoples"
Fantastic views,One can have fantastic views of Seoul from N Seoul tower on a sunny day and night. It is located on the top of the mountain. 
Nice Place to see the city skyline,"The area is a well maintained and clean park/tourist area where you could eat Korean food, view the city on the highest level of the tower."
A romantic pilgrimage,"N Seoul Tower is a romantic pilgrimage for those who are sensitive to the finer aspects of the human life, It seems the authorities of Seoul Tower encourage people to leave locks in the premises propagating “Eternal love” an intoxicating emotion which gives up all the insecurities of physical existence. Love locks of all shapes and sizes are left around there. A worthy place to visit, as it tranquillizes the mind with scenic beauty of the place as well as the message it conveys. Best way to reach N Seoul Tower is the Namsan Cable Car. To reach the Cable car, take the subway line 4 (light blue) to the Myeongdong station, take exit 7 or 8 and you will reach in front of an office building/bank. Wait here for the free shuttle that will take us to the cable car station. "
A must activity for Tourists in Seoul,"I love this attraction. Whether you want to hike up, there are many routes with stairs and real climbs or take the tram the view is amazing. This is a perfect activity for visitors. There are some touristy things like caricatures, locking a love lock and taking selfies, but there are also amazing views of the city. The look outs help you see how big Seoul is and all the restaurants have great views. There are a few shops and restaurants. On some days and times there are cultural performances. This is a must activity for tourists to Seoul."
Nice view of Seoul,N Seoul Tower provides a good 360 view of Seoul. I am happy to note that they now have an elevator which will be helpful if you have seniors on the trip who are on wheelchairs.
Awesome view of Seoul,The view is awesome! Nice gift shop and restaurants to spend a little money. There is more than just going up in the tower but the view from the observation deck is breathtaking. 
An interesting visit,Our itinerary was tailored to our preferences with my friend suggestions at South Korea.I think it's more beautiful in the evening.
Special place!,"We went twice, once in evening, the last in afternoon. All are awesome! The tower is very crowded, it is difficult to take a photo in there. The view is amazing and the air is natural!"
Beautiful moments in the N Seoul Tower,"It was one of my favorite moments. We were lucky, the weather was perfect. Not too cold and not too hot. Good place with family, with friends or even solo. "
Great atmosphere,That place was amazing and great atmosphere. We loved taking telephreak up to the tower. The area up was awesome the coffee shops there are lovely and also the food shops I give them two thumbs up. You will find the 3D monitor which was a great experience we saw the show two times . Locks of love ❤️ loved.
Daytime view is great just wanted to stay up there until it turn darkto see the city lights,"I have seen so many K Dramas that mentioned this place or showed it that I just had to go and see it myself. Yhe place is truly amazing. Some posted on my Facebook page that those were beautiful flowers, when they saw the picture I posted of the monument of love locks. You will have judge for yourself. Sorry I'm all over the pictures I like taking selfies. Note: it's not just for young people but families and especially older folks and it's wheelchair accessible as well. You don't have to climb the mountain to get up there. Next time I go I will go up on the cable car and come down walking. Beware there are a lot of stairs."
Visit N Seoul tower in the night,We visited this place in the night. It is open till 10.30 PM. We didn't get a chance to go up to the observatory as it was extremely crowded. But all other spots at N Seoul Tower are beautiful and the view of the city from the top is beautiful.There are a couple of restaurants on top. You can trek one way and take the cable car the other way. 
A great view of the city of Seoul,"A great place to visit especially with the family and also if it is one of your first visits to the city. We visited during the day but I can gather that the view at night it would be even more spectacular. Well kept and reasonably priced, and clean, clean, clean! And Koreans are so personable, courteous, nice, well educated! I love Korea :)"
Mesmerizing night time view of Seoul,"Visit the N Seoul Tower at night for maximum impact. It offers a beautiful view of the city lights. Good food options also, although I found that they close a bit early. N Seoul Tower can easily be reached by exiting Myeongdong station and taking the Ormi or elevated lift to the base of the Namsan Cable Car. At night queues for the cable car either going up or coming down can run long so budget time for that accordingly."
Best views in Seoul!,Great views atop this tower. There is also a candy store and they have signage on the windows indicating how far different cities are. Fun and entertaining.
A good experience but noit too exciting,"My visit to the tower was pleasant enough though the waiting time to get to the tower was quite long. I enjoyed the opportunity to have photos taken in traditional garb (albeit overpriced), but overall, it was not a very exciting tour."
Spectacular. ,We saw it from a distance and as we got closer the sheer grandeur of it became apparent. It is an epic structure and worth seeing if you are in the area. I love super structures and I am amazed by the architecture. The surrounding area is very nice and it's worth a trip if you have the time. 
A must see,"Morning time is rhe best time to see the N towerIt shows all seoul . And while you there you can try some of the perfect options they offer , there is a wood laser machine that print picture on a peace of woodYou can take a picture by your self over tgere or by the help of the other people , but i recomend that you use an old picture you like the most The prices not that muchThere is also an italian resturant Thire pizza is a must try "
Love Keys,"If you have been to other tall buildings like 101 in Taiwan, former World Trade Center in New York etc, there is nothing really fantastic about the Seoul Tower. What is cute are the love keys that you will see in the garden just before you go up the elevator to the view deck."
Another thing to do in Seoul,"It’s not the best tower in the world and perhaps not even in Seoul but it is still an attraction and I want to do it all in every city I visit. Sitting atop the hill makes the tower ever so epic. My in laws wouldn’t go up out of fear. Trust me, it’s nothing to fear. If you miss the trolley like we did, and have to walk all the way, then that’s something to fear, lol. Honestly, the locks? Everyone loves the locks that adorn the gate symbolizing forever love. It looks silly to me but to each his own."
Lock your love,"I think this place is special for couple who wants to leave a ""love padlock"" in that place. It's not that high but good enough to see the whole Seoul. I think it's a nice place to just drop by for some coffee. Me and my husband went up to the Tower and ate at N grill restaurant. The food was expensive but delicious. We did spend a romantic dinner there. "
Seoul Tower: great view on a clear day,"Seoul Tower is a landmark visible from most parts of town that provides a great view, especially on clear days. Sherry and I were here on our 45th anniversary and ""fell for"" buying the Love Locks. Remember don't bring the key back with you -- bad luck. The cable car to the top was fun and beat the long walk up to the Tower."
Tower in seoul,Worth every.minute...Caught a cab up to the cable car.....bought a round trip ticket....unfortunately we went on a sunday of a public holiday so it was busy....but expected.... queuing time approx 40 mins....worth every minute to see the view....we then bought a ticket to go up to the observatory.....i enjoyed it but not something you have to do....there is plenty of advantage points at the base of the observatory for pictures....they also have a man selling locks for couples to place around the area....several eating areas and a water spray area for the children....easy acess for people with disabilities. ...lifts and runways.....you could also buy a one way ticket and walk down the path but be warned its a long way down.......they do have another ticket outlet upstairs if you change your mind....my suggestion for a great overall view of Seoul.
Scared out of my mind but I did it went to the top,Was scared of the tower but the view was amazing you can really see soul the blue house and so many areas it's breath taken when you get to the top (scary too) so many locks that are let by lovers and people who just visit it's a place you have to see for yourself it's worth it 
Nice views,"Let me start by saying that I'm a tower fan. This isn't the biggest tower in the world but it is perched on top of a huge hill makes it feels very high above the city. I went along late evening so I could get a view during daylight, see the sunset and then see the magnificent views over Seoul at night. Time didn't allow me to walk up to the tower so I took the cable car which I thought was fairly expensive but nice.If you buy a T-money card you will get a set of discount vouchers, one of which you can use to save 1,000 won from the price of the visit up the tower.Does the view from the top of the tower offer exceptionally better views from the platforms at the foot of the tower, possibly not, but when you have got so far you might as well go to the top, right?Gentlemen, ensure you go to the toilet when you are there, the view from the urinals over the city is magnificent.Don't forget to walk around the mall under the tower, LG show off some of its technology. The huge 3D screen and LED tunnel are worth a look (FREE also).I would have given this attraction 5 stars but I felt the combined price of the cable car and entry to the tower made it a little too expensive and therefore lose a star."
Good Place to visit,"Its a good place to visit, awesome view, romantic place, and the cable car ride was not that good as it was a bit crowdy. Comfortable shoes should be worn as lot of walking is needed. It is worth it to visit this place. "
Expensive attraction ,"LocationBus - There is a shuttle bus from few subway station (Myeong dong station is one of it) that takes you all the way up to N Seoul TowerCable car - walk from Myeong dong shopping street follow the road sign along the way to the cable car station. Takes ard 15 mins walk. Cable car takes ard 10 mins ride up to N Seoul Tower. You can also take the shuttle bus from Myeong Dong subway station to the cable car. EnvironmentHigh up at Namsan hill overlooking Seoul city. This is also the place where the love padlocks is located. Originated from Europe but it is very popular here in N Seoul Tower as well. Sometimes if you are lucky, rave party will be happening at this place! Price Pretty expensive for my liking FYIYou have to pay another entrance fee to go to the top of the N Seoul Tower. "
Not as high as some tours but good attraction,"The tower itself is just ""ok""...nice views and large gift shop but surrounding area is a nice place to hang out for an hour or so. Take the cable car if possible, fast and beautiful view."
Nothing unusual for foreigners ,"A very popular destination in Seoul for local residents. A huge number of visitors reach by cable car noticing thousand of thousands of wish locks reflecting popularity of the venue. In the cable on the way we can see one part of Seoul by night. Various floor and steps amply display colourful locks on trees,railing rather everywhere showing a faith for future and love. Spread out are at top and interesting floors in tower resembles like any other tourist city tower. Though venue can be covered in 2 hours it has less dramatic element for an overseas tourist. "
Seoul tower ring road,Don't miss the road at the base of the mountain that has a walking path. Very beautiful and a great escape from the hustle of the city. If I had found this earlier in the trip I would've gone daily. I highly recommend it for anyone who loves nature and exercise and wants to get away from it all. I believe it is c all ed Ring Road and it actually has a spongy surface which is easy on the knees for walkers and joggers. 
View of Seoul,"A must see in Seoul. It is also the hight peak in the area. It provides an observation deck to see the city. It has a variety of stores, restaurants and ""Love Locks"" Area."
Night View is Best,To reach N Seoul Tower u can use Cable Car...its a great experience in this cable car... u can also reach by walk or road. Enjoy Love Lock point at the exit of cable car. Remember to bring ur Lock and Key...is believed that ur love wish get true here. Climb up to now reach N Seoul Tower. U can buy ticket to of N Seoul Tower observatory... view is amazing.Lots of entertainment and sovernier shopping at the base of tower. This tower is at Mt Namson about +200mts above and one of the high level of Seoul.Even if u dont want to go at observatory deck...do visit this place as lots of fun for all family and couple at base as well.In Night u can enjoy beautiful LED Lights on N Seoul Tower.
Tourist Adventure Korea,Wonderful view of the city from here. Lots of people and there was a demonstration of ancient Korean martial arts when we were there. Steep hill from bus stop but relatively short.
Checking the coolest places in Seoul ,"The Tower was good but not up to expectation. You pay for a cable car to get to the Tower. Then they charge you again to take an elevator to the top. If skies are clear, views are spectacular. You can see for about 50 miles on a good day. Keep in mind, smog is an issue and can blur viability. Restaurants and trinkets all available. As you can imagine, this is highly commercialized. I recommend doing this at night. With city lights, more beautiful! "
very nice view from the top,we walk from grand hotel myeongdong which we are staying. It took around 15 min. and purchasing the tickets was a breeze. We get the package which include a meal at the restaurant there. The view are so so but the areas there are very nice.
Cable Car to Seoul Tower,"Great to go up to by cable car, you can walk up or descend on foot too should you feel up to it. We caught a free cultural show which was amazing, classic Korean music, sword and martial arts that kind of thing. Very professional and just free to watch. We did not pay to go up to the tower itself, but there are very good viewing decks even at base of the tower. Lots of food outlets etc, certainly well worth a visit."
Beautiful but prepare to walk a lot,"We walked from the station all the way to the cable car station. You might need to ask for directions a few time as the sign is unbelievable hard to find. Since it is an uphill walk, be prepare to hydrate yourself.The Seoul Tower cable car is pretty cool, but still average.The place is extremely beautiful (flowers/ trees). You can also easily find food there. The lovers locks is free entry but the Seoul Tower isn't. There are also a lot of places to see if you decided not to go up into the tower.Depends of the time available, to get the full experiences at least 4 hours is required.There are also traditional dance performance."
Would only come once,"As a tourist it's a norm to go visit all sorts of towers.. Taipei 101, toronto's CN tower, hong kong's sky 100 etc, once to be would be more than enough. "
Great walk up,"Not my first time to Namsam Tower but it was my first time walking all the way up there and it was good. You get amazing views, breathing in fresh air, taking pictures. It was a long walk though and many stairs so this is definitely not recommended for people with knee issue. Remember to bring water if you opt to walk up there."
A nice place to visit,"You may go N Seoul Tower, if you are in Seoul for 3-4 days visit as going up and down (even by trolly)shall take at least 1-2 hours."
Ehh,We did this as part of a tour. The view is definitely cool from the top but I was able to see comparable (if not better) views from hiking. 
Simply amazing!,We took the bus 05 from Myeongdong to Namsam Tower. It was a loooooong tiring uphill walk to the tower but it was worth it.
A lot of waiting in lines ,It was a lovely view. The cable car views were better than the tower.The lines were long every step of the way. We went at night.The rest restaurants were all closed by the time We got down from the tower around 930. Thank God we opted for the popcorn and beer option or we would have starved.If you've seen towers in other cities this was not one of the best. You couldn't take very good pictures inside at night because of the glare...Finding an affordable taxi at the cable car base was very difficult at 10:30 at night.
great cable car to the top,"It's about $8 return ticket on the cable car to the top, and you don't have to pay to go up the tower because you get great views Seoul just from the top, and get to see the lock bridges. Buy your lock before you get up there because it's expensive once you're up!"
Great views and walking trails,"We took tram up, wandered around at top, rode up and spent 1/2 hour enjoying the view and quick lunch (prices okay at burger place). Kids lost interest in views pretty quickly but enjoyed candy store at top of tower. We walked down and saw only a few people but was nice after crowds at top. Easily followed map through park and to Grand Hyatt. Would recommend having water with you on hot day as was warm even though walking down and we went through ours fast. "
Interesting and scenic walk to the top,"I didn't take the cable car or go to the top of the tower. However, I walked up here two different times. On the spring day I went, the park was beautiful and the weather was perfect. Many older people are exercising and the walk up is quiet until you reach the tower area which is sadly crowded with tourists on bus tours. The view itself is OK in the day but fantastic on a clear night (I went both times). At night, the Seoul residents will crowd the area (even in a chilly winter night-which is when I went). Be prepared to walk slowly up as you must follow many people. The great views at night make it worthwhile though. You can follow the Seoul Fortress Wall trail which is historical as well as providing several viewpoints. Free to visit the area but of course you must pay to go to the top of the tower."
Something about twinkling lights and love locks,"Best viewed at night. The cable car ride costs W8,500 round trip per adult and there is food and drink up top. For an additional fee, you can get up to the tower. Be ready for long lines because this is a popular spot, particularly of lovers. There are tons of love locks all over the fence lines that it blocks views. But the night time view of Seoul is inspiring. Some people walk down, but you can cab it up and down."
Nice walk in the park to reach tower,A very pleasant walk in the park to reach the tower.A fine view of the city below even in the mist. I try to forget the locks.
N Seoul Tower ,Wonderful view of the city of Seoul...padlock exhibit was interesting.....the X-Mas Tree padlocks were amazing. The walk incline was a great walk but would be a challenge for those with ambulatory issues.
Nice place with plenty of 3d museums,A must see tourist atraction when in seoul. Beautiful view of seoul from up above. Plenty of 3d museum to choose from. Didnt get to ride the cable car but its ok. There is always another trip. 
Tourist area.. But Great View,"This a tourist spot, but the view is amazing. I went up to the observation desk took lots of photos. Then had a glass of wine to enjoy the view. This is a great at night or sunset. "
Visit it - because it's there!,"The N Tower is fun to visit - you can see the panorama of Seoul and even put a little lock with your name on the ""tree-lock"". The way up to the lift is long, windy and arduous - hence, use the inclining lift cabin on the main road - it's much more fun, unless you're into hiking!There is a shop at the bottom of the cabin which offers all kind of merchandise - don't be tempted, as prices are atrocious and you can get things twice as cheap in the town. Purchase a return ticket - don't be tempted to purchase a ticket with a meal- and off you go. There is a lift that could take you up the 5 flights of stairs, but only if you're very old or very pregnant :) - we braved the lift anyway and were told that we have to be ""punished"" by waiting 10 min for such ""disobedience"". The visitors are lined up in a very ""military"" / ""communist regime"" style - you do what you told! - but this is all part of the experience!Up the top, there are more steps to conquer - then, you're (almost) at the top. The views are great, and there are plenty of opportunities for the photographs and selfies. There is a concert available on a daily basis , - worth watching for a bit, and there are plants of eateries up the top, although the prices are higher that in downtown Seoul. In the way back, try to take you place on the bottom right corner of the cable car - that's where you can have the best view as the car descends to the ground. "
A great day out,"I would recommend going up to the tower by cable cart, and then coming down Nasam walking to enjoy the park as well."
The popcorn & beer package!,"Awesome view of the huge city that is Seoul!And, take the popcorn and beer package... just take it!"
peak at seoul,"this place is located on a mountain. we can go there by taking a shuttle bus around Myeongdong area. After arrived there, we can go up to see the tower by walking or taking the cable car. We can get inside the tower and go up to enjoy the city scenery from the top of tower, entrance ticket needed. It is a nice place for couples and families"
"Cool, clean air, and great views of Seoul.",Great 360 degree view of Seoul nest seen on a clear day. Sunset is best time but busy over weekends. You do notice that air is cleaner than below. The cable car is worth it going up but if it's busy save your money walk down using one way ticket. It is a steep walk up from the street. Views are great you can see the expanse that is Seoul. There are 1000s of locks attached to the fence like on the Parisian bridge and you can buy them on-site. There is a burger restaurant and Michelin starred restaurant on the site.
A must to view,"I'm on a trip here to South Korea for my sons wedding. Not only are the people extremely nice, but there are plenty of amazing sites to see, the Tower being one of them. From taking a cable car up top of the mountain, then zooming up to the top for dinner, or if you choose a buffet. Amazing views of Seoul , unless it is on a hazy day. You can also visit the love locks, which my son and his fiancé put their heart lock on and signed. If you are here, you must take time to at least see the observation deck.It's amazing!"
Good hike,"To reach this tower there was 2 option by walk or u can take cable car, we decided to walk and hike little bit in the afternoon...it was long walk but it was really worth it, great view from top, we did not manage to go up to the tower, we just enjoyed the view from the park and rest little after before we head down back to the city"
Smoggy Day,Went up the cable car and then walked to the tower to take the elevator up from the cable car. Nice attraction to see and be at but not worth to go out of your way. Famous tower but is a tourist spot.
Visit in Spring or Fall,"I lived in S. Korea for two years and the best time of year to visit the country is spring and fall. The weather is perfect that time of year (frigid cold in winter and more humid than FL in summer with lots of rain). Better than the weather though is the air clarity and quality. So I recommend hitting up Seoul tower in the spring or fall because the air is more likely to be clear and less polluted. If you get there in late April/ May you are going to hit the yellow dust but you will see the flowering trees and flowers. In the fall the trees offer so many different colors. We went to the tower at sunset which gave us amazing sunset photos (until the rain hit us). There is a shuttle that will take you from the bottom of the hill to the top and a railcar. We took the shuttle, but man the lines can be long and the later the day the less busses so it's hard to catch one. We did not go up the tower, I enjoyed stayed down watching the city and mingling with the people enjoying the space. We left around 8-9 pm and there were hardly any buses running so we walked down."
Good place to go,n Seoul tower isn't only a tower it's great place to see all Seoul from upstairs you can understand what kind for people the Korean great place to go i hope i can go again 
Great views at night,We visited the tower at night and it was great to see the city sites at night. There are many love locks on the fences. It is quite a walk from where the bus drops you off so I would not recommend to visit here if you have difficulty in walking.
"Scenic Destination, try out Korean Traditional Costumes for Free",Can see the Seoul City from a bird-eye view. Scenic mountain where you can choose to go up by namsan cable car (round trip 8000w) or by walking. Dont forget to try out their Korean Traditional Costumes for free here...
Best views in Seoul,"We like to visit places that have nice aerial views around the world, and this was indeed a nice one. It's sad to see the effects of pollution, but it was a great experience with the value added of showing how far different places in the world are. If you have time when in Seoul, don't miss this one."
Great views of Seoul,As first time visitors to Seoul we had to stop by the Seoul Tower. The views from the park and the top of the tower were lovely but know that the tower is a major tourist trap. Everything from the tram ride to Tower entrance and pictures cost money and the crowds get excessive so get there very early like we did.
The Beauty of N Seoul Tower,"Love the night view so much. Suggest to visit it in the evening ( but go there before 5pm as there is a long q and may take longer time to reach the tower) to see the day and night view. Remember bring a thick jacket if visit at night. It is damn cold. After the cable car, you may reach the Namshan and here yon can have a drink to enjoy the view around."
Romantic place for couple,"The view from above is very nice and beautiful, also if you are couple, this place is very romantic at night.there's many photo spot for you to take a picture."
A wonderful night excursion,"On the last nite in Seoul we visited this beautiful Seoul time just only from the bus stop area, where we took foto to the tower and city view . Since we hadn't enough time to go to the tower , it was after dinner and still 30 min to go to our hotel.It is worth the nite visit to N Seoul Tower and I don't know why they call it N Seoul Tower ?"
Seoul Tower Smile,This was awesome to see it at night. There was lights & sights to see down in the city around us. The Temple was all lite up and looking up the Tower it was awesome. A must see for anyone visiting Seoul South Korea at NIGHT!!!!!!
A Must-See at Night,N Seoul tower offers some of the most breathtaking views of Seoul. We went in the evening and we were able to watch the sunset over the city. It was so beautiful to watch the city light up at night as the sun set. I highly recommend visiting later in the day so you can witness the sunset. We did a ton of sightseeing that day so we opted for the cable car. The price is minimal and it saved us a ton more walking/stairs. The cable car is popular so be prepared to wait in line headed in both directions. There is a restaurant in the tower that offers dinner as well as snack and coffee counters. It is traditional for couples to leave a lock on the rails at the top of the hill. My husband and I purchased a love lock from the store. They are expensive on site ($15) but we opted for the two locks so one stayed in Korea and one traveled home with us as a souvenir.
Great first day stop,"I would start my visit with this attraction. Provides a great view of the city and also, if you are lucky, there will be some dances by local Korean groups in the center couort"
Must see attraction in Seoul,"This tower is a must see when you star in elevator, a light show welcomes you and show projections outside and inside elevator.View is amazing with many interesting information available."
Not a must go place,"N tower is the landmark of Seoul. Was very crowded during spring and the air was still cold. We walked uphill and a little bit tired. Not very interesting, many people just sat there and enjoyed the view. There's also famous love lock, where couples locked their love. So for couples who want to lock their love, remember to bring your own lock."
Just a tower in another city,I don't know but there's nothing really special about the Namsan Tower. I mean if you been to other towers around the world you'd agree. Just a typical sightseeing place for tourists who need a quick picture.
Iconic tower on a mountain ,If in Seoul you will always catch a glimpse of this tower when walking on the streets This is a must visitYou can have breathtaking views of Seoul Its got some attractions like 3d art museum inside for taking pictures Also while going up there is a place where there are a lot of padlocks must visit that too
Amazing View from the Top,"We took a slow and nice walk up the hill to the tower. It is a walkable distance from Myeongdong. We took the cable car up to the tower at night, the lights were beautiful and the weather was nice and cool! Went up the tower and we enjoyed the ride up, the view was amazing and we tried to spot our accommodation from the top of the tower. A must do is to send a postcard back home as this is one of the highest postbox in the world. If we were to come back, we would take a walk up the hill especially during Spring where you can see Cherry blossoms!"
It's best to savor the view and enjoy the nature walk to the top.,It's a place for romance & provides a spectacular view of Seoul. When the city lights light up the view will be amazing.
One of a kind,"This is a very amazing place since I can't do the same at home for me the experience is unique. I took the Namsan cable car to the tower and the view is beautiful; best time to go is on the afternoon to watch the sunset. This is a place where many couples go to, you would find locks representing their love before going into the tower. They have gift shops and restaurant/cafe inside the tower. Ticket was about $10.00 or 10,000 won per person. There's not much to do unless you are with company and are going to eat in there. "
Fully appreciate how endless Seoul is.,Seoul is a mega city. We know this although maybe we don't understand what it means. The N Tower makes you realise and appreciate what it looks likes to gave millions of people living in a relatively small amount of space. The views will leave you in awe and make this a must see in Seoul.The price is low compared to similar places in other cities around the world: only 10000 won. You can get there by hiking up the hill which is actually really nice or getting the cable car (walk from Myeongdong tube station to cable car about 10 minutes). You can probably get a taxi up as well.Best to go on a weekday to avoid crowds. We went along the afternoon around 4 and we actually didn't need to queue up for the lift at all. It got a lot busier in the evening. 
Above Seoul ,No other way to see the city then to be above it. Great views from up the tower. You'll find yourself taking way to many photos which are all great!
N Seoul Tower,"I love the view and the place though we only stayed outside. For the easiest and fastest way to the tower, use the cable car. Food is also available and a lot of photo ops ✌ "
Overwhelming sense of Seoul,If you want to really get perspective on the size of Seoul is then this is a must. This place We were really awed by the city's density and sprawl. The steps are a very pretty walk but you need to be fit (we only did them going down which was quite tough).
Good,Awesome view of city in the evening. We climbed and spend good time. It is very cool and has excellent preservation of nature in the city. Amazed to see how good they have maintained. 
See all of Seoul,This is the only way to see all of Seoul at once and appreciate the size and density of population. The cable car provides an easy way of approaching if you don't feel like a 40 minute walk up the mountain. Taxis understand NamSan Cable car. Very nice to walk around base of tower before ascending. You can sit back and enjoy the view and have beer and sausages if you want to just relax at the base of the tower. Also you get to see the ancient signal fire station that provided Seoul's early warning system more than a thousand years ago 
Bird eye view and late cherry blossoms but not much else,"Long wait to take the tram up from main road as there is only 1 car. Lots of standing. You could walk up the rather steep steps if you have good knees. Thereafter another long wait for cable cars. We took about 1.5 hours to get up. Loads of people once you get off the cable cars. Last of the cherry blossoms was lovely though. The locks of love, though gimmicky, was actually nice. You can buy lock from the stall up there. I think we paid krw7000 for one. To get away from the sea of people, we bought a Cass beer each and was allowed to sit at a bistro overlooking the city, not superb views but ok for a rest n beer! "
Great view of the city,"Namsan Tower offers a great view of the city. We went there during the last week of the spring season so the weather was still a bit cold. We took the cable car going up but we decided to hike going down due to the very long queue. Our friend who is based in Korea said that the place is not usually packed but because we went during a holiday, there were a lot of locals. Nonetheless, it was a great experience."
Nothing amusing,"Went there on a hot sunny afternoon after quick shopping in myeongdong. Wasnt easy 2 find our way to the cable car. I find that signages/directions r lacking a lot in Seoul for main tourist attrctions. It was nothing amusing watching the view fr the tower, perhaps it would better at night. The park before going up the tower was quite relaxing though. Give this a miss if u hav a packed itinerary. "
Spectacular 360 views of Seoul,"The best way to see all of Seoul. I've been up there a few times in Summer and Winter when I had friends visiting me, and both times it was spectacular..... The perfect way to get a view of all of Seoul. You have to visit the Tower if you're in Korea"
Small tower Made for lovers,This is a really small tower when compared to towers in other parts of the world. The area is quite and nature friendly. Good for couples. Closest scares from metro is by Myeongdong station. Have to walk around 400 meters to get to the cable car access.Buy tickets and go up. Coming down its better to walk if you enjoy nature walking. Tower access costs extra. The main attraction I found here is that couples tie a lock on the rails. Never seen anything like this Anywhere else in the world. So buy your lock from the Myongdang market under the street while going there...A good view of the city is an added advantageClick helpful if you find this post helpful...
"A ""must"" on the sightseeing list","The hotel announced this as a ""must do"" tourist activity. To get there, I took the cable car which then means there is only a short walk to the N Tower. Once there, the ticket queues were small, and it was fast to get to the top of the tower. All signs are in Korean and English, so no problem for International travellers. The views are great, and yes it is a ""must do"" thing!"
Breath-taking view of Seoul,"Put on a pair of comfortable shoes and Enjoy a langorious stroll up Namsan ... At the peak you would savior the lovers' corner with thousands of locks latched tightly to the fences around ... Occasionally you see a local korean drum performance .. The tower is a modern playground with an exhibition hall, several cafes plus a bird-eye view of Seoul! "
Must visit !,"The best time to visit N seoul tower is around evening time 5-6pm and you will get the view before sunset, during and after. We were amazed by the awesome view! There is bus from seoul and few areas straight up to tower and you require to walk up (5 min). This is the cheapest and fastest way. There is few restaurants and souvenir shop right up the top with lots of photo worthy places. Do spend 1-2hours here to enjoy the view and have a cup of coffee. "
Pleasant walk to the Tower,"I was staying in the Hyatt and they provided a map detailing walking/jogging routes to the Tower. Very pleasant walk through woodland, dotted with the occasional garden. Very peaceful until you reach the Tower where you come across the tourist buses and the hundreds of tourists ( it was a Saturday though). To be honest even though busy it was nt that bad and you did not have to wait long to get spectacular 360 degree views of Seoul. This time did nt take the lift to the top of the Tower, but for KRW21K it is worth it on a clear day. A number of restaurants and bars available if you need refreshments. For me it was well worth the walk up the hill."
nice view of the city,nice view of the city maybe a challenge to go up by stairs but will try next timeat the tower feet you can bring your own lock ant stick it to the fence like the rest of the tourist thats the trend nowyou can take some nice shoots from the terrace
Green mountain in city centre,"there is a mild mountain in the city center of Seoul with beautiful park around it. You can go up by walk or use Tele cabin to reach the tower. In the tower by elevator go to upper floor and enjoy from 360 degree view of Seoul. there are some shops to by Korean Souvenir here, telescope to watch city, memorials photo ... .In the ground floor you can find Love lock trees by different colors from beautiful locks.also there are some coffee shops and restaurants over there"
Good exercise walking uphill.,"The Tower was visible from near the hotel, so decided to walk. A cable car ride gets you to the tower base. Another ticket needed to go up into the tower. One novel sight was the 100's of 1,000's of padlocks placed by couples. Heard of the practice, never seen it before. The view from the tower was worth paying for. The view over the city was hazy due to approaching rain. Food outlets are all around, from fast food to restaurants."
Top Attraction,The tower is literally and figuratively top attraction. Many tourists consider this as the main attraction in Seoul. Accessible by a bus in Chungmuro Station. However the walk from the parking area to the entrance of the tower is quite steep. When on the top floor the view is fantastic. Souvenirs are also available on sale
Seoul Tower,"You will know this is the seoul tower when you see it far away. Maybe I was expecting an amazing view but this is just an average view. If you don't have time, you are not missing much. This is something I would come see once for the experience but I wouldn't come for a second time. I recommend coming 1 hour before the sun sets so you can see the day and night view at once. Don't come on raining/cloudy days or you won't see much."
Morning roaming the park and Tower,"Easily reached by most public transport, taxis or by foot, the cable car serves the tower park and return tickets are quire economical.The park has some nice features and if you are a fan of ""love lock"" there are many areas, mostly quite full, where couples lock themselves in for the hard slog.The trip up the tower is by express lift and the beer combo gets you two beers for less than the price of one. The usual photo booths operate on the way up, which explains the long queues going in. But the views from the top are fantastic and if you fancy it, there is also a restaurant there.All in all a trip worth making if you have time to kill in Seoul."
Brilliant,"We went on a Saturday evening and we didn't want to stand in the long line for the cable car, so we took the hiking trail up, which was a great workout and also had good views and certain points. There was a free concert going on there too, and the beer + popcorn combo for 2 was quite reasonable. "
Must see if in Seoul!,"Super easy to get there and back with incredible views. Several options including hiking great trails up, city bus or cable car.Going up to the base of the tower is free, going up to the top is around $10 or so.Take the time to go you will not be disappointed!"
Amazing views,"My husband couldn't make the elevator trip to the top due to his fear of heights but I did it and it was fantastic. We were lucky that the air was clear, skies blue and the view went on forever. Really great attraction. "
Remember your padlock!,"You can take a taxi to the short cable car ride if the walk up a steep hill doesn't appeal. The view over the city is impressive once up there. It's optional to go up to the top of the actual tower- we didn't. This is a famous place inasmuch as people fasten padlocks (and a selection of other items such as mobile phone covers!!) to the railings and dispose of the key. Many locks are inscribed with pledges of love. Don't worry if you forget your padlock - you can buy one, and borrow a pen, from a seller at the tower. There are literally hundreds of locks and they in themselves make for interesting photos!"
"Spectacular views and grounds, light show","The tower is quite an experience from the minute you enter the elevator. The service is great, and friendly. On a hill at the centre of Seoul, the tower offers commanding views of the city. For shoppers, there will be temptations galore as you walk through the couple of floors at the top. The tower is also beautifully lit at night."
Night and day spectacle ,"Lovely to view the cityscape during the day to really get a view of the Han river or seeing the neon lights of the korean night culture.If you have some time, it's worth going up just to get a better look at the city. Especially if you know about the Korean war and want to think about the situation from a different view perspective. "
Nice view,"Love the view from there. There are three option going up there by walk, cable car or bus. I take bust from Itaewon take me around 15 minutes. Fee to going up to the tower is USD10, but only few people going up there. They also got restaurant. The view is superb."
See all around Seoul,Requires some amount of energy to cover the steep climb road to reach the entry. Beautiful view of the seoul and the neighbouring countries with their distance is marked on the glass walls of the tower. Suveneers are sold inside the tower with refreshments. Nice to spend an hour.
Cherry blossoms,Lovely place to visit but be prepared for long queues! No clear directions for entering the restaurants or restrooms in the tower... We had to go around in circles trying to find the enter acne to the restaurant we were booked in! Best place to view the Cherry blossoms from! 
Must visit if it's your first time here!,"N Seoul Tower is a must visit if it's your first time in Seoul. I do not enjoy the cable car ride up the Tower area though. There was no seats and overcrowded with people. View up the hill was great but a pity I couldn't capture much photos because of space constraint. Once we were up the hill, everything was good. There were pretty spring flowers blossomed and the weather was good. The view from the Towel was magnificent too, overseeing the whole of Seoul."
Beautiful night time view of the city! ,The view from the tower at night is BEAUTIFUL!Buy a one way ticket up by cable car then walk down. There are many pretty spots along the walk down to take pictures. (The wait to take the cable car back down is very long anyway.) 
Nice view,Enjoyed Seoul night view. we went after 8 and the tower ticket were available till 10 with closing time 11. the waiting time was around 45 mins but it was worth. we took combo ticket with popcorn and drink. which was really worth.
Good views on the right day,You start off by taking a mini people lift up to the first level ( you can walk up the stairs if you want). Once there you buy a ticket for the cable car. 6000 won for one way or 8000 for the return. Most people get the return. Once you reach the top you can enjoy some great views of Seoul. If you are there at the right time you will see a traditionally dressed Korean man near the bell. They performed some sort of routine but it was just finishing when I got there. They have food and drinks available if you want to sit and eat and enjoy the view. You can also purchase a padlock to add to the other thousands that are up there if you want. A good place to go. Probably even better at night.
Fabulous views,"We thought the view from the top of the hill was good, but we were pleased we went up the top of the tower as well as the view improves and explanations of the sights was good."
Great View!,The tower gave us a great view to see the city that never ends. The restaurant had many options to choose from and it was enjoyable to see the view of the city while dining. 
Antennas for TV and radio,"Unlike great towers in Tokyo, Beijing, Toronto and great cities, the Namsan Tower is not that high. But with the Namsan Mountain together, it is one of the very tall towers in the world. It covers all it needs to cover for TV and radio for people in Seoul and cities near by. It is very friendly and allows people to come near with a fresh mountain environment. That may be the main reason why there are so many people visiting day and night."
But the views!!!!,"There are long lines at night.But the views are worth every second. This is an inexpensive fun thing to do. The views are spectacular, especially at night!"
Seoul tower,"Amazing view!! It was a 30 minute wait for cable car and then 15 minutes for elevator but so worth it! I recommend to go there when it's dark outside, you'll see better and it's beautiful with all the city-lights! Bring a padlock to hang outside as a memory. "
Nice place to see sunset,"Nice place to see the sunset.Buy the observation ticket to go up, noting much, but able to see Seoul from high up.I enjoyed buying the postcard and sending it back to my friends and myself~ the post card with stamps cost about 2200 won. Please do tell the cashier you are gonna send overseas, so she will give you another stamps.I don't know if this is the peak season. When I was there its was madly filled with people. Too crowded, making the observation area hot and stuffy."
"Tram up, walk down",This was great fun... took a tram from it's little station up the long hill to the tower. There are gardens and benches there as well. You then take an elevator ride up the tower... there is food available and windows all the way around the tower... signs showing distance to far away places...We were there when the Cherry Blossoms were blooming and there were lots of spots to stop for pictures.
Unexpected,"If anyone want to visit the place, please be there before the sunset cause the view will be nice before dark. Night view, oh well it never give me the wah impact."
Famuly trip,Ride the bus to the top if you're with young children. The walk is very tiring. But nice view it got up there!!!
Fun place,If you have ever wanted to enjoy the scenic landscape of Seoul while you're urinating then this is the place for you. The restaurant on the top was pretty good.
Amazing view from the Namsan Hill!,Seoul city looked alive and vibrant with lighting everywhere from up above at N Seoul Tower. In here also located the second Bear Museum within this building at the basement floor. Cute and cuddly bears displayed on various settings! Souvenirs sold for mementos. Came here twice!
Beautiful scenery ,I enjoyed my visit. The staffs at the information counter were helpful. To get there you can get a free bus ride from myeondong. Just wait at the bus stop next to the subway station. Just look at the signage and you will be safe. 
Great night view,"I didn't get a chance to go to the top of the tower, but the view from the base at night is really beautiful. I would advise anyone looking to visit the tower to go just before sunset to catch both the view during the day, and at night. ^^ If you've got kids, don't worry - Trick Eye Museum has got you covered. I took the Seoul City Tour bus to the tower, but couldn't find the bus on the way back. If this ever happens, don't worry - green public transport buses are available and maps posted at the bus stop. Just make sure you have exact change to make it easier if you don't have a T-money card. It's a rather steep climb from the bus-stop to the base of the tower, so it's a bit tough for older people with heart conditions."
"Good view, interesting show","The tower offers excellent views as you would expect from a large tower, on a hill, in the centre off a city. It was easy to get tickets and for an additional 7,000 won we also received two pints of beer and a large popcorn in addition to our two tickets. Although hazy we were able to see a lot and signs around the observatory helped direct us towards various landmarks. At 14:00 their is a one hour show at the plaza at the foot of the observatory. This was worth staying to watch and there was enough space to get a good view. The show was an exhibit of traditional fighting styles (the photos will give a clearer insight)."
Not as good as it could be,"This attraction is so close to being really good, it gives a great view of the city and in nice weather its a nice couple of hours. What lets it down is the quing. Endless endless ques to get the lift, then again to get a ticket for the cable car, then again to get on the cable car, then again to go up the tower. They could easily sort this out but my guess is they dont want to make the investment. Still, if youve got a few hours to kill and its a nice day, venture to the top."
N seoul tower,From namsan guesthouse 3.. just walk about 10 minutes before approaching the cable car..Waiting time (queue)before taking the cable car is around 30 minutes ( we take evening). Do come in morning time to avoid waiting too long.. When arrive at the tower.. its a breathtaking and the view was very nice! 
"Verry nice fiew arrond the city, great buffet food",That is a must if you are in this area. We walked up arround the tower this is a long way but nice to do. We had Lunch there and we found a great buffet. Verry good foot
City Lights,I visited Namsan Tower and you can see the beautiful city lights. I haven't been in the N tower. I just walked around the area and still you can view the beautiful city lights of Seoul. Must visit during night time. 
Great view of Seoul,"To get a great view of the city, go up to the peak of this Namsan Hill. I was there during the weekday, so it was not very crowded. And we managed to get onto the cable car as soon as we bought the tickets. The nature view and garden up here are breathtaking and one not to be missed for your picture collection."
Nice place to see and hang out for a while,This place is very nice... lots of people taking pictures and chill around.. sometimes there are cultural events here... when we came there was like a traditional sword and martial arts performance. There are also a few snacks stalls and a small olive young here. Most people will take pics as the lovelocks are all over. Very lovely!
Can't miss it.,All big cities seem to have a tall tower of some description and this one is Seoul's. Not sure what function it serves or why it is even there. One thing is for sure though that you can't miss it if in Seoul. You will find it lurking in the background of many of your photos in Seoul. 
don't recommend. 3 hours standing in the queue,caught a taxi to get up there to have a little look. unfortunately the taxi didn't get me there and left me at the cable car entrance. there i waited more than an our to go up. than another hour to get in the lift of the tower. visited 10 minutes and then it took me another hour to get back down. queues everywhere. i regret i went there...
Mesmerize with the tower,We ride the cable car and passed by the attraction place to tied you love pad lock. Beautiful scenary from the top.
Great view,"Going all the way up the tower is definitely worth it, cause you'll have the best view over Seoul! There's also restaurants/ cafés there, but they're quite expensive."
Alright,"Pay quote a bit to get to the top of the tower, but it's a bit of a letdown as it is nowhere near as high as others in Macau, Seattle, etc. Lots of shops and park type areas around, but the top of the tower itself is tiny and can be walked around in less than 30 seconds. Nothing special to be honest and you won't be devastated if you missed it out when in Seoul "
Cool place and very affordable,You can go up to the tower for about 8500 krw and see lots from there. They also have locks all over from previous couples. I would say millions of them. They have some cool combo deals but if you want to go on the cheap you can bring your own locks and walk back down for cheaper
Went at night,"We were too late to get to the very top, but we got to take the cable car to the top and hang out by the platforms. I highly recommend going for great views of the city. Its great for couples as its romantic. There is a heart shaped chair to take photos in and there is a gate filled w love locks! "
Towering one's heart and S(e)oul,"If you really want to be on top of the world for just a day, try the NSeoul Tower! This place is best for those who want to have their moments together and profess their love. Not to mention going to the observation deck in a swift!"
Observation deck was rather small,I've been to the same tower in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia and I have to say Malaysia's tower is bigger. It was rather disappointing that I can complete one round of walking in just a few minutes. However the view was excellent! It was to see all of Seoul from above. Sunset is a nice timing to go. They have souvenirs shops in the observation deck itself. You can also sit on some platforms in the observation deck to enjoy and absorb the view. At the bottom of the tower itself has aa few cafes where you can sit and enjoy the view. They have this place where you can lock your locks something like the bridge in london if i'm nit wrong. Ypu can get up to the tower either by climbing the stairs though not recommended as the stars is steep and its tiring. You can also get to the tower via the cable car but it is always crowded sith people from CHINA. Alternatively you can get up by the bus. It will alight you a few metres from the tower itself where you can walk up a steep slope to the tower itself. Its recommended to go if you in Seoul. 
Beautiful views,Go early in the day as it gets very busy witb tourists. A stroll up to the tower is a must for any visitors to Seoul. The views are wonderful and worth the walk. There are places to buy snacks and drinks at the tower.
Meh.. So so Seoul ,"At 230ish meters this is a pretty small tower by world standards. Up top, the viewing deck is somewhat small, the wait to get up is somewhat long, and the disappointment At the lack of anything upstairs is somewhat large. It's a bit of a tourist trap in every way possible... Worth doing if you haven't found anything better to do."
""" where you get an awesome view of Seoul""",Our tour-guide Chance Kim from VIP Travel had showed us around and we were so grateful to him for being so accommodating.. 
so so,Not easy to reach if you are not familiar with that place. I went with my Korean friend but he also doesn't know how to get there. We walked nearby and asked a student and she showed us to catch on a bus which is a cycle route to and from downhill/N tower. Actually we wanted to take cable car but unfortunately there was too late when we got there. So if u wanna try cable car you must check the time table before you go there.
Fantastic Views of Seoul,"The North Tower is the best way to get some fantastic shots of Seoul, plus there's some great souvenirs at the kiosks at the top. Having said all this....GO EARLY IN THE DAY. This is a very popular spot for tourists, and it's not unusual to wait over an hour just to get on the cable car to get to the Tower! So plan ahead, especially if you want to take kids. I would not go to the restaurants at the Tower, mostly because they are very crowded and expensive for what's offered. Take some snacks and enjoy the little park area if it's a nice day."
"The Light of Seoul,",The hike to the base of the tower provides the opportunity to digest breath taking views of the expanse of the Seoul city scapes-it is so compelling. Seoul Tower illuminates my inner soul just looking at this spectacular landmark. It is a must see.
Good views of Seoul,"It is a pleasant walk uphill to the tower. Although offering excellent views, the day we went the sky was rather murky due to the dust/pollution blown in from China."
Beautiful city night view,Was a bit worried of the long line since we have elderly parents with us.. but we were lucky that we are able to go up with the travel van. And they just opened the lift to go up the deck. So it was a breeze for us as we do not need to climb the stairs. It was breathtaking sight of the amazing lighted city! A definite must visit destination in Seoul.
Behold the city after nightfall,"Overlooking from above, Seoul appeared so magnificent with all its sparkling lights. Definitely a must-visit destination in Seoul!"
Well worth it,"Despite the long lines, it's well worth the trip up to see the city.Better to do it at night, as the city lights are amazing "
Cherry blossoms,"Wasn't expecting to catch the cherry blossoms so late in the season. Was 2 week of April. There were at least 7-10 bus loads worth of tourists near the foot of the tower.We had wandered away from the crowds, looking for a good photo opportunity along roads less travelled and threaded upon. Was first our stop in Seoul, was a lovely start to our trip.Seoul little time..... Seoul much to do!!!"
360 Degrees Awesome ,"We planned to be at the tower by sunset but we were not able to do so.We walked on the way to the cable car from Myeongdong around 30 minutes. We did not know we had to queue for about an hour just to ride the cable car. By the time we reached the tower, it was already dark.Nevertheless, the view was spectacular. It seems to me that all bridges and roads seen from the observatory lead to N Seoul Tower. It's like being in the center and on top of the world.IT could have been more pleasurable if it wasn't too cold for an al fresco dinner or drink.I would recommend going to this place on a warmer night, maybe summer."
It was very good. It has very good and clear air. It looks very beautiful.,I think you should not ride the cable car because it destroys nature. But everything else is good. Oh and make sure you go to Seoul an tower on a sunny day.
Beautiful ,N Seoul Tower is a beautiful destination for pictures and to get a view of the city. The observation deck gives you a great view. The park around the tower is very pretty and you can take the cable car up to the tower.
Good view of huge city,"We enjoyed a ride up the cable car at night. It was almost closing time, so had to wait in line for the ride down. Beautiful view on a clear night. Sweet displays of love locks and sentimental thoughts."
Rainy stroll,even the rain can't stop us strolling in N Seoul Tower. This place is a must visit when travelling in Seoul. View from the top of Observatory tower is very nice.
"great experience, come and see Seoul at night","nice place, great view (little bit expensive). you get to see Seoul at night, go by cable cart, nice illusions , send a postcard home with local stamp"
"Stunning Views of the City, must try the Cable Car ride","Beautiful views of the city, especially by the night. The entry to the tower costs about KRW 6000. Must try at least a one-way cable car ride to/ from the tower to the city."
Love locks,"The famous love locks are located here. Fantastic views of Seoul especially at night. I went up by taking the Namsan Sunhwan Shuttle Bus No 5, from the bus stop right outside Myeongdong Station exit 3. Comes in 15 minute intervals, from 730 am - 1130 pm. After alighting from the bus you will have a short but pretty steep hike up. I was there at about 830pm and the whole place was buzzing. Visit Namsan Park as well if you have the time."
Awesome view,"Awesome view and the weather is lovely , lots of tourist every corner but fun the city view from top of the tower is breath taking beautiful"
Beautiful place,"We walked there from Myeong-dong market. First we used a free lift that moves diagonally over a slope. Then we bought cable car tickets and waited in a long queue for almost an hour. (It was a Saturday.) The cable car took us to the base of the N Seoul Tower. My wife and I contributed two ""love-locks"" to the thousands that were already there. We went to the observation deck of the tower using a lift. I didn't find the deck or the view that impressive. Of course, you get a good view of Seoul City. But somehow that didn't impress me. When we returned to the base of the tower, it was 9 pm. We were fortunate to witness a electronic dance music (EDM) concert for free. Then we returned to our hotel.I was looking forward to walking my way up and then down. However, my family was not so keen about walking."
Nice view of Seoul,"The N Seoul Tower isn't tall relative to the other towers in the world, but since it's built on the summit of the Namsan Mountain, it enjoys a nice elevated 360 view of Seoul, which provides you with views of the Geongbokgung and other palaces, as well as many other sights around Seoul. Let's one orientate oneself around the city.The observatory consists of two floors, accessible by a fast elevator."
Can improve a bit,"I booked a table at the Han-cook Restaurant at the N-tower through an agent before I went to Seoul. The food there and the service were both good but things can improve a bit for two things. First, the signage for non-Korean speaking traveler could be more prominent. Second, if I could be informed of the need to first get an entry ticket by presenting my reserve voucher at the information counter would make my experience more pleasant. "
The love tower!,I really love everything about this place!! you can find food and many beautiful souvenirs! :D here you can see the beautiful seoul view from all its angles <3
Mail yourself a postcard!!!!,Wonderful views of the city! Loved mailing ourselves a postcard from the highest post in the world. Received it a couple of weeks later......what a great memory we have!
"Nice, a must go location in Seoul.","Nice place. I'm going up to N Seoul Tower by cable car, I'd enjoy the view on the way up, people jogging and relaxing in Namsan Park, watch cherry blossom above the tree. At N Seoul Tower, you can see how strategic location for old Korea as alarm tower it is, you can see Gyeongbokgung n HangGang river from here. Love locker all around the platform. I've chance to see free traditional performance at here too. Good impression for me!"
Nice view from the observatory deck,"Great experience with Seoul tower where you can get full view of the city from above. We took the Seoul city bus tour to get there. It worked out best if you get the Observatory combo which includes 2 adult tickets, 1 large popcorn and 1 large drink for 21000won If you buy tickets separately it will cost 12000won each. Should check out their restroom as well, stunning view from above."
The performance at 3!!!,It was super amazing. People go to Namsan for the view and the famous love locks but I always go for the traditional performance. Its at 3 and it has the dance with percussions first and then the martial arts part with weapons and all
Nice place,"Managed to catch some leftover of cherry blossom up at the N Seoul tower. We took a cablecar up and down as we are Travelling with two young toddlers. The cablecar is big enough to accommodate the stroller ( you do not have to fold them ) which is very convenient for family travelling with young children. It is a very stable ride up and down the tower . If you are fit and strong, the option of hiking up the TOP is also available if you choose not to take the cablecar ride. Nice view from the TOP. Restaurants and souvenir shop is also available up there should you need a bite or coffee break. On a side note, after taking the cablecar ride down, you may choose to walk down to the Main Street ( appro ximately10 mins ) which have a children animated museum. Quite an interesting place with plenty of photos taking opportunity if you are travelling with young children. All in all, is a nice trip up the Tower."
great view.,"i think it's just for looking at the view, and walking around the trees of locks. climb up the slope and you'll see alot of flowers, great for photo taking. "
"For about $10, a killer view of Seoul (it it's not smoggy).","We came here on a clear sunny day, and the smog was less hazy than normal, allowing for a crystal clear view of the Seoul metro area.Do not waste your money unless it is a clear day!"
A must see tourist destination.,"I can't lie, the tower is a bit of a tourist trap, but you can't visit Seoul without seeing it just once! I highly recommend going at night to see the city all lit up - the view is gorgeous.We rode the cable car, which was nothing spectacular, but it felt like a necessary part of the experience.Pro tip: If you're taking a taxi, you may need to ask for Namsan Tower rather than Seoul Tower."
Busy tourist attraction ,Beautiful place to go at night time. Will see many teenage couples there. Cable cars are very full and busy. The entire place is busy overall.
nice view,"peaceful place, suitable place for family vacation. before u go to namsan tower u can go to namdaemun market first for shopping(souvenir, t-shirt ext) "
A must go place when visiting seoul,"Though tower can go up with cable car, recommend to walk up as the scenery are amazing, fresh air, green tree and view of the city."
Picturesque view,"The climb was arduously hard especially for people with weak legs. It was steep... But the view was picturesque, you can see the whole city including the sea and mountains. The place is filled with beautiful flowers. Aside from that, there's a lot of places there where you can take pictures. View aside, if you're with your special someone, it's a place for you. You will enjoy the place with locks, the benches and displays for lovers. The souvenir shops carry a lot cute and unique items. However, they are more expensive compared to the other shops who also sells souvenirs."
Great place to be if you are in Seoul,Nice view of the city in the day as well as in the night. You should go to Seoul Tower if you are in Seoul.
Namsan tower,Namsan tower is very nice place.. U can choose either want to walk or use cable car.. The place is many of love padlock. I like an environment there... 
Towers above Seoul,"There is a cable car which runs regularly to the top. It cost 13,500 won. We managed to go late in the afternoon, which made it possible to see the city at sunset and with the city lights.On the windows surrounding the tower are distances to world cities.There are platforms outside to enjoy the panoramic views.The only food available are popcorn, soft drinks, and candy."
Another popular place for Cherry Blossom,Don't miss the pork cutlet rice after your walk of cherry blossom. There is a row of good restaurant for you to try..
Nice tourist spot up the hill,One of the star attractions of Seoul is the Seoul tower. You can locate it from distance as well as its quite high and also located on the hill. Nice place to visit.
"See it on TV, be there yourself!",We always see this place in Korean dramas... Be there yourself in the late afternoon to experience the day and night of N Seoul Tower! *Do rem to bring a lock if you want to make some wishes! ✌
Seoul Tower (N. Seoul Tower),"An elevator takes you up and you can see 360 views of the city. It's really spectacular, especially considering South Korea is 70 % mountain and one cannot see the horizon. Being that high up you can see for miles. There is of course the requisite shopping when you are tired of the views. It is worth the trip. If you have a fear of heights, not to worry, there is plenty of heavy glass and metal posts so one doesn't get the sense they will fall. Do use the restroom on the floor below - there are views from the restroom as well."
pretty day or night,"Visible from many places, including Banana Backpackers, very appealing. Even at the base of the tower the views are great. "
Nice View ,They have nice view when u reaches the top of the tower. They have created this tower into a Lover Tower too which u can buy a love lock to lock it into the love tree or the side railing. 
Day and Night Views are Awesome,"The Tower itself is cool. The observation deck has an amazing view (both day and night). The area around N. Seoul Tower is beautiful. You can walk up the trail to the tower or take the cable car, either way it will be an enjoyable experience for you. It's alot of walking if you want to walk up the tower, but great exercise."
"To see city view, should visit here ""N Seoul Tower""","If you would like to see city view, you should visit here ""N Seoul Tower"", you can take a bus to N Seoul Tower, or take a cable car to be there. Once I visit here last time, I am going to buy ticket to see view and visit museum on the top tower, the staff is not nice to me. I asked staff (women) about what is the different between Package A or B for example. And then seem that she shouted on me. She is so rude. She might get tired from work but this is a service job. Staffs should have a service mind especially tourists who are not understand Korean Language, she should improve herself to have a better service.Anyhow, apart from this, the location is quite nice, the weather is so good. Lots of families and tourists visiting here. And very nice shot here for taking photos."
N Seoul Tower is a must,"If you visit seoul,you must visit N Seoul Tower..this tower is a symbol of korea..dont forget to bring your padlock and write your name and your couple also..."
Ntertaining! :D,"A must visit for any season of the year! There is a cafe, a museum, a super cool lift that goes up to space and pf course, a great view from above. "
Fantastic views,The views from the top of the tower are fantastic. You can walk the whole 360 degrees and see for miles. You can even enjoy a drink and some yummy things to eat. A great feature are the directions and distances of a number of places around the world as you walk around the viewing platform. An absolute must visit.
N Seoul Tower is romantic place,First time i get this place. My eyes is look toward the bear that hanging on the tower.. It was a nice place.. The lock of love is looks like in the other city like paris or etc..
"Fun, but the view is not great","The view from the Tower is not so different from the base of the tower in my opinion. The glass at the top is not as transparent/too much glare so you can only see when you are right up to the window (whereas I have been to other towers and it's completely clear from wherever you stand). Having said that it's pretty economical to go up (10,000 per person, 21,000 for two people plus a huge popcorn and two drinks!) Popular couples spot but fun for families and solo travellers as well :)"
Great view!,"We went up on a very foggy evening so it was so cold and the view is not so good, nevertheless, it was a very good place to visit. We can still see a great night view despite of the fog. For those who are fit, a walk in the park would be best... plus the Cherry Blossoms on your way up is an added attraction. "
Tower worth the trip :) ,"Forget the bus or taxi going here. Take the cable car instead :) The scenic view, although relatively a short distance, and the experience is what you get your money's worth actually. This place is where past meets present and gives you a sneak peak of the future. The 360 degree view of the entire city of Seoul is breathtaking. Oh, and the elevator? See it for your self :) "
Beautiful View of Seoul for $10USD,"so i ended up trekking miles, up the hill, through the park, only to realize there is a bus stop near Seoul station. The view is magnificent, you see all of Seoul and the relative distances it is to other cities around the world. The observatory is about 10000Won which is about $10 usd. Not bad just to go up to the tower and see the city. They offer various packages which is totally unnecessary( beer and popcorn etc.) or a booking at their restaurant( right next to the ticket box office) They have gift shops, Twosome Coffee/tea shop, and a restaurant (booking required). They let you stay without time limit, and you can even pee with a view(men's room) LOL. The bus station takes you to seoul station and is a lot easier than the trek(it was raining) it costs only $3usd. From up top, you can see cherry blossoms, and the beautiful landscape. Worth it!"
One of the top landmark in Seoul.!,"It is one of the most popular landmark in Seoul so if you have time, head to the N Seoul Tower. The view from the mountian is stunning!. There is a cable car which can take you up there but you can also walk up ( about 3 km) if the weather is nice. There are some restaurants up there as well, so it is nice to spend a few hours there. "
Iconic Visiting Place in Seoul,"A must visit during ur days in Seoul. Went up to the Seoul tower and had a panoramic view of Seoul city. It was amazing. You can have a walk up to the Seoul Tower or take public transport, both will give you different experience. "
Beautiful! ,"My 6 year old son, 63 year old mother loved our visit to the N Seoul tower. It was amazing! Going to the observatory deck was a beautiful experience. Great view of the city as well as the Namsan mountain. It was cherry blossom season so we had the opportunity to really get up close and personal. Best way to see cherry blossoms in full bloom in Namsan mountain. Loved the love locks area as well, most especially if you're a KDrama fan. Weather is good at the top during Spring. Loved it. Would go back again with husband. Maybe try going there at night for a different experience. "
Great view from the top!,"Namsan Seoul Tower is a great place to see a view of Seoul. Take note that to take the cable car to the tower area is a fee by itself, and to go up to the tower is another fee. So be prepared. Best time to go here would be at night, as you get to see a beautiful night view of Seoul from here. Can get pretty crowded too."
Quite a view,the tower affords a pretty amazing view of Seoul as well as the beautiful hillside park surrounding the Tower. Be careful about letting someone talk you into walking up the hill. It is longer than you think. 
Spectacular view,"We had this included in our tour of the city, and it was a amazing view from the top. Very busy, but worth it. You get to see the schemer scale of the city from up,here, although I'm told that visibility can be poor when the pollution from China drifts across the city,miso avoid if it's not a clear day. The trip up to the base of the tower itself can be via cable car or walking if your energetic, but the cable car is quite fun. Great way to see the city."
Nice View of Seoul,We took the cable car up and it had just started getting foggy so by the time we were up there we couldn't see Seoul but on a nice day you can see for miles my wife's sister told us. There was also a restaurant up there which you have to climb stairs to get to and beyond.. To see all of this you must be in good physical shape. 
"Not bad, but the park is better ","A bit too tourist-y for my taste, but the surrounding park is well worth having a stroll in. Walk in the park and if you have time try the tower! "
Scenic view of Korea,A right choice to travel up to Namsan Park in the evening to catch the sunset view. Magnificent panoramic view of the night scene of Korea. A must-go place if you want to catch the night view of Korea in the lovers' park. :)
Feel like spring ,We came here when green leaves started growing and some petals were on the wooden walking bridges . It's nice and lovely but busy. Worth to visit one time. 
Awsome view ,"What an amazing place to visit in seoul. Even if you dont want to pay to go up the tower, just standing outside you have a great view. The Love Lock wall was ny favorite. Make sure to buy a lock, write your names, and lock it amongst the other lovers. Was awsome attraction"
Beautiful view of seoul ,I liked the idea of lockers we was having our luggage of shopping and we wasn't sure if there is large locker to put the bag on it and there was We enjoyed the view of the seoul then we enjoyed the museum there and we had our Coffee on nature it was amazing experience 
Nice tower but expensive,"Nice area nice view to the Seoul city. You can drive up, jogging up or take the cable car up. We took the cable car. But the price for the ride was not cheap. The cable car was lousily designed compared to cable car at MaoKong,Taiwan or Langkawi, Malaysia. It was a short ride as well.The scenery around the tower was great. We could see the lights of Seoul city from a high area. There were lots of gate there for couple to install their ""love locks"". To go up the tower need extra entrance fee. Thus we decided not going up to the tower. "
Go-able. But not a must.,"I been visit to KL tower, Petronas Twin Tower. However I felt it is not a must place to visit in Seoul if you want to see something cultural.There is this ""Love Lock"" area in the ground floor of N Seoul Tower which is quite a scenery similar to Paris Love Lock."
Fabulous panorama views of Seoul City,"Great views of Seoul, especially at night. You can purchase a lock there and affix it to the fence. A cable car takes you to the base of the tower. There is a cafe and observation deck at the top."
Not to be missed,"Beautiful views, great walk up and a must do in Seoul. Take your time on the way up to admire the scenery and enjoy a nice meal when you arrive at the Tower. Great way to spend the day."
Great view over Seoul,"...on a clear day, that is. When it's hazy you still see a lot, though. If you don't want to climb the hill, take the cable car. "
Good place to view Seoul,"Went up by lift, down by cable car. Nice view of the city. Can see cherry blossom too (April).. Will recommend to anyone who wants to hv a good view of Seoul.."
Summit View,Scenic view of Seoul without having to go up the tower. Just at the foot of the Tower at the Summit a nice walkway of Cherry Blossom.
Not the best tower,"Been to Macau tower and Crowne plaza Cebu...and N SeoulTower is no bettter. But the location is indeed ideal for sightseeing, though the way to get there may be tough for newcomers.What stood out is the viewdeck with the names of major cities around the world indicating the countries and the distance from the Seoul tower.Suggest a traveler visits in the morning for a better appreciation of the view."
"Didn't go up the tower, (relatively expensive) but worth going to","Set in park land and accessed either by cable car or a path through the park. Good idea to get cable car up and walk down. Views even from foot of tower are spectacular and worth seeing at night. Also there, there is a daily beacon lighting ceremony (11am) and martial arts display (3pm)"
Seoul Tower ,"A nice few hours visit, you can enjoy walking up instead of using cable car, stairs are not that steep and not having many steps, so can enjoy the views of Seoul more and through the tress : ) A place for couples to put love lock on : ) I love the chair designed for couple to get closer when taken photos, haven't had the chance to test when travel solo : )"
360 degree view,"Talk about as far as the eye can see! The climb to the tower was ok as we took the lower route. There is another route that goes a higher uphill which was steeper and that's what we walked down to our bus from. There are a lot of things you can do at N Seoul Tower aside from going up to the observation deck. There are open viewing decks where you can hang out with your family and friends, you can explore the little shops and eat at the restaurants. You can also bring a padlock and lock it to certain parts in the complex. All in all a fun experience. "
Amazing,Great views and good culture brilliant all round I enjoyed going up the cable car and also seeing how far we were above sea level and the distance to different countrys
Great view!!!,The cable car ride was awesome. We didn't get the chance to get to the tower due to time restrain. Some of our lady friends got to try on the national costume. Restos are available around the area.
Best place for cherry blossom viewing!,I'm glad my friend and I decided to go Namsan tower to try our luck for cherry blossoms after the end of youeido cherry blossom festival. This location has more cherry blossoms in bloom minus the crowd and you can get wonderful pictures. We took the shuttle bus and drop off at the base at the mountain. Awesome view during the hike up. Easy walk and very relaxing with the cool weather. Took about an hour with photo taking.
Breathtaking view,Its a must in seoul specially during spring We took the bus strolling through sakura with amazing view of the city from upMany restaurants and cafes just take your drink and enjoy the view at sunsetLovers buy lockers and make wishesIts a must
Very nice evening with someone special.,"Namsan tower has changed drastically since our last visit there in 1983, at that time for security reasons it was prohibitive to take pictures from the tower. Even though it has become more touristy it is still a great place to visit. You have to take a bus to the tower; you cannot drive yourself or take a taxi to the tower. However buses are plentiful and it is inexpensive just use your T-Money card or pay in won. Have to walk to the tower once dropped off by the bus. It is a nice uphill walk. The only drawback is there are a lot of Chinese tourist and their social etiquette is probably worst than Koreans, they are loud and will just walk over you to get that perfect picture of a flower that everyone else is taking a picture of. Once you get to the tower it costs 10,000 won per person where all the information is in Korean, you can buy a package ticket which includes popcorn and a drink of choice (soda or beer.) Take the elevator up to the observation platform and see an amazing sight of Seoul, great to take pictures during the day, catch the sunset, and then the city lights. Take a pair of binoculars they will be helpful. No time limit and you can stay until closing at 10:30. Minimal lines for the elevator, there are a lot of clean bathrooms and many places to eat. Have to take a bus #3 off of Namsan which was cheap down to the Hamilton Hotel. Overall it is a very nice experience and I highly recommend it. NOTE: Namsan means South Mountain so the tower is the South Mountain Tower (Namsan Tower) the N does not mean north it means Namsan and it confuses a lot of foreigners, so adhere to this and you won’t be a confused tourist."
Must visit during Cherryblossom season,"Although we visited the Seoul at different times of the year, the recent visit during the cherryblossom season was the best. From Seoul station the blue bus takes you to the public library from where the scenic walk takes you all the way up to the tower and back. The place visited by many locals and tourists. That time the carparks are overloaded and buses continuously take tourists up and down Namsan hill. So many scening areas along the way invite for making pictures or picnic."
Beautiful scenery,Beautiful at night. We did not go up the tower but only went up to the platform to do our locks of love. Even that scenery is nice... much less the one at the top! Go at night for a better view!
Worth to visit,It is a landmark of Seoul and is very charming during night time. A must visit place if you were in Seoul. Walking distance (10mins) from MyeongDong subway station.
Great spot for photoshot!,"If you are looking for the highest point in the city of seoul, this might be the one. There are several food served with great city views and for sure the legendary key park, where there is believe if you write down your name and your spouse's, your love will last forever!"
Disappointing visit,nothing much to shop around. only good thing is the night view. shuttle bus was crowded. left after an hour 
Very nice view,It was hard to locate the cable car to get up to the Tower by looking at the map. We finally took a cab to the cable car station. Waited about 30 minutes for the cable car. Maybe because it was a weekend so it was very busy. Prices are quite steep for food n drinks there. 
nice view,better take the oreum travellator than to walk from Pacific hotel. we went up from pacific hotel (tiring) to the cable car station. 
Perfect spring trek to N Seoul Tower!,Spring is a perfect time to go to Namsan Park and walk up to N Seoul Tower. The sights are just beautiful! Wear your best walking shoes and don't forget your cameras!
Best view of Seoul city,"Not necessary to take the cable car up. A walk up was nice too. Although the tower was pretty touristy, a good mix of local crowd was there also!"
很美的夜景,"On a good day you can have a nice view over Seoul, but the queues for the cable car can be over an hour long, so be prepared to wait. 一個很好的一天，你可以有在首爾的美景，但纜車隊列可以超過一小時多頭，所以準備等待。夜景真的很美很適合與情人一起約會❤️"
Fun night great view ,Fun time! Cable car was experience to the top and the evening view was beautiful. They have cafes and two restaurants. 
Great Views From The Top,Worth a visit for the photo ops from the top observation deck. Can be crowded. Be patient and you will be rewarded.
Pick your day for a good view,"With the changing air quality in Seoul you need to choose your day to ensure a good view. The tower is lit each night with a colour to predict the air quality the following day. Green is good.Good combi packages available to go up the tower, but also good views from the bottom. Lots of options to get to the tower: bus; taxi; cable car; or walking! A walk down to the park is a good way to finish, or walk down to the Hanock village for a bit of culture too. Lots of options at all price levels for eating."
"Fun journey, good eats",A walk up to the tower is rewarded with attractions and fun foods. Great views in the fall when the leaves have changed colors. Enjoy some ice cream or churro and a burger. Or choose to dine at one of the other locations around the base. It also makes for a great romantic date! 
"Very cool, very cold","If you are into K-drama, this is a must for you, The colourful locks were very nice and captivating that we can't help but reading the notes attached to it one by one. Also, you can see the whole Seoul from the tower."
On top of Seoul,"There's no where in town to get a better view of Seoul. Here you can see the whole city from a higher point of view and then you get to buy some nice souvenirs and have some quality food. If you're going to Seoul, this place is a must. It lets you view the city in a whole other perspective."
Expensive and time consuming,"Queuing for going up and going down, we spent more than 2 hours doing that. I didn't find the view as impressive as I was expecting it."
Good evening out,"Great place to view the setting sun and the gorgeous seoul cityscape. It's touristy but, you'll only be here if you're a tourist-ha! There are two ways to get here 1) cable car 2) walk along the city walls - its a long walk, and for the adventurous. There are a ton of eateries atop. Go if you have an evening to space, go for sunset. Its in Namsan, so if you're staying somewhere in Namsan, can walk to the cable car station."
Nice view.... of course!,"Another tower, another quick lift, another revolving restaurant (not tested). This is Seoul Tower which, obviously offers splendid of all sides of the city, and for this it is worth the queue and the detour. No discussion, especially because Seoul is a complex and diverse city with all its hills and its difficult too appreciate it globally otherwise. This being said, the tower itself is nothing special, even rather on the dated side in comparions with many others (for example the windows are straight (and dirty) which is not ideal to take pictures). Th cable car to reach the tower is very nice too and offers nice views on central Seoul and the mountains."
"Good view, but does not rank high amongst global observation towers","The observation deck is small, and there is not much story-telling or explanation of the places you can see from the tower. The gifts sold on site are exquisite, and that's the best part of the place. "
Go before sunset ,We experienced fantastic views of the city on a bright and clear spring day. We timed it so we would see the sunset and Seoul at night... highly recommend doing it this way but allow time for the cable cars as queues can be quite long. We enjoyed the walk back down rather than queuing for the cable car again. 
great views,The view from the tower is amazing. One can see all throughout Seoul. One of the cool things we found was the different cities listed with the kilometers away from the tower.
I'm a normal person to trip somwhere,Yes I have a habit of going to high point when I visit to somewhere.That's what I said like the title buy anyway it was nice
Shows so much history,"Is like Eiffel for Paris, Burj Al Arab of Dubai... N tower is a tower that somehow marketed to represent Seoul... Which is the reason why it is also called the Seoul Tower. There are restos in top of the tower and cafes on the ground floor. This is were you'll find the famous love locks. They have a viewing area on top of the tower but there is also a deck on the grounds where you can have a view of the city. "
Amazing View,"You get to see the whole city from just one tower. I recommend not to go at Christmas because it'll get extremely crowded and will take hours to get to the top of the tower. When you get to Namsan, there are little stores that you can go to, like get ice cream. There are a few stores that sell food, and there's a gift shop too. "
amazing night scene,Need to take cable car to go to the tower. Estimated time to get into the cable car is about 45 minutes as always long long queue.. night scenery from the tower is amazing.. N seoul tower also famous for love locks... unfortunately laser lights show was temporary suspended during my visit in Mac due to regulatory inspections...
I thought the highlight is the elevator,I thought the highlight is the elevator with fancy animations but I was wrong. It is the view on top as well as the experience getting in and out of there. 
Beautiful namsan tower ,"We took subway to Myeong dong and walked abt 15 mins to the cable car station . Another opinion was to walk up which we are not so adventurous and no stamina along the way.. There's many shops with fancy deco and a line of restaurants b4 reaching the station . Everything is so organized at the station as everyone lined up orderly .one shortfall is the toilet .. Only 1 cubicle and it's pretty stressful with ppl waiting outside if u need the loo..Upon arrival at the tower , it's so beautiful !!There's a part outdoor where u see many 'love' locks along the walkway ... There's a trick eye museum there but the queue was very long with tourist groups so we decided to give it a miss ..Love the souvenir shop, many nice items that u bring home for momento . :)"
Go on a clear day!,"Initially planned for a hike up but it was way too cold so we took the bus up and boy were we thankful. It's quite a long journey up. Didn't really managed to see the sunset as it was pretty cloudy. It's a tower. View of the skyline from above is a sight to behold, not possibly captured through camera lenses. Eat at the restaurant! Churro there are delicious. On a good day it'll be a nice to walk up."
Great view,Great view from the tower to see the city even though from indoor (observation deck). We went up and coming back using cable car and during a night time it was nice with all the lights around the city.At the plaza area they have fence full of padlock (love padlock ^_^) you can buy padlock there and write your wish and lock it along the fence. They have restaurant/cafe as well. I would recommend to go here.
A Must,This place will help you to see the entire city in few seconds. I visited it during the day and I really enjoyed the location.
Top of the world!,"Start your adventure with the cable car ride to the base of N Tower. Experience the Entertainment on the stage below the tower, take a pad lock for your loved one... You'll see when you get up there...everyone does it! Take the ride in the super fast lift to the top of N Tower for AMAZING 360 degree views of the enormous city of Seoul... Fab afternoon out.. "
U dont have to go up,"U dont have to go up.if u r budget traveler ,just to reach up the mountain is great and free.Before sun set was WOW"
Must-visit sightseeing place,"It's quite an easy access to the tower, you can take bus number 5 from Myeongdong station exit number 3. If you feel a bit more adventurous you can walk uphill from behind Pacific Hotel in Myeongdong too for 15-20 minutes to board the cable car. It's gonna be full of people but I think it will never be too crowded. You can go to the top and look at Seoul (prettiest at night) and you can also get a love lock to put around the chosen area (or just to look around). Obviously there's gonna be A LOT of couples, just a heads-up ;)"
Breath taking view of the city especially at night,"I went up there at night for the very first time during my last travel and the stunning view of the city caught me . Although the place may be a bit crowded during peak seasons, it is still a must-visit especially for first timers. :) "
Nice views,"We took the walk up to the base of tower and it was quite pleasant. While we decided not to actually go up the tower because we had already been to plenty of towers earlier in our Asia trip. However, the base of the tower had plenty to offer. Good scenery and there was a cultural performance at the courtyard when we arrived. Otherwise, fairly ordinary but we were glad we skipped the cable car and walked down the opposite side from the way we came up."
loved the tour specially if you are a Kdrama fan!,It was really nice we had to take a cable car and walk up and we saw Seoul city site and it was beautiful. It is nice and worth the visit. if you forgot to bring a lock don't worry they sell them up there.=)
View was amazing,Despite the weather that day (-6 C) we braved the cold just to see the view of Korea from up the tower. We reached the top by cable car (another option is to hike which they said will take 40min). Lining up for the cable car took us about 1 hr though. And it was March when we went there. The view of Seoul's skyline is beautiful. I suggest you go there early at night 
BEAUTIFUL VIEW FROM ATOP,Had a beautiful view of Seoul from the top. Could see Seoul 360 degrees. Fantastic ! Staff at N Seoul Tower are very efficient.
Take the Cable Car,"Enjoyed the cable car ride to the top of the hill where the N Seoul Tower is located and enjoyed the smooth ride up and the opportunity to see the city from above. We didn't go up in the tower as it was starting to get foggy and the view was becoming limited, but we did enjoy the park like area at the top and the thousands and thousands of token to love in the form of locks - yes, locks everywhere you looked! Quite the sight and a top 10 destination while in Seoul. There are places to get some refreshment or have a picnic."
Mesmerizing Views,Best Experience and a must visit place in Seoul. We took a cable car to top and the view was awesome. 
Great on a clear day or night,We took the cable car up and walked down I think that's the best way of doing it personally. We thought it was great during the week not a lot of people and great views just a tad expensive
Amazing views! ,"A must see tourist attraction! Views of the entire city are wonderful. We didn't go all the way up to the top of the tower, as you can see all views from the exterior viewing areas. "
A little underwhelming,"Went here at night so the experoence might be different during the day.It is a long ride to the top and when you get there you can view the city from behind a 360 degree glass viewing deck. Aside from the shops and food not much to do here, I would rather have spent the time doing something else."
"Cool view, not worth the money","It's a really nice view, but not really worth the wait and fre to go to the observation deck. You get pretty much the same view at the base of the tower. If you are going up, do it in the evening when it's dark. It's so much cooler to see the city lit up by all the lights."
Nice easy walk up through the trees. Good views at many of the stopping points. Nice clean air and easily accessed from ,Don't bother with the cable car. Easy walk to the top. Good views from stopping points. Would highly recommend going. Can do up one side and down the other.
Long queues but worth a visit off-peak,"We visited Seoul tower at night. We caught the cable car which was great and once we arrived, paid to enter. View was amazing!! Try and go on a clear night and if you can, avoid weekends. There's a queue for the cable car; queue for the lift to the tower and queue for coming back down in the lift and for back on the cable car.. Long waits but great view!!"
Cool Experience While in Seoul...,"Seoul Tower is definitely a cool place to visit for your first time in Seoul. Keep in mind that it does take an effort to get up to it (a pretty steep paved inclined road), but once you get up to the tower area, the views are worth it. It was pretty cloudy the day we went up to the top of the tower, but the views were still great to experience anyway. Another cool part is the ""love locks"" area. Definitely check that out and add a lock if you're there with your special someone! :)"
Top View,"Namsan Tower is accessible two ways. One is on a hilly road (my taxi went this way) and the other less slopping on foot (discovered this on the way down) and comes out opposite the Myeongdong Substation, near Prince Hotel.It would have been a nice night view but I went in the afternoon and still get to see the city below. As I hop into the cable car, I can't help but think of Lee Min Ho and Goo Hye Sun in Boys Over Flowers when they were trapped there overnight. All the surrounding trees were rather bare and not much flowers in sight at this time, perhaps later after the rain.In the main square there is cultural performance at 3.00pm and I was lucky to catch it. Very enjoyable.There's a small souvenir shop, a couple of coffee outlets, a hamburger place and a few eateries (but they appear to be closed). Many lovers and couples swear their dying love by clicking locks onto many of the railings (just like at the Great Wall in Beijing). I missed the revolving restaurant !"
Nice view ,We came here but not going up to the tower. We only see the suroundings. You have to pay if you want to go up to the tower. There is a coffee shop under the tower open at 10am. There is a love padlocks area. So you can bring your own padlocks. You also can get a nice city view from the love padlocks area. 
Amazing ,I wanted to visit this tower so much. It was so peaceful and beautiful. This has to be in your top 10 places to visit in Seoul.
City view from the top of Seoul tower,"Beautiful scenery spread everywhere.. Cold and windy, you better put your coat on. Even more beautiful at night, because it has a light show. But, there is not enough restaurant or even bench to enjoy the view from outside the tower."
Stunning views on a clear day,"We hiked up from the bottom through the park as it was a perfect day (2km ish up). Be aware that there are squat toilets on route not normal ones.The actual tower is great and gives stunning views over the entire city. You can even get a package including entrance, popcorn and beer to go up with. Entry isn't excessive either.This is a must see for visitors to Seoul."
Challenging upward walk with breathtaking Seoul view,"N Seoul Tower ticket costs KRW 10K/pax while buying online via SeoulTravelPass.com costs KRW 7,200/pax only.Took bus 05 from Myeong-dong MRT Stn to N Seoul Tower that cost KRW 1.2K/pax with T-Money card.Need to walk a very steep road to N Seoul Tower.Since the road is very steep it will be slippery when wet so I don't recommend going there during rainy season.Go to the ticketing section to exchange that voucher to a N Seoul Tower ticket.It takes 25sec to reach the N Seoul Tower via lift as per staff.Once inside you can take the skyview of Seoul.There are shops that sells souvenirs while you are still in the tower itself.Going to the G/F take a stair going to the Love Locks where you can see people attaching locks.Took bus 03 from NSeoulTower to Namdaemun since it was the 1st bus that arrived that also goes near to our Seoul hotel."
N Tower known as Namsam Tower,This is located in NamsamGood to see the city view from the hillAlso there is restaurants in N Tower.
Beautiful scenery but avoid weekends,Long queue on Sunday which we visited. The queue took almost 1 hr to get to the base of n seoul tower through the cable car. Be prepared to be packed like sardines in the cable car. We didn't went up to the observatory as it was getting dark. There are souvenir shops and restaurants. We even brought our own locks to lock at the bridge. You can buy locks there. 
Best sunsets in Seoul,"Went on late afternoon, watched the sunset, although a bit crowded, the experience is just fantastic. Besides, coolest bathrooms you will ever experience"
amazing view!,"I had an opportunity to hike at Namsan Fortress Trail going to N Seoul Tower. The hike was very worth it! I also visited the Teddy Bear Museum inside. Also, I went up and see a spectacular view of Seoul."
great way to see Seoul,"Getting to the tower is not an easy peasy thing to do, as if you do not take the cable car (which i did not) you have to walk up an enormously steep hill to get to the tower. However, once up there the views of the city are amazing! Make sure to go on a clear day so you can really get a good view of Seoul. Sunset is best!! Also, take a lock with you so can can add it to the 1000's that are up there attached to every possible place. "
AVOID the weekends!,"We visited N Seoul Tower on a Sunday and it is one of the worst decision ever. Walking up to the cable car is simple and straight forward from Myeong Dong. When we arrived at the cable car terminal, we were informed that the waiting time would be about 40 to 60 mins. There were many Koreans and Tourists waiting to head up to the tower. The day we were there, visibility was low. We still decided to head up to the observatory deck and was disappointed as we were unable to see the scenary clearly. The deck is also small and packed with people. Not sure if it's worth the money to head up. Neverthless it's definitely one of the to do attractions in Seoul."
Long line for cablecar but great views,"We went around 4 PM so the lines to buy tickets and board the cable car were about 2 hours long. Once up to the base of the tower by cable car, there are shops and a few things to see, but there are a lot of people awaiting their elevator time slot so it can be crowded. The views from the top are nice and the city lights are very pretty. The line to come down can get long so be careful you aren't stuck at the top near closing time, as you have to remember you need to take not only the elevator down but the cable car (or a long walk down the stairs). I would say it is worth it but budget enough time. (at least 4-5 hours if starting n the late afternoon/evening). . "
A must-go during sunset!,"Love the city view of Seoul that I had while taking the tram up to the N Seoul Tower. Loved the colours during sunset.The night view was superb as well, with the neon colours of the tower."
Beautiful Tower & Surounding,"I love everything here. From the tower, lock of love are and surounding. Its beautiful especially in the evening. The color of the light on the tower will changing in the evening. Last time I came here, there was a Teddy Bear Museum. The museum is gone now. Replace by a few restaurant. I'm happy because they still keeping the Lock of Love area here. So we can put something here to remember.."
Daughter and Mommy ,"Amazing view at night. We took a long one hour and a half hike up to the top, not very smart decision but I have a Wonderful time with my daughter . Love the scenery . "
Hmmmm... It's a lot of money to just go up to the observation deck,"So we took the Namsan Cable Car up to the N Seoul Tower. The cable car ride was about 2-3 minutes... Relatively fast. We bought a one way ticket because we wanted to go to namsangol Hanok village afterwards.... The lady at the counter told us we could take a bus to the Hanok village... If you plan to go to the observation deck of the n Seoul tower, I wouldn't advise getting the combo A package... All that is is admission plus a tub of popcorn and a soft drink...( think movie theatre size ).. The circle we made around the tower upstairs was a small round... Not really worth the money but it is a touristy thing to do... This was ok... Not much different from going up to Taipei 101 or Skydeck 100 in Hong Kong or the tower in Macau..."
Fun evening activity ,"My fiance and I did an evening trip to the N tower. We found it a good sight. The troll ride up, always full, but offered a good view and a cool experience. The view from the decks and the tower especially gives you a great feel for just how huge and expansive Seoul really is. There is the locks of love, countless amounts of them, for the love birds out there.There is some touristy aspects, but not bad. Gotta do this when in Seoul."
Definitely a must visit!,"We had a great time here, enjoying the view. We took the cable car up and it was real easy. The only thing I suggest is that you come here during warm weather. When we visited it was cold and windy!"
. . . And the food isn't bad,"Face it, the reason for eating at ""N"" is the view. And the views were spectacular. We booked for 7:00. Because of the limited space, we were not permitted to ascend to the restaurant until 7:00. But we were able to go to the observation deck (it is included in the dinner price). We saw the Seoul during light as we walked around the tower, at dusk in the observation deck and finally at night in the restaurant when the City was all lit up. We were fortunate to have had clear weather, and the views were spectacular. That brings me to the food. It wasn't bad. In fact, it was very good. The menu is price fixe with several options. Our family all chose beef, which was good. The surprise of the meal was the parmesan soup - which did not sound appealing but was very good. For dessert, the cheese plate was standard fare. But indulge in the homemade snicker bar. It was really good. The meal was not cheap, but were buying the view. The terrific meal was a wonderful bonus."
"Long climb, not sure if worth it",Very long climb and not much to do from the top except take photos and get a nice view of Seoul.Because of the long climb you can easily spend 3 hours in the area which is better spent elsewhere.The viewing area is enclosed so not very romantic. The locks area is cool for couples though!Would just visit this once but there are better places to go.
Good,"all my reviews about seoul are effected with the fact they are not stroller friendly, and if there was by any chance an elevator, again it would be either out of service, or way far.went at night, if you want a view of the city, its better do it during day time."
Pick a clear day to visit,"The tower apparently has a lighting system that signifies the air quality. We lucked out and visited on the clearest day of our trip. You reach the tower by walking up a winding incline or take a cable car (3 minute ride). At the tower, observation decks afford an impressive view, but the best view is from the tower. Tickets may be purchased at the ticket office at the base of the tower. The panoramic views are impressive and they will take your photo (12.000 for 1 5x7 photo or 20.000 for 2) with a green screen to allow changing screens. Food and souvenirs are available for purchase."
sunset viewing,"one must go and catch the sunset here. beautiful surroundings. interesting place. you can enjoy it here solo, with family, or with friends."
Not so good!!!,"I visited seoul tower in the month of July. It was my birthday so I got a good discount for visiting seoul tower. They also offer many foreigners and couples discount. Tower was just fine as there was nothing much to do. View from the top was good and that's all. Get some pictures clicked with a background view and you are done. You can also purchase souvenirs for yourself. We carried out our own lunch so dont have much idea about the food services there. After having our lunch, we visited the alive museum which was right next to the Seoul tower. I would highly recommend you to visit Alive museum if you want to have super fun and planning to visit Seoul tower. Otherwise, visiting seoul tower alone is a complete waste of time in my opinion. Good luck!!! :)"
Great but crowded place,"We had the wrong time to visit N Seoul Tower (there was a scheduled fireworks display and so the place, being up high and a good viewing area, was jampacked with people) so we did not enjoy it much. It was even difficult to get on a bus from somewhere near Myeongdong to N Seoul Tower. If it were a different day, it would have been better :) That aside, I think NSeoulTower area is an entertaining place, with food places, Bear museum, good view of Seoul and a good place to walk around (be prepared if you want to walk uphill though)."
Wonderful View from the Top,"We took the tram to the base of the tower, bought our tickets and rode the elevator to the top. It's worth the extra dollar for the popcorn and soda. The views were spectacular and since this may be my only trip to Seoul I am glad I did it. Then we walk all the way down the hill to find the subway."
Fun place to visit!!,"I went there with a group of 15 people and everyone of them loved it. It's a very romantic place so if you are planning to impress your date, this is it!!!"
Little bit of a disappointment,Easy to get to by metro and shuttle bus. And surrounded by a national park. Go on a clear day though! It's a bit featureless rely but does gave reasonable views over Seoul. It's not expensive and you can spend a couple of hours on the trio including going up the towers 
A view that any camera could love,Specifically recommend visiting Seoul tower during the day near sunrise or sunset as the view is simply astounding. This is a photo worth sharing!
fantastic view with crowd,"This is landmark, one of the most visited site in Korea. It's the highest ground in central Seoul you can observe everywhere especially in good clear weather. But beware, so many tourists will be also there you might have to walk in line and get tired soon. you don't have to spend $$ to get to the top of the tower. The view from the peak itself is beautiful enough. Early morning and late at night are the best time to check out the view."
It's memorable place for couples ,"There is a tower in every country, but N Soeoul Tower will give you special experience. There are special area on the top for couples, families and someone who has got a specific hope. You should buy a padlock before you go, and write your wishes there to use permanent pen. There is a cable car to the summit, but you have a strong legs you can enjoy the beautiful walkway to the summit. Also whenever I go there I go to famous restaurant in front of the area. It's pork cutlet with rice but I can't remember the name of restaurant. "
Nice to visit for a short period of time,"Nice to visit for a short period of time.The view from top of N Tower is fabulous. And, even from the bottom of the tower, the view is very nice. Don't even need to take the elevator up to the top.The only drawback is that have to take a bus up to the tower, which can be a bit inconvenient."
A must go for 1st time traveller,"It's a place when you will really have a great view of the surrounding. For first time traveler, I believe that if you have the opportunity to visit the Tower, grab the opportunity. Especially for those who enjoys watching a beautiful scenery."
Only seen it from the outside,"Have to confess that we never found time to get to the top of the Tower. But it is a pretty visible highlight of Seoul, as it's situated atop a hill. It's often hazy due to pollution and Dust (I'm told the dust come from China), but that makes it more Star Wars -like to me."
Wonderful Seoul Searching,Seoul South Korea is ideal for nature lovers and a romantic place to visit. N Seoul is a nice spot to see the entire view of Seoul. South Koreans are so warm and friendly. Bibimbap food must try. I would definitely return someday.
Good places but still renovated ,"Good places but still renovated was we come, so we unsure what the best value about this places. We just view all the Seoul city view from this places.."
do only if you got nothing else to.,"we took a cab to the cable car station , followed by a 8,000 per person cable car ride up to the tower base. Before taking an elevator to the tower top. Frankly, nothing thrilling, the tower is amongst the lowest in the world."
A great view,"A great 360 view of Seoul. Get there early to avoid the queues. Restrooms and restaurants available so you won't get caught short. 10,000₩. Make sure you have a clear day to visit other wise it's a wasted journey."
DO NOT WALK THERE ,I was stupid enough to want to walk there. DON'T. The road takes you round and round around the tower instead of straight to it. Just take the bus there it's much easier. You can take the bus to the Tower from meongdong. The tower itself was very expensive. Too expensive. So I didn't bother going up there even though it took me an hour and a half to walk there. The view from the bottom of the tower was already nice so I didn't want to pay 22000 won to go further up for apparently nothing. 
Lock your love eternity,I went this place daytime so no idea how it looked like at night......i like that people must walk up there themselves to see a bird eye view from the top. It doesn't matter if you have a gf or bf coz u might catch up someone up there. ^^
Random visit ,If you are in Seoul you must visit the tower really good views from the top. You can hike up to the tower or take the cable cart to the top. Plan for long lines for the cable carts going up and coming back from the tower. 
Panoramic view of Seoul,The view is amazing from the tower where you can the beauty of Seoul. Souvenirs shop is located at the top of the tower and also around the entrance along with cafes. The entrance also surrounded with art work and greenery view.
Perfect spot to view the 'Soul' City..,"Well, nothing much to talk about this place..but the scenery was amazing esp at night. I went in Feb this year, decided not to take the cable car and climb up to the top with my own foot(worst decision ever..), i wish someone would carry me, unfortunately..not be able to find one. I don't spend too much time here, 1hr is enough because its too crowded..people everywhere, really hard to find a good spot for me to take a picture(sighed). But still worth a visit."
Romantic spot with a beautiful view of Seoul,"I've been wanting to come here ever since I first saw that cable car scene from My Lovely Sam Soon and was not disappointed! We planned to arrive during sunset and the hotel I was staying is pretty nearby, so we decided to walk on over. The walk up to the cable car station wasn't bad at all, probably because there is this elevator/ramp hybrid thing that helps you up this last steep portion. The cable cars were really cool to ride in although they do kind of pack you in since there are a lot of people. Once you get to the top you have to climb a few more flights of stairs, which isn't bad, but may be for those with mobility issues. Once you get close to the top you can start to see all the locks of love. There were quite a few vendors selling locks so those looking to lock their love last minute don't have to worry. The view below the tower is really gorgeous although it was a bit windy when we went. There are quite a few restaurants/shops around the bottom of the tower for those who are hungry from the climb. The tower costs an additional extra to go up to and we bought the package deal in which popcorn/drinks are included. It's funny how they play this scene that you're blasting off to space as you ascend in the elevator. Once you get to the top of the tower, it's pretty much a 360 degree view of Seoul with souvenir shops in the middle. I like how on each window it tells you how far you are from a major city in the world and it's nice to sit down and chill next to a pretty view . There's not a wholeee lot to do here besides admiring the scenery, but the entire experience was definitely worth it and fun!"
Good to see,"The place is beautiful in the night , it has beautiful views and there is shop were you can buy lock and lock it in place they say it will make your love together . Then you can go up the tower it show the city view and there is restaurant and souvenir . In all it's good "
Romantic and breathtaking view.,"Twice I've been there during winter. I love walking up the slope and looking at the scenery and how the trees cast shadows on the path. I'm not sure how it'll feel for summer though. The wind can be a little too much for winter and high altitude. I think u have to go up the tower itself so that you won't get blown away. Same, I think scenery up the tower is best when you go just before sunset so that you can enjoy 2 different feel. "
Great outing to see the skyline of Seoul ,"We took the bus (2, 3, or 5) up to the last stop, and walked the rest of the way up to the peak. The last stretch is pretty steep to say the least so if you have mobility concerns, please check before you turn up. We paid 10,000 wons each to go up the tower and from you can get a panoramic view of the city. Worth the visitIf you have purchased the T-money card, please note that there are some discount coupons that come in the box and there is a 10% coupon for N Seoul tower. "
A disappointing trip,There is practically nothing to do once you are up in the building though there are quite a number of activities (eg. wax museum) at the bottom of the tower (but you have to pay for it). Basically there are only 3 floors accessible for tourists and 2 of them are just restaurants. There is practically nothing to do on the top floor which is just souvenirs shops and the view of Seoul. 
Cooling visit in the morning ,"Hi all,My guide bring me the first stop is to the seoul tower 3D dimension which was good experience for mine young kids and if I did not recall wrongly which locate on the 2nd floor and the 4th or 5th floor was the open space where many locks was locked on the fences say once u put a lock with the person u loved it will be ""forever love"""
Beautiful!,A must see! Make sure you visit in the late afternoon and stay into the night. The views are incredible and you won't soon forget your visit.
Beautiful view of Seoul.,"Bring you hiking shoes when you visit Seoul. A walk up Namsan Mountain to the base of the Seoul Tower is an absolute must. Locals of all ages do this hike, so do not be intimidated by a little uphill walking. Paths are well marked, well lit and well maintained. Namsan is pretty at anytime of the year, but spring and fall are exceptionally stunning. At the top, the views of Seoul are fantastic. I find it really memorable on a clear night. This will be one of the highlights of your trip to Seoul. "
very fun experience,nice view and the trick eye museum was really so funny! loved the experience and had really good time.the view is also nice!
Good view and some Cultural Events,"On our fist day in Seoul, we rode the Seoul City Tour bus to get an overview of the city. We got off at the N Seoul Tower to get the panoramic view. It really is a fantastic view of Seoul; you really see how huge the city is! There were also some cultural events going on, touristy, but entertaining. There were people dressed in traditional clothes performing different acts."
Beautiful,Amazing views of Seoul. On a clear day you can see much of he city and surrounding areas. There are some nice cafes and restaurants at the bottom of the tower. It is a fun family day to walk up the trail and then have a ice cream at Cold Stone Creamery
Nice view,"Went through subway + staircasessss + uphill + cable car. It was a winter, freezing with the strong wind. Otherwise, the whole seoul is under the foot. Nice place for photo shooting. Worth for visiting, although is tiring. Haha"
Sights of Seoul,The view from the top was really nice. You will see various sights of seoul. I love that you can put locks and eat here. Really romantic place. Just prepare a long line during weekends and night time since this the time that couples date. I suggest also riding the cable car since its fun and affordable.
2 hour trip stylee,"Hit the cable car walk round the summit once then bail. Amazing views, inexpensive with a sweet cable ride in & out. Highlights: viewsLowlights: not much education as to why it exists. "
highest point in seoul,"I think going to the N Seoul Tower is a must when in Seoul. Unfortunately, we walked from the train station to the cable car station so it was quite tiring! I had to stop a few times to catch my breath. When you get to the cable car station, more stairs!The cable car is I think W8000 for a round trip ticket. This will bring you right up to the platform where you can walk about and this is where lovers leave their locks all along the fence and even on the trees. There are restos and coffee shops and also a gift shop.To go up the Tower, you have to pay an additional amount which I forgot. Too bad it was a bit cloudy the day that we went so you couldn't really appreciate the view.Still a nice place to go to and include in your itinerary :)"
"Wonderful view, a prominent landmark.","You can see this tower from almost anywhere in the city, it always helped me navigate and kept me orientated. It is beautiful at night and and the view is beyond compare. "
Walk to the top!,We opted for walking up to the hill from our guesthouse and ended with the magnificent view of Seoul. Worth it!! 
Beautiful Views,This is a great place to go to get oriented on Seoul or go on a romantic stroll. The love locks are a nice touch too.
go there at night!!,"who knew koreans were so romantic?? all the love locks are amazing, even though i couldnt really read them. you can buy them at the gift shop and they come with a small sharpie, just remember to make sure you open the lock first. "
The rooftop of Seoul,The tower sits on top of Namsan mountain which is already very high up above the city so I didn't pay to go up the observation deck. There are a few free viewing platforms at the base of the tower and the views are superb. I came up here via Seoul City Tour bus which I think is great value.
Good time! ,"Great views, can get photos done with ticket purchase to observation deck. Cute wall where couples, people like to ""lock in"" there promises. Large area where they often put on shows and artists who will sketch a caricature for 15000KRW per person. Cable car will transport u to Myeongdong for 6000KRW from the Namsan. Not accessible by car. From Myeongdong/Junggu area take bus #2 or #5. "
Disappointing but a must-see,"The N Seoul Tower is the symbol of Seoul, a must-see. You can either walk, take a bus or a cable-car to go up. If it's not too cold I would recommend walking, you have several view points that are worth it when you walk.The view is wonderful from the tower. However it is very touristic (and all the Korean couples come here!) and going up in the tower is not worth it (expensive and the windows are not clean enough to take pictures).The view from N Seoul Tower is amazing by night!"
Nice view on the top,"You can get the teleferic to get to the top (less than 5 minutes) or get there walking (many stairs, be aware). Whatever the way you choose, you have a view of the city, and you're able to get a dinner on the restaurant on the top with such view. Apart from that, is a simple TV tower, nothing special except for the colors which can be viewed in the distance. Plenty of padlocks from lovers, french bridge style, good place to go with your couple..."
Amazing city view,"Namsan tower is located in the middle of seoul and its the highest place . from it , you can almost see all Seoul from above. you can go up : 1-by bus2-by cable car3-by footi recommend going there at dawn to see the view in the morning and watch sunset and see the view at night. also this place is famous for love locks."
Not easy to go there. Only go there with clear sky.,"Only lover locks and the tower itself not attractive enough. This place should includes more restaurants and great view and platform for taking photo. Maybe some special design structure. For young travellors, what attract us is nice view and relaxing place. If there is some linkages with the hiking trail, it would definitely attract young peopel to come who can inject more energy for this place."
Get an amazing view of Seoul!,"Another of Seoul's amazing spots. Walk around the tower and get multiple views of the city. Take a break at one of their cafes or restaurants which also offer a great view while you eat. Leave your mark behind by placing a lock on of the ""lock trees"" or fences. "
Nothing really amazing,"Packed up with tourist, expensive everything, lots of queuing and too commercial. Ok, young couples might enjoy this thing, but for others I wouldn't suggest. The view was nice for sure, but overall experience was a bit lame."
Well run great views,Spectacular view of Seoul from a tower on top of a mountain. Very touristy yet worthwhile. Go on a clear day for best views. 
We enjoyed,"Entrance fee was pretty expensive, therefore we finally decided to stay just under the tower, but even from here the view to Seoul was amazing and we enjoyed time spent there."
Second Time here and still love it! <3,"It's my second time in South Korea and I couldn't resist going back here. The view is priceless, you have no idea that Seoul itself its sooooooooo huge. You'll love all the restaurants and things to shop up there."
Great views of city and good restaurant,"Been up twice now. The second time the clouds got in the way, but this is rare. The restaurant is really good and not bad value given the context."
A Fun Place To Visit With Your True Love,It was fun to see all of the love locks that couples had left in this place. And the views were great. Lots of people though!
Quite expensive but a great view,This attraction isn't the cheapest in Seoul but it's definitely good if you want great views of Seoul. The first time I went it was foggy and I couldn't really see much so they give me a ticket to go back. This was good for me because I was in Korea for a year but not so good if you are only there for a short period of time. So it's definitely worth checking the weather before going. I've been both day and night time. During the day it's a nice walk through Namsan Park up to the tower and there was different games and activities going on outside of the tower. On the night time the tower is lit up and the views from the top were amazing! So it really just depends what you want to see. I've walked up and took the cable car. The walk was nice but can take a while so again it depends if you like the walk or just want to see the tower. The restaurant in the tower is nice and you can get a combo ticket for a meal and entry but it is also very expensive. There's a gift shop in the tower also. 
Perfect View,This is totally worth your time. You get to see the whole city by just going to the top of this tower.The elevator ride is already an attraction. 
Beautiful sights,"Seoul tower was amazing! The views were great and there was so much to do inside the tower like take fun pictures, eat and of course shop! The hike to the tower was fun although tiring for those not in the best shape, but worth it!"
Be prepare to walk a lot,"Nice setting, especially as the sun is setting. It was snowing the day I went and the incline car couldn't operate so there were quite a few stairs to climb to get to the cable car. Then after cable car you go to the tower to go up. Give yourself plenty of time -/ this is not something like many towers I've been to where you walk up, go in an elevator. You'll spend at least 30 minutes just getting to the base of the tower."
Great views and nice environment,"See the city at night,r type lift takes you up to top of the mountain lots of history there both recent and past. The views were great. Lots of locals. Some neat traditions for those in love. If you climb it it will take a while and allot of steps. "
Nice view,We went in valentine's day. Crowded. It was winter also. Wear thicker clothes if going during winter. The love lock there is Ard 5000won. Must try the burger place place there. It was prepared by 1 star Michelin chef. A set meal cause Ard 8000- 10000won. There's a escalator up to the Tower cable car area. But need to find as it was another side of myeongdong. We went up to the cable car area the long way. But when we going back from the cable car area to the street level we found the escalator. Hahaha.
Great Place to See the Entire Seoul City,"I visited the N Seoul Tower on Monday, so it was less crowded and you don't have to get in queue to get into the top of the tower. It has a lot of cute souvenirs too that can't be found in other place, so I suggest you to buy something in here."
Nothing to see much ,We didn't feel much great here. Its like normal mountain where you can find city view. Its not unique things for sure. I think its suitable for couples.
N Seoul Tower,Very Cold. Very Nice View. Very Relaxing. Very nie to walk around and drink coffee. Very nice to see happy people with happy faces !!!
Nice views and similar experience as Tokyo Tower,"The N Seoul Tower experience is similar to Tokyo Tower. After paying for admission you take an elevator up to the observation deck on the tower. The elevator ride up is about 30s and there is a pretty cool video on the ceiling of the elevator. The views of Seoul are breath taking but fog can obscure your view. There are many paid and unpaid photo opportunities. Before you go up the elevator, you are asked to take a picture in front of a green screen and when you get to the top, you can see the various backgrounds your picture could be on and available for purchase. There is a cafe and gift shop available and pay per use binoculars are also available.The hike up to the tower is not too steep but the ascent could be tiring. There is a cable car available that takes you almost to the base of the tower but the cost is extra each way and the parking lot is in a different location. If you decide not to walk up the hill to the tower, you will need to drive around the hill to the cable car parking."
Nice view of the city,"You get dropped off at the bottom of the towel and have to take a very steep 10mins ish walk up a hill but once you're up there, the view is beautiful. You can also pay to go up to the top of the tower. "
Absolutely stunning,"Went at around evening and stayed till the sky turned dark. I guess the timing made the experience SO much better as I could see the sunset and also the city lights against the pitch black sky and it was absolutely beautiful. I saw the famous lock and key thing and it was pretty cool, think it'd be fun for friends and family to do it too. this place does have souvenir shops that sell different lock and key designs bit do expect them to be a little bit pricey. I'm not sure if you are allowed to bring ur own lock but sure why not I don't think they will fine you for that or anything :D All in all, I feel that this is a must to visit when you are in Korea and I recommend going at the time when the sun sets and you'll get an enhanced experience :)"
I like this tower...especially the nature that surrounds it,It's not the biggest or the fanciest or the most beautiful but there is a charm to this tower that appeals. Perhaps it's the park its in and the walk to get there. Koreans love and respect nature and I like that. I love architecture and have a thing for towers...I visit one in any city that has them. This one is unique because you get the views of the city formed from a natural vantage point. 
Visit visit ,Here is like an exercise weekend place ...30 seconds elevator up to the viewing deck ..nice experience but no nice pictures for me 
Great Tourist Attraction,"The tower and location on top of the mountain offers amazing views of the Seoul from every angle. I went in Feb and it was chilly but the walk/hike up to the viewing sites warmed us up. I would recommend going in the late afternoon so you can see the city in the daylight and night. There are several eateries if you get hungry and lots of snack food you can buy as well. There is an area where lovers can put their locks on the gate. I would buy your locks and bring them before you come if you plan on doing this. Locks at the gift shop might set you back a small fortune. Ha. Overall, I enjoyed my time here. I am glad that we added this activity to our site seeing agenda. If you go to Seoul it's just one of those things that you should do!"
Good views and facilities,"The views were good and the facilities - restrooms, eating/dining were good and there's a plaza that is currently being constructed. I enjoyed the view from the top - however it wasn't that much better than the view from the hill, so I'm not sure it justified the price tag!"
Romantic Tower at the hill side,"We visit this place at mid FEb 16, which is the weather is chill. For visiting this place from Myeongdong station, take exit 3 and find bus stop. Take bus 05 to Namsan Tower, it takes around 15 minutes of ride by bus. This place is have TV Tower and lock loves ""wall"". So if you believe then prepare your lock to hang on the wall. Also from this place you can see Seoul city. It is free, unless you want to enter and take the elevator to the Seoul Tower."
A lovely little hike,We walked up through kyungridan road towards the Hyatt hotel and up through the park to the top. It is a nice walk through the woods with some great views. When you get to the top you can go up to the top of the tower for ever better views. We also saw some traditional Korean sword fighting and some traditional dancing on the plaza which was wonderful. There are a few restaurants and a few gift shops a well if you want some souvenirs. There are many buses that can take you up or down to the main part of the mountain but the walk from the bus stop to the tower is quite steep so any with walking disabilities may find it a little difficult. The views look upon the han river to one side and on the other towards Bukhan mountain. As it can get a bit windy up there a jacket may be needed in most seasons.
WINDY DAY,"Going here last April 2015. So many people came here just to looked at the famous ""Love Lock"". So glad to be here ;)"
Spectacular night view from tower,"Great view from the top of the N Seoul tower, you can see the entire Seoul city view. Nice view inside the cable car on the way to the tower."
Nice View,"The slope was quite steep, not recommended for people with weak legs. Cabs are not allow to go up, hence we change to bus at the foot of the tower."
Never gets old,Make the climb up the short hill to the top where the tower is. Take some time and enjoy a coffee or even an ice cream. Take in the scene and place a lock on the fence to create a lasting memory.
Great view and gift shop!,Was surprised that the bus only goes so far and you have to hike up the hill for quite some way so its good to be in shape. The view is great and the gift shop has quite a few gifts for a good price.
Great view,"Get to the top of Seoul, namsan tower, for a romantic moment. Don't forget to bring along with ""a lock of forever love"" for a couple."
View from up there is Beautiful,I once visited this place with my father and siblings. Being here was so pleasant and fun. Me and my siblings had so much fun. This place reminds me of the time I had with my family. 
View the city from the sky ,"A 15-minute walk through the park to the tower landing awards the traveler with a picturesque boardwalk covered in ""love"" locks.... The tower itself provides and expansive view of the city from the sky "
worth a visit,"if you want a 360 degrees view of the city, it is worth a visit. the observation deck would give you a glimpse of the massive development of seoul as a extremely develop state. "
nice view from top!!!,"I love the idea of keylocks, its so amazing coz its shows how many million couples got there to locked their love for each other.. (Heard from sayings about the locks meaning) the view at the top is so refreshings and relaxing.."
Amazing view,We took cabel car to the top of the tower and public bus back to the city. The view of the city is very beautiful.
nice wald,"take your time, walk from the Hyatt Hotel, through a beautiful garden, climb stairs in the forest, join the road, walk another 2 km, appreciate the view and arrive at the Namsan tower."
Great Views,"Yesterday i decided to do some tourist life stuff around Seoul. The tower is one of the most ideal places for that. Many people walk up to the tour, while others like myself take the cable cars to the top of the base of the tower before taking the elevator to the top. The views were just astounding. Being able to see all the cities and buildings and then the mountains in the background. There were also plenty of ""couple"" things to do, as Korea is big on ""couple"" promotions. There are thousands of locks down on the base, near the tower for couples promoting their everlasting love to one another. It was cute."
It's a tower with a view. Don't get excited!,Seoul's north tower on Namsan mountain makes a pleasant excursion during the day or at dusk. It gives an excellent view of the whole ugly sprawling city spread over the mountains and down to the river with clear information displays and some restaurants too. But although the crowds were not that substantial it is nothing that special - until you compare it to any of the other attractions in Seoul!We caught the metro from our hotel to Chungmuro station on the orange line and then just outside caught a bus (number 2 or 5) which run frequently up to the tower. Don't try to walk - it could take you an hour!
"Pretty romantic spot, but keep in mind the crowd","N Seoul Tower (the N stands for the ""new look"" of the tower) is a pretty hot spot to go in Seoul, and for an understandable reason: you can look over the brightly-lit city at night, and it can be quite romantic. A lot of couples buy locks and keys for 8,000 won and write their names on them before locking them near the tower and throwing the key away (or keeping it). I enjoyed going up to see it, but it's a whopping 10,000 won just to go a littttle bit higher than the gift shops. The extra price wasn't really worth it in my eyes."
great views of city,fun short cable car ride to reach tower in centre of lovely park with good walks never feels crowded
From above,N Seoul Tower is a must visit if you want to have a glance the whole of Seoul. Best way to enjoy this scenery is to dine at restaurants at the tower. Is a breathe taking view from high above be it day or night time.
Must visit,"Take the cable car to see the whole city from different perspective. Take the bus the way going down (or walk if weather supports) will be another great thing to do, especially in late afternoon."
Nice view ,Must definitely stay until late night and look at the night view. Breathtaking views of Seoul ! But it was crowded haha. And too bad we didn't get to visit the museum because it moved to some other place. We took so many photos when we got up to the tower. 
Great view of Seoul City,"If you stay in Seoul, you can see the great view of whole city at the N Seoul tower. There are many ways to go up there. On warm days you can hike slowly from the subway station watching the walls and trees. In winter you had better take the cable car. You also see the wonderful scenery of the Seoul night.In April the best thing at Namsan is walking through the cherry-blossom-tunnel!"
Landmark,Its the iconic landmark in Seoul. Best view during night time for the panoramic view of the city skyline. Ride the cable car if you opt for a more comfy experience.
great view of seoul,"you can come here during the day, but the night view was amazing. you could hike (more like a walk) up there or more conveniently take the cable car. couples could lock their love keys (sold at the merchandise store) around the gate at the tower. great view during sunset too. must visit if you're coming to seoul for the first time"
Great views of the city,This is a nice place to spend some time. Great spot for people watching on top of the mountain. There are places to leave love locks if that is your thing. Nice views of the city. Well worth the price of admission. 
Beautiful View,If you want an amazing view of Seoul city this is a must! Take the cable car up around dusk. You can then compare the city in the day time and then see all of the beautiful lights of the city!
A nice experience,"When you reached to the N Tower it got a very nice view. A beautiful place to dine too. You have options what to eat. The food price is quite expensive but if you want to splurge a little bit for a good view then it will be worth it. Going there we go via metro, and walked to the cable car station. It was a long uphill walk. If one is not use to walking, it will be tiring. But once you are in the cable car, the view is magnificent. It will be worth the walk."
Good Value for a half day outing.,"We decided to take the cable car up and walk down. This was indeed the correct decision. If you decide to walk up be prepared for a tough climb. There was a 30 minute queue for the cable car and we were jammed into the car like sardines, but still it got us up to the tower OK and without breaking a sweat. At the tower we were a bit confused about which ticket to buy. There was the observation tower and a combined Tower and Pavilion ticket, but it was not clear what the Pavilion actually was. Finally we bought a beer package which was access to the observation tower for 2 persons and a beer each for 26,000 in total. Not bad considering the tower alone would have been 20,000. cheapest beer we had in Seoul ha ha. You need to collect your beer though before you take the elevator to the top.The views are pretty average. Its not like the Eiffel tower where you are looking down on so many historic places. Here you pretty much just see a concrete jungle.When we came down we bought a lock and wrote our message on it and hung it on the fence. Kind of quirky but we enjoyed it. Finally we walked down to the bottom which is very enjoyable and recommended."
great view of seoul,from above you will be able to see the beautiful seoul. we went there at night and it is really beautiful. this place is good for lovers. make sure to lock you love and promises :)
Nice view above a big city,"We have been there in winter time, in the evening. So there were less people then expected. The staff is very friendly (like everywhere in Seoul). You can choose to go up the hill by cable car. But I guess you can also walk.Later it is queuing again for the tower ticket. Inked the tower it is quite empty, only candy shops."
Best place for date,i have visit with my boyfriend to seoul tower we plane go up via stair can you believe it;s really very good fist i think very difical but it is not when you date with your love it is good for talk.
Seoul Tower,This is a Famous Tourist Object at the center of seoul. Here we can go up at the tower and see the view of seoul city. but another one that also famous is the Lock Love Key at the same location at the n seoul tower (Ground floor). Here we can put a lock and put name of our couple and throw it away the key and most people believe their love will be eternal.. =)
"""Breathtaking Sights""",Most breathtaking views from the top of this Tower. The surroundings were stunning with line of trees at the roadside. I can imagine how beautiful it is in summer time.
Highest point of Seoul ,"It's a must visit spot in Seoul. The highest point in town, so you'd get a good view of Seoul, along with the lining of majestic mountains around it. There are the love locks, which could be a cute gimmick for your trip, if you're into those things. There are cafes and shops to kill time. When we were there, a show was put up, men dressed as ancient korean warriors, doing choreographed fight movements with swords. Pretty cool. One tip, take the cable car there. You could also hike, but why the trouble?"
There's nothing like being on top,"This is one place you don't want to miss when in Seoul. The views on the way up are amazing but once you get to top, it will take your breathe away. We had an unforgettable time here and I can't wait to go back. I recommend having dinner in The Place dining. It's where we watched the sunset while enjoying a romantic dinner for two. Enjoy!"
Nice,The special thing is lover locker. I have buy 01 locker (10000won). Dont have many restaurant here. The burger is very good (cost about 7500-12000 won)
beautiful at night,"very nice place to visit but weirdly ""expensive"" - first you pay for the gondola up and then you need to buy tickets for the elevator to the top - don't get the set (popcorn, drink and ticket - not worth it). Beautiful views of Seoul. Dress warmly - very windy at top."
Great biew,This hill provides a beautiful view of Seoul and is a must on any visit there. You can either take a cable car up or you can walk. We took the cable car and it was great. On top of the hill is the tower as well as a few historical sites. Allow some time at the top to enjoy the views and sites
Observatory visit,"I would suggest for you to take the sideways elevator to go to the cable cars, there are different packages for groups at the cable car. From our first visit in 2014 its now more stroller friendly. There are now ramps where you could push the strollers as well as an elevator to the cable car area. We took the tour this time to the observation deck, we got the package for 2 adults with a big popcorn and a big drink at 21000won and a 2 kids package at 17000 won ( with popcorn and drink) there was a nice elevator gimmick going up and down. We also had our souviner photo 20000 won for 2 shots. It was nice because we were there before sunset so we saw the city before it turn to beautiful lights."
very nice half day,this attraction is kids friendly suitable for the whole family.thus is taks some time if you start by the cable car. the line for it was 60 minutes! in the tower you can have some lunch. the view from the top is awesome!!! great all around seoula nice half day in seoul
Beatiful Sunset View,"The sunset view is So Beautiful. Make sure you bring your loved one to enjoy it :D. After sunset you can also enjoy the city night view from Above,and it was amazing"
Beautiful,"When you are in the bus going to the top of the mountain you see the city. When you arrive there the weather is colder, but you can see the hole city and the tower is vrry beautiful."
Lover's Peak,Namsan Tower is a beautiful place to view the entire Seoul City. But it is also the best place to experience romantic feels for lovers. You can see love locks and photo shoot spots for lovers anywhere around the area. It is so romantic that love songs can be heard in the background. You will definitely bring back the spark between you and your lover when you both visit Namsan Tower together!
Worth it,"Go here and experience the fantastic view. It is defiantly worth it! But don't go up in the tower, the view is amazing but the long line and all the people are not worth it. There are only Windows to look through and they are full with people's fingerprints and so on. The view is good enough from the mountain!"
"LONGGGG WAIT, but worth it. ","I deduct one ""star"" because of the wait. To get up to the tower took us about 3 hours. It was a 5 hour trip total. Once you're up to the mountain, there's more waiting but the views are totally worth it. It costs about 17,000 wan to ride the cable car then 20,000 for the observation deck (which you buy after reaching the top of the mountain via cable car). There's plenty to see on the mountain top but even more inside the tower. Just make sure you have time. It was a neat experience, especially for my 1st Korea trip! "
Incredible view at dusk,"We visited the N Seoul tower late on a winter evening and waited for the sun to set. The view at sunset was amazing but the night lights were also beautiful, you can see for miles and miles in all directions. The cable car ride is smooth and there is plenty of space. There are popcorn and drink deals and family tickets, which make improve the value."
A visit in the snow meant limited views,"Enjoyed a late night outing up the cable car during a light snow. The snow unfortunately limited our visibility of the city below, but it was still beautiful and very romantic. We ate some fish and chips at the top (a nice surprise) and came down on the last cable car of the night (around 11pm)."
very pretty location sun Sunset,very pretty location and snowy . waterfalls hard freeze. leaves that were still frozen .existing outlets for souvenirs . on which you want to buy a lock to be hung on the iron are encouraged to make as a couple . very nice atmosphere
Amazing Place to go if it's not cold,Very good Place with a 360 view of Seoul. Look spectacular During Night. A must go place in Seoul. The shops nearby have very Expensive stuff (it not only my experience but my Korean friends also agree)
Amazing show,"Be sure to visit at noon, they have an amazing show with swords and music. (Not sure if only on weekends).The trail to go up by foot is really peaceful and beautiful, but also can be a little exhausting, maybe you can try to go up by cable car and down by foot, so you can experience both.Leaving a love lock may be a great detail for someone special."
Great view.,This is the perfect place to go for a panarama view of Seoul. It is especially nice on a clear day. This is a fun activity for all ages. 
Best to visit in the evening,"Visiting in the evening allows you to take amazing picture as the sun set (you wouldn't see the sunset but the sky turn beautiful shades in the evening) while also enjoying the city night scene at the same time! Easily accesible from Myeongdong station Exit 4, you can either turn into the small road and head towards the general direction of the tower/cable car station (~20 min. be warned of steep slopes!) or walk along the main road after coming out from Exit 4 and turn left on the first major 4-way junction and continue straight along the main road (~5-8 mins or so) to reach the elevator to the cable car station.Additional tickets is required if you wish to go up to the observatory tower for a 360 view of the city but for me touring the site and the outdoor area is good enough for me to get a bird's eye view of the city. Once done, you can continue shopping at myeongdong where the shops open till late!"
Good experience,"Ticket for the N Seoul tower (observatory) costs 9000 won per adult but if you purchase the promo of 2 tix with popcorn and soda at 20000 won, it will be better. Believe me ;) It comes with 1 bucket size popcorn (any flavor as long as available) plus 2 large sodas. Picture below.This is a typical tower that offers 360-view of a city. Good for experience and since you're already in Seoul. Hike is tiring if you're not used to it but view going up is relaxing, you can try the cable car if you want. We did not bus going to N Seoul foot and just try our luck and walk our way from Seoul station going here. We felt getting lost at some point, but you can always see the tower and you can rely on google maps, so if you're up for a little adventure you can do this too.Didn't try the Alive (teddy bear) museum but some say it's good especially if you want to learn moer of Korea's history."
Nice and Great View,we walk from Myeongdong to N Seoul Tower and we didn't use cable car if you have time. i recommend you to walk to the top of tower. you'll got a nice view. the weather is so nice. just walk around and enjoy to take a photo.
stopping by,"We missed one stop when travelling to myeongdong and stop at the university stop, just so happen there was an indication to the tower by bus which took us ten minutes to reach the tower. After reading the reviews at tripadviser, we decided not to pay to go up the tower. One floor down the tower has a newly opened LG display of their 3D TV screen, pretty awesome and free of charge, the display movie lasts two minutes. It is nice to viewseoul at a height with a panorama view anyway. "
Stunning Seoul view in the night,"Namsan Seoul tower is best visited for sunsets till night, even in Winter time!, it provides us with a stunning city view around the tower from the upper deck.Inside the tower before we enter the elevator upstair, they offer us to take picture to be picked in the upper deck with price of KRW 12.000 for one picture (you could choose the scenic background they offer), the more you take the cheaper price they give.Usually couples of the Korean and tourists come there to strengthen they promise and love bond, by put a love-lock with their written name, wish, and promised words on it. Visitors could buy the love lock in the souvenirs shops both in the lower deck or in the upper deck.In winter time the tower open from 11:00 a.m. up to 11:00 p.m. And we could easily take bus 15 minutes from Dokkgung University station with cheap fare."
Wonder 360 degree view,"A must see on a clear day! There's also the equivalent of the ""Trick Eye Museum"" inside the lower part of the tower. Lots of fun in there too!"
