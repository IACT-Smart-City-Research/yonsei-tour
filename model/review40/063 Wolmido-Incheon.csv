Small but funny place with Yellow Sea view.,"CYC ( 19.08.15 ) The Wolmido was small island and had many sea food restaurant and funny facility. There had small theme park, and the road around there was good to walk with sea view. When we stayed, the beer festival was held. And the food bath facility was good to us. There was good place to rest about 1 or 2 days."
Wolmido Lighthouse Road,"A beautiful date course with a relaxing view of the sea. Perfect for couple, family and friends. This is located beside the Theme Park."
most amazing sunset,"The area , is quite like a lot like any seaside carnival type town, like key west or Coney island. but much smaller , with nice ocean views and some restaurants and bars."
Interesting,"Very crowded over weekends, nice and quiet during the week. Lots of shops and restaurants, lots of ferries and ship trips."
Breath Taking View,Place is located not far away from incheon city but a awesome place to enjoy the sound of sea. If you are nature lover you can go there to take a deep breath and forget all fury stress.
I visited the place with my parents we loved it!,"We were there to check out the place before my parents fly out that night at Incheon International Airport. Parking is easy to find and pretty cheap also! We got on the 1530 ferry boat ride and that boat is really nice and clean!! The performers are amazing! and the view of the Yeongjeong Grand bridge is breath taking! After our ferry ride, we were hungry and walked around the marina. The whole place is lined up with great sea food restaurants, shops, plenty of activities for the kids as well! We went into this restaurant and the lady who helped us spoke little english but got us squared away with some fresh sea food (clams, shrimp, halibut, oysters), with a seafood mix/soup bowl the size of manhole cover lol!! We had fun and enjoyed our time in Wilmido!"
Surprises galore on Wolmido visit,"Thought we were going to AN amusement park, but, so much more to see. Many interesting and varied art works plus live entertainment from magic acts to music, to aerial acts and singers all on the outdoor boardwalk surrounded by a wide variety of restaurants. Pizza to Kim bap, very happy place. "
A bit dated but a nice quiet walk,"As I first arrived to the entrance of the park, I noticed it's not the newest park, but that doesn't mean it's not worth going to. The Korean Traditional Garden section has a lot of small sections that are recreations from other palaces or gardens around Korea. It has some nice spots if yu want to lay out a mat and have a picnic, or take a rest. The observatory in the center of the park is worth going to the top to get a nice view of the ocean, and the paths are well maintained. If you want to come from Incheon Station, I recommend hopping on a local bus, rather than walking there on the sidewalks because it's a lot longer than you think, and you would be just passing a lot of industrial areas."
for a evening timepass,"I like to go there in the evening when the sun sets. the view is best then. there are many restaurants on the sea side but they are quite expensive in korean standard. I usually other elsewhere, where they provide better food on a good price. except on winter you can enjoy the musical fountain. this is a best place to stroll around and have a chat with your pal. "
Good to visit in couple or group,"It’s easy getting to Wolmido. Take exit 3 from Incheon subway station (Line 1) and walk to the bus stop next to the tourist information center. There are 4 local buses that go to Wolmido (it’s the final stop) and you can see the amusement rides when you’re at the final stop.There’s no admission fee to the amusement park but if you’d like to take any rides, they charge a fee for that. Straight ahead from the amusement park is the sea, surrounded by a whole stretch of restaurants. Would not recommend to visit for solo traveler as it can be quite boring. "
Wolmido park,"Oversea travelers do usually travel the seashore of Wolmido. However, they should also travel the Wolmido park so as to have the great view about Incheon."
Good for locals,"This is just my personal opinion. Restaurants and their menus, amusement facilities, and general environment are basically optimized for local Koreans. Westerners will have hard time in finding their types of things. Especially when the place is full of group of Chinese travellers, even local Koreans will have hard time. If you are with local Koreans, it is worth a visit."
Don't expect too much.,"It's simply a breeze. It's not a place to see a spectacular view. But there is a small theme park next to the ocean, so you can enjoy it with your friends or family. You can also eat raw seafood, such as raw fish and clams. It would be fun if you come with a light mind, but if you bring too much expectations, you will be disappointed."
Amusement park galore,A decent sized amusement park with rides as well as an assortment of street food. It's a nice walk and there's seafood restaurants in the area as well.
Must visit,Ferry ride was really nice. Also walk through the wolmi culture Street is amazing. Traditional Korean garden on the way to wolmi is also worth visiting.
Super,"I went alone and I really enjoyed my time, I sat in front of the river and had a beer. Was amazing.Really good for family too, if you come to Incheon, please pass by there! "
Fun place to visit,"Accessible by public bus, this is a lovely board-walk style park with an amusement park (more rides are for kids than adults but if you're young at heart you can ride all of them hahaha), games, arcades and restaurants and a great view."
Wolmi Culture Street: One attraction with lots of activities,"I visited Wolmi Culture Street last April with friends! If you are in Incheon area, I recommend you to visit this place. This place caters to everyone: couples, families, friends, large group, solo travelers, etc. It's for everyone!You can do lots of things in this place:1. Eat at a nearby restaurant. When I visited the place, I ate at Daebak Jogae Gui. I really liked their grilled seashells with cheese. (Refer to my photos) 2. Enjoy the sea view or sunset by the sea.3. You can try their Amusement Park too!4. Stroll and enjoy the atmosphere. This place is good for picture taking!5. Watch live performances! But what if you are not in Incheon but still want to go there? From Seoul, you can take Subway line 1. Get off at the last stop which is Incheon Station. There is only one exit at Incheon Station. From the exit, take Local Bus No. 2, 15, 23 or 45 bound for Wolmido. Get off at Wolmido City Tour, Wolmi Culture Street, or Wolmi Final Bus Stops."
Great for photos!,"An island that's themed similar to a theme park but much more relaxed and laid back. Great for a family stroll with many opportunities for photos.It's kind of like a board walk where you have the ocean on one side and a strip of Korean restaurants and game-stalls on the other. The game stalls are mostly 'pop the balloons with darts' or 'shoot the targets with staple guns' and you can win large stuffed animals.You can take the ferry there which is amazing in itself, as you can buy a bag of shrimp crackers for 2000 Won, and feed the seagulls. There are literally 50-100 of them following you and will snatch the crackers from your hand, it's amazing and very fun!"
Amazing seagull watching,"Watching seagulls at Wolmido on a ferry is an exciting experience as seagulls follow the ferry to get fed by the tourists (they like potato chips) and also to catch fishes thrown up by the turbulent waves at the rear the ferry. To get good photos of the flying seagulls, use a camera that has fast focussing and can shoot multiple pictures per second."
Must visit,"There are many public buses that go to the Wolmido from incheon station tourist center that is next to the incheon station. The bus fare is cash 1300₩ or ticket 1100₩ ($1 or $1.20) and taking around 20 min. If you take off the bus at the last place of Wolmido, you start visiting the Wolmido culture street & talking a walk on the culture street that is along the ocean. You see the view of ocean, incheon bridge, tons of the restaurants. The museum of Korea immigration history takes around 20 min. from the end of the culture street by walk & free fee & adjacent to the Wolmido observatory (850 meters)."
"Wolmido Isalna,","It is beautiful. Wolmido Island is a small triangular shaped island only 0.7km (about 4 miles) in area stretching from north to south with Mt. Wolmido as its center. During the Korean War, its beautiful landscape was completely destroyed by bombing, as it was the first destination of the Incheon Operation. It became a base for the U.S. military, both Army and Air Force, and civilian access was restricted. The military base was established for about 50 years until it was returned to citizens in 2001. Wolmido has been transformed into the Wolmido Cultural Center where one can experience the traditional Korea royal court and culture."
Should in a good weather ,I liked this park but we were unlucky it was foggy. We went observation tower but couldn't see because of fog. Even that walk was good. Couldn't go boat tour. Food was nice in a restaurant. 
Fun but old,"Wolmido is okay for a last minute outing but I wouldn't plan my week around it. The rides are old. My younger children enjoyed themselves. I recommend bringing cash. The atm is far and hard to find. Our family's favorite ride would be the bumper cars, they were a good four minutes."
Beautiful Sunset,"came here on a late afternoon and i got to see a beautiful sunset. there are tons of things to do here. they've got amusement rides for the kids and a good number of food joints to choose from. this place seems pretty romantic as well so you'll notice tons of couples having a date here. if you're doing a short layover in Incheon, this will be a good place to visit"
Awesome trip for one day tour from Seoul,"Wolmido is one of famous attraction near Seoul city, Korea. You can drop by China town and Animation village together along with Wolmido trip. You should try to ear Jjajangmyun at China town and amusement park in Wolmido is also not the one which is missing. High recommend!!"
Pleasent walk around the water,"We were there with a bus load of military retirees. It was too early to eat or shop, but it was a nice morning to walk around the water, looking at all the shell fish offerings of the many restaurants. It's hard to believe that this was a backup landing sight for the Incheon invasion. Many monuments to look at."
Long walk along with sea,Very good place for family with kids. There are a lot of entertainment for kids. A lot of restaurants here. Those who love to eat raw fish can eat here. You can also go for 1 hour ride in ferry.
Awesome!!!!!!!!! :D,"I love Wolmido Island!!! The sea so calming and refreshing, its very near Seoul so if you plan for a one day trip and you want to enjoy the sea, I suggest go to Incheon to enjoy the Wolmido beach, the local buses take you to Wolmido stop, so its very convenient!!! :D "
"A fun, relaxing getaway","It's a small island with a few theme parks, many cafes and restaurants. A good place for families to spend time with each other.Check out my blog for a more detailed review :)http://berrypetite.blogspot.kr/2015/09/wolmido-place-for-fun-and-relaxation.html"
Sea naery Seoul,"If you hv a short time but want rest... Wolmido is for you. It have park , sea and any shop. Seafood is nice."
Nice Nice,"It was nice to have my kid here, he loved it. We spend time on the fairy area and a nice walk beside the sea, watching the dancing fountain and some paint artist. Lovely for an afternoon-sunset stay."
A nice getaway from Seoul ,"This is a nice place to just walk along the boardwalk and watch the sun go down. You can get a nice view of some buildings off in the distance. There are a few places to eat at, a couple of nice cafes, and fun carnival rides to enjoy or watch others enjoy. It's about a W4,000 taxi ride from Incheon Station. You can visit Chinatown and Wolmido on the same day."
Fun day out in the sun,"Wolmido is named after the shape of the island that resembles the tail of the moon. However, nowadays Wolmido is connected to the mainland due to various reclamation projects. There are many recreational spots like Wolmi Park, Cultural Street ,Wolmi Amusement Park and the Lock Gate Exhibition Hall. As Wolmido witnessed historic moments of the city , such as the Russo-Japanese War, the French Campaign against Korea and Operation Chromite, there are monuments dedicated to the fallen warriors along Cultural Street. To get to Wolmido, take subway Line 1 to Incheon Station. From the bus stop, take bus number 2, 23 or 45."
See the first Disco-Pang-Pang,"This is a nice area to have a quick bite to eat next to the water. Locals like to feed those crispy shrimp snacks to the seagulls (the birds go CRAZY for them). The tagada here is also supposedly the first disco pang pang in Korea (look it up! this is the most ridiculous ride I found in the country). They have some restaurants overlooking the water as well, and you can catch a ferry from the port to a few close-by spots. A short walk down the street is a nice park you can visit if you like to hike, where you can get to a small tower that you can go up into for a great view."
Very nice sea view,"On weekends and holidays, this place is like a small theme park by itself. Couples and families come here to spend time together. Lots of nice cage and seafood restaurants.. do take the rail and explore the island. Take the blue line to Incheon stop (i think is the last stop) and hop on a bus to 월미도."

good for dating,"This is the place where people living in Incheon or Seoul visit for dating.Because this is the closest ocean from main cities.There are many cafes and sushi restaurants.If you need more information on bars, restaurants, shopping malls in Incheon,visit my Incheon blog. My blog is the only blog about fun places in Incheon.http://fun-incheon.blogspot.com"
The view is breathtaking!,The sunset is amazing. Nice view near the sea...The wolmido park is really fun for those who wants to go with friends or even those who wants to go
Colourful and Vibrant-Great day trip!,"I spent quite a bit of time over on Wolmi Island mainly as I was living in Incheon City so it was walking distance for me to get there. I'm a big fan of carnivals and seaside type, funfair action so this is the reason I ended up there so often! Wolmido has an interesting and harrowing past in terms of it's wartime history and these days it tends to be a family orientated place popular with tourists and children alike. Aside from the funfair and promenade amusements there is also the traditional Korean gardens in Wolmi Park, a mountain with observatory and a culture centre (where you can even try on some traditional Hanbok and Korean National dress!).I mainly spent time down near the funfair area which at weekends was packed full of people, exciting rides, candyfloss galore, street vendors selling snacks of dried fish, lemonade and sweet potato fries. The place has a really fun vibe and the atmosphere is happy, brash and loud! It's a worthwhile day trip seeing as it can be easily accessed from Seoul via the Metro (Take the blue line 1 all the way to the final stop 'Incheon' and from there you can take a 10 minute taxi or it's a 25 minute walk~alternatively there are a couple of buses outside of Incheon station but I don't remember the numbers~there is a little tourist office there so they should be able to help you with which bus to hop on!)There are a zillion and one food options on Wolmi~mainly fish based with touts trying to entice you into their restaurants! The nearby residential areas are interesting to have a wander around as people living there tend to customise their homes with colourful wall murals which was really cool!Really fun place~ seaside type action, Korean style! Definitely worth a visit if you enjoy noise, bright lights, candyfloss and waltzers!"
A must do,"from the Wolmi Park to beautiful Gardens (not over spectacular though),,, you will love the place... they have an amusement park which is overcrowded for rides,... you must climb on tip of mt. Wolmido and enjoy the city and port view from up there"
An Enjoyable Day Trip!,"I visited Wolmido several times during my year in Korea and found it to be an excellent way to spend an afternoon.Apart from in the jaws of winter, you can visit at any time. A climb to the top of Mount Wolmi for panoramic views of the city of Incheon, its port and the fast rising skyscrapers of Songo is a must! Make sure you choose a clear day for the best views.The traditional Korean garden is best enjoyed in spring when the flowers come into bloom. The boardwalk contains an amusement park, numerous seafood and chain restaurants as well as ferries which circle the bay area. If you only visit one attraction in Incheon, you should choose Wolmido."
