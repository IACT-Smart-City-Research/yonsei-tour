Train from Busan,"We took the KTX to Seoul and all went well. This station plaza has caf√©s, restaurants and shops to explore before the train ride. Information counter staff speak English and signage is clear. "
Nothing special,"The Busan Station Plaza is the transition area from main train station to nearby areas such as Chinatown, which is across the road. The plaza is nothing special in any regard, of course transportation and food can be avail there but that's kind of it."
Not tourist friendly at all,"Had a bad experience at the train station. When I was about to leave Busan back to Seoul, there was some power outage in one of the stations between Busan and Seoul and trains were delayed. Announcements were made only in Korean, and I did not know what was going on and was left in the dark (Saw commotion around and figured something was wrong). Spoke to at least 5 staff, but none of the staff could speak English (including the ones manning the information counter). It's appalling how NONE of the staff could even speak basic English. Staff were not helpful at all and were extremely rude. Saw other tourists who don't speak Korean struggling with the same situation too.One passenger was kind enough to explain to me what happened. In the end, the train was delayed for more than 4 hours. Wouldn't recommend this place at all, unless you speak Korean or if you are comfortable figuring things out on your own."
Busan KTX Station,This is where you get down when you come from Seoul on KTX. There is also a city tour point right next to this station. I stayed very next to this station. Good view at Night.
Good View at Night,"Main station of Busan. We got here from Seoul Station by KTX. There are many food stalls here, i liked the clock. In evening there are lights so its beautiful"
Great views of the harbor from the upper floor,"Conveniently located in the city center, the railroad station has some nice restaurants with decent prices. Trains to Seoul take just over two and a half hours."
Busan Station (Outside Entrance) having major upgrading construction.,"FYI, we went August 2018, Busan Main Station link (KTX Station), big entrance is having major upgrading construction going on..i guess estimated completion in 2 years.so be prepared, quite sad we can't take any photos at that area."
Busan visit,You have to go outside the Busan station to take the Busan metro subway to Haeundae beach. Info desk at the station very helpful.
A little confusing but once you know where to go it's not so bad,"We arrived via KTX to Busan Station and that part wasn't bad at all. We got off and started walking towards the exits of the station. Once we got on the escalator down we were confused to where to get to the metro subway entrances. There is a lot of construction going on as well which added to the confusion.To get to the bus stop, simply walk out and talk the escalator down to the ground level and walk out towards the street. The bus stops are there. There are also taxis that constantly drive up and down the street. If you see the red light on the front windshield, it literally means ""empty car"", so you can flag those down.The metro subway entrance is just next to the bus stops. A helpful person led us to the stops thankfully after getting turned around due to the construction. Overall the station plaza will be great once the construction is done and the area is opened up. There are restrooms, cafes, and is the hub for transportation if arriving at the station. "
Easy and accessible,"The station was big enough and easy to understand. With lots of entrances, the signages within the station were helpful for foreign tourists. The station also had good cafes, for any last minute coffee or whatever. Very clean and well maintained too."
Excellent smooth ride from here to Seoul,"We travelled VIP from here to Seoul. The station is very large, but well organized, even for a non Korean like myself, we were an;e to navigate quite easily.The fast train is luxurious, seats are well spaced out and recline. What a ride. You would never know you were going so fast!No security hassles.Definitely recommend"
Huge!,"Busan Station is huge. I arrived here on a K-rail express trail from Daegu and there are easy connections to the Metro, the Port and local buses as well as a range of shops inside the plaza to appease commuters and travellers alike. "
Not exactly an attraction but rather a big train station with few shops.....,"This isn't exactly an attraction but rather, a big train station building with fee shops & restaurants to cater to passengers' needs.There aren't many shops or restaurants here but enough to satisfy basic hunger if needed(& if one is not choosy.)Being the main train station in Busan ( & KTX from Seoul), it's pretty busy with regular flow of incoming & outgoing passengers.Note this train station is not connected to the local Busan Metro. You need to exit the building & walk about 3 mins to the underground Metro"
Very croweded area,"A station, most of the public transport will stop here. Such as , KIX train. Similar as airport . Or Airport bus. But, is outside the busan station. Not inside. "
Not Much to Write,The place has many shops and restaurants across the street but that is all about it .Yesh if you wish to find Tops Supermarket ( for cheapest drinks and snacks etc) then cross the road and ask for directions.Too much upheaval around with taxis bus stops etc all crowded up.In the evening they light up the area in a fashionable way making it attractive .
attraction?,"I wouldn't call this place interesting at all, but that maybe is because there was some reconstruction nearby and also a lot of homeless people since it is close to the train station."
All boarded up being refurbished,Other that just a few little areas the whole plaza is getting a full over haul. If the end result is anything like the pictures that it will become a great place to meet up with people. But for now - move on.
Nice place to hang around outside Busan station,"We arrived here from Seoul by train and looked around the plaza under the hot sun. Dotted with bright flowers and occasionally, water would shoot out from the ground. We also came here at night and it was more beautiful at night. The lights would constantly change colour."
The centre of everything,"The main transportation hub of Busan, this area is surrounded with many eateries. A great exploration"
A huge station to get lost,"Busan Station is the main station thus the biggest of them all. Very busy, it's like one airport terminal already. Crew and staff though are all around so they are there to help when you feel you're getting lost. It could be more efficient if there is an elevator to bring passengers with loads of luggage to bring along. The escalators aren't too friendly for travelers having more than 3 baggage. Since everyone is in a rush, passengers with lots of luggage really get in the way of those without too many bags. I hope they can consider installing elevator in the station.Another thing is the Public Announcement is in Korean thus not helpful for the foreigners to understand. We almost got in late in the train because iwe didn't understand what the announce,emt was about.But overall, the station is satisfactory. Everyhing you need is inside the area."
Light show at night,"The station plaza is a good example of user friendly public space in the city with the huge fountain area and nightly pop music and laser light show. Hot and sticky from a long day on foot seeing the many sites around town; meet here, find a seat and just enjoy the cooling spray and perky K-Pop before hitting the bar with travel companions or meeting at one of the many local restaurants. While it is pleasant; there is not a lot of seating and that makes it only average when it could be better."
Typical Main Train Station,Just your usual artzy plaza in front of the main train station. Worth seeing if you're using the train station to travel anyway.
Good meeting spot,"Its nice meeting spot in front of station! Every bus/metro/will get there! You can even go for a long distance from stations.Inside - lot of shops, tourist centers and food stores. Everything what simple traveler need while waiting for a train. :)"
Why spend time outside a station?,"Busan Station Plaza has been steadily under construction of some sort for the five years that I have been visiting the city, and there is still no end in site. It's a nice enough space but ends up being where a lot of the city's homeless end up at night.Hopefully, once the endless construction is finished, the plaza will have something to show for it."
A big plaza welcoming you,"When I stepped out the Busan Station, I was amazed by those art installations on the plaza. People are using it for different purpose such as children are running around and some old people are singing. IYou have to pass through this place to reach the bus stop and metro station."
Just spent 1 hour waiting for KTX,Plenty of good Options to have coffee or cold drinks plus snacks whilst waiting for Trains here. Also pricing does not seem over the top depiate it being in a major rail station
this is where you go for ktx subway trains,lots of restaurants and near the intl ferry passenger terminaleasily accessible to reachthere is also underground malls everywhere
basic place for transport,good for arriving and departure. with quite a few good eateries and some shops to buy basic items. this area lacks a shopping mall and of cos a lotte mart. 
Full equipped Busan Railway station,"There are cafes, eatery stalls and mini mart within the premises. U can expect crowds every moment because it's a railway station."
Good facilities,"The Busan Station Plaza is the large open area between Busan metro station and the Busan Train Station (for KTX, etc.). From the metro station one could take the lift near Exit 4 to go to the road level. The limousine bus going to Gimhae Airport has a bus stop right there, near the lift door. There is also a taxi service. There are many shops in the Busan Train Station. In addition there are many luggage lockers (different sizes) in the train station. One could take the escalator from the road level to the ticket office (Entrance 7) and departure gates. Lockers are located on this level and in fact there are many more lockers located one floor below (near Entrance 5). At one time, I thought that I was running out of luck as all the lockers on the ticket office level were taken up, but found that there were many more one floor below. It takes a little time to learn about the area (the metro station, the train station and the plaza itself). There is also an observation deck on the upper level of the train station, with an expansive view."
Good station but not a tourist spot,Good station... Many restaurants inside .. Free wifi inside... Outside the station just small square... Good for taking pictures....not really a tourist spot. 
Plaza,Nice little plaza outside the main station in Busan. Couple restaurants and neighborhoods around as well
Just take a picture here,"Place is famous because of running man so just take a picture. Yes, it is full of people comming and going. easy to move around."
Dirty,"Kind of hit or miss with Busan Station. Inside is adequate, lots of resturants. Bathrooms could be cleaned better. Outside the station many homeless people hangout but they don't hassle or bother you to much."
Nice train station,Can get many nice Mandos (dumplings) here at a stall outside the train station. Can get many more little snacks here. Can travel to nearly all the places around Korea from Busan. The train from Busan to Seoul is super fast.
Relatively big station,"Visited Busan station because my boyfriend and I had to take the KTX to Seoul. There are many cafes and convenience stores in the station so it is very convenient for travellers. There are many ATM machines too thus allowing ease for tourists. If you plan to take the KTX, you are allowed to bring outside food into the train- quite unusual compared to other parts of the world where people are not allowed to bring outside food into public transportation. I saw people eating McDonald's and even gimbap! The entry and exit points in this station all have visible signs and it outside the station, there is a taxi stand."
Very large station,Arrived here from the airport via various lines. We came here to take the buti city bus tour. Many dining options inside the station. Information desk was helpful in pointing us where to find the buses. Ate lunch at Paris baguette. Passed through here in November 2016.
First sight of Busan,Too the train from Seoul to Busan and the Station Plaza is the first thing you see as you emerge from the building. The main modern circular sculpture dominates the space and view but there are several other pieces of art to view as you walk to the metro.
Quite nice for a station ,"Considering there are literally thousands of people at all times going by around the station , id say is pretty well managed. Easy to navigate in , easier than seoul station that is , and yeah , waiting for yr train you get all sorts of stuff to do , from eating something from the cheap to expensive, to having a coffee etc."
Some Construction but doesn't get in the way,"Busan Station is well marked and easy to use. The only thing that's a bit of an irritation is going to the subway from the inter-city trains. The information booth is large, easy to find, and the folks speak several languages. "
Helpful info counter,You can a lot of infomation from Info counter with english and chinese speaking staff. We reach Busan using KTX and walk few minutes to reach Metro just outside Busan Station.
Nice plaza,It's a nice plaza with flower pots and some food stalls around. Went there to check on the KTX - yeah piqued after watching the movie. The train station itself is nice with nice restaurants- got my hotteok and fish cakes from a store which I guess is famous since it has a long line in it
A few things to know,"You can buy a train ticket to Seoul upstairs, return trip will be around $100. There is wifi in the train and it takes about 3-4 hours one way. There are few cafes to have a coffee and some food/snacks while you wait for the departure. Fun fact - to buy a ticket and travel you won't asked for a passport. Tip:Take a city tour bas to see beautiful Haedong Yonggung Temple. here is a bus stop on the side (if you look at the station ‚Äì on the right)."
A bit sad.,"I'm sure on a busy summer's day, this is a lovely place to walk around. However, on a grey evening in October, upon arriving in Busan, it didn't strike me as the best welcome for the city: I was approached several times but obviously drunk old men asking for cigarettes and/or cash in my two-minute walk across the plaza, something that did not happen anywhere else in South Korea. Yes, the sculpture is impressive and Busan station provides a grand back-drop to if but as my first glimpse of the country's second city? It left a little to be desired!"
Great train Station and nice central square -,"The Busan Station Plaza is in the center of Busan, The station connects by Korail Fast Trains to everywhere in the country. The Plaza in front of the station is nice and also the starting point of the BUSAN JUMBO TOUR BUS."
More than a station,"Busan station is the place to go when you need to take trains to other parts of South Korea, it's a big place with food shops and souvenir shops. Quite clean also, very nice"
Busan's Central Train Station,This is the main train station in Busan and I happen to stay at a hotel next to the station for 2 nights. There are a number of restaurants/cafes in the station therefore you can have your meals here. There is a water fountain outside the station and the busan city tour buses are located here.
Day trip to Busan from Seoul,Great day trip to Busan. Even better when you take the KTZ fast train down to this station. The station is very easy to navigate and just outside the station is the hop on hop off bus (2 choices) to take you around to all the great sights. 
Busy station leading you to all parts of Korea,"We choose to stay near the station as we took the train from Seoul to Busan. Busy day and night, overall its safe even if you are alone. There are many cafe in the station Plaza, so you have no issue with food. "
Center of Busan transportation,"There are huge gate in front of Busan station. We were surprised during at night and discovered that it is also a music water fountain and a light show, brilliant oranges and reds and purples and a giant ""Welcome to Busan"" inside the ring. It was great fun and spectacular view for tourist. Busan people also very friendly when we ask for direction even though they cannot speak English.We speak through body language. :)"
Roam Around,"a place to roam around with friends to enjoy the beauty of the sea, relaxing area to have a brisk or leisure walk while enjoying the sea breeze! very clean waters and friendly people around...."
Star Gate!,"The plaza in front of the Busan train station is dominated by this huge gate which reminds me of the Star Gate in the science fiction series. I was totally surprised when taking a night train to discover that it is also a music water fountain and a light show, brilliant oranges and reds and purples and a giant ""Welcome to Busan"" inside the ring. It was great fun. Bravo, Busan! "
Near to metro train,"If you come to Busan via KTX, then you will be arrived at this station. You can change the normal train just outside of the terminal. The normal train not that far from the KTX station, you can change to dif train to go to Busan city."
Easy to follow,"Compared to the central station in Seoul and maybe others like it in Japan, Busan Station is very well laid out and does a good job with signage. It is fairly intuitive for a first timers. Enough shops for food and gifts but not overdone. "
Very nice Terminal Station for the KTX,"We wanted to see the Busan Film Festival and really to get out of Seoul as we had been there for a while and had seen the major attractions. We jumped on the KTX and in 3 or so hours we were there. Once you get out of the station, it‚Äôs nice around there and there are even Christian groups singing gospels. However, once you leave the premises, the environment isn‚Äôt so great. I advise you either jump on a taxi to your destination or jump on the Hop on /off bus and you‚Äôll be ok."
Country heart of infrastructure,"Busan Station is a train station in Busan, the most important railway line in the country. It connects Busan in the south with Seoul in the north by using KTX line. The journey is under 3 hours. It also connects to Gimhae Airport & Busan Subway It has everything under one roof."
Train hub for Busan,"Good design building, very busy place. Getting here from Seoul by KTX. Commuting in South Korea to anywhere is a breeze. Their very advance transporting system is to be praised!"
A very functional transportation hub in a seedy neighborhood,"The station itself is fantastic. It is clean, nicely laid out, easy to get into and from, good sign signage, there is even a help desk. The station is located across the street from China/Cambodia/Russia-town which is also a red light district, apparently. As a result, you get a wide variety of people in the area. You can encounter drunk men falling over, working girls, travelers, locals having fun enjoying the performances, and anyone under the sun. Single female travelers, word of advice: ignore men who try to pick you up. There may be weirdos who might follow you for a few metres or so. I did not get a sense of a particular danger, but I found the area fairly unpleasant."
Important Station,It is a important station for linkage to other part of South Korea. Especially KTX. It also link to Subway.It has some restaurant and small shop. In some night that also some show on the outside of the station.
Main Gate of Busan,"I often travel to Busan via KTX, so it is the main gate of Busan for me.Efficient station and directly connected to Metro line and Buses.It is surrounded by many accommodations of your budget and you can feel the active Busan from your arrival.Always happy to be here!"
Star Gate,"The ""Star Gate"", which changes color at night, is a definite landmark making meet ups easy. There are a lot of restaurants and hotels in the vicinity as well as two tourist circuit bus tour starting stops. "
Rapid Transit,I loved this train station. I arrived at this station on the bullet train and was able to easily transfer to the subway and make it to my hotel with ease.
huge plaza in front of Busan station,"This is a huge plaza in front of Busan Station. Great for meet-ups or your jump off point if you're doing a walking tour of downtown Busan. Lots of markets and restaurants in the area, there's an underground shopping alley and Chinatown/ Russian street is right across the plaza."
"A nice, expansive terminal for the trains, particularly the KTX.","Since the KTX was our means of entry into and exit from Busan, the train station played an important role in our travels with large luggage. Fortunately, Busan Station is a fairly modern, open facility with plenty of eating options, shopping and a nice viewing deck on the upper level to look at the harbor. Getting to and from the KTX train was pretty painless. We did use the elevator, and it didn't take too long to get from the platform to the terminal main floor (thankfully, because it was cold on the platform). The layout of the station and train info boards were pretty easy to figure out. I think Busan Station is every bit as good as any similarly sized train station in Europe."
big and convenient one,it's a big yet convenient one for travelers. there are plenty of restaurants and you can store bags/luggages at the lockers inside the building that costs KRW 2.000-4.000. an easy way to connect with the subway and KTX itself.
KTX Terminal Station From Seoul,We took the 9am KTX train from Seoul and arrived Busan Station around noon. Big station with shops and also signs to show direction. You can take the long escalator to go down to ground level where taxi are available on both sides. The station looks great from outside as a landmark.
Big Station but convenient for traveller,This is not my first time at Busan Train station. I have been travelling between Seoul and Busan on this train station and seen a transformation to modern upgrade happening. Like the station which has huge lockers which allow travellers to lock up their luggage to travel around the city before check into the accomodation or for a day trip. The cost is also reasonable. There are many eateries there so you are not left with no choice when you have to take away food to be eaten in the train. There are few famous Busan local speciality food. Just look at the long queue and you will know which are the ones.
my KTF Station,"the biggest station in Busan. the station for my KTF train from Seoul. I could feel the tradition design with this station, but the interior, machine and equipment was modern. Nice station."
A landmark in its own right,"When I've seen the historic photographs of the hold Busan station, I really prefer the architecture of the old to the new. But, time marches on and here's the gleaming Busan Station with all the modern conveniences. Easy to get around inside and find your way to your transportation. Plaza out front is a hang-out place."
Nice Big Station,"Busan is one of the bigger stations in Korea. Almost the same size as Yongsan. They have a information booth I would recommend going to. Just follow the yellow signs. Most of the brochures they have english versions too. If you're not sure what to do, get on the busan shuttle bus. It has an open top and goes around the whole city (15 stops) for 15,000 won (about $13.50). Not bad, you'll see the whole city."
