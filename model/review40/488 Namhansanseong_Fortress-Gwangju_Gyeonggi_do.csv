Excellent fortress,"The World Heritage listed Namhansanseong fortress can be reached from Seoul in about an hour. Catch the metro to Sanseong, then the bus to the fortres. Set in the hills the fortress is a great place for hiking. The walls are about 12km long. The fort has several gates, crennulations and watch towers. A good half day out."
Worth the trip ,"It’s a little out of the way from Seoul, but totally worth the visit. Easy to get to as directions are quite clear, and in doubt you can follow the many elderly folk going there too. It gives you a different feel from the bustle of the city, and the air is cool and crisp. Lovely trip. At the base of the fortress there are also many restaurants and cafes which offer good food at affordable prices. Well worth a visit to do something different if you’re going to stay in Seoul. "
Summer hiking,"One of my favorite hiking sites to date...I'm loving hiking here in Korea, even summer time can make you feel happy...Nice view feom the top and you'll get to see the city view, if air quality is favorable, you'll see lotte tower too...It only took less than two hours to take the old walk way course. Hike for free."
Nice walks through the forrests,"I combined my trip to Namhansanseong with a visit to Hwaesong, starting out in Seoul. All is easily doable using public transport. Since it was quite a hot summer day, I enjoyed that most of the ways to get from place to place is in the shade, the walls and gates are really pretty. If you have seen the royal palaces in Seoul beforehand the (reconstructed) Palace inside the fortress might be a bit of a let down. Inside the fortress is a normal village, you also find plenty of food or drink options throughout the paths you can follow. Besides the fortress walls and gates you can also step into a couple of temples."
Beautiful piece of history to visit.,Very well maintained and marked attraction. Enjoyed seeing the various buildings and reading about them.
Easily accessible from Seoul,"I finally went out to visit this UNESCO World Heritage site, and I'm so glad we went. It has easy and more challenging trails. We took a bus from Sanseong station to near the top of the mountain to have an easier time. We walked to the North Gate and then up the mountain just a little bit to the West Door. We walked around just a little bit more before heading down. There were enough signs along the trail indicating where to go for what. Looking at the map was a little bit confusing, but the signs that pointed down each trail saying what was which way made it easy to figure out where we wanted to go. Be sure to eat lunch somewhere near the North Gate! There are a bunch of restaurants and cafes. We had a nice coffee right near the fortress palace and then a really delicious lunch of smoked duck, bibimbap, potato pancakes, and bean paste stew."
Beautiful views of Seoul with easy or challenging hiking,"Locals and tourists flock to this fortress and the city inside of it. Take the #52 bus from Namhansanseong station, or the #9 bus from Sanseong station.The city inside the fortress is filled with restaurants. The palace was recently reconstructed. This palace includes beautiful views from the mountain of the town below. There are many different walks or hikes you can take from the town to tour the fortress, ranging from simple to challenging.For a challenging hike, walk from the Namhansanseong subway station about 1.5 km to the park. Then, take another 1.5 km hike up the mountain in a beautiful valley. Locals come to this area to picnic, relax, and exercise. The route gets steeper as you go. Toward the top are natural springs you can refill water bottles from. At the top you reach the South Gate of Namhansanseong Fortress. This is the most photogenic of the fortress entrances. My 9 year old son and I did the above hike. From the South gate, we walked the perimeter of the fortress to the North gate, then down into the town. By the end, we were exhausted. It was a rewarding experience."
Nice walk along with the fortress,"This is made in Bakjae dinasty(7, 8 Century). Used also in Silla and Joseon dinasty. It is not tough at all, very easy walk course. There is also small palace where King stayed(need to buy ticket for the palace). We were lucky to have chance to watch the Korean traditional performance at the yard of South Gate. They said, every last Sunday of the month, there are some traditional performance for visitors. It is free."
"Lovely hiking, views and palace","First of all, if you have time to see only Namhansanseong or Hwaseong(the other unesco listed fortress in the area - in Suwon), most definitely go to this one. The time it takes to get to either of them by public transport from downtown Seoul is roughly equal, but this one has more hiking, more views, more information, and generally more of everything. Do see both of them if you have the time though.Plan for a full day if you can, half a day if you must. The shortest suggested hiking route from the bus stop area is marked as taking about an hour.The fortress is in the provincial park, or the provincial park is in the fortress, can't really tell. Anyway, it's a large forested and hilly area surrounded by a wall with a village (mostly restaurants and cafés) at the centre and some pretty temples and military buildings all over the area.Tourist information isn't marked super well: from the last bus stop head towards the roundabout the bus just crossed and look for two small houses with thatched roofs some 200 m further out and slightly to the left. Once there you can get all the info about the area as well as buy tickets to see the fortress's ""emergency palace"" (guided tour in English at 14.00). There's also an info booth just at the roundabout, but here they only ask you how much time you have, hand you a map and say go this way and that way and bye bye.We came there for half a day, completed half of trail no 1, half of no 2, did some sightseeing at the palace and loved it all very very much. And we plan on coming back to see the rest."
Great choice for a one-day trip from Seoul,"A bit hard to reach by public transport but totally worth it. The fortress covers a huge mountainous area, so be sure to wear hiking shoes. If the weather is nice, you can see a large part of Seoul from the walls. You can choose from among several walking trails. In the valley in the middle of the fortress there are plenty of cafes and restaurants. To get there, take subway no.8 to Sanseong station (not Namhansanseong!) exit 2, and then bus no.9-1. You can also reach it by bus 9 it takes longer and has more stops.Definitely worth visiting!"
"Traditional architecture, free attraction.",The fortress is located in Namhansanseong provincial park. The best thing about the park is the walking but if you come for the palace and the fortress then the fortress is located a short walk up hill from the palace. The fortress is an attractive tradition building with good views over the woodland and Seoul. It is not a particularly large structure so combine it with a short walk along the wall located behind it. For directions see reviews on Namhansanseong provincial park. Unlike the palace the fortress is free.
World Heritage,"Most tourists come to Seoul for food and shopping, but going up the hill in the suburb shows the tranquil part of the city. I did not hike to visit the fortress; a lot of the local do. I only spent an hour or so visiting the old palace and I was impressed."
