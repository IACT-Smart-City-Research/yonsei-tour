A lovely introduction to Korea,"A wonderful service for Transit passengers. Getting out and about during our 13 hour stopover really helped us tide over jet lag quickly in Honolulu.English descriptions on their website really need polishing up though.Here’s a few tips about using this service at T2.• Book as soon as you possibly can. Tours (especially 10AM Tradition) fills up very quickly. That said, even though the bookings for your desired time and day might appear full, it’s worth checking at the Transit Tour Desk when you land as slots open up• You’ll find the Transit Tour Desk within the Transfer area after going through Security screening. We checked in with the friendly staff about 50 minutes before our Tour was scheduled to begin and they told us to immediately go through Immigration and Customs. That took about 15 mins. Once in the public area, head for the Transit Tour Desk near Gate 3 on the 3rd floor. You'll pay for the attraction's entrance fee and lunch charges here (about USD$10). The guys at the desk will store all your hand baggage for you until you arrive back from your tour. Easy.• Feeling peckish? There’s an excellent Paris Baguette outlet across from the Transfer Desk for quick nibbles.• Note the trip into Seoul takes an hour both ways. • Coach is comfortable and our English-speaking guide was very sweet. Just don’t bring food or drinks onto the bus.• If you want to do some shopping in town, do change some Korean currency prior."
"Be prepared in advanced ,it's wonderful ","I booked this transit tour to GwangMyeoung cave in the morning. It's very easy to go to the transit tour counter on the arrival hall on terminal 2 then just showed my booking and my boarding of connecting flight then our group of 8 people with korean tourguide boarded bus to terminal 1 then going to this woderful cave with history of Japanese soldiers history when they invaded korean peninsula , now it transformed into entertaiment park, with aquarium, light and sound showcases in the cave, wine storage chamber and etc. It's courtesy for transit passengers from korean government tourim for organising this free tour."
This is a Fantastic Service,"I had a 13 hour layover in Seoul and was interested in seeing the city a little. I did some checking with people who know Seoul and decided to try to visit one of the famous market areas. When I got to the airport I saw the Transit Tour booth and checked it out. It offered various tours to sites like the Castle in Seoul, some temples, and shopping tours ranging from 1 to 5 hours. They are free! All the time I was on the tour ( to the castle) I was expecting to have to pay some exhorbitant price to get my suitcase back from underneath the tour bus, but no there was no catch, it is FREE! While the schedule for the afternoon shopping tour did not fit my available time, I was able to take a 5 hour tour with about 25 other people on a tour bus with a tour guide who explained things while we were on the bus and kept track of us when we were off the bus. "
Adventure tour,"Could be better signposted in the arrivals hall, after you've cleared immigration - best to walk the length inside the arrivals hall, past all the doors, looking for the transit tour desk. Once booked and joined, very well organised. The young man we had as our guide was excellent. The caves were a revelation; beautifully lit."
This airport is beautiful and very very clean. ,This airport is worth a stop just to see the airport it’s is very very clean newer architecture was over all super fantastic airport they do a great job with signs and English if you’re not from there. 
Great layover trip,"Once you exit out of arrival door, you can easily find the booth to book the tours. You can pick and most of them are free except one of them you have to prepay KRW. I would suggest you bring some cash so you can buy souvenirs while exploring Seoul. The bus is very efficient and on time getting back. The tour is very nice and tour guide had limited English but it was understandable. We came back from Thailand and didn’t have any warm jacket and it was in February in Korea. The tour had puffy winter jackets to borrow!"
Baekunsa Temple tour (1hr),"Please check out the free transit tours laid on at Seoul Incheon airport.I visited the above temple in 2017, and their itinerary has changed since then. However, Seoul goes out of its way to sell South Korea to transit passengers in the hope they will become tourists, and it works.I have found Incheon airport (on my frequent visits) to be characterised by cleanliness, efficiency, and first class service to passengers. The transit tour I took was no different. They check your ticket to make sure you have sufficient time for your selected tour; it runs to time and is interesting; it was free of charge.This tour was the shortest one (all I had time for) and we had about 30mins at the temple to look around. That was enough to get a flavour of the culture and some great photos, I really enjoyed it."
Seoul Incheon Airport Free Tours,Pretty well run tour. The one we took had a charge of usd10 per person I think for food while the tour was free. It's not easy to locate the booth to sign up as it depends where your arrival gate is. So if you cant find it when you arrive dont worry. Clear immigration and walk out. The booth is in the middle of the outside area before you exit the airport. Just choose the tour that suits your time and away you go. There are various ones with different length of time. Tour guide also speaks English and it's pretty straight forward.
Waiting outside the door of the Incheon airport....,"Waiting outside the door of the Incheon airport with around 50 other people trying to get onto the buses is no thrill, and it takes around 40 minutes to an hour drive to get to Incheon!"
A must do tour,"This was such a great tour. It was so worth it, lovely guide - English speaking, lovely scenario and beats the hours of waiting at the airport. The guide was also kind enough to inform us of the free showers and nap zones in transit lounge which made the transit experience even better. I did the Gyeongbokgung palace and Insadong lunch tour, the palace tour was beautiful and there was time to walk around the streets of Insadong after the lunch. Lunch wasn't fancy but it was good enough."
Transit tour is a must,"I can't rave enough about this free tour! We went August 21st with our 4 children 13,11,11and 8 years old. I'm glad we reserved it online months in advance because they were booked solid. Theres limited seating. I do believe 2 people on standby did get on but if you have a big family you will not get on without reservations.Our tour guide was funny and informative! The drive over there went by fast because you get to see the scenery and she explains so much. We went through the palace quickly with her and no you don't want to be left behind because time is of the essence and they have it down to a science. But she leads you through it and explains every part of the palace. She'll even take your picture. The lunch was fine. I loved it but I love bi bim bap. It wasn't the best I've had but I loved the experience. My kids didn't eat any of it however and there were no other options. We paid by credit at the tour counter hoping my kids would eat something which was plain rice. Expensive rice I tell ya but I knew that. Afterwards we had very little time to shop about 30 minutes. It was a fast paced tour, go into it with that in mind. Also, I read many of the reviews on here so I knew that after I got off the plane I had to go to the transit tour desk first before going through customs. Then you have to go to the terminal transit desk again. It was all smooth. No problems. I highly recommend this tour. Check out the airport too if you have time. Most amazing airport besides Changi in Singapore!"
Nice clean safe english speaking ,We have 5 persons 5 luggage. We took limo from Inchon airport to lotte hotel and also head back from hotel to airport with more luggage and trolley bag. It can fit it all. The driver can speak english. The car was clean. 
You must do this if you have a long layover in Seoul,"I have done this tour twice as they have different options. If you have about 4 hours to spare I recommend taking one of their tours. Also, some of the airline if you ask them in advance will waive the small fee. regardless its still worth taking for the small fee. So far I've done both the traditional and palace tours. Both great. I also heard the shopping tour is great."
fun and convenient,"we had a very long lay-over at incheon on our way back to the US last January. I was with my husband and a toddler son. we decided to try this free transit tour for I think 3 hours. it was very convenient, we just went to their booth and a tour guide led us to a van. we had to go through immigration when we exited and entered but the tour guide was there the whole time to help us, so it wasn't a hassle. we got to see temples and small streets around korea. they're beautiful. we are planning to get the long layover schedule the next time we travel and maybe we can try the 5-hour transit tour."
Perfect option how to spend your long stop over in Korea,"It was very enjoyable, great guides. We learned lot about Korea and spent well our time, instead of stuck on the airport. And as a bonus it is free!"
I fly from Vietnam to Japan,"I have a Japanese visa not knowing whether I am eligible for free tour?f possible, I think this will be an interesting experience"
Good and it is actually free !!!,"If you are in Seoul airport and have a long layover, this tour is the best thing to do .It is run by the Korean government and the Incheon airport and is free. You have to pay a small fee ( approximately US $ 2.00 ) . The tour counter is outside the arrivals hall, you have to go past immigration and out through the door and you will find the tour desk next to the Korea Telecom booth in T2 . I was able to get only the temple tour,the heritage was sold out. You have to be at the desk 30 minutes before the tour start time. The travel time from the airport to the city is about 1 hour each way, so you we got an hour at the jeondeungsa Temple & Deokjinjin fort before heading back. The tour guide was a young energetic Korean man who was happy to show off his country. The Jeondeungsa temple involved a bit of going up an incline and has many entrances, one of the families with a child did not get back on time and were lost, the tour guide and the bus driver was gracious and made calls to locate them and pick them up at another gate. This caused a delay of 15 minutes and they managed it well. I would recommend booking the tour online in order to get the best option :)"
Hard to find,"I am sorry to say that i missed my scheduled tour because it was so confusing to find the correct meeting point. My confirmation email noted one location (Terminal 2, Gate 3) that was located just after immigration, but as I eventually learned, is impossible to return to once you pass through and enter into the terminal. There was no one staffing the two transit tour desks in the terminal for hours so I just ran around getting sweating looking for Gate 3. It was a huge disappointment to miss this. I suggest that you ignore whatever directions your email says and simply head straight to the information desk as soon as you pass into the terminal. They can clarify exactly where to find the correct Transit Desk and will advise you to stay there until someone arrives. Do not wait at the Transit Desk in the Transfer Lounge or you will be waiting for hours."

Incheon transit tour,The tour was on time and the guides are knowledgeable. They give you a lot of tips and advise for shopping.
Fun way to pass the time,"I had a 15 hour layover, and from a prior layover experience in Taipei, Taiwan, I knew to look if Incheon Airport also had free transit tours. They do, and many to choose from! I had enough time to do two: 1- The 4-hr Temple tour to Jeondeungsa Temple and Deokjinjin Fortress in the morning, and 2- The 2-hr Old & New tour to Songdo Hanok Village and Triple Shopping Street in the afternoon. The Temple consisted of several lovely buildings in a beautiful, peaceful mountain setting. This was my favorite of all the spots. It took 50 minutes to drive there and we were given 50 minutes to explore, however it took 20 minutes just to walk uphill (not strenuous) from the parking lot to the temple buildings. 10 minutes' drive got us to the fortress, where we had 25 minutes to look around. Unfortunately the pretty building over the main gate had scaffolding all over due to a repainting job underway. There isn't much there in the way of structures, mostly some earthen walls along the waterfront, with cannons. Some nice views of the water. Return trip to the airport took 45 minutes. Tour time is 8am-noon. When they brought us back they stopped first at Terminal 1 at 11:30 am to drop people off, then we got to Terminal 2 at 11:45. So if we hadn't arrived 15 minutes early, there would've been more time at the fortress, and maybe the temple.The second tour was 3-5 pm. It took 25 minutes to reach Triple Street, and we had only 1/2 hr there. It was a little deserted but that was probably the time of day; probably lots more people at night. You don't have any time to shop if you want to check it out. It's about 3 blocks long, with some bits of art here and there to take pics of/with. Not the most exciting thing but nice. Then 25-30 minutes to Songdo Hanok Village, which is several buildings done in the style of a traditional village, which house mostly restaurants and cafes, so if you're looking for more of a historical recreation with interpretive signs, this is not it! It's situated on a waterway across from some ultra modern high-rise buildings, which make for some cool pics. Then a 25-minute ride back to the airport. My tour guide for both tours was Jennie, who was very pleasant and funny.So here are some observations I've made that I didn't read about in any of the other reviews. Except for one, which is you definitely need to be back at the tour bus on time or your guide may become upset (mine didn't)!! Don't keep everyone waiting; South Koreans are punctual and they need to get people back to the airport on time. Anyway, instructions say you need to be at the transit tour desk an hour before your tour. This is true, but confusing because there is more than one transit desk: For both terminals, there is a transit desk inside the departures area (i.e., where only ticketholders are allowed), that is, where you wait between flights. That's the one you need to be at 1 hr before. They bring you through immigration/customs (we got to go through our own security checkpoint to have our bags put through the xray machine, skipping the line) into the general/public area, where the other transit tour desk is. There, you wait til 10 minutes before your tour and then get on the bus. You'll have a little time to kill to get a snack, use the restroom, etc. So don't go on your own through customs! Secondly, if you have gone through customs, you CANNOT then go on a transit tour! The tours are only available if your layover is less than 24 hours, and if you leave your terminal to go into the public area or outside the airport for any reason, you're disqualified for a tour. There was one sign at the tour desk in the layover part of the terminal stating this, and I never saw this info listed anywhere else. However, the tour agents knew I was doing two tours, and advised me to stay in the public area in between tours (three-hour gap) and not go back to the ticketholder-only area.Also, since I had so much time I did my research on all the things you can see in the airport (i.e., art and cultural stuff). My flights arrived and left from Terminal 2, both to and from my ultimate destinations. There seem to be several things which are only available in Terminal 1, though, and since I had time to kill, I wanted to visit Terminal 1. It was very difficult getting any airport employee to explain to me how this could be accomplished (language barrier and lack of knowledge of how things worked there). They have brochures explaining how to do it but I didn't have time to decipher it. I finally talked to someone who was able to explain to me that I didn't have enough time. It can take up to half an hour to go from one terminal to another (one way!) and depending on the time of day, possibly half an hour or more to get through customs (which you'd have to go thru again on your way back). So I went looking for the nap lounges instead, lol. That was on my inbound trip. On my return trip, I again attempted to visit Terminal 1, using my boarding pass, which has a barcode you scan to pass through a gate to the airport shuttle/train. It wouldn't open for me. I talked to a few unhelpful people (they were nice, just didn't know the answers to my questions), before I finally found out the story from one of the immigration officers in customs. Turns out if your flight leaves from a particular terminal, you are NOT allowed to visit the other terminal. My flight left from Terminal 2 and that's where I had to stay. I was bummed, to say the least. In case you're curious, here's a list of the things they only have in Terminal 1: a) Korean Cultural Street (houses and gazebo), b) Palace Trip With a Character (video tour of Korean palaces), c) Korean antiquities exhibit, d) seven indoor gardens (not sure if these are living or fake plants), e) Walk of the Royal Family (people wearing traditional royal Korean outfits). But it turns out even if I had been able to visit Terminal 1, I wouldn't have been able to go on the tours! So overall, I highly recommend them. I just wish the Traditional tour (to the royal palace and Insadong Street) was available in the afternoon too, as I'm most interested in historical sites."
Why Incheon is the world's best airport!,"Free Korea Transit Tours are simply amazing. The new Terminal 2 at the airport would have been great but with a range of practically free tours these options are the best. Trips range from 1 to 5 hours, some of the longer ones have a small charge $4-10USD but totally worth it. You feel like you're in safe hands and you'll see some real highlights!"
"13 Hours in Seoul, S. Korea","Excellent tour if you have an extended transit in Seoul. The cost is $20 for 2 & covered lunch & the entrance to the palace. Some shopping time was provided. The guide was funny, helpful, & professional. She did not solicit or encourage tipping. My wife & I enjoyed the tour & saw a bit of Seoul."
Great free way to spend a longer layover in Incheon Airport,Fantastic way to spend a long layover at Incheon Airport. Very well organized and put together. My family and I took the Palace and Seoul tour. Next time we will spend even more time in Korea to take in even more sites and experiences.
You must take transit tours,Visiting Korea through the transit tour is always worth it. The tours are well planned and they have provisions like coats in winter. It is admirable how they present the finer points of their customs and traditions.
amazing airport,the airport is so cool they can house a mini forest. they have shower rooms for those in transit for so long before their next flight
Cave tour,The transit tours are a great FREE way to kill time after a long layover. The one we wanted to go on was unfortunately full but we were able to go to the cave tour and it was pleasantly surprising. We had a great time and the tour guide was extremely informative and funny. I think you can book online a day or two in advance to ensure you get the tour you want. they are small groups of I think max 10 people
Great For Airport Layover,"We had what seemed to be an awful layover but decided to make lemonade out of lemons. South Korea is just about the most laid back, friendly place I have been and I have been to some places!! Get the temple and downtown tour with lunch. You will not be disappointed. If you have time when you get back to the airport jump on the shuttle to the casino...it's super nice!"
Very nice airport ,This is my first time going to korea. My first stop was incheon airport. Is big and clean. I love the robot :)
Arrive (really) early for this wonderful free tour,"We took the Traditional Tour and loved seeing the palace, eating at a traditional Korean restaurant, and visiting the tiny shops downtown. Plan to arrive at the Transit Tour kiosk at least an hour earlier than the tour is set to start, since by “start” they mean driving away in the bus and you do have to get through customs first."
Can't wait to go back!,"Won't deny it, probably the only good time to hope for a layover. The tour guide was very polite and respectful of people's values (some culture's do not like getting their picture taken). Guide was informative and friendly, great scenery, I will definitely do this again."
World class airport ,"What a great airport!From the transportation (KAL limousine) up the counter service, the size of halls, everything!Very efficient way customs, good duty free "
READ if you are planning a transit tour...,"I gave this tour a very poor rating on a previous visit during which the booked/planned destination was changed and it felt like a complete waste of time.I had another 8 hr layover at ICN and decided to try the tour again and this time things were much better. Joy, our tour guide, was excellent. She spoke most of the way to every destination, which gave us a lot of useful information about the area and destination site The 1-2 hr tours are very short due to ICN being really far out of the way, but we had plenty of time to take some pretty awesome pictures.PLEASE NOTE the transit tour schedules listed on Incheon Airport website are completely wrong!!! The schedule and tour destinations do not match what's running at the airport. Please see my attached picture for the current schedule as of February 2019."
Great Free Tour,"We went on a free tour during our long layover in Korea. It was Monday so the tour we wanted to do was closed so we went on the Incheon city tour. We visited traditional homes, tried on Hanbok, and went to the market. We only had about one hour at the market. I wish we would have had some time to walk around and shop. Most of the market was not open yet so only a few stalls had food out when we arrived. My husband and I found a restaurant and ate some good Korean food. This tour was a good way to spend a few hours outside of the airport. Getting out and back in was easy and quick. We are glad we went to see some of the city. This is nice that the airport offers this free service."
Worth the time but hope they don’t overbook ,"Overall I’m glad we did this tour during our 12 hour layover in Seoul. We took the 5 hour Traditional tour.Pros: free, convenient, great way to see part of Seoul when you don’t have much time. Cons: they overbooked the tour so we almost didn’t get to go, the tour guide didn’t speak English well and was very hard to understand. Normally this is not an issue, we are in her country after all! However, as a tour guide it would have been better if she could be better understood when English was the common language spoken by people from all over on this tour. "
Excellent way to fill in a transit period - and FREE!,"Incheon International Airport is superlative in its comfort, elegance, design and the services that are provided for travelers...and the Incheon Airport Transit Tour is a fine example of this airport's remarkable attention to customer service. The tours are completely free to passengers who are in transit through Incheon Airport. Booking is done online via the official Incheon Airport website - all you have to do is provide evidence of your incoming and outgoing flights. A good range of tours is offered, of varying duration, and these cover aspects such as shopping, casino, local sight, cultural destinations. We opted for the Jeondeungsa Temple & Deokjinjin fortress tour, which was from 8am to 12 midday. Pick-up is from the Transit Tour Desk in Terminal 1 and 2, and the tour is in a coach with a very pleasant English-speaking guide. Although I feared that the tour might by geared towards taking passengers to shops, outlets, etc, the whole time was spent visiting the tranquil Jeondeungsa Temple in its lovely mountain setting, then onto Deokjinjin fortress which overlooks a strategic sea inlet. Both locations were interesting and provided a brief but fascinating insight into the culture and history of Korea. Excellent quality, interesting and totally free. Wonderful."
Stretching our Legs,"I wanted to check out the free transit tours offered by the airport. We tried the short 2 hour tour. You do have to exit the airport and must go through immigration, so, allow time before and after the tour. We signed up online, but, there seemed to be room on the tours for walk-ins. This ""shopping"" tour was not worth it as 80 minutes of your 2 hour tour is spent on the bus driving to and from the airport. Only 20 minutes was allowed for shopping which really is not much time at all. The shops were high end ones that you could find at the airport. Caution, the bus drivers won't allow food and drink on the bus, so, don't get your Starbuck's coffee to go! Perhaps, the longer tours would be better. Free is free and we appreciated the efforts of the guide and the concept. The offerings at Incheon Airport are geared to making your experience great."
Great Service offered by a great Airport,"My family and I recently had a 10 hour lay over in Korea. Firstly, Incheon Airport is the best airport I have visited to date. Clean and modern.The free rest and shower areas for in transit passengers are wonderful. There are also plenty of food outlets and convenience stores. The customs and immigration staff were polite and friendly (take note LAX!!!). The airport also offers a variety of free tours to various locations in the area, ranging from 1 - 5 hours. My family and I opted for two tours. One to a Buddhist temple and another to a shopping precinct and traditional Korean cultural centre/park. The buses provided were modern and clean. The tour guides were wonderful and spoke great English. What a great service to offer travel weary guests. I will definitely go back to Korea and see more of the country."
ICN is a first class airport,"ICN is a very nice and modern airport, lots of things to do and see during a layover. The complementary airport tours are the best, allowing visitors the opportunity to see a bit of the city and experience the cultural during a layover. "
Wonderful use of a layover ,We recently had a long layover in Korea of 12 hours and wanted to make the most it. We were recommended the free transit tours and thankfully we fortunate enough to get a spot for our family of four . We loved it ! We did the Traditional tour which included a tour of a Palace and lunch at a good family owned restaurant. Our tour guide Jean was spectacular! She was prompt and informative and even entertained us with Christmas carols and the Korea nation anthem . My entire family loved the experience! Thank you ! 
Incheon airport world class.,Incheon airport is very beautiful and luxurious and passengers avail many many free services free shower area free rest area is wonderful and helpful for transit passengers and people are very kind helpful lovely language korea i love korea.
Terrific experience!,We had an 11 hour layover traveling from Phuket to Seattle at Incheon airport. We had read about the free transit tours online. We weren’t sure we were up for the messing around to leave the airport or if the experience would be worth it. It was great! Very friendly people. Well organized and very helpful/friendly (though they did not tell us we needed to fill out a customs form before we could leave the airport). We did the 5 hour traditional tour. The palace we visited was great and the group lunch at a small local spot was terrific. Our guide was a stickler for rules - but no one was confused and no one got left behind. The whole deal was $10 a person (7 for lunch and 3 to get into the palace). Well worth the time and energy if you have a long layover! Terrific airport service. 
5 Hours Flew by with Awesome Tour Guide!,"What a deal. For Traditional, you pay for food and entrance fee to museum of $10, but everything else is totally free. Enjoyable trip. We had an amazing tour guide named Jean. She kept us constantly engaged with interesting tidbits of information and was very watchful over our team, encouraging us all to stick with her while she talked us through the sites. At one point at the palace you can wander off, but I don't think there was a person on our tour trip who wanted to leave her. Really enjoyed my time. I can't imagine a better way to spend on a long layover."
Totally worth it!!,"It is a free tour so who's to complain? There's wifi in the bus. In the Traditional tour you need to pay $10 for the lunch. It is not bad anyway you get shuttled to Seoul. You can go off on your own once in Seoul but tell the guide that you will not be riding back at the bus so they will not wait for you. Of course going back to the airport, you need to travel back on your own."
"mediocre tour guide, great tour","The idea of a 5 free tour (+$10 for entrance and food) was very appealing for our 8 hour layover today. There are some things to be aware of. The sights are an hour drive each way, so if you don't mind sitting on a bus, it is interesting to look out the window at apartment blocks and factories. Our tour guide was ""tyrannical"" and lacked any kind of humor that would make someone feel welcome. She basically barked orders and hardly explained anything at all. She wanted us all to know we had come to South Korea and not North and that she had no idea why they split in 1945. When someone was a few minutes late getting on the bus, she wanted them to apologize to the entire bus. (seriously). Be careful to take extra note of where the bus is parked so you can find it again at the designated time/place. After some effort to tune the tour guide out, the tour was a good way to occupy some time during a layover and see some sights in Seoul. And the lunch was really good, in a local restaurant!"
Best deal if your layover is 6hrs or more,My parents 12hrs layover was well occupied. I booked them with a 5-hr tour and a 2-hr tour and they were so happy to see South Korea on a different level. They definitely want to see more now.
Fly through tour was amazing!,"What a great service this tour is for travellers. We had a 13 hour layover and found the tour desk. They helped us pick a tour, find the desk, and provided great information. The tour was wonderful, the guide informative and prompt. Great way to pass the time and have a quick glimpse of Korea!"
question regarding transit tour,Hi...what time does the tour usually start? I have a 6-hr layover in Incheon but my plane will leave past 10 AM. Is there any tour that starts as early as 6 am from the airport?
Excellent way to see Seoul,Everything was so well organized. They have different tours for different layover schedules. It includes the tour bus and the tour guide. They even have jackets if the weather is cold and you didn't bring any. They make it so easy to join these tours. I prefer this than just sitting at the airport and eating - though the airport is also a great place.
Layover Wonder,"When I booked a ticket to Vietnam via Korea, I didn’t realize the length of the layover 14+ hrs each way. No wonder tickets were cheap! I booked a hotel for that time then I wondered what to do during that time? Enters the Free Korea Transit Tour at Incheon Airport. What a magnificent idea! I booked the “Tradition” tour (5+ hrs) and visited a beautiful palace (Gyeongbokgung), shopped around at Insadong, and had lunch with locals. On my way back, I booked the “Temple 2” tour (4+ hrs) and visited a Buddhist temple (Jogyesa) and walked around the restored Cheonggyecheon Stream plucked in the middle of downtown Seoul. What an experience! Awesome way to spend the time, the Tour Guides were awesome too. This is a hit for the Korea National Tourism agency that created it!"
Do it!,"I had a 10 hour layover in Seoul and am so incredibly happy I did the 5 hour Traditional Tour. It was nice to talk to like minded travelers and get out of the airport and have a look around in such a great city. I paid only 10 dollars for lunch, I didn't even convert money (although there is great shopping potential if you want to). I went through customs and found the stand downstairs in the lobby (there are signs but I also saw a brochure on the way out and grabbed it, asked a security guard for help). I was there at about 10am so just made the Traditional Tour. Gorgeous palace (and lucked out with stunning weather, the fresh air felt so nice after a long flight), fun easy lunch in the back streets, and just great general walking around shops and parks. Got back at the airport with just over 2 hours until my flight which was perfect. It was such a lovely day, and definitely makes me want to go back to Seoul to stay a bit longer. I think even if you aren't super impressed you have to remember it's just a better way to spend your extra time then in a crowded space on your phone or laptop for hours.Note: They are VERY strict about being on time when you meet back up (for our benefit, really). I watched a nice man get scolded at like he was a child for being two minutes late."
Everything i know now that I wish I knew 3 hours ago!,"I've been through Seoul several times with long layovers, but have never taken the transit tour. In theory, it sounds great - they organize the travel, it is (mostly) free, and you get kill time while seeing a new city. The reality of it is a bit more complicated in terms of navigating the airport. Perhaps I went wrong by trying to plan too much in advance and relying on a pretty crummy ""official"" website. Here's what I learned.1) Online reservations - yes, you can do this, but they apparently have extra seats so don't be dissuaded if it looks like your tour is full.2) Don't worry about T1 vs. T2 tours: This is where I went terribly wrong. Based on the website, it made it look like some tours you could only pick up at one terminal and others at another. So when I arrived in T1, I took the shuttle and then ran as fast as i could to T2. As it turned out, the tour bus was coming by T1 and I could have avoided the run, but the website didn't really indicate that (see photo of schedule)3) They are pretty serious about getting to the Tour Transit desk 30+ minutes early. I found that the tour transit desk (Usually near the Transit lounge) is BEFORE immigration, so when they give you immigration forms on the airplane, take them and fill them out. Just put in that you are doing the transit tour. Then the transit tour representative will walk you personally through security and immigration. 4) Finally, outside of immigration, you go to the transit tour desk (the desk closest to the actual bus). i arrived at 9:50 there for a 10am tour, but the bus had already left to pick people up at T1 for the same tour (where i started!!!). Ugh. Anyway lesson learned. Hopefully it can help you out.Next time, I'll just ask the transit tour person before immigration what is available and grab the next tour without stressing, but allocating enought time."
Don't do the City Tour early. ,We signed up for the 2 hours City Tour from 9 to 11am. It was a total waste because nothing is open yet. Perhaps other tours would be better.
Worth The Time,"We landed around 6:30 am in Korea and since we thought nothing would be open we lazily went through customs and immigration etc. As it turns out, we wish we had hustled so we could get on the 8am tour that leaves the terminal. It’s a 5-hour tour that takes you to Seoul to a famous palace, then over to an authentic lunch with about 45-60 minutes to just walk around and shop. It’s a 5 hour tour because you spend about an hour each way on a nice/air conditioned bus. We ended up on the 10am tour and I wish we could have played that smarter and got on the 8am. In addition to maybe getting a second tour in, the 8am tour has a chance to see the changing of the guards at the palace. Not sure if that’s worth it or not, but at least its something unique.The tour is free, but you have to pay $10 to cover the cost of the meal and entrance into the palace. Generally we thought it was worth it to do that tour. Some of my kids liked it better than others (total of 8 in our group), but generally our family gave it a thumbs up. It was super hot — the palace has stone walkways everywhere so it makes is feel hotter than the air really is. The other nice thing about doing the 8am free tour is that you get back with plenty of time to do another tour. They have free WiFi on the bus (very nice!) but if you want internet access everywhere you go while out and about, there are 2 places right next to the meeting point where you can rent a hot spot for the day for just $3, so if you want to have great internet access even while you’re walking around the palace and don’t want to go onto international roaming, then that’s a cheap way to have internet accessOne last thing...as you approach the customs/immigration area after you debark, there’s a desk there where you can reserve a spot on your tour. A pretty helpful lady is there. So you may want to get your spot reserved there so that you’re not trying to get one down on the main floor. If you are traveling alone and they say it’s full, I’d still go down and try to get on because they apparently have plenty of no-shows. I heard that you can reserve a spot online as well, but I didn’t try that.Our tour guide was Nicky and she did a pretty good job. She has a cute personality but her English was so-so. She tried hard and her choices of words were funny — we enjoyed her a lot!"
Great way to pass time,"We arrived in South Korea around 9:00am in the morning and had a 10 hour layover. We decided to take one of the tours. It cost us $10.00 US funds which included lunch. We learned a lot from the enthusiastic tour guide, she really made the trip fun and interesting with a sense of humour. We took the bus ride from our terminal to the temples, then to the market for shopping and lunch. This was much better than sitting in an airport for 10 hours. I would definitely do it again."
Waste of Time,"I arrived at the airport at around 5 in the morning. The arrival area is so confusing. Got pass security and custom and has to asked couple of times to locate the booth. I thought Korean has better command of English (compare to Japanese). Wrong! After some walk, I finally located the booth and has to wait for someone until 7:30am. The girl at the counter was totally rude (gave Korea a bad name). I saw her rude to other people too. I gave her everything and was taking a moment to select which tour. She made up line up again the last only was told to be put on waiting list. I wanted to join the shopping tour but I had only less than 12 hours of layover so I couldn't make it. Join the palace tour instead. Big mistake. The actual palace was closed and we went to another one. It is only the heat and the palace sooooo boring. I know shouldn't expect much from a palace but it is really nothing to see. Nothing like those in Japan. The tour sent us to a shady restaurant for lunch and made us shoot photo twice, and pretended to be funny. I know this is free but I paid $10US for admission. I should have spent my time in the airport chilling, and go eat and shopping instead. What a waste of time!"
A great way to spend a long layover,"When I booked my flight to the Philippines via Asiana airlines I saw that I had a 10 hour layover in Korea. I was at first dreading that because since I don't have any airline status and don't have access to business lounges what can I do for 10 hours. After reading some blogs it was said they (the airport) offer a free transit tour of the city. They offer different packages in the tour. I wanted to do the palace tour but since my flight was late I missed out and instead took the shopping tour. The shopping tour takes you to the two most popular shopping areas of Myeong-dong and Namdaemun Market. There is so much to do. So much shopping and some of the best street food you can eat. I don't think I was able to see everything. There is a tour guide that speaks really good English and gives you a bit of info before you go on your own. The tour is strict on time, so if you plan on sticking with the tour group follow the tour guide's advise. I think you can go on your own after the tour but you have to let the guide know. So if your travel plans take you on a long layover through Korea, inquire about this tour. You won't regret it. It's on a first come, first serve basis. So don't waste time. Because you have to leave the airport there is some processes with immigration you have go though. But still, DO THIS TOUR!!!!?"
Wonderful airport! Wonderful tour!,"Such a wonderful airport with great service, especially with Very good transit service! I have visited a Buddhist temple and they have had provided me all the service in between!"
"Excellent Way to spend a long layover in Seoul, Korea","My family and I had a 12 hour layover at Incheon airport between flights from Saipan to Manila. I had transited this airport several years ago and knew there was a PAID ($40) available and was ready to pay the fee because even then it was a great deal.However, since then the airport has initiated a “free” tour and we took it.We paid $10 and this was for a lunch that was provided at a quaint little hole in the wall establishment which was quite good, as well as entry in to an old (700 years) palace. The guide spoke excellent English and was very knowledgeable, but very frank when people were late after any of the excursions. The tour started at 0900, and we were back at the airport by 1400, I recommend this to anyone who has at least 6 hours to kill in Incheon airport. The idea is to give you a taste of Korea so you will want to come back and make a longer visit."
Did the 5 hour,Took the 10am to the Royal Palce. The guide was great. Her name was Parker. It was a rainy day so she took us the mesuem to stay in doors. Its worth doing.
Great tour,Took 3 hours transit city tour. Excellent tour. Guide Edward was great! It is nice opportunity to visit Incheon and also utilise your layover time.
Greta tour,"Great free tour provided by Incheon airport. I only wish there was more time to enjoy the shopping street in downtown Seoul, but otherwise, a nice visit to the Palace and a great guide. The tour made it easier to spend a long layover at the airport. "
"If you have the time, do it!","First off, the transit tour is FREE! We just paid for lunch in a restaurant located in a very traditional looking korean village. There were a lot of opportunities to buy souveneirs.We also visited the Gyeongbokgung Palace in Seoul, to my wife's delight. The tough part was we had with us 2 baby strollers, but the papace grounds were laid out with uneven cobblestone. It was quite difficult to move around, so with the time we had, we limited our visit to the main hall and the gardens near it.All in all good way to spend transit time, the best in fact in any airport I've been to thus far."
Crappy instructions/airport support,"We had reservations for 8 am traditional tour. Instructions say to meet at main desk 30 minutes before. Our flight arrived at 5:30 AM, terminal 2, so we decided to freshen up in the lounge before embarking for the day. At 7 AM, we try to figure out where the main desk is. It says it’s through immigration, but we can’t figure out how to get to immigration once you’re inside the terminal past security (turns out you have to go up to the transfer desk, get your boarding pass stamped, and then go through a reverse security.... but no one can explain this). Instead, when we try to ask for help Information and security sends us to the transit tour desk inside of T2. We get there at 7:15, and no ones there. Someone’s there every 30 minutes. So at 7:30 she shows up and tells us we won’t make our tour because we’re suppose to be at her T2 desk 1 hour before. Our email said 30 minutes before, but at the main desk. No one could tell us how to get to the main desk and they insisted we wait at the T2 desk.I don’t know if you call it our fault or theirs- for crappy and inconsistent instructions. It may have been more straightforward if we had directly exited the terminal to immigration upon arrival, instead of passing T2 security and staying in the lounge.... but I didn’t appreciate being admonished for not being on time when we made every effort to be on time and was given circular instructions from everyone we encountered. Waste of time. "
Very good service ,Good city tour if you have over 8 he’s waiting for your next fly or 1 day stay over in Seoul!! Some tour is free and they pick up you at the airport and drop you back in the place !! You can get information from the inside after you get off the airplane!! They do speak English too and very service!! I love Seoul it’s fun city and Incheon airport so beautiful and they have express train to the city take only 45’ and cost 8$us at the airport you can take shower too very nice and clean! Very good service at the airport 
Great way to spend a long layover,"Had a 5 hour layover at Incheon International Airport last June 3. We were flying from Rome to Manila via Asiana Airlines with a layover at Incheon.We took the 2 hour Songco, Incheon tour. Our tourist guide was B.J. who was very friendly and seemed to love his job.The free 2 hour tour was a great way to while away our 5 hour layover. We were very impressed with thethe New Town portion of Incheon, espcially Triple Street ( the main commercial strip ) and ""Central Park"" --the 2 places where we stopped during our tour. The sight of the skyscrapers after spending a month in a medieval town in Italy was certainly a great contrast.Kudos to the management of Incheon International Airport--not only for their free tours but also for all their facilities in the airport including comfortable lounge chairs where one can sleep. On the way to Rome from Manila, we had a longer layover at Incheon ( 7 hours ) but we were there at night so we could not take advantage of the free tours. But we were able to sleep in their comfortable lounge chairs. Marilou ReyesPhilippines"
Lovely one-hour tour while waiting for our next flight,"We had a nine-hour layover in Incheon and knew about the free tours, so when we landed in Terminal 2, we decided to go straight to Terminal 1 and find a kiosk in order to register for a tour. The young lady we spoke to told us to come back 2 hours later to hop on a 1-hour tour of a temple. We did so and she took us back to Terminal 2 and rushed us through customs without telling us that we would need to fill out a form (we thought the ticket for a transit tour would be enough). No big deal, it only took a few minutes to fill out the form, get out and find the main desk. When we got there, we were told that the 2pm tour was now full, and we were ""stuck"" at the departure zone of Terminal 2 without anything to do for more than two hours, when we could have stayed where we were and enjoy the Asiana lounge. That was a bummer. When the clock finally hit 3pm (5 hours into the layover), we met with Heejay, our tour guide who informed us that we would be the only people on the bus because of no-shows. And the tour ended up being a fantastic experience, mostly because of Heejay telling us stories about South Korea, about the temple and her own experience with the city & her views on spirituality. We loved every minute of it. It's a nice concept overall and it does make you want to visit South Korea when executed well. So if you're up for an unexpected adventure, go for it. If you would rather play it safe and hate waiting, stay within the airport and enjoy the free shower rooms and nap areas instead."
Layover Nirvana,"If you've ever been stuck on a long layover in an airport, a good free tour is the perfect remedy. Due to a blown connection because of a late departure out of SEA, a free tour became a perfect option. The options were quite impressive, and we chose the 5 hour tour of Gyeongbokgung Palace, the Insadong area, and an included lunch in a local restaurant of Bimibap. The tour was incredibly well done, the guide was easy to talk to, answered our queries, and the sights and lunch were very well put together. While it's a 1hr drive into Seoul, both ways, it was still very much worth the effort. If you have a shorter time available between connection flights, their tours range from 1 hr. (for closer locations), up to the tour we took of five hours. You can also book multiple tours should you have the time.All the tours are offered free of charge with the exception of the 5 hour tour, which carried a 10 usd fee for the included lunch. If ya got the time stuck in the airport, ya can't beat it.The tour desk is downstairs and the very end of the departures area where the hotel shuttle buses arrive and depart."
Good Tour - but wouldn't do again,"It takes at least 1hr on the bus each way to go anywhere, just a lot of time wasted on the bus rides. Had booked the long layover at Incheon to take the tours. If I'd known the bus rides were that long, I wouldn't have taken the tour. So with the forewarnings done - to take the tour go through immigration then go down to the first floor (we were at term2 ) we saw area/gate C, turn right walk through a corridor to reach D and you'll be able to find the tour desk between exit 8 & 9. This is where you can book the tour. You can also pre-book it online, but they'll ask again at the tour desk. Had the temple tour and shopping tour-- shopping tour was quite a bore since there's no time to do anything."
Good free tour.,Very great of the airport to put on a free tour like this! Special thanks to Jung Heejae from the tour desk for all the help in making this trip possible and being so helpful!
Surprisingly good,"I was hesitating when I first found that this tour exists. I had 20hr layover, chose the first seoul city tour and the last that they have. Downside i guess is for the last tour. It said in the itinerary that we'll visit the Seoul tower but did not actually do it. If you are looking forward to eating street foods in Myeongdong the tour isnt maybe the best idea. When we were there, the street food carts started setting up like 10mins before we had to leave. Overall experience is good. The tourist guides are good in english. They will understand you so no need to worry about it. Plus, it's free, what more can you ask for.Although maybe if you have as much time as i did, take the first tour just to get to the city, then roam on your own instead of going back to the airport with the group. Then you can take the train to the airport fro. Seoul. But for first timers, and those who are not confident on going alone, the tours are great choice. You can combine the tours, the helpdesk will fix that for you. For every tour you book you will have to go back to the airport and depart from there. I dont think it's possible to meet the new tour group in the city. The tourist guides are really helpful and nice. I highly recommend this.If you have a tight schedule you can tell them and they will fix the schedule of when the tour will end. But at the same time, it might or will cut the tour shorter for the other people in your group. "
Transit tour,Very nice and its free!!! Will be back for sure!! The tourist guide is knowledgable and very patient.
Excellent initiative to promote local attractions,"I had a long layover, different free-tours are offered. Great options to get to see local attractions and very nice staff. Counter is located before migration, they will recommend the best option based on the itinerary."
"Missed the tour, but we took the bus","It was very easy to get into downtown Seoul by bus from the Airport. And along the way, everyone was helpful and polite. Very few signs in English, though, so minor acts of kindness were plentiful. The trip in took 2 hours because it was snowing and the traffic was bad at about 10:am. We strolled around the walking streets area, Myeongdong,which was very fun. The trip home lasted only an hour, buses leaving every ten minutes. Re/entry to the airport was a snap, uncrowded and efficient at about 2:pm.Highly recommended."
Great tour!,"I went on the 4-ish hour tour of the palace and the market. Very worthwhile, I would definitely recommend. The tour people at the airport are very helpful showing you where to go; you can store luggage on the tour bus, they had warm jackets for us to borrow due to chilly weather. It’s a free tour, but lunch was $10–we had the choice of veggie bibimbap or beef stew. It was great!"
One of the best Airport I've been to,"airport transit tour s are great and they're free. there's a 5 hr, 4hr or 2 hr tours all throughout the day"
Every city should have this!,What an awesome idea to offer in-transit travelers a chance to see the highlights of Seoul while on layover. We had planned our trip specifically do enjoy a 17 hour layover in Seoul and do these trips. Saw the royal palace and had lunch at a nice authentic Korean restaurant.. There was a $10 charge but it included admission to the palace and lunch. Not a bad deal! We also had time to take a trip to the BMW Driving Center to check out their road courses and sit in new cars. No driving on this tour unfortunately but it was still fun. 
Good airport and easy travel,"We traveled for the first time to Incheon and things went very smooth. If you enjoy shopping there are many duty free choices. I was disappointed on the restaurant choices, we didn't find any nice restaurants/bars in the airport - only fast food / food court area. Finding gates wasn't a problem."
Good tour and photo opportunities!,"I learned about this tour group when I arrived at Incheon airport. Prior to immigration, they have an information desk where you can see what tours are available. If you like what you hear, then you proceed through immigration and then go to their kiosk near door 9 to formally sign up. It’s also possible to reserve ahead of time, which is a good idea. The tours I really wanted to do were already full. I went on the BMW driving center tour and the tour to G Tower. On the BMW tour, you can sit in a M3, an i8, a 760Li or one of many other cars without feeling the pressure of a salesman to buy something or get out. You can also get close to a &$900,000 Rolls Royce Phantom. It was kinda fun!On the G Tower tour you get to see a new city, one that’s been recently been built on landfill bordering the old part of Incheon. At first, I was afraid it would be boring, but on this super cold day in S Korea (14 degrees F!) I managed to photo some beautiful impressionistic and surreal depictions of a city under change. I recommend checking out a tour if you have a long layover in Seoul."
Nice way to spend wait time,We took two tours on one day as we had a late flight. Nice way to find out about Incheon and surrounds. Great to have free tours for transit travellers.
International Nursing Conference,"One of the most beautiful airports i have seen so far. It’s clean and accommodating. It is -4 degrees Celsius when we arrived January 9, 2018 and expect a lower than usual. Its not a very busy terminal compared to NAIA III or the one in Suvarnabub, Thailand. If you happen to arrive later than 10pm you might just as well wait early am for the train or bus (for heavier luggage) for you to travel Seoul or other parts of Korea. "
"""Clean & tidy Car services""",Very nice services. They provide clean and spacious car to transit Airport. The car was available on the time.Great!!
Well organized and you get to see glimpses of South Korea,"The INCHEON AIRPORT TRANSIT TOUR is perfect for that waiting time in between flights. The best part - it's absolutely free.The minute you land at Incheon Airport, you can check with their information services and figure out the tour schedule available for the day. They usually have their transit tours starting from 7 a.m right up till late noon.The tours include temple tours in Incheon, a Korean drama set tour, a cave tour and a Seoul City tour. You can choose the tour that is most ideal for you basis your available time at the airport. Once you decide which tour you want to go for, you can register yourself and then be present at the departure counter. They have buses along with tour guides arranged for each of these tours. The tour guides provide a detailed explanation on the place of visit. These tours are timely and the buses depart and arrive exactly as per the mentioned time. So it's best if you head to the tour counter a couple of minutes in advance so as to not miss the bus. The only requirement for the tour is that your native country regulations allow you to enter Korea or you have a US Visa or your final destination Visa enables you to enter Korea.My transit tour mainly consisted of 2 temples. One was the Yonggungsa Temple which is beautiful and even boasts of a tree which is over 1300 years old. And the other one was Heungryunsa Temple which was established almost 600 years ago. We even got to see the Korean War Memorial."
great way to spend a layover,"Great way to spend a long layover at ICN! I joined the 5 hour 10:00 tour which took us to Changdeok Palace and Insadong street. For this particular tour there was a small fee of $10 (well worth it) to cover entrance to the palace and lunch at Insadong street, but everything else was free. The bus was average, a standard tour bus (we had a larger group, so it was a coach), I would have liked to see a restroom on board but everything else was fine. They did offer warm coats which was great, because it was snowing that day. The bus ride was comfortable, the tour simple but informative, and the food was great. If you want a good way to spend a few hours without venturing out on your own, I would recommend checking out the tours offered."
What a service,If you have a layover at the airport check out the transit tours. The staff are helpful and there are plenty of options to choose from. I had a long layover so did two trips one to a temple close by and one to Incheon. I wish other international airports offered a similar service. Best of all this is entirely FREE.
Great way to see a bit of Korea during a layover,Free! We had 8 hours but were nervous about leaVing the airport for a transit tour. We shouldn’t of been concerned as the South Koreans are extremely organized. After we went through immigration and customs we went to an information desk and asked about the free transit tours. We were pointed to the free tour desk; there were many options one hour to five hour tour options. They were extremely well organized and very conscientious when it came to time..... like the Swiss! We took the two hour tour - it was good to get out of the airport see a bit of Incheon ..... and then we took a second one hour tour. No shopping involved; it’s winter and parkas were provided. Everything was free.
Like the tours!,"I had 9 hours at Icheon Airport and was very happy to join 1 hour tour to Yonggungsa Temple from 7am to 8 am and 5 hours tour from 8 am to 1 pm to Gyeongbok palace and Insadong street.Everything smooth and pleasant. Good bus, nice guide, no trafic jam and every body on time.If you haven't registered online for the free tour, don't worry, go to their booth to check and register there. You don't have to worry about the custom check as well, just fill in the forms as all other people, state clearly about the free tour."
What else have you got to do?,"I can't understand why anyone would complain about a free tour? If nothing else, you go for a drive and see a little bit of the country for zero dollars. I took the 5 hour tour #3 that went to one of the palaces. There was a $10 fee which covered lunch and entrance. The palace was beautiful, the lunch was authentic and I got to mingle with other travelers, and the shopping street was nice to pick up some souvenirs for home. They could expand the scope of the tour by adding other attractions but even without that I thought the five hours was a good way to spend a long layover. I've got to hand it to the South Koreans who can provide a free tour of Seoul when Los Angeles airport can't even provide free wi-fi without jumping through a thousand hoops."
What a waste of time!,"Since Delta rekindled its relationship with Korean Air, it was been connecting flights at Incheon with 7+ hr layover, so I decided to book one 2-hr tour and another 1-hr tour of the nearby temples and learn about Korean culture and history.What a colossal waste of time! Upon check-in, we were told the 2-hr tour is no longer a temple but a shopping mall or something. The actual tour turn out to be a visit to the business center of Incheon Free Economic Zone building - the only ""shopping"" there was a convenient store We did stop for gas at a gas station if you count that as exciting The tour is basically a government sponsored propaganda machine, tell visitor Korea and particularly Incheon is a good place to invest money and move your business. The only good thing out of this is the photo op for the Incheon IFEZ Central Park.My next tour was supposed to be a 1-hr tour to another temple, but it too was changed to a 1/2-hr visit to the freakin' airport hotel casino!I did hear another visitor had a decently 5-hr tour to the city shopping center. Unfortunately to passenger that arrive after 11am, your options are these useless 1 or 2 hr propaganda tours. For a moment, I honestly thought I landed in North Korea instead of South Korea.This lie of change decimated my layover and didn't leave me enough time to go to the city center on my own.WARNING - DO NOT WASTE TIME WITH THESE 1/2 HR TOURS. You are better off taking a train/bus to the city center on your own."
Don't miss it! long transit? take the tour(s),"Had a very long connection in Seoul, so took 2 tours back to back.A 5 hour tour to the old city and a food market (5 hours) and then a Water cannal tour with a boat ride - highly entertaining (4 hours). Coming back through Seoul I want out for another tour - a 4 hour tour to the older palace in town and to the shopping gallery area. AND IT IS FREE!!!"
Great opportunity to see Seoul while on layover,"I had a 12 hour layover which normally would be a soul killing amount of time in an airport. But the airport has tours that vary in duration and you would be a fool to skip them. I took the 6 hour tour to one of the historic palaces in Seoul. The drive from the airport was in a large comfortable tour style bus (Not the little white van shown at the top of this page.) The drive to Seoul took 1.5 hours each way. The tour guide spoke for part of the drive telling us interesting things about South Korea and teaching us a bit of Korean. She was fun and interesting and not overbearing like some guides can be. The three remaining hours were spent visiting the palace, having lunch and some free time to explore or shop downtown.The time went so fast, was fun and interesting. I wish more countries made it as simple and easy to explore while waiting for a flight."
Long Layover Take In Tour (you will not be disappointed),"So I had a 12 hour layover from KL (Malaysia) on way home to Seattle. ICN is a great airport with tons of amenities and great food (Katsu pork dinner was awesome in food court and a great deal),but 12 hours is a long time. Upon arrival I asked about transit tour and as luck would have it I could get on an 8am tour, and then a 9AM city tour. The process is simple don't worry about bags, just go to the desk and register your bags will continue to your destination. How easy is that?most of the tours are FREE! (this i could not believe) the toiur guides were fun and english speaking, I nodded off on a quiet part but no matter. Lots to choose from 1-5 hoursI did the Yonggungsa temple, and it was short and sweet, nice cultural exchange.Then back to ICN and joined the 9 AM Seoul city tour 2 Bukchonn Hanok Village, and they added the Insadong market (due to local holidays), great market, nice gifts there tons of street food, I had fantastic Korean dumplings more than i can eat for like 8000 Won (which is nothing). come to the market with empty stomach its got a lot to offer.The transit tour is a great way to pass time, i wanted to go to DMZ but glad i did this instead, KJU will have to wait for me to visit another day.Cheers!"
"anything over 3 hours, they have a suitable tour.",If you have a layover for more than 3 hours they can have you a tour of Korean culture and of course shopping. Free of charge. Quite reasonable with guides who speak perfect english. have to show your incoming and outgoing flight ticket.
"Awesome Airport, Awesome City, Great Opportunity!!!","If you have a long layover at the airport in Seoul South Korea take advantage of the free tours they offer. What a genius idea for this city to offer free tours for people traveling through their city and have long layovers. Seoul South Korea has never been on my radar as a place to visit, but it certainly is now. Seoul South Korea is a very clean and organize City compared to Bangkok where I was visiting. There are tours of different lengths of time so be sure to take advantage of the tour if you have time to go on one. Our tour guide was very spunky and entertaining. I took a 5-Hour to her and we got to see a king's Palace and then went to a shopping district in Seoul South Korea. We also went and had lunch together which cost us $7 a piece. The airport is wonderful, however it is great to get out of the airport for a while. Definitely check into this option. It was well worth it. I enjoyed it immensely.The tour guide told us some interesting things about the king. The one that stuck with me the most was the duties of the Kings doctor. Whenever the king had to go ""number 2"" he would just lift up his dress thing and squat wherever he was at the time. There were some servants who had to scoop up the number 2 , they called it the plum flower , and present it to the Kings doctor. The king's doctor had to assess the plum flower. He had to smell it, he had to poke it to see if there was anything interesting , and finally he had to give it a little taste. I don't think I want to be the king's doctor ."
Freebie Seoul teaser tours!,The tours are free but on a first come first served basis. We pre-booked a 5 hour tour through our travel agent but had to settle for a 1 hour tour of Yonggungsa temple due to our flight delay. We went on a short tour in an airconditioned mini-bus with an English-speaking tour guide. Great way to kill time on a layover!
Good way to kill time,"Another great choice if you have a long layover in Incheon.There are many selections of tours depending on the houses you have in Incheon, however most of the tours to Seoul starts at 9 am.The info desk was easy to find, we came up the escalator and found the info desk, the lady took us to bags x-ray and to immigration, where we have to go out and find the reservation desk for the tour. The desk is located inside the building, between gate 8-9."
Great free tour - but make sure you have a boarding pass before leaving customs!,"We had a 12 hour layover and chose a 2 hour tour in Incheon. The van was comfortable, we got to see a few sights and the guide was friendly and knowledgeable. To go on the tour you have to clear customs. Our mistake was we did not get our connecting flights boarding pass before leaving. When we returned we had to wait about 3 hours for our airlines desk to open before we could get back into the airport. There is so much to do in the airport (cultural shows, free showers, places to sleep), just make sure you don't get stuck waiting to get back in. Will definitely try another tour the next time we travel through."
Quick Tour while waiting ,"Loved this free tour provided by Incheon Airport. We booked in advance so we had no problems and we booked the 10am tour as our flight was scheduled to arrive at 8:30am. Was a bit confusing finding the tour desk but asked a lot of airport staff, and it all worked out. Tour was supposed to be for 5hrs, including the 2hrs travel time to and from airport. So actual tour length was just 3hrs. Visited a palacr and had lunch and walked at Insadong Market. It was raining and weather was nice. "
Tours made our long layovers fun!,"Very pleased with the tours! For transit passengers only. So take advantage of it. When our group of 6 planned our trip to Vietnam, we purposely picked long layover at Incheon. Got to see Incheon comfortably. Even saved on train fare!We signed up for 2 different 5-hour tours for our going and returning trips. 1st trip was to tour city centre. During the one-hour bus ride, our guide gave us a very good overview of Incheon, landmarks along the ways, a bit of history etc. Very interesting and informative. But she didn't talk the entire hour so we could rest a bit also. She took us to a large market with many local street food choices, plus nearby shopping areas. So we had 2.5 hours of fun eating and shopping.On our return trip, we signed up for another 5-hour tour to see one of the palaces plus historic districts nearby. Another fun trip. Admission to the palace plus lunch at a local restaurant was USD 10. We're told if we wore a Korean traditional outfit (can be rented from shops nearby), free admission to the palace. We saw many people do that. The tour counter staff was very nice. On our returning trip, she realised we had time so she recommended us squeeze in another 1-hour tour to visit a famous temple near the airport. Thanks to her and we got a good view of the area since the temple sits on top of a hill.A few things we learned. Even with online reservation, check in at the tour counter as soon as you can. Show up a few minutes before scheduled tour departure time. They are super punctual (I guess to ensure everyone returns to the airport timely to catch their connecting flights) they will not wait if you're late. Coffee, milk tea and fruit juices not allowed on the buses. Water ok.ENJOY !!!!"
Very breezy,"Not much really to say, on time, comfortable, courteous and very breezy and easy when you've never been to the country before/had a transfer to and from the hotel."
Good waste of time,We took two one-hour tours and both were fun and insightful! One to a local Buddist Temple and another to a television studio. They have two-hour and three-hour tours as well that leave Incheon (Seoul) and the longer ones go all the way to Seoul if you have that much time. Free and culture that ate up a couple hours - that was great!
FREE!! ,"We had approx 6hr layover and was able to take the 2hr temple tour. It takes approx 25mins to get there but well worth seeing. The beat part of the various tours offered is that they are free! You can chose from 1hr upto 5hr tours, all with different departure times and places to visit. The booth was located by door 8 and signed well. Our guide spoke english very well and provided information about our stop and along the way pointed out various things. I would recommend taking one of the city tours if upu have a layover."
Incheon thinks of the tourists on a long run,"I hv used this free transit tours on 3 occasions when I hv long layovers.1)5 hr city n palace tour 2)5 hr night tour of Seoul city and 3) 3 hr tour to a Korean township,War memorial n temple.Instead of wilding ur time in the airport ,take a short tour to go sight- seeing,stretch ur legs n relax.Half of the time touring is taken up on the road bcos the airport is a distance from the places of interest....For free,I have no complaints n qualms.Buying a city tour at the airport can be costly n there is no guarantee that u wl not miss ur flight home.all u need is ur boarding pass out and the kind ppl at the counter wl arrange everything.Changi,the best airport in the world is doing the same.thanks to the Korean Tourist Authorities for this facility...book early for it is on a first- come-first serve basis."
Excellent Free Transit (Layover) Tour,"The most amazing and informative 5 hour transit tour of Seoul, Korea. Our layover group took the Transit Airport tour bus into the city of Seoul, which took about an hour. Hyun is an entertaining and passionate tour guide that kept all of us entertained.The first guided stop was Changdeokgung Palace, the 2nd palace built in 1405. The history is so rich and awe inspiring. The 2nd. and last stop, was at an authentic Korean restaurant where we were served traditional Korean cuisine. This was by far the best tour I have taken in a very long time. What a great way to fill my layover time with. Thank you Free Transit Tours and Hyun, our amazing tour guide, for a memorable experience that will last a lifetime."
"Great leg stretch during a 7 hour layover , well organised and easy to do.","We had a seven hour lay over and took an afternoon 3 hour visit to museum situated in a former gold mine. The tour organisers were fantastic, spoke excellent English and very efficient. We did an afternoon activity. The museum was interesting and had great light set ups, some gear from New Zealand inspired by the Hobbit and some Korean wine tasting. Might be tough for kids under 5 due to the steps. It was also FREE. About 1 hour at the museum and the rest in bus trip between airport and mine. The tour guides called it a ""cave"". Thought provoking memorial to the Korean Comfort Women."
Transit shower ,"This is a nice airport to transit if you have time the info counter will arrange a short tour of a temple free. The second floor has a rest area to lay down. A free shower is available, a towel . Is provided. Also toothpaste with brush."
Brief sightseeing,I took the 5-hour city tour during a 10-hour layover. Signing up was straight forward. Tour counter was easy to find. Good to stretch the legs between flights. Gyeongbak Palace was quite a sight and we were allowed free time to browse around on our own.
Amazing free transit tour,"The Korean gov't is certainly doing a very good job of offering free transit tours at the Incheon Airport. I took advantage of 3 tours for a total of 8 hours while on a 15-hour layover complete with an English-speaking tour guide in an air-conditioned tour bus, and a group photo posted in their fb page. There were many of us that availed of these free tours. The Incheon Airport is awesome, having almost an entire floor for transit passengers where they offer a lounge, comfortable lounge chairs, free shower rooms, free baggage storage, and cultural shows too! "
Excellent airport transit tour! ,I had 8 hrs. Layover flight at Incheon Airport heading to Seattle. Good thing a friend of mine mentioned about the transit tour so I really appreciate it! I definitely enjoyed my 8 hrs with some sight seeing visiting two different temples in Incheon. Very Beautiful! Wish I could go to Soul. May be next time! 
Horrible service,One of the worst airports I've been to. Poor customs support. Overall poor customer support. All I want to do is fly out and start my vacation and can't because if them.
Good wat to kill time,"Have an hour or 24 in Seoul? I'd suggest taking a free tour with this company. It's great to see an airport care for thier clients who find themselves with long transit times. I took two tours: the Yonggungsa Temple Tour that took an hour and the Seoul City Tour 4 that brought you to Myengdong shopping area and the Seoul Tower, this took five hours. Both were done well and was full of information. My suggestion to the company is to have a tour that could last the whole day ;)"
Good service,The staff are accomodating and knowlegeable in assisting the passengers. Keep it up and improve further
Just amanzing experience,This is something super cool - you have 1 to 5 hours free (!) tour to Seoul or Incheon organized by airport. This includes transfer and guide. Haven't seen this anywhere else.
Great Airport,"Love the design of this airport .. especially amazed with it ""re packing section"".. great for last minutes shoppers...!! "
Free tour of Seoul,"If you have many hours in Seoul, take advantage of the free tour. Very good way to see Korean culture and place for short time. Make you want to visit Korea again."
Beautiful airport,"Just arrive here and I am amazed with the condition inside it. However, too many visitors from other countries at the same time, so it takes long queu to pass the immigration. If you need the internet, you can buy the simcard, or rent a modem or a handphone just outside the airport. You can also hire a taxi or bus to take you to your destination from the airport. "
Missing Piece of Information!,"Trip Advisor lists the Free Airport Transport Tours as #1. I wouldn't know. We had 16 hrs in Incheon before boarding a Crystal Cruise. Standing in line at 7:15 am for a 8 am 5 hr City Tour. We were informed we don't qualify! It is for passengers who are ""In Transit"" ONLY between airline flights. Sorry to have not ""qualified"" but we took the Airport Express Train to Seoul for the Palace & Isadong Street. Wonderful day anyway!"
Great tour for free ,Great tour You can take a fast one hour tour or a five hour tour Or even take one or more of them They are free And the tour guides are great This is sure nice of the city to do this for tourists 
Good for a long stop over,It's a nice airport with to my experience reasonable distances between arrival gates and departure gates. But with a seven hours gap it doesn't matter. All the facilities for your stay are there for reasonable prices. I stayed at the KAL's Lounge Prestige Class. A big lounge with average seating and average food except the brew-yourself-tap! Also the showers are very good and refreshing between two long flights.
Huge International Airport but Unhelpful Staff,"We arrived at Incheon Airport for our family vacation for the holy week. The airport is very clean, very huge but the staffs are unfriendly. They barely understand English, and they barely want to help. My father in law needs assistance for pushing his wheelchair but nobody is willing to help. "
Great experience at Incheon Airport!,"We had an 8 hour layover at Incheon Airport. We decided to stay at the airport, instead of taking the tours, only because we were exhausted from our travels and didn't sleep well on our night flight from Bali, Indonesia. The tours would have been great so we'll do that next time we have a long layover here. The Incheon Airport is the best airport for getting some rest! There's sleep couches/lounges and comfy sleep recliner chairs almost everywhere. There's a free shower (a towel, toothbrush, toothpaste, shower gel and shampoo are provided), plenty of very clean restrooms, and a spa where you can get full or partial body massages, facials and foot massages. I chose the neck and back massage and the cost was $59 USD. The massage therapist did an excellent job and didn't skimp on the TLC. I felt truly pampered and afterwards was given a cup of tea and a ginseng cookie. The airport has a multitude of shops, mostly high end designer shops which I'm not really interested in but there were plenty of people shopping throughout the day. There's concerts provided several times a day. We listened to some really talented musicians. There's a few bars but mostly restaurants and coffee shops. There's a kid zone play area and a kids toy specialty store next to it. Most of the airport employees speak English pretty well and can give directions. For me, it was a relaxing day at the airport after our three week vacation of being on the go every day. I would definitely come back for a long layover here!"
Incredibly beautiful,"This is the most beautiful airport I have ever seen, Is like a mall with everything you need. They even have resting chair with tv's and a museum. Free charging station for your cell phone but what it gets better is that they have different charger cables for all type of phones. They have all types of restaurant coffee shop is top of the line airport."
Beautiful Airport! ,Long layovers are a must here! Plenty of activities to enjoy here! Clean bathrooms! Spa! Free shower facilites! Free city tours!! Lounge area with free Wifi all around! Korean museum is a must visit. Ask about the hidden skating rink in the basement level by transit!
Transit tour,"This transit service is excellent and very efficiently run. It is reliable, on time, comfortable. We took this service to in teresting spots in Incheon"
"Even if you have less than 4 hours, you can take the hour long tour",I was worried about how much time it would really take but it was truly an hour door to door. You can reserve space in advance or go to the information desk on lower level near door 8. Tour took us to a temple and provided some good walking and much needed fresh air. It took a little while to pass through immigration coming but going was extremely fast. Bus drops you at departure level to make it even easier. Worth the effort!
Pleasant area !,"This is a place that somewhat reminds you of Singapore. There's a lot of stores, good security and really clean.I would definitely go back again!"
Absolutely Best Absolutely Free Tour Of The Best Of South Korea (You Pay For Your Lunch But That's It),"The Incheon Airport Transit tours are one of the absolutely best deals on the planet. We've traveled the world for >40 years now and the services at Incheon airport, especially these tours. There are more than a dozen tours to fit all levels of transit times from a couple hours to a dozen. Like many people, we planned our stopover transit time specifically around these tours. We did the #1 city tour to Gyeongbokgung Palace and the Isadong area. We paid $10USD each for lunch, which was very good. A beer was another $5USD but was large enough for us to share....and it was ice cold too. We arrived at the palace after an hr on the road from the airport, had time for photos and a quick tour of the palace grounds, saw the famous and colorful changing of the guard ceremony (see our photos), then were driven to the Isadong area where we had lunch and an hour to shop for souvenirs and gifts. We were able to leave our carry on baggage in a secure place at the tour desk at the airport and our valuables with our seats on the bus. The driver stayed with the bus the entire time we were on our tour and having lunch. The bus has loaner down parkas in the overhead racks (you can help yourself). Here is what we wish we would have known in advance: (1) you can reserve your tour online in advance (2) if you didn't reserve in advance there is a wait list and there are nearly always no-shows so you have an excellent chance of being on the tour (3) there is a free transit tour desk at each of the terminals....don't wait for them to open at 6A, proceed through immigration and security and go to the real tour desk at the exit to departures. Also, as there isn't anywhere to review airports, Incheon has won numerous awards as the world's best airport.....there are free showers for transit passengers on the 4th floor after you go through immigration (although they have the smallest towel's we've ever seen.....size of a washcloth.....they do give you free toothpaste and a toothpaste though. There is a world's best cultural center with live musicians, free art projects to choose from, genuine art....ceramics, fabrics, brasswork for sale and even the changing of the guard who did a short formation in the hallway in front of the center (which is located at the main crossing of the shopping mall.....between gates 41-42. You can't go wrong with a free tour, even if you only do a couple hour one to a nearby temple. Absolutely fantastic opportunity that is worth making a deliberate stopover an enjoyable experience!"
Great way to enjoy a layover.,"I missed joining the 8 hour tour by a few minutes and ended up taking 2 layover tours. They were a fun and informative way to get out the airport and see a bit of the area.Michelle, our guide, was funny and informative."
Excellent option at Incheon,"Incheon has very efficient means of transportation, but nothing like having a transit tour available with people you can trust, so you don't have to worry about anything. Great stops and reliable service!"
Poor Poor Poor,Airport employees have difficulty understanding the English language. The information desk can't or won't answer questions because they don't understand. Asked the information desk where the day lockers were so we could store our bags for the day. The answer was go upstairs Heineken bar.They have a lot of high end shops but little in the way of shops toPurchase something to drink other than bars.The rest and relaxation lounges were great.
Great way to spend a layover!!!,"Had a long layover at Incheon Airport, and decided to try this Transit Tour. I loved how everything is simple and informative, starting from the guide on how to join and meet them at the booth. Transit tour is the best way to welcome tourists, as they offer it for free and you get to explore and see what Korea has to offer. They do offer a lot of tours, depending on how long you want to go, if I had just enough time I would have try the Seoul tour which is 5 hours tour. But still it worked out well, I enjoyed the tour and our tour guide is very friendly and welcoming. Will definitely recommend this tour! (It's veryyyy helpful when you're trying to kill time while waiting for your next flight!)"
great way to welcome tourists! ,"Everything was simple from beginning to end. I booked the tour I want online and then showed up to the counter when i got the airport (like others have said, i left plenty of time between my arrival time and the tour time because of immigration). Our guide had great English, coats were provided for everyone, we arrived back to the airport plenty early. I booked a long layover just to do this tour because, why not if you're passing through! "
Kudos to South Korea this is how to welcome tourists :),"First let me tell you, we travel from LA to Thailand and I planned our flights in a way I have to have a log layover in Seoul and try this experience (FREE) and amazing. I read so much about Incheon airport and this tours, that I decide to taste a little bit of beautiful South Korea in this amazing tour.I read abou this a long time ago, also I booked online several months in advance, is recommended but not require, I know some people just check in 1 hour before tour started and if is place available you r set, but I will recommend do it in advance, if , like me, you stop here just to do this tour and what a better way to kill some hours right?We arrive in Christmas holiday season, Dec 16, but even though airport was efficient, lines but everything runs smooth and quick, we booked the ""Seoul city tour"" (5 h) from 9am-2pm, and you have to be in the desk 1 hour before tour start.This was totally free, we stop for lunch (that is on you), other than that we loved it, our guide was very sweet and speak english, also it was winter season, very cold, we bring tick jacketts and ponchos (it rains ), but if you forget, they have some jacketts to borrow.main desk is in 1st floor, after passing through Inmigration (between exit 8 & 9).I recommend this tours 100%, we were VERY happy with Korean hospitality, everybody was very nice.If this post was helpfull, click buttom below."
I would've happily paid for this tour,"I went on this small tour today because I had such a long layover at the airport. The tour was led by Miss Park, who was knowledgeable, kind, funny and great at her job. This is such a neat thing to offer travelers. Thank you South Korea! Your hospitality is without measure."
Enjoyed the one hour tour,"Our family had a four hour layover so before we left for our vacation, we booked the free one hour tour online. People do need to go through immigration to reach the main transit tour desk. There are four immigration areas (A,B,C,D) next to each other so if one is very crowded move to another one. Allow plenty of time when you schedule your tour because it may take an hour to walk to immigration, go through and then head downstairs to the reception desk. You may place your carry ons behind the reception desk while on the tour. The tours do leave promptly so make sure you are there 10 minutes ahead of time.Our tour was at 7 a.m. and it was still dark when we drove to the temple. The guide was interesting and informative. We had arrived from Cambodia which had 90 degree weather so we were not prepared for the 30 degree weather in Seoul. We so appreciated the warm winter jackets that were provided on the bus! The temple was interesting.Allow at least an hour to go through immigration and security and to arrive at your gate. There are no priority lines, just one long line. This was at 8 a.m. so later in the day, the lines will only be longer.We were very glad we went on the tour to see a bit of Seoul."
1 hour tour,"We booked a 1 hour tour(11am tour). It took us almost an hour to go through the immigration and customs to before we could reach at the Transit Tour reception desk. Once we was there(10:59), the staffs told us the 11am tour has already left!!! They asked us to join the next tour which we had to wait for another 50 minutes for the next tour. I think the organizer should reconsider the whole thing, because it is really a waste of time on the immigration & custom. They should let the transit tour travelers use crew lane on high season. We couldn't enjoy the tour because it was only a 15minutes tour at the destination and it had only made us extremely tired."
Great way to spend a long layover,"I took the 5 hour tour from the airport to see Gyeongbok palace. It included lunch, and a stop near Pagoda park to do some shopping at Insadong street. The 5 hour tour costs $10, which includes lunch and the ticket to the palace. Lunch does have a vegetarian bibimbap option - so its a nice way to try some authentic Korean food. The tour desk is right outside immigration, and they help you figure out what tours would work with your flight schedule. You can do back to back tours. Once you've passed through immigration, you register with the desk in the arrivals area. registration is on a first come first serve basis. Our tour guide was very good, giving us a lot of background into Korean history, description of the different rooms of the palace etc."
Efficiently organized,Great way to do something interesting if you have a long stopover at Incheon.Do remember to make a reservation online.Our tour guide for the Seoul city tour was efficient and funny -- thanks Michele.
Very helpful and Quite Efficient,"This airport I will stop by ever year as it is the only stop lead to Chuncheon. I like this airport as it is always clean and not so crowded. The service is good too. Last year I was stuck due to handcarry back ginseng liquid but the stuff helped me to solve it. Another year, my student left her luggage and it was sent to her house safely. "
Great way to kill time and for first timers in Korea,"This transit tour is recommended for travellers with long lay over, especially for those who never set foot in Korea before. I took this in September 2016 when I had a 13 hours lay over. The counter is easy to find, even if you don't find it, you can ask at any info counter. They don't charge you for the tour itself, but you need to pay the entrance fee to certain places that's in the itinerary (like some old palaces). It took about 45 mins of tour bus ride from the airport to Seoul. Once there, the guide (who's lovely and speak English really well) took us to visit the Changdeokgung Palace, Insadong Street (can buy souvenirs here) and took us to enjoy a nice Korean traditional food, bibimbap and beef stew. I think we spent about 5-6 hours doing all that including the trip back to the airport. It was a good time spent."
An interesting excurson,"We took the day tour to Seol with a guide whih was satisfactory.As this visit was in a winter with lots of ice & snow it was impossible to visit the temples but we managed to get a good impression & would like to come in spring for a few days. The people seem nice ,courteous &helpful"
1HR. tour - Yonggungsa Temple,"Not much to check out at this temple, but it's FREE and worth the while just to get out of the airport for some fresh air. Also just going for the ride to stare out the window while heading to the temple was better than nothing. "
This is a winner for your long layover!,We made a reservation online and arrived at the desk about 20 minutes before the tour started. They signed us in and we were off right on time...we were escorted out to a very nice transport bus and advised to be sure to be back at the meeting points because they would leave you if you weren't back. We visited a temple and Insadong Street for lunch and some sight-seeing. The whole trip was very well planned and we enjoyed it very much. I highly recommend this trip - for $10 USD! - if you have the time. You can book multiple trips if you have the time. Getting back through security and to the gate was very efficient and quick.
A short visit outside seoul,If you have 3-5 hours to wait before your flight.It is better to do a free transit tour You will get to know some of there culture.That is why we are coming back to seoul to stay maybe a night so weCould know more about history and culture esp the food.
Airport express bus,Recommend the express bus due to comfort & expedience. Impressed with the Korean bus drivers. They understood their role as driver in the service relationship. I was grateful to have them.
When winter,"Going to South Korea on winter from a tropical country made me wonder how will be the transition especially in terms of clothing. Of course it is easy to say, layering is the secret. Yes, it's true but my question then was "" What will I wear in going to the airport when the climate in my place is perspiringly hot?"" What I deed is I traveled with my usual clothes for tropical weather and bring a jacket with me but with my boots on already. Then I made a separate pack/bag for one set of my winter clothing including socks, gloves, scarf and bonnet and winter jacket. I hand carried them so that I can easily pull them out when needed. When we arrived at the airport, the moment we alight the plane, we already felt the cold weather. Good thing inside the airport building was warm. Then inside the airport, we really need to change/add clothing before we go out of the door. My packed bag became handy here. I don't need to open my luggage and search from all the clothes inside. It was really very cold outside. We arrived at dawn. We never had the chance to check in to our hotel but went directly to a whole day tour. I was thankful that I readied my winter clothes separately. My companions struggled in cold weather because their clothes were inside their luggage bag. They were only half ready so to say."
Transition ,"I fall in love with Inchoen airport. It's the best airport for me. The airport has the best transfer Amenities. Free palace tours ( depends on your lay over hours in this airport) and many options. I always use free wifi ,shower room , eat and shopping in this airport. The staffs in the airport were very helpful and informative. "
Break up a long layover,I have a 14 hour layover so I decided to take the 5-Hour tour at a cost of $10 or 10000 won. Went to see the Gyeongbok Palace and had lunch on Insadong Street. The tour was a bit rushed and you had an authentic lunch what's lacking flavor. There are also some souvenir shops on the street but it is better if you use Korean money. So if you have a long layover take one of these tours.
A good reason to fly through Incheon,"There is so much to do in Incheon that I now plan for long layover in Seoul. The airlines are making their seats smaller and tighter. It is a good way to stretch out before next flight. I have been avoiding short layovers in Incheon Airport so that I have enough time to browse the shops at the airport. This time, due to missed flight connection, I have time to sign up for a couple transit tours. It is very well operated, with a strong mandate to ensure the participants due back in time to catch their next flight. Since I have previously visited the palaces as tourist, I signed up for the temple tour and the mining cave tour."
Terrific way to spend time waiting in the Inchon Airport,"We had a 12 hour layover at the Inchon Airport. Airport layovers can be a pain. The chairs are hard and crying babies can defeat a flight layover.Korea provides an alternative with the Free Airport Transit Tour. There was a $10 US cover charge on the 5 hour Seoul tour. The fee covered lunch and the entry fee for the palace tour. Luch was fun, the palace tour was interesting, plus it got us out of the airport. In the afternoon we took the 3 hour tour to Inchon. We toured a temple and the Inchon war memorial. Again, the best part was getting out and exploring Korea.The staff was professional, interesting, and entertaining.We did tip both the driver and guide. Otherwise it was a free, interesting way to pass time at the Inchon Airport."
Enough reason to have a looong layover In Seoul ,"I read about the free transit tour in some of the blogs I came across with while researching before going to LA (since we had Asiana airlines). Upon arrival at the airport and passing through immigration, proceed to the tour desk at the second floor, the one right by the money changer. Tour officer goes there every 30 minutes so make sure to be there on time. I booked the 5hr tour but we came late since we ate breakfast first so we were just able to join the 2hr tour. We went to the grand memorial landing and Heungryunsa temple. The temperature was 3°C so imagine our shock upon exiting the airport! Even if the tour was short it was worth your while. The guide was very nice and she spoke very good English. They are very mindful of your flight schedule so they make sure the bus leaves on time to be able to get back to the airport on time also. Next time I go to the US again I'm most likely doing this again and next time I'll make sure I can do the 5hr tour."
Great for long layovers,"I had about 16 hours of layover and before I flew in, I had learned about this program so I went and gave it a try ( in fact, this is one of the major points why I decided to accept the 16-hour layover. there are so many other flights you can choose from, you know). I met a lot of travelers and the tour guide will absolutely make sure you don't miss your flight so sit back and relax, you're about to see the beauty of Korea. I have nothing but appreciation for their staff for they will help you step by step from going through immigration to getting back to the airport in time for your flight. Also, you can choose as many tour packages as your layover allows and it's all free. You will need cash for a stop at the market though or when purchasing souvenirs."
Time to kill,"Due to the flight re-timed, we had an almost 12 hours layover at Incheon airport. To kill some time, we took two transit tours, both to the temple nearby the airport. The first tour which took two hours was very good, due to the excellent guide who explained well about the spots visited. However, the second, one hour tour was not as good. Nonetheless, we learned a few new things about both temples."
time to fly ,wow where to start I really had a bad experience here it started with the Korean tradition of someone cutting in line I said to the rear and she had a problem and called a korean official that was working for air Canada air line ticket line walk to her the he walked to me and said stop and walk away korean will always stick up for Koreans especially if an American is among the issue they will always state you are wrong and no one at the air port could care less if I were korean I'll be a different out come I had this problem my three months in Korea my point for you at this air port keep in mind you have no say or support in this air port unless your rich rich or korean
Rude staff!,"First let me say that this is the worst behavior I've ever experienced in any form of customer service.We had a 10 hour layover to get back to San Francisco after our honeymoon so we figured to kill a couple of hours we'd do a tour plus I've never seen S. Korea and wanted to see if it was worth a trip back. We were told at the info desk to go to the transit tour desk about 15 minutes prior to the tour, which we did.There was no one else on line and a lady named Julie walked by us at 9:02, sat on her chair and did not say a word. No eye contact, not even a look... nothing! My wife said pleasantly, excuse me are you able to help us book a tour?She didn't even look up from her phone and nodded and than asked if we had a reservation. I said why is there a wait? There appears to be no one else here. She asked me what my problem was? I said excuse me? She than turned away and said we were already late for the 9:00 tour and we could maybe get on the 10:00... By then I was livid and said I need to speak to your manager... She told me to go ahead she didn't do anything wrong and that she can't help me today with a reservation.My wife said maybe it's because she's Vietnamese that this lady showed such immediate disrespect and honestly I know nothing about that but there was some definite attitude before we could ever mutter a word.I will definitely never be back to S. Korea and will share this experience with everyone I know as well as FB, Twittter and every travel review site I can find.Oh BTW... Cambodia and Vietnam were wonderful places to visit"
Went to go home,The airport is quite and the facility are good and the process of the airport was smooth no complaints and no complications 
South Korea for FREE!,"I flew thru South Korea to the USA twice this year already and its always the best part of the long trip- to be in Incheon airport! Their transit tour is just something every traveller should consider in choosing which airport to fly thru! It's FREE and absolutely hassle free. You will definitely enjoy sight-seeing in South Korea, their temples and cities and that Seoul Tower. It's also a great way to meet fellow travelers from around the world. Their tour guides are always nice, speaks good English, very informative and time- conscious especially about your flight details making sure you get back on time yet not sacrificing a great experience in the tour. Too much to say BUT ONE THING is for sure, NEVER MISS THIS TRANSIT TOUR. It's absolutely amazing!"
Long layover - great taste of Seoul!,"We took the five hour tour of Changdeok Palace with lunch on Insadong St and free time to peruse. It's a great way to get in and out of the city easily with enough guidance that you don't have to use much of your brain if you're coming off a long flight. The tour is free except for the $10 for lunch. So, it's really hard to go wrong. Our guide was adequate for free. But would have not fared well if we had paid for her. Things to remember: you must clear immigration before your tour. This took us 40 minutes at around 7:25AM. Allow yourself ample time. There are several tour choices ranging from one hour to five hours. Depending on your layover, you might be able to stack tours. Arrival times are accurate. We got back 15 minutes ahead of time. The counter for the visit can be found between doors 8 and 9 on the arrivals level. A guide is available at times (every half hour) just outside the transit arrivals area (before immigrating)Overall, time well spent!"
Free Tour!!!! TAKE IT,"If you have 9 hours to spare till my next flight this tour will be your life-saver, that said I took the 2 hour tour and it is worth a shot, since it is free why not right. After custom's and check points from my first flight you will be taking a escelator heading to departure area; the first thing you've notice at the end of the escalator ride is the tour booth next to a currency exchanged stall. I went to the booth to check the times and sure enought they have tours ranging from 1 hour to 8 hours. They have 3 booth all around the airport for each terminal, their will be an attend every 30 minutes to check if there are people waiting to do the tour. She came (attendant) asked if I would like to join the tour and she ask me what kind of tour I want to see since I have 9 hours to spare, All of us (tourist) pick different tour times, one choose 8 hours, a couple choose 7 hours, I choose the 2 hours and the last one was a beatiful blonde lady whom she's by her self...I know what your thinking guys.( I am a marriaged men but my friends told me if your traveling by your self your a single men.... no comment on that part). Anyway so I told her I will be taking the 2 hour tour; since I got off from my previous flight with little food on my tummy, the attendant asked for your boarding pass information to your next flight, your passport information and some forms to fill, we were 5 tourist( quote hehehe) all in all then we proceed to the customs area, the line was very long and it took us almost 1 hour and 30 minutes and I told myself I am getting hungry and this will take forever but again I'm next a beatiful blonde, we've exchanged information about our previously flight and trips, we laugh and had an awesome conversation then suddenly it was my turn to head to custom, the custom officer I had were very serious looking guy, he asked me what was my purpose to my visit to Korea and I told him I am here to take a tour and to see your beatifull country and historical places to visit, after that he smiles and said Welcome to Korea.After custom clearing us, there was an attendant waiting for us and we're all sorted by our tour time and I say farewell to that beatiful blode lady.For me I went 2 temples and it was a short drive from airport to my destination but when you hit AM commute good thing I have alot of time because traffic add 30 minutes then going back it's 45 minutes. The temples were very well taken care off and the view was magnificent, you have to really read the historical details in over to understand what it went thru all this years. It's all awe and wow...To end this review I gave it 2 thumbs up. Give extra time for your commute to/from I end up almost 4 hours. It was a breeze from the airport to custome line to the departure."
Friendly airport,Wherever we go in South Korea we will have wifi access without any speed limitation. This airport it was fantastic. I bought a local wifi device to carry wherever I go. 
Try these great tours! Here's how!,"If you have at least three hours in transit at Incheon Airport, try one of the transit tours organized by the Airport and the Tourism Authority. Some are short of 1-3 hours, free of charge around Incheon City; Three Seoul City tours take about five hours with $10 for a good Korean lunch. A warning: the immigration line sometimes is a long wait before we can get out to the transit tour desk past Baggage Claims. Fill the yellow immigration card for entering Korea while on board. You only need to take out your carry on bag and leave on the tour bus or at the Tour counter locker. You won't have to clear customs as your other checked baggage won't show up until your final destination. Enjoy these tours as I have (already covered about 5 of the tours)."
Has great potential but failed to deliver for us,"I had reserved this tour online to make sure that we'd be able to do the 1 hour tour during our 6 hour layover and was super excited about it. The email said to arrive 30 minutes prior to the tour, we showed up 45 minutes prior to the tour and the lady at the desk told us that we would not have enough time to get through customs and join the tour. So we were unable to go on the tour. The lady was not very friendly/helpful (we found that to be the general attitude at this airport, sadly) so we did not get to enjoy this experience."
The Incheon Airport Transit Tour Program is Terrific!,"We had a 13-hour layover in Incheon, South Korea not by choice. At no charge or for $10, the Incheon Transit Tour offers visitors a cheap, pleasant, and tourist-y way to fill those hours and cultivate a beginning appreciation of South Korea. The tour guides were great - offered enough background information, has sense of humor, and stayed on schedule. They made sure we were comfortable and sufficiently entertained. The transit tour counter attendants were also helpful and efficient. They recommended we take one a tour of one of the palaces (5 hours including fee for palace entrance and lunch for $10) and a separate tour of a temple and a small war memorial (total two hours max). We stored our carry-on luggages in the van while we visited these sites.We had not known about this transit tour program until we arrived at Incheon, so it was a delightful surprise. The pace is fast and quick because there are time deadlines to adhere to, otherwise some people might miss their flight. South Korea's light traffic allows them to have a transit tour program. I cannot say the same of other cities I know. Ultimately, this tour is not for everyone because of its pace. Young children will fall asleep on the bus and may not like all the touring aspect of the program. But it remains a wonderful idea and a great way to encourage travelers to think of using Incheon airport when they take trips."
Amazing tour of the town,"Loved going on this tour; everything was planned really well on this tour. Moreover, the tour is FREE and gives a really good and informative view of South Korea.Arrived to the tour desk half an hour before the tour and we were given a briefing and made our way to the tour bus. The tour guide introduced herself and told everyone about the history of the different places in Seoul and announced we were going to two places: the Bukchon hanok village and gwangchang market. She brought us around the places as well as let us go around to explore ourselves. Headed back to the airport on time for the flight to Auckland."
Great Start To Know About Korea!,"A very good way to start learning about Korea, it's people, culture, food. The guides are very accommodating, and it was a very smooth ride. I'll do it again as they offer great variety of tour options."
Excellent way to kill time...,"I had a 7 hr lay over and decided to join the free Incheon Airport transit one hour tour. After registering at counter outside the arrival hall, I realized I was the only person on this tour. The agent did not cancel the 1 hour tour on me. We took a mini bus to to Yongungsa Temple, just the guide and I. The temple isn't the most exciting place to visit but I'm not complaining. It's Free and it gave me the opportunity to take a break and to get some fresh air.If you're on a transit, I'd highly recommend the tours offered by Incheon Airport!"
Best way to kill some time,"I had a 13- hour- layover at Incheon airport. Horror! I thought. But in the end I had a great time going on a 5- hour- city tour through Seoul. Saw a palace, had lunch and time to discover a bit of downtown Seoul. My recommendation: Have a long layover in Incheon!"
the best stopover ever,"I do really reccomend anyone waiting long hours for their flight to participate one of offered tours. There is one restriction, the offer is dedicated to transit tourists so Your stay in Korea cannot be lognger than 24 hours before the tour.All the tours are guided by English spoken Koreans, whose fluency is really good.The coaches are air conditioned, very comfortable and quite new. There is one disadvantage. It is not easy to find their desks. There is one on F1 floor, number 41-42. There you will see the schedule with the total time of every tour. The good thing is that You can participate more than one - it only depends on Your time.I took two, first one to buddhist temple and war memorial, second through history of old Korea. Both were fantastic. To sup up, this is the offer You simply cannot miss during You stopover in Incheon AirPort."
Way to while away those long transit hours in Incheon airport.,Great way to spend 12 hrs of transit time and its free. Did the 5hr Seoul City Tour. Guide was excellent and we had lots of time to browse at sites and also shop for souvenirs.
Travel by SOLO!!!,"I had use Inchon international airport by alone which too big. And worry about lost. But it was tidy and clean. Everything so nice and many restaurants, shops, toilet and smoking area etc!!! There are so easy to find bus to go to Miyeaong dong!!!B5!!! "
Great way to pass a long layover,"We ended up arriving in the winter after having spent 3 weeks somewhere tropical, so it was a great relief to know they had warm jackets for loan. (Adult sizes only, so we purchased a kid one at the airport).Getting in and out of customs was easy enough, but takes extra time so we weren't able to take the longer tour.Driver was knowledgable but he wasn't super friendly.We spent some time in the beautiful Wolmi Park and the open market to pickup a quick bite to eat. Be sure to change some money for food purchases, they take cash only."
Perfect for long layovers,"I had a 12-hour layover so I thought this is a good way to kill time. Once I got off the plane and before I reached Immigration and the Transfer Desks, I immediately saw the information counter for the tours so I inquired. The staff spoke good English and provided recommendations based on the length of my layover. I chose the tour of Gyeongbokgung Palace and Insadong District. Because it was Tuesday and the Gyeongbokgung was closed, the Changdeokgung Palace was given as the alternative.After clearing Immigration, I proceeded to the tour booking counter by the Arrival Hall and was able to secure a spot. Because the tours are popular and spots are limited, there is no guarantee one go on his or her preferred tour. The tour is indeed free but there is a mandatory $10 lunch fee, which I paid at the counter. The bus was full and left on time. The tour guide spoke good English and was competent, friendly, and knowledgeable. The tour pace was just right I did not feel rushed. The palace and Insadong are a good introduction to Korean culture. Lunch was good as well.If you had more time like me, I suggest separating from the group that was returning to the airport and doing some more sightseeing. I had an additional two hours so I walked along the long stretch of the famed urban park called Cheonggyecheon. That was a nice way to do people watching and admire the modern Seoul skyline. I also visited City Hall and the main gate of Gyeongbokgung, which I hope to see next time.I hopped on the metro (City Hall station) and then transferred at Seoul Station to grab the express train back to the airport. The trip takes an hour so make sure to allot ample time. Metro and express train tickets can be purchased using cash or credit card.Overall, I had a great time and would do it again next time I find myself in Seoul."
I had a long layover in Korea on purpose for this,"I wanted to make my vacation a 2-for-1 experience by booking my tickets so that I had a long layover in Korea in order to see a bit of this country as well. When I read about this free tour online, I was like heck yeah why not. I initially wanted to take the 8am temple tour to Gwanghwamun but I didn't get out of that longass immigration line full of Uzbekis until 7:45 (my flight arrived at six) so that tour was fully booked when I got to their desk. They instead offered me the tour to Changdeokgung palace which leaves at 10am. The experience was great. Oh and plus, it was a Korean holiday (May 14) so there were a lot of locals walking around in traditional wear. It takes about an hour to get there and an hour back. The tour guide spoke good English (for a local Korean) and actually relayed some interesting facts to us on the way and during the tour. I could tell he was starting to get irritated by the people who were starting to lag behind--he actually yelled at them. But I guess it's also their responsibility that tourists don't get lost on their tours. After the temple, we were taken to Insadong--a downtown shopping district--for lunch, which consisted of either Bibimbap or Bulgogi. After that, you're given almost an hour to go shopping for souvenirs. They suggested to me at the desk that I go on another 3hr tour right after the 5hr one but I was too exhausted from my flight for that so instead I said no. On the flight back, I finally arrived early enough to go on the 8am tour and wow it's exactly the same. The only difference between the main palace and the second one is that the first one has a building within a pond. Other than that, it's 95% identical. I didn't have to wait at the immigration though, the foreign passport line was practically non-existent (this was on a wednesday at 4:30am). The tour guide--a girl this time--seriously needs some English pronunciation lessons. I had a hard time understanding her, more than usual. I did enjoy trying the bulgogi instead of the bibimbap and shopping around at Insadong again. I followed up this tour with the 1-hour tour to this little Buddhist temple in the woods. Not very interesting to see. I also asked the desk which tour would be better, the two-hour tour or this one and they weren't particularly suggestive. One piece of advice though, they offer all tours as free, but for the temple tours they ask you to pay a fee for food and entrance to the temple in the form of 10USD or 10,000 korean won. I advice paying in won because it is actually less in value than dollars (when I visited, 10000 korean won was about equal to $8.4 USD). After the tour, I had this most amazing dish called omurice at Omuto Tomato (4F, before immigration) and then quickly went back to the departure hall to take a refreshing shower. I also recommend that you rent a cheap wi-fi egg for the day (I rented at Wide mobile for 4600 korean won--about $4--plus a security deposit of 100,000 won--about $84) to stay connected during the tour in the city. They do have free wi-fi all around, but not on the bus (where you will be on for two hours) or the temple. The airport's wi-fi was fast, if you can stay connected."
2 Hour Tour of Incheon,"They made it so easy that I would recommend it to anyone that has a few hours to pass and not want to wander the airport. Check in near the 8th door exit. The English spoken was excellent, we were a small group so we could stay a little longer at one site and less at another. I look forward to the 5 hour Seoul tour on the next trip. "
Fantastic way to spend a layover and get an introduction to Seoul,"We had a 12-hour layover in Seoul, so I'd reserved ahead for the 5-hour Seoul culture tour. When got to the transit tour info desk indicated on my confirmation email, we were invited to join the 1-hour Incheon temple tour as well. Total cost to us for both tours was just USD 10 each, which covered entry to palace and lunch. We got to visit Yonggungsa Temple at dawn, then for the culture tour saw the beautiful Changdeokgung, had a delicious lunch, and got to explore Insadong shops. We had the same guide for both tours, and she was both knowledgeable and personable. I realize the intent of the tours is to promote tourism in Seoul and encourage travellers passing through Incheon Airport to consider making that their next holiday destination... and it totally worked--Seoul hadn't really been on our radar as a destination before, but now we're planning to come back so we can explore it properly!"
Great free tours,"I had a 10 hour layover in Seoul so took advantage of a 5 hour Seoul city tour and a 1 hour Incheon temple tour. Both tours were free, though the 5 hour tour had an add-on of $10 to pay for entry to the palace and for a traditional Korean lunch. It takes one hour to get into Seoul from the airport so there was time to nap both going in and out. Both tours give you a sampling of what Korea has to offer. The 5 hour tour was the city, the 1 hour tour took you to a quiet forested area to see a Buddhist temple. It was a great way to get through the 10 hours of transit time."
Free tour Seoul esp Grt if have long layover,"Had 14 hour layover, on floor three by information, near the food court. Immigration took about 45 min to get thru, but with many tours they can help you have options. Went on tour 3 to changdeokgung palace. My flight left at 4:30p. Getting back from 3p tour a little earlier 2:45pm, it only took 15 min to get thru security. They give you an hour, so you should have plenty of time. 1 hrs drive into Seoul. trip. Plan ahead highly recommend. $10 for food and entry fee to Temple. Worth it. Kim is a great tour guide, informative and witty and kept us on time without feeling rushed."
Great Trip,This is a great trip for going to the hotel. I was travel weary so took this option. The Incheon Airport itself is brilliant. Apparently it has been voted the worlds best airport for 11 years in a row now.
Good idea when you have a few hours to kill,"Nice tour with a friendly guide. I was only able to do the one hour tour (there are tours of 1 to 5 hours long if I remember well). Free of charge, it's really enjoyable when you have a long transit."
Best layover ever!,"Having an 11 hour layover, I was thrilled to find out about this! Getting there/booked was a little tricky, and it really does fill up fast (but the guide said this season is especially busy due to holidays), but the tour itself was absolutely worth the $9 ($2 for palace and $7 for a delicious lunch). I was hoping to do City Tour 2 to see the market, but it was full so I did #3 to Changdeok Palace and Samcheong-dong. We got back with plenty of time to spare, luggage was safely stowed on the comfortable bus, the guide spoke wonderful English and was very conscientious when herding all 35 of us, and the sites have me placing South Korea at the top of my travel list. As you can see in the attached photos, there are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 hour tours, so take advantage if you can. Getting back through security/customs took about 25 minutes. For the price of Free, this definitely earns 5 stars. "
Free transit tour of a minimum period of one hour,I went to the temple close to the airport on the one-hour tour by bus.The money is unnecessary.The guide speaks various explanation with kindness.
Wonderful Tour!,"I highly recommend doing this if you have a long connection at Incheon. They are handled by very personable guides on first class buses. It's an hour from the airport into Seoul each way, if you are taking the 5-hour tour that includes Gyeongbokgung Palace and Insadong Street. They do charge $10 for the palace entry and lunch (a super bargain), but the balance is free. If you were in Europe for example, a day tour of this quality would cost up to $100 USD. You can also take your luggage with you. The driver will stow it in the luggage bay."
Free Amazing thing to kill some time! A taste of Korea!,"It has always been a dream of mine to take a trip to seoul, and timing was just right. I forgot how it happen but for some reason i went to this page and saw about the Incheon airport transit tour and it sounded so interesting to me while reading all the reviews. So on my way back to Seattle from my great summer vacation in the Philippines i have a 12 hours layover in seoul so i figure why not avail this free offer. So as soon as i get to Incheon airport i went to the information desk and signed up for this. I was very tired but i am glad i took the chance. I took 5 hour tour in seoul, went with a group of people that avails the same thing. We went to Bukchon hanok village and gwangjang market. and i get to see some areas of seoul as well, the tour guide was nice. it was pretty cloudy but it didnt bother the time that i spent around seoul. The bus will take you back and fort to the airport so no need to worry about transportation.If you have hand carry luggage with you, you can leave it in the bus so you will enjoy your tour. Then i still have a lot of time left so i use their free shower at the airport, and look around, they have cool things inside the airport as well. It was a neat experience, and its free!! If you happen to have long hours layover, you better not miss this opportunity if you want to experience a lil bit Korea.. now i know how to kill some time whenever i'm in Incheon airport! great airport, great facilities. 5 stars for this one!"
Great way to spend time while waiting for the next flight,"Im so happy Incheon airport had this transit tour. And they have several selections of area to see and the number of hours you can spare for the tour from 1 hour tour, 3hours tour and 5hours tour etc. and its for FREE! "
Great use of time!,"The tours are easy to book (though first-come first-served, so get there as early/quick as you can) and all transport is included. I landed at 5 am and had to wait for the first desk to open so they could tell me how to get to the second (or actual) transit tour desk. However, they provide you with a document you need to complete and sign for immigration to let you in so it's a necessary step. Everyone is very helpful and most speak enough English to communicate.The tours are separate (1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, etc), so you will always come back to the airport in between if you take one or more tours. This means there can be a lot of travel time included, but the tours are worth it especially when you weigh them against sitting around in the airport for 9 or 10 hours. The tour buses are clean and neat with large windows, the drivers are cautious and you get where you are going and back in one piece.The first tour I took was to the >1000 year old Yongungsa temple. Some of the trees on the hillside were bare as winter is just ending but the fresh smell was wonderful; it reminded me of camping in the US. The tour guide had some interesting information about the site: 1300 year old trees and a tablet of the last Korean king.The second tour was to the Heungryunsa Temple and Incheon Grand Bridge Memorial Hall. This tour guide was funny and also full of historical info. We crossed the 21 km bridge from island to island over the sea to get there and that was amazing; what a feat of engineering. The Incheon area outside the airport is somewhat rural and then you get across the bridge and tall buildings suddenly appear in a cluster. The temple was interesting with many buildings, lots of stairs and Buddhas as well as a large old bell and quite a view from the top.The memorial hall had some photos and weapons from the Korean War as well as tanks, jets and missiles, as well as an eternal flame memorial with a wall of remembrance. Some stairs here too but worth the view when you get to the top.All in all, totally worth the time and a good way to see some of South Korea. Next time, I will try to book a layover that allows me to take a longer tour and see the markets and eat some local food."
Free tour of Seoul on layover!,"Awesome way to spend time exploring the city if you have a long layover. We chose the 5 hour tour and it was $10 but included transport, entrance to the Gyeongbokgung palace, and even a lunch! Our guide Michelle was very knowledgeable and fun to listen to on the way. Highly recommend!"
FREE TRANSPORTATION !,"I had a two noght, one full day layover and was able to take Seoul City Tour 1 and 4. Tour 1 was fantastic. $10 included admission to historical site and a really nice lunch. There was some time for shopping after lunch, but not enough time for the great variety of shopping in this area. The Tour 4 is billed as a shopping tour but was a complete waste of time. All but two people returned to the bus very early because the clothes shopping was identical to products in the US, but at much higher pricing. Korea, apparently, has heavy taxes on items."
Free tour of Korea!,This is a great way to showcase Korea! We had a 13hr layover in Seoul and joined the 5hr tour. Other tours were free but the 5hr one. We paid 10USD each for the lunch. We had fun and would like to join the shorter tours next time. Definitely a good way to kill layover time while learning something about Korea.
great stopover,This is the best way to escape long hours of waiting in the airport and a perfect opportunity to see a bit of Korea. It's really for free and very uncomplicated. On one of my two tours I visited Shingli Market and was even given a few tokens by the guide to 'buy' food. That was really an experience.
korea at a glance for free,"places visited and time allowed for the trip was just enough to give you a glimpse of different places in Seoul, Incheon, Insandong, the staff were very accommodating and informative, they will even extend your trip for another tour if you have the time, one thing unique in them is that, i travelled winter time and its freezing outside, they offered me a complimentary coat ofr use during the tour... they have lots of umbrella available in case of rainfall. I was able to do some shopping at a cheaper price, this project of Incheon Airport is highly commendable.."
Wonderful,We had a 10 hour layover in Seoul. They looked at our boarding tickets and said we had time for two tours (both were great). This is truly a wonderful service that all airports in the world should offer.The coaches were very nice and the staff was very friendly. Knowing that this service is focused on in transit passengers and ensuring that we would be back in plenty of time made this a worry free service.Great job Incheon Airport!
Free Tour,"I had over 5 hours of layover at the Incheon International Airport. I already did my research prior to the back home to the Philippines. And to be sure that I get in to the tour, I applied for a transit visa at the Korean Embassy - free for all Philippines passport holders. ICN airport is quite a large airport and finding the tour kiosk is bit challenging. After asking a couple of airport staff around, finally got my way to the kiosk. The staff was very accommodating, even followed me as i pass through the immigration and to the main transit tour desk since i only had few minutes left prior to the 1PM tour. Our tour guide, Sang, is good. She even entertained with few of her jokes. She speaks English well. It was really a great and refreshing tour. The tour provider even gave us seaweed (with Almonds) chips for our snack."
"Free, quick tour","We went on the 5 hour city tour. Someone posted to store your luggage on the 3rd floor where there were free lockers. This is no longer available. We were allowed to take our luggage and store it on the bus. It is a quick tour to 3 places but it was free and still nice to see a small part of Seoul. They had down jackets on the bus and at 26 degrees, very helpful - wish we knew that before we packed extra clothes. Go direct to the transit tour counter on the 1st floor and sign up there. "
Great tour of Seoul!,"When you have a long layover at Incheon, go on a tour. The guides are great and they will make sure you get back in time. Seoul is a fascinating city, and it will whet your appetite to return."
Visiting the temples,"While in transit in Korea- we joined the ttransit tour offered by Incheon International Airport. If you are interested to do the transit tour- make sure you inquire at the Information desk located on the 3rd floor and they will direct you to the nearest desk where the staff of the Transit tour will be meeting you. Take note - the tour staff are there only every 30 minutes- its either you wait here or check the time that they will be present.the tour desk on the 3rd floor is not manned all the time. So after you meeting the staff they will accompany you out of the secured area and then you have to go through Immigration- they can be crowded after 7 AM, so the earlier you do this the earlier you can join the tour. The guide will tell you which desk ( I think it is in 41 /42) you are suppose to inquire. We did 2 hours and then 1 hour tour. It Is good. we missed the 5 hour tour because they are only offered at certain time. Overall - its good! Our tour guide- Hyun- is very accommodating, professional and friendly! well recommended and its Free!"
Nothing like it elsewhere!,"You will see a kiosk advertising the tour prior to Customs. I done the North Village and market tour after a early A.M. layover for about 8 hours, which was very prompt to get me back in time to for a free shower and chair massage.During the initial contact at the kiosk I was told there was no lunch or food break, however I was taken to a market whereby you can return to the bus in about 1.5 hours and clearly told when to be back. This a great tour and food experience!"
Great way to fill in time and see a bit of Seoul,"For our trip back from the US, we looked up places that may be suitable for up to a 24 hour layover (our fare rules only allowed a 'layover' not a 'stopover'). Incheon seemed to fit the bit nicely with their free airport tours and great reviews of the airport itself, and we hadn't been to South Korea before. We booked our tours online in advance.We flew in late at night, and slept at one of the close by airport hotels, then headed back out to the airport first thing in the morning to do the 5 hour Seoul city tour. We were taken into the city on a nice bus, and shown a palace, small city temple, and then had a lunch and shopping break. We had to pay for our lunch of course, but it was only a small charge. It was all fantastic, and our guide was awesome.Back at the airport, we checked in for our next tour, the 3 hour Incheon city tour. They had to change the itinerary for this one, and we ended up going to an information centre/viewing deck over the canal, then went sailing at the other end of the canal. It was a bit of a random thing to do in South Korea, but it was a beautiful day, and it was most enjoyable getting out on the water! Our guide for this tour was not as good, but you really can't complain when it's a free tour.It was totally worth spending the day in South Korea to do these tours. It gave us enough of a taste that we know it's worth going back to see more!"
Awesome service. Almost free - and great layover experience.,"The free transit tour offered by the Incheon airport and S Korea government is awesome ! We had time to do the longer 8am - 1pm city tour. Visited 3 beautiful landmarks, had a great local lunch. Perfect way to spend our layover. The bus and driver was top quality and the guide was even better. It was of course a quick visit of a few Seoul highlights but would highly recommend. The airport itself is also one of the best I have ever been to. Free showers and a decently priced buffet + alcohol in the rest area zone."
Do it only if you can't avoid a long layover,"Do the tour (it's FREE) only if you can't avoid a long layover. Otherwise, don't purposely pick an itinerary with a long layover for the purpose of ""seeing a bit of Korea."" It's not worth it."
One of the best international airport experiences - EVA!,"These tours are a brilliant initiative for travellets stuck in Incheon on an extended layover. There are many tours to choose from in varying durations that go to Seoul and Incheon. You can book ahead online, or go to the Free Transit Tour Desk on the ground floor of the airport. The longer tours allow a bit of self explore time in some locations. This is a great way to sample a bit of South Korea while you wait. TIP - grab yourself some WON and have it ready in case you want to try some of the interesting food options that are sold at the markets. All you need is your boarding pass to be elligible for the tour."
"Didn't,t appear",It was snoring gently when arrived at 10.45pm.We wanted in vain for shuttle by did not arrive.so took taxi.not unreasonable charges
I purposely created a 12 hour layover so I could see a bit of Seoul,"This is a FANTASTIC service that’s offered. My wife and I was planning on DIY, but we figured we would be exhausted and we came across Incheon Airport Transit Tour and decided to take it easy, IATT gave us that option. We opted for a 5 hour tour in the early AM.. A temple was closed that day as police were planning a raid to arrest protesters held up in the temple, so we spent more time at the other locations. Our guide was informative, when I had a question the guide didn’t know the answer, she looked it up on her phone. After we arrived back at the Airport, we were given a bag of seaweed as a gift. This is a free tour, so how can you possibly complain?"
What a deal,"I fly through Incheon every time I visit Thailand, maybe 13 times now with a normal 10-13 hour layover, due to my out bound flight city. I never saw these until my last trip. Had 13 hours and went on 3 of their free tours. You have to do it, they have 1-3 hour tours, you get both out and back in threw immigration fast. If you have the time, take one."
Excellent way to kill time during a long layover here,"I read about these transit tours the airport provides and was excited to know that I could explore a little bit of Korea while on my layover. After you land in Incheon airport, you have to ask around to find the Kiosk to where you can sign up for tours. Don't immediately go to the security line where you will go to your next gate. After finding the Kiosk, you sign up with that's convenient with your schedule, making sure you don't miss your flight. Since my layover was 5-6 hours long, I was able to catch the 3.5 hour Incheon City Tour. You have to go downstairs and go to a part of the terminal where they check in guests. Our tour guide was really nice. She guided us to the exit onto our tour bus. It was freezing cold. Having coming from Thailand and Singapore with my final destination in Southern California, you wouldn't think of spending some time in a cold climate area to tour for a few hours. I came unprepared. I wore loose long sleeves and flip flops. Fortunately, they had large jackets provided for free inside the bus. I put on one of those bad boys really quick. We we were then on our way to the city of Incheon.Our first stop was at a Korean Culture Center where everyone in the group got to try on Royal Korean wardrobe and took photos. I love trying on different culture's outfits, so this was a plus for me.After that we headed back to the bus and they brought us to a market in the city. I asked the tour guide if she could accompany me to buy socks for my freezing feet. No one spoke English, so I was glad she had the time to help me.After I bought some socks, I joined her in getting some Korean noodles at this mom and pop noodle house. The owner/chef was so nice and accommodating. I felt like a fish out of water, but being there made me ease up. The noodles called kalguksu were so delicious and warm and hit the spot during a cold day. We headed back to the bus and back to the airport.The tour guide gave each of us these seaweed snacks with almonds in them. It was interesting snack but pretty neat.Highly recommend if you have a long layover in Incheon. Depending on the time of year, dress appropriately!"

Transit tour for Indians,"It was a 1 hour tour of the Incheon Temple. People are very warm and welcoming. I was taken care very well through out my trip.I had booked online for a 2 hour tour and got a confirmation by email and my friend from another country also booked the same tour but he did not get a confirmation email. The website does NOT mention India as one of the countries which is not allowed for the free transit tour. As soon as I arrived at Incheon airport I went to the Transit tour desk and showed my reservation and Indian Passport, I was told that Indian passport holders are not allowed this tour, I told them it was not mentioned in their website to which they did not have any answer.My friend was immediately accommodated because of the passport he holds. I left for the transfer desk, got my onward boarding pass and approached another transit tour desk. To my surprise I was welcomed and told that since time is short I cannot do the 2 hours tour, so they suggested 1 hour tour.The whole process of taking me to immigration took about an hour (probably because it was lunch time). I went through the immigration where again I was denied entry and after some discussions with the transit tour desk they let me in. Phew! It was indeed an adventure. I would definitely visit again because the people are nice and place is beautiful."
This is an excellent service!,"When arriving in Korea in transit to another destination, fill out the two cards - immigration and arrival, when they hand them out on your flight. You can join the tour either by going straight through immigration when you arrive, or entering the transit are and then joining the tour. Either way, you are entering Korea like any other traveller. There are several tour options and they are very professionally run. If you can't find the place to meet, just ask at any of the transit or information desks. You have to show up an hour before the tour you want to take, and if you are already in the transit area, they will walk you through to immigration. It's very well set up. Yes, the tours are rushed, but you do get a little taste of Korea, with a friendly and competent guide in a safe and clean tour bus."
South Korea is Beautifull,"Really enjoyed this place,if your at the airport for a long layover try the Airport SPA I took a full body massage and oh man was it good I enjoyed the entire 80 min."
Great !!,"It's so good for the transit passengers those have to spend 4-8 hours in the airport.Also this tour can promotes Korean tourism very sure. Personally, I love it and wish to encourage to all transit passengers rather spend a time in airport. Please take it free."
"Free, Informational and Enjoying!","We took a 3.5 hour Incheon City Tour and glad we did. It to a little bit to go to the Asiana transfer fee esk, get a ""found outside stamp"" go through security and to 5he bus, but worth it. Went through the city, 5o a cultural center and tried on traditional clothes and learned about traditions, left and went to a war mwmorial, and them ended up at a local market. So different than many, this one we could eat the fresh food being prepared there, lots to look at and a lot of real good deals on clothes and the like. Not only did we get another stamp in the passport, but we got to see the outside world. Coming from Cambodia, we expected hot and humid. The temp actually about 45 and not humid at all. Great fun, especially for the price of free!"
