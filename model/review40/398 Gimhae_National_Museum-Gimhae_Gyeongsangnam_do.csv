Great for history lovers,"The Gimhae National Museum boasts a sizeable collection of artifacts that is well maintained. I visited this museum after making a “pilgrimage” to the museums of Baekje and Silla history (in Buyeo and Gyeongju respectively), and while the Gaya confederacies (which this museum is about) are not as well known as the aforementioned kingdoms, the contents of the museum are still pretty interesting. I would recommend a visit if you are visiting Busan. It’s not too far from the airport/Busan, easily accessible via the metro and light rail and just a 5-10 minute walk from the station. "
it was a visit to see Korean culture,I went there with few friends. Its a quiet amazing place with Korean historical items. There is a small cafe shop inside and a meseaum items. I bought a wrist watch from there written Hangul inside that. I prefere to all those who wanna visit and see Korean culture. 
Gimhae National Museum,If you are into antique and Korean history & culture you will love this. When visiting Gimhae spend a night at Hanok building and come see the exhibition at the museum. 
Kimhae National Musem,"You can understand the histories related to Kimhae from the past up to now if you look around in the museum. In particular, this museum is very famous for all kinds of relics related to the old kingdom of Keumguan Kaya. Allot one day to scrutinize the relics."
