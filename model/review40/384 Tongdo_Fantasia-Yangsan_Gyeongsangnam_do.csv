Aqua Fantasia ,"Alright they got 2 parks going on in this jam. 1 is the Amusement Park with the rides and roller coasters and all that and the other the water park. I hit up that water park. After 3pm the price a bit cheaper so peep that. Here is the number one tip I gots for yall...you has got to bring your hat. Apparently this common sense that you must be rocking a hat at the water park in Korea. If you don’t have a hat you can’t do anything at this place. Some people rock the swim cap but most just got a baseball cap on they lid. So if you thinking about hitting this place up, bring yo hat. Also, everyone needs a life jacket for the wave pool and lazy river, so you probably be renting on unless you rock a life jacket regularly. But you can’t wear the life jacket in the baby pool. I took the life jacket off to go in there and then some lady stealed it. This place pretty good for the kids but you ain’t catch me going on them big slides. It is also kind of far from anything but if you in the area check it out it worth a chill if you kickin it in Yangsan. "
A Forgotten Amusement Park,"The hardest attraction to reach if you want to go here from Busan.The park is located near the Yangsan station, which is at the other end of Jangsan station in Busan.Then, you still need to ride a bus, and walk a little bit uphill to reach it.The rides are designed for children and teens, and the visitors are usually families or a group of friends, but the place is deserted.It's clean and well-kept, but it receives very few visitors.On a positive side, you can take a photo where you're the only one around."
