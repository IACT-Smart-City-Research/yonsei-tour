Poor service ,"They just put on an act of trying to help you. They are rude and just stare at you. Hostile and unhelpful. They are arrogant, dismissive and apathetic. It's a waste of time to try to talk to them."
Informative,"Information counter located right at the center of the station and staff give good information. There are few trains, KTX, ITX and others. There are also many places to explore in Busan. Depending on time, many areas can be explored within the day. Notedly is the Gamcheon cultural village, Songdo skywalk, BIFF square and Jagalchi market. "
Korean Holiday,"We arrived in Busan Train Station, which was opened on April 1, 1908, and expanded to include Korea Train Express (KTX) services in 2004, for our one day in Busan. With the opening of the second Gyeongbu express railway, the station's second-floor waiting room and parking lot were expanded. The station is a major station for the Gyeongbu line express trains (KTX) and a hub for general trains. It also appears to be well taken care of."
Helpful staff,We stopped here first after arriving by KTX train from Seoul. We collected some brochures and made some enquiries regarding the metro trains. Staff were very helpful.
Very helpful,"The Busan train (KTX, etc.) station is separated from the Busan metro station by the Busan station plaza. Both are near each other. It takes some time to get familiar with the large Busan train station. I spent at least half an hour to go around it on the day prior to taking the KTX train to Seoul. There are two information centres, one for Korail and one really small one behind it for general tourist information. It is very easy to get confused. I went to the tourist information centre (counter) to ask about luggage lockers. Although the representative spoke pretty good English, I had to go back and forth 3 times to sort out the problem as the station was big and the luggage lockers were scattered around the lst and 2nd floor. There was also a need to learn how to operate the self-serve luggage lockers (not all that easy). I am grateful for the assistance in English, as finding a person who can speak English in S. Korea is difficult. I also have to use the Google Translate app on my mobile phone to communicate with the information centre."
Info,Staff speaks some english. Very easy to use this transportation system. Main station in all Busan...
Friendly and helpful!,The title of this post says it all. It is true that sometimes you will met some that are not so nice. But we are humans after all. And I'm really thankful for the customer service team at the subway stations and tourist information counters. They are always patient even if they have to use limited English to help you.
New location ,Tourism information centre is now part of the general information Centre on the 2nd floor of the KTX station. Not very big had friendly attendants who was able to explain in English where to visit and provide maps and hotspots to tour.
Very helpful team who look have reasonable English ,Found this information booth very helpful and very easily. Staff are very approachable and are keen to help you understand how you can embrace Busan for your time there. 
It's a little bigger and feels like information center of an airport,"If you came to Busan and have no Idea what to do this place got you covered. P.S. don't forget to pick up the FREE postcards (I forgot and my friends picked it up, still crying on that one)."
Simple English Is OK,"After leaving our KTX train from Seoul, we paid a visit the center for more info about the direction to get a taxi to our hotel. Staff there is helpful and can communicate with us in simple English. Taxi can be found on both sides of ground level including the Jumbo Bus for city tour."
