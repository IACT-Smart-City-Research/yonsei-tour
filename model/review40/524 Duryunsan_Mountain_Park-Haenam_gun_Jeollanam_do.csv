great views across the sea,"The top of the mountain is easily accessible via a cable car and a short walk, so it is popular, in particular during the autumn when the leaves change colours. The views from the top on a clear day are supposed to be nice (I was not so lucky). Hiking seems to be good day trips."
Beautiful scenery,"It has really beautiful scenery. Harmony of mountain, sea and land Makes you happy. Enjoy all of them."
