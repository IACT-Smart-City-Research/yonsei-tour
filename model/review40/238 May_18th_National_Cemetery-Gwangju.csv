Moving tribute,Take the 5.18 bus here. It is a very moving experience. It is very English friendly as there are tour guides all around. The 5.18 cemetery includes a 40 minute video presentation. It should take you about 2 hours there to see everything.
Moving and touching place,"A moving place to visit, a place for reflection. Very good visual presentation on video explaining very well and enlarged the impressions and the feelings I got from my visit "
Historical cemetery in Korea democracy.,"C ( 19.08.02 ) This cemetery was historical place about May 18th Korean democracy. This area was quiet and solemn, and many victims buried. The May 18th democracy movement was big meanings in Korea history, and many people fought and was dead. Because of this movement, democracy of Korea could be more free. There was good place to pay our respects to soul of victims."
 Very impressive.,"We came here to pay respect to a friend who is buried here in 2016 in the row with heroes from May 18th. They were all fighters for freedom and democracy in their country, for which we all should have the deepest respect."
"Accidental visit, glad it happened","I meant to visit the May 18th Mueseum park in the middle of downtown Gwangju and told the cab driver (in worse than broken Korean) that I wanted to go to the memorial. I noticed that we were driving out of city towards the hills surrounding Gwangju and knew that my Korean skills had got me in another accidental journey. Once we arrived, I was amazed at the sculptured murals, statues and memorial. The gravesites were all marked with photos of the entombed. It was moving. The only thing I regret is that I spent ₩50,000 on roundtrip cab fare instead of getting on a tour bus. I'm sure it would have been cheaper, but I'm still glad I went!"
Salute to the people of Gwangju and the later government who is brave enough to face the truth ,"A well done facility. The English video is not to be missed. Not all exhibits are bilingual but there are enough English for foreign visitors to understand what had happened.We spent may be 2 hours in the museum including watching the video. The outdoor ground is nicely done and worth a walk for half an hour. The national cemetery across the road looks very calm and quiet and well maintained, but we visited in a down pouring raining day so we didn't go there.Bus 518 circles round the city before heading to the cemetery / museum, it takes almost an hour if you get on from U Square. Getting on the bus outside Gwangju train station will take a little less time on the bus.When getting off from the cemetery park bus stop, the museum complex is on the same side of the road; across the road is the national cemetery. The bus heads back to the city is on the cemetery side. The bus stop doesn't display bus schedule but we found a schedule inside the photo exhibition building in the museum complex. (According to the museum map that building is a restaurant but turns out it's not, just a snack shop and photo exhibition)The tragic end of innocent Gwangju citizens who fought for democracy makes my heart broken. There are so many similarities between the Gwangju massacre in 1980 and the June 4 massacre in Beijing in 1989. The new democratic government in SK has been so brave to face the past injustice and held the then dictators accountable in less than 2 decades since innocent people killed or injuried by the gun firing army.Next year is the 30th anniversary of the June 4 massacre, very unfortunate for the Chinese people China is still ruled by an authoritarian regime suppressing even the most basic human right."
A good visit to learn more about history,"It's a different kind of visit but very worth it. It's a good reminder of Korean history or a chance to learn if you don't already know, and a reminder that in many countries people have lost their lives for the democracy we enjoy today.If you are interested in history, you have to visit this place.There is plenty of parking on site. We stayed about 1 hour which was enough, but could have stayed a bit longer. It's OK to visit with a baby stroller."
Impressive Monument.,"I would recommend visiting if you are staying in Gwanju for a longer period. If you are only in Gwangju for a short time, then you can probably skip this. The May 18th event was significant to Gwangju's development and there are still many residents who lived through it. It is a good history lesson and a good way to learn about the local culture.The monument grounds are well maintained and located outside of the city. It is a peaceful place, good to walk around and reflect. It is all outdoors, so choose a nice day to visit.Getting there can be a challenge if you don't have a car. There are buses that go there, but no so frequently. It might be hard to catch a cab there, unless you call one or use Kakao taxi."
An Essential Part of Korean History,"This is a must see to help understand Korea today and in the past. You can arrive easily on the bus 518 from the central bus station or along the route in the city. Also, a taxi from the bus station or downtown will be about $15-20, and takes about 25 minutes. This location is just north of the city. They can call a taxi to bring you back into the city, or take the bus. A very well done monument and cemetary, go into the building inside on the left and ask to see the 20-minute historical video. The museum is also a powerful place. Then pay your respect to the 200 or so victims whose graves are here. This was a monumental event in Korea's transition from a fascist dictator to an elective democracy."
As much of the present as of the past,"It is a little bit out of the city of Gwangju, but easily reached via local bus #518. The tricky part is to find the right bus stop. It is the one at the rear of Gwangju Railway Station, not in front of it.The cemetery was as expected: neat rows of tombstones with hie plastic flowers at each. The museum was interesting, detailing a kind of timeline of the uprising. What is it lacks however is a more balanced discussion of context. Also a pity is that the curatorial tone is one-sided... which is a reflection of today's politically-correct version of history."
Visit to better understand Gwangju and S. Korea,"Get a guide and visit this sobering memorial to those who lost their lives in the quest for freedom. The architecture, museum, memorial, and cemetery are a fitting testament to the birth of democracy in S. Korea."
History of Gwangju Uprising,"The Memorial and the museum are a good introduction to the Gwangju Uprising of 1980. The graves of the victims are moving, as is the Memorial Hall. The exhibits in the museum may occasionally seem overemotional, but the movie provides historical background. Well worth the longish trip out on the aptly-named 518 bus. A little further up the road is the original burial place of the victims, if you have time make your way up there, too."
Very moving Memorial,"Our English speaking guide made our visit very enjoyable and we left with a thorough understanding. There is a brief video presentation, museum and gift shop that was on the same site as the cemetery and memorial.Koreans strongly believe, if you don't remember, it will happen again."
May 18th video documentary.,"We were lucky because the memorial hall staff are very helpful. The staffs even offer to show us English documentary video with Chinese subtitle video. You shall watch the video ! It''s worth it although it took a bit long 30 minutes. Last surprise, the staff give us the official historic book about May 18th incident....FREE. This is the best souvenir! "
democratization Memorial Place,It is a symbol of the democratization of the Republic of Korea. Gwang-ju citizens think it is very important here. It has a place to visit year after year many visitors.
Nice memorial park,Very nicely up kept memorial park. Makes visitors appreciate the sacrifices people from Gwangju gave to achieve their democratic goals.
Must experience,"Few uprisings in world history have been so well memorialized as the 1980 May 18 People's Uprising in Gwangju. There are 2 cemeteries here--the old one up the hill (where a visit should start) and the new one which can be reached by walking from the old. If you are in Gwangju, or in South Korea, this cemetery, museum and site are not only educational, they are unforgettable.

"Breathtaking, a Beautiful Remembrance.","This was a beautiful place, and I really enjoyed walking through the museum area and the surrounding grounds. It was very somber, but a great portrayal of what happened. One thing that was disappointing was the tents that were being taken down from an event. It was very loud and obnoxious as I was trying to be reverent and respectful of the lives lost. The workers should've taken the tents and poles down after hours. Besides that, I would highly recommend it."
A Tragically Beautiful Site,"The May 18th National Cemetery in Gwangju, South Korea, is a sacred and revered memorial for both the people of South Korea and democracies around the globe. The memorial is open year round and is free to the public. Getting there is simple; just get on bus 518 and it will take you straight to the May 18th National Cemetery for just 1200 won or about $1.20 USD.From the bus stop you will have to walk to the entrance on a well maintained sidewalk. The public restrooms, located in the parking lot and on site, are very clean. Cleanliness is definitely noticeable at all the memorials and monuments, from the well manicured landscapes to the floors inside the Memorial Hall.During my group’s visit there were several other groups touring the premises as well. The site is massive and there are many places to discover. I didn’t realize just how many other groups were visiting until we were all walking out of the main entrance together.The exhibits inside Memorial Hall were so profound that silence was a natural instinct. Parents should consider whether to expose their young children to these exhibits due to the graphic content shown.The monuments that memorialize the May 18th uprising are tragically beautiful. Personally, the cemetery and Memorial Hall exhibits left me in tears for the civilian lives lost during the battle for democracy at the hands of the military in Gwangju. As someone who lives in a democratic country, the cemetery had special significance. It was as if the heroes buried there were pleading with me to learn from their fight and what it took to bring democracy to South Korea."
A must see when visiting Gwangju.,"When I traveled to Gwangju I knew that it was rich in democratic history which is why when me and my classmates were there we visited the May 18th National Cemetery. If you don’t know what purpose the National Cemetery hold it’s when people lost their lives for freedom and democracy. Admission is free and offer tour guides that can walk you through the memorial, although I would recommend you call ahead of time if you need a guide because when we arrived there was not an English tour guide available. Note: if you decide to go don’t rely on a tour guide for there is a museum and a video that is offered to people who want to know more about the people who were involved and what happened turning these times. They also offer a learning center for kids which makes this memorial kid friendly. The view of the memorial is beautiful and if anyone wants to learn a little more Korean history then this is a great place to go."
Do Not Miss This!,"When I entered the cemetery grounds, a gentleman came up to me and asked if I knew anything about this and wanted to know if I have seen the video in one of the pavilions. Hw guided me to the place to watch the 30 minute video which put the whole cemetery in perspective. He also filled me in on the importance of the area, gave me a map with details of each monument and where to find them and also a thick book of the events that happened during May 1980. At the time that I did visit there was a funeral for a gentleman that passed away a few days earlier. I was lucky enough to witness this as it was done in the korean traditional way, with lots of events. It was amazing to witness this in a place like this. Without the guide, I would have not been able to experience the whole cemetery it was meant to be. I highly suggest entering through the main gate and take time to explore this gigantic area. It is extremely worth the time to learn about how a whole city came together to changed the nation."
Guide Made It A Five Star Experience,"We weren't sure what to expect when we arrived at the May 18th National Cemetery. At first our visit was just some wandering around without getting much out of it. At that point a guide at the main entrance spotted us (we had come in a side entrance) and came over to offer us a tour. He took an average experience and, with his explanations, made it amazing. He showed us graves of individuals that were noteworthy in one way or another, answered our questions and filled in additional information as we stopped in the photo hall, and then brought us into the museum where he let us to watch a 40 minute film (in English) that explained the background of the May 18th Democratic Uprising and then walked through all the events that occurred during the standoff with the military and the resulting massacre. After the movie, we enjoyed the many well done exhibits in the museum before going and looking around the cemetery some more. For those who are interested, there is somewhat hidden part of the facility behind (to the northeast of) the museum and a path that leads over the nearby road to the main cemetery about 500 m away. When we left our guide was at the main gate with a book and several pamphlets for us. His assistance certainly made our visit worth it."
Worth it,"We went on a rainy Monday, but in no way did this take away from the experience. (If anything, it added to the solemness.)The cemetery is a bit aways from the city and a lot of locals get a little confused about foreigners wanting to visit it, but it was worth it. As you enter, on the left there is an exhibit hall with a video (45 mins.). We had to pass on that because of time, but the exhibit was interesting, clean, and had some English explanations. After that, the tombs, monuments, and reliefs were interesting. Haven't felt that level of solemness since visiting the Nanjing Memorial. On the right (when viewing from the entrance) is a photo hall. This sounded a bit dull but was worth the drop in. Overall, a worthwhile visit. Would recommend an hour or two.TransportWith not a lot of time, we opted to take a cab there despite there being a bus route (bus 518 as mentioned by the previous person). It took 20-25 minutes one way. The meter read 9,800 won, but we worked it out with the cab driver for him to wait for us and take us back: both ways plus waiting time for 30,000 won. RecommendedYes, especially if it's rainy or if it's a Monday when a lot of museums are closed."
Take 518 bus there,"The bus leaves from the main bus station and takes about an hour. To the right of the main memorial and cemetery area is a photo room and to the left is a museum which is very detailed in the history, giving an hour by hour record of the two main days."
Quiet and Solemn sight away from the city,"The cemetery provided an insight to the political movements in South Korea in the 1980s, which is little known to foreigners. The tombs, monuments, documentaries and artifacts served as a reminder of South Korea's struggle to true democracy. Visiting the cemetery was a humbling experience. There were not many visitors to the place at any given time.A downside would be that the documentaries played were mainly in Korean and as a non-Korean speaking tourist, it was a little hard to grasp the details of what happened.Do factor in some time for travelling as the cemetery is a little out of the city centre."
Don't miss this wonderful memorial.,"The Gwangju massacre must never be forgotten and this very moving memorial will enrich your understanding of the Korean people, their culture and their history. Visit the 5/18 Memorial in respect of those who sacrificed their lives for democracy in Korea."
Very nice place to visit!,I visited here with my co-teacher (who speaks Korean) and enjoyed the scenery and the museum itself. I recommend it for anyone interested and with the ability to transport yourself to there. You won't regret it.
Good history lesson,"Before coming to Gwangju, I tried to understand the Democracy Movement, but the little information available in English was confusing. The National Cemetery had a great 30 minute (free!) documentary with so much information, pictures, and video. It was shocking to see pictures of tanks in the middle of downtown Gwangju, but very humbling. Very few people were visiting the same day, so the attendant answered our questions about the movement as best she could. Well worth a visit!"
Quiet Afternoon Reflection,"The May 18th Park is a an all around good afternoon activity. There are many places to see including the temples, memorials, and a student center. There is quite a bit of history, but only a few of the signs were translated. You can get a good idea of what happened from the statues. There are parks, with the exercise equipment and a look out temple(?) if you walk up the hill by the student center. There is areas if you want to picnic and at least 2 fountain/ponds. There is a templestay you can also visit."
Humbling Tribute,"We were there for the anniversary in May, it was a humbling experience where you could feel the spirit of those who fought for freedom. I definitely walked away with a greater appreciation of what happened and how it changed the lives of people in S Korea."
Interesting insight into a troubled past,"The May 18th National Cemetery is perhaps the biggest must do for those visiting Gwangju. The city is known for the protests and massacre of 1980 and this cemetery stands as an excellent testament to those events. The cemetery is easily reached from the Gwangju train station by taking the 518 bus from the road outside. A short walk from the bus stop then brings you to the museum. We were taken into and exhibition room and shown a video explaining the history of the uprising. Be warned parts of the film are extremely graphic and it is around thirty minutes long. It is however fascinating to watch the footage of the military and civilians clashing on the streets of Gwangju. The movie is followed by a small exhibition that shows artefacts from the uprising, most of which like an exhumed skeleton and a blood soaked rock are pretty morbid.After this you can wander around the cemetery itself at your leisure. All in all this attraction is an important piece of regional and national history and is well worth making the journey from the city centre for."
