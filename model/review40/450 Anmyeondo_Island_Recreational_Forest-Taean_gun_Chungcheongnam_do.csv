The best healing place,"CY + cg ( 2015.09.12 ) I think this place was very well organized for people need healing. There was consist of two area, one was trail, and the other was arboretum. That 2 area was all good. There had many pine tree, and we could breath with fresh air. The size was very good. If you visited Anmyeondo, must visit this place."
