Afternoon Stroll,"Love the tall trees. We came early for autumn, but still beautiful.The skytower is closed during our visit."
Very relaxing walk and beautiful place,There was a board walk up to the Sky Tower. Quite an easy stroll up and should be wheelchair friendly. Walked up the to the recreational sites and there were sequoia trees along the path. Very beautiful. Weather was just nice for the stroll.There was a cafe at the entrance and we had to take a shelter as it started to rain as we were about to leave. 
Good for hiking and outdoor activities.,"This place has dawn redwood forest where you can put your tent and spend good time with family or friends during hot summer days. Also, treetop walk can be done and a tower is there to view the surrounding area. If you like hiking, there are some hiking routes."
