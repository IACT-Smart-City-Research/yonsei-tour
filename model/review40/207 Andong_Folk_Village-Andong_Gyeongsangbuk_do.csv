Good half day.,"If the weather is nice this is a good place to wander around looking at homes, houses and other buildings moved here. Its just about walkable from Andong. Some shops, some food outlets, more across the bridge and plenty of toilets. "
Perfect location full of traditions ,Different traditional style buildings represent the long and interesting tradition of old Korea. A bit hilly but with fantastic views.
Like an outdoor museum,"Great spot to see some traditional style houses if you don’t mind the lack of authenticity. It’s very staged and next to the Andong Folk Museum so it feels like an extension of those exhibitions. Would recommend walking from downtown Andong via the right bank of the river on the nature trail. Very scenic and quaint, few people and only about 45 minutes to the Folk Village. The trail has quite a few stairs but is an easy walk overall with many places to rest. No toilets or rubbish bins along the way. "
Beautiful setting but not original,"We had visited Hahoe Folk Village the day before so this village was a little bit of a let down but it was in a picturesque area by the river on the side of the hill . The buildings were created for tourists, unlike Hahoe. There was a pond at the bottom of the hill, and from there a small road led up through the village. One of the best things to do is to walk here from the city center as there is a plank path by the river which winds its way through the forest."
Buildings internally quite bare,"We decided to walk to the folk village from Andong, this was quite a trip in the afternoon heat, but fortunately we were able to get a taxi back from nearby Wollyeongo across the bridge from the folk village (the tourist information office just outside Andong station was very helpful with taxi contact details). The best way is to take a taxi there and walk back! Like Hahoe village the buildings were internally bare, for example there were no furnishings or mannequins dressed up, really only the buildings to see. We were disappointed."
Very good to know Korean traditional houses,"We went by car and stayed in one of the old houses (there are many B&B very nice where you can sleep). The day after we visited the village. It has more than 300 years and gives a perfect idea of how Korean built their houses and lived. Very interesting to appreciate the construction styles, heating and natural ""air condition"", display of rooms etc. At the the same time you can enjoy the beautiful of some houses, everything in a nice area near a river. Must go."
Amazing must visit,"Andong Folk village, is a must do visit when you are in Andong. It is amazing and all is authentic i recommand all tourists in the area to visit"
"So funny, got here by accident.","We were on our way to Hahoe Village and the signage is bad and I did not properly set up the GPS. Anyway, glad we went. However, this is actually a reproduction village in the spirit of Hahoe. I guess it was put together as a site to show the historic villages looked without the additional trip (45 minutes) to the actual Hahoe Village. It was free to park and visit."
Must Go!!,"A nice serene village that is full of historical charm. Must go in Andong!! Take bus 48 oppsite Andong Train station. Collect bus schedule from Tourist Infomation, next to Andong Station. The bus timings to various attractions are timed and not that frequent, so do plan your itinerary according."
Informative outdoor museum.,"The best it is to visit this folk village after seeing the dam and especially the Folk Museum nearby. The houses brought to this Skansen were in danger of destruction during the building of the dam. They are mostly simple family dwellings with kitchens, paper windows and outhouses. There is a good example of a building with so called magpie roof which was a form of ventilation. In one of the houses we participated in chrysanthemum tea ceremony.One can see also a kiln complex.You can combine visiting the village with the walk along the river or follow the road uphill to a hotel and restaurant complex."
OK to get an idea of traditional Korean houses,"We took bus 3 to Andong Folk Village after arriving at our guesthouse. An easy ride with the bus, and at the bus stop there are quite a few nice restaurants serving heotjesatbap.The houses in the folk village were transported to the village due to the building of the Andong Dam in 1976. Most houses were farm houses (with thatched roofs), which were open for visitors. We walked all the way up the hill, where even prettier houses were, but we were quickly sent back, as apparently those houses are now part of an exclusive hotel.We walked back via a 2 km. long board walk along the river, which we'd highly recommend."
Nice folk village but not Hahoe,Free to visit with some historical homes and movie props as well. Not a must see and not as good as Hahoe but worth a visit if you are in the area. Easy and pleasant 25 minute walk along the river from the train station to get there. 
quite interesting,"entrance fee: 3000 won. this traditional and village may represnt what has been korea in the past. all the buildings are very well kept but there is somehting missing... i guess that they should organize some english speaking tour, maybe there are but we couldnt manage to find any. it could be better presented in order to understand more this amazing place"
Nice to see if you are in andong ,"We came here because we had some time in the afternoon and andong itself has little to see. The village is ok, and has nice paths along the river. You can check out the dam or the bridge which is quite nice but other than that it is just ok. Buses come very infrequently here from andong so if you must rely on them be careful and get a timetable for buses before you venture here."
