Maybe next time ,Maybe next time if I’ll be driving around I’ll pass by with more time. KTX train also stops here which is good transport option.
Very beautiful mountain but beware of the long hike. ,"It was a beautiful mountain. A waterfall, cave, temples, Cherry Blossom trees etc. Definitely must visit mountain if one is in Gumi.But, beware of the long and steep hike. At first, we were surprised to see many Ahjumma and Ahjussi geared in hiking equipments at the bottom of the mountain and realized what we were in for when we started hiking. Not for the faint hearted. The whole hiking trail to the summit was more than 2.4km and boy, was it tough. It took us about 4 hours to hike up and down. I slipped and fell due to the dry sand and rocks. My partner and I were not prepared for this and our leg muscles ached for the next few days. We couldn’t really walk properly.If you are not trained, I would suggest that you do not try to reach the summit.Besides these, the scenery was awesome. "
places that you should visit in Gumi,It is beautiful and amazing place to climbing. you can climb to only waterfall which takes around less than 1 hour. 
"Spectacular views, steep hike past half-way point","Really loved the views and the hike. Even if you don't have hiking shoes, you can walk up an easy uphill trail giving way to wooden steps up to the lookout just past the waterfalls. The autumn foliage just made it a little more special. After the lookout is a different story. Better start early to reach the summit and return to the lighted path before dark. If you walk from the reservoir after lunch, the lookout is probably a reasonable just like I did."
A Little Piece of Heaven,Take it from someone with a huge fear of heights this place is amazing. Take the lift to the top and enjoy all the beauty and the small temple around you. Very peaceful and soothing mountain to be on. 
Great View.,"I came here a little un prepared. Easy to get to. The cable car takes you to a temple, waterfalls and caves. the climb is steep up some stairs. The stairs finish at about 300m and then its a 2km walk to the top. Bring water and proper shoes. The climb is on a rocky track which can become slippery. Once on top there is an amazing temple with spectacular views of Gumi. I will do this again but will prepare myself next time with, water, snacks, first aid kid. Allow up to 4- 5 hours to complete."
Great day out,"Nice views of mountain, lakes, mountain stream. Cable car takes you up Geumo Mountain. From there hike to a temple, cave and waterfall. Below also picnic grounds for BBQ etc. Some people camp there in summer."
Nice park and trails,Very nice and well kept up the mountain and around the lake . This area is very popular at Cheryl blossom time.
Great Park for Hiking and Walking ,Absolutely beautiful park and mountain hiking. Can spend the entire day here. Family friendly. Enjoyed the hiking; trolley ride; temples and attractions. Also took the walking tour around the reservoir. 
Amazing hiking,"Spent about eight hours today exploring and hiking up and down the mountain, checking out caves, waterfalls, and the natural scenery. Best hiking I have done yet in Korea. "
One of the best in Korea,I have traveled quite a bit in Korea but never got around to Gumi until recently to visit a friend. I was shocked at what I had been missing. This park is absolutely beautiful and has some of the most amazing sites I have seen in Korea. I highly recommend this place. Give yourself the time to walk around the lake and hike the mountain. You won't be disappointed.
Really nice moutain,Easy hike. Or take the cable car about 0.6km up! Nice restaurants and coffee shops in the area. Different routes to take.
Absolutely Stunning landscape,Geumosan Probincial Park is one of the most beautiful destinations I've visited in Korea. It was easily accessible from Gumi train station with a taxi (Only 4000 Won). The trails were in very good condition and the the park was clean. The views are amazing. We spent 7 hours climbing and hiking. Well worth a day-visit.
Best trekking outdoors in korea,"Geumo mountains are amazing to spend your weekends with amazing Un altered natural outdoors. Park, peaks and temple are so peaceful and serene. In case you hit mountains in early morning do hit the summit."
One of my favorite areas in Korea,"I really love the Guemo Mountain area. Here's why.The ""base"" of Guemo mountain has: 1) A lakethe lake is man made, but still really beautiful. There is a short trail that goes all the way around the lake. I've almost always seen fish or turtles in the water. In the warmer months you can rent duck paddle boats and paddle around the lake. 2) Guemo LandA tiny little amusement park geared mostly to smaller kids (The Viking is about the most exciting ride they've got) However, there is also an ice rink in the park, and in the winter they have a cool little sledding hill.3) Restaurant AreaNear the main parking area, there are quite a few traditional restaurants specializing in traditional foods that are a little hard to find in the city. The row of half open air wood paneled restaurants specialize in Jeon (Korean style flat grilled pancakes, which can be Green onion and seafood, potato, or kimchi centered) These places also serve fresh makkoli and dong-dong ju (creamy rice alcohol) and stews. There are also noteworthy tea cafes and samgyetang (chicken soup of awesomeness) restaurants. Further up the trail towards the mountain:1) River areaGreat for a picnic or walk. Lots of benches. The river continues most of the way up the mountain.2)Guemo Hotel One of the fancier hotels in Gumi. They have buffet lunch/dinner, and an interestingly manicured and decorated hotel grounds.3) Cable carFor 5,000 this will take you right up to the big temple and waterfall area.4) Boardwalk area to the waterfallThere is a boarded walkway that follows the river and goes most of the way up to the waterfall. It goes through some really pretty terrain and has built in lights making for a great night stroll/hike. Mid mountain1) TempleThere is a medium sized picturesque temple just before the waterfall. 2) WaterfallVery pretty area and a good place to cool down. 3) Cave shrineTo the right of the waterfall (if you face towards the waterfall), there is a short, but very steep trail that will take you up to a small cave with a cool little shrine. Worthwhile if only for the view.4) Stairs of deathTo the left of the waterfall, is the safest leg of the trip to the top of the mountain. If you have a lot of trouble with the stairs, you might consider turning back, because things do not get any easier. The view is fantastic at the top. Warning: the hike up to the top is pretty steep and can be pretty slippery if rain is involved. There really aren't any safety measures past this point, so it's very much go at your own risk. Personally, I love the hike, but do be careful. Also if you plan on going to the top, make sure you bring a goodly amount of water. The peak:1) The summit rock Not quite at the summit, but a nice picture opportunity to show how high you've climbed. 2) Clifftop templeGreat place for pictures. One of my favorite spots in all Korea3) Prayer rock outcroppingsIf you go to the summit rock there is an abandoned military base, if you hike around behind the base and to the side opposite the rock, there are some great little outcroppings with prayer rock tower that overlook the clifftop temple. Great place for a picnic and some pictures. Other:1) There is a very, very old stone Buddha relief carved into a rock face about 2/3 of the way up. It's hard to find, though. 2) It's possible to walk to the parking restaurant area from downtown Gumi. If you do there is a cool little barefoot walking course, complete with foot rinse station on the way. 3) There is also a little riverside camping area a ways behind the restaurant area. It's usually pretty crowded by western standards, however."
"Spectacular views, brutal trails","The park is one of the few attractions in Gumi. There are a few tasks to the sites such as the waterfall, stone Buddha carving, and the summit. The trails are extremely tough, sometimes treacherous, and not well marked, at least not if you can't read Korean. The payback is terrific, though, offering spectacular views. Be sure to bring plenty of water and some snacks. "
