Historic Village,"1. I wanted to see something historic.So Yandong Village did not disappoint me as many of the ancient village houses were preserved.2. Some of the traditional village e.g. Bukchon Village in Insadong, Seoul - are actually restored to replicate its historic style - and are now occupied by present day residents.The Yangdong Village is not restored in that sense.3. Learnt a bit of the Korean culture in history - like their fermenting of Kimchi in large pots, a pole is placed across their gate to signify that visitors are not to enter, we can recognise the status of the occupants from the different roof types on their housesNot sure how the poorer folks back then survive the severe cold in winter.4. Great photo taking opportunity to remember our time in Korea "
Disappointing,disappointment because walk around at village hillside and look at the outside of the buildings only
Interesting,Worth a visit here. You see lots of old houses as you wander around the pathways but you can’t enter any. Loved the thatched roofs and plenty of persimmon trees full of fruit! Would suggest visiting out of season as we did as we did so it wasn’t too crowded.
Living village that is UNESCO World Heritage Site listed,"Having visited other living villages or towns that are similarly UNESCO World Heritage Site listed, we were left unimpressed with the sights in Yangdong Village. This is a living residential area with numerous houses sprawled across numerous hills, and residents going about with their daily activities. And that is it.It was a short half day trip from Gyeongju with a mixture of taxi and bus. Other than having visited another UNESCO listed location, there were not any memorable sights in this village. "
Mixed experience,"I spent a pleasant hour and a half wandering around the village enjoying the architecture but my husband was bored and hated it. I recommend stopping by the small museum to learn more about the village's history. Be prepared, it's very hilly so walking around is definitely a work out. The bus 203 only runs about once an hour so make sure to check out the schedule to help plan your visit. "
"Love, peaceful village to experience","We visited Yangdong-ri Folk Village on a drizzly, gray day...perhaps the perfect day to wander around out of the sun. The existing, ancient dwellings were a marvel of classic Korean style architecture and construction that has lasted for centuries. The lotus pond was in bloom, making it even more beautiful. I think this is a must-see if you’re in the area."
Step Into the Past,My family of eight visited Yangdong Folk Village in June 2019. We hired a driver to take us from Gyeongju and he waited while we visited the village. They provide English tour guides who are quite knowledgable. What's interesting about this village is that it is still lived in. From the outside you see an old structure with a straw roof but if you look around the back you see air conditioners and satellite dishes. Apparently the current inhabitants are descendants of the original village dwellers. The village is quite large and you need several hours to see it all.My family especially enjoyed the archery corner. We paid extra for this and it was great. Wear good shoes as there is a lot of walking and some very steep terrain.
Free tour in English available ,This was the most expensive sightseeing thing I have been to in Gyeongju and probably my least favourite. In saying that it is easy to get to on the 203 bus which starts by the inter city terminal .. but on the road side. Costs 4000 won to get in but there is free tour guides available including English speaking. This was really good otherwise I would have been quite lost .. the map did not seem informative either. Lovely village to wander through. 
wonderful village,"Quite hilly and paths that can get steep but such an amazing demonstration of traditional Korean houses, both tile roof and thatched. Stunningly restored!"
Very nice village,"It's a great looking village, and it's a nice place to take a walk. There weren't many tourists there."
Quiet UNESCO site,"It’s a very big area with some huts occupied by current residents. You cannot access most relics. From Busan, Nopo Station, take bus heading for gyeongju at berth 27 to Gyeongju express bus terminal (city center with plenty of food options) After dropping at the bus terminal, take bus 203 to Yandong Folklore Village. The bus stop ( not the one across the zebra crossing) is further down on the same side of where stop where you dropped (same direction of car traffic)"
Great traditional architecture ,The whole photogenic village looks so beautiful. The typical stone walls with straw thatched roofs in the quiet hilly countryside makes me feel like in a oasis.
How beautiful it is!!,It was a very lyrical village.It would be perfect for me to walk around town in traditional Hanboks and take pictures. It is closer to Pohang than Gyeongju.
Overrated,"Positive side: decent car park.Given that this is a living village with traffic coming and going, why do we need to pay to go in (who gets the money)?Was most disappointed – you have to pay to walk around a village on a hillside, the interesting historical houses are locked up (all you can do is look from the outside), the map is useless and there are no signs Given that this is a UNESCO World Heritage site, this is the most disappointing such site that I have seen.(Compare this to say Carcassonne – which is very impressive, also a living village and access is open to all)Can’t imagine what this is like in summer with every house selling ice-creams."
Trip back in time,"We spent a superb morning exploring. You feel like you stepped back in time few hundred years. We took a taxi from Gyeongju to reach the place fast, walk around the village for 3 hours and took the bus back to Gyeongju. There are vending machines in few places to get water and snacks. All small restaurants and places to eat open around noon. Keep this is mind if you want to have a meal here."
Great living folk village,This is a very large site with many buildings/houses to view. Made better because this is not just a museum but a living village. Great to stroll round when the weather is good
Old traditional folk village,"We stopped in Gyeongju for one day on a trip from Seoul to Busan. After we visited the Bulguksa temple we decided to give the folk village a try. There is only 1 bus (line 203), which stops directly by the start of the Yangdong folk village, but a couple of buses do stop quite close (close means that you have to walk 20-30 minutes to get to the actual start of the folk village). The bus stop is also just at a large bent and you don't see the village, but the stop was announced in English, so we knew where to get off. The village is pretty nice, also with a few little shops around, and a museum with air conditioning and some snacks you can get. We took bus 203 back into town, the scheduled times are listed, so check before you get into the village to make sure you are back on time. Unfortunately it was in high summer, so maybe a bit too hot for my taste, but the village is surrounded by lots of trees, so some shade is insured."
Unique village maintaining historic building techniques and used as living quarters,"The village was quite far from the train station so you either spend a lot of time on buses or lots of money on taxis. The interesting part of this village is that the majority of the buildings were being used as living quarters. A few large buildings were available to get close and look at, but very little if any furniture, tools, etc. The rest were residences and as such not something that you could get close to. The terrain was also challenging as you were either walking up hill or down hill. Not easy to get around. The homes were also not well laid out to get from one to another. My thought is that most people will wear out before they see all of the buildings. It is a UNESCO site, so worth the effort."
Check the timing for bus 203 to yangdong ,"There is only 1 bus going there, 203. There is fix timing for this bus. I waited almost 45mins near Gyeongju train terminal bus stop because I wasn't aware of the time. if unsure the location of the bus stop, always check with the information center just outside of the train station or bus terminal. They speak English and very helpful. There are few villages in yangdong village to visit. If you're in time constraints, checking out the 4 main houses would take you within 2 hours time. If not you can just wondering around the village till the next bus back to terminal. Remember to grab a map and ask for direction. I saw people just walking in circle without knowing their destination and it will waste your time here. Decide which village to visit and it helps you navigate easily and time saver. Feel kinda disappointed as the village only showcase the building and not the interior. It's kinda empty and basically just empty shell. But still you manage to see how strong foundation this building is that still survive till now. Glad that it's preserve and listed as world heritage. "
very good beautiful alternative to Andong folk village,"A must if you are near Gyeongju , you have many different kind of houses from the rich families to the normal one, make sure to take a map before starting the visit in order to not miss any house because it is not always clear.. unless you don't care as you still have some indication for the main houses (all inhabited). may have some steep slopes.You can enjoy some fresh tea at the small ""cafe"" near the entrance, very kind lady."
A beautiful traditional village,"This village is one of the few villages preserved over a century. Besides its long history, the village itself is so beautiful, especially in June and July."
A cultural gem,A well preserved cultural gem. The village is easy to reach by public transportation and is well worth the trip to see the rural life of past and present.
Disappointing experience.,"The 16th century buildings are interesting and the village, with its thatch-roof houses as well, is set beautifully within the hills. However, Yangdong was a disappointment to us because all one can really look at is the outside of the buildings, not even the courtyards, with a few glances inside. We understand that too many tourists can trample a site, but we had expected more based on the Korea Smart Tour Guide (Audio Korea) app that we used here (and at the National Museum). Using the app was a tease because it had all the details about the buildings, yet we could not see much of them. Also, there seem to be no maps available and the sign at the main entrance isn’t sufficient. There are enough directional signs in the village itself to find your way around eventually, but a map would certainly help. On a Tuesday toward the end of April, there was no place open to sit for even a coffee, let alone some food. Also, we took the 201 to the village, which really drops on the main road, and we walked from there. We took the 203 back from the parking lot."
Interesting,"A mixture of old, as in 1600s onwards, tile roofed houses and simpler thatched housesThere is a museum at the entrance - we recommend you do this on the way inThere is a hilly walk between the main classy housesThe village was peaceful even on a busy weekend. "
Strolling around here for a peaceful feeling,"Here’s to witness a cultural heritage site. Known as Korea’s largest traditional village, which also showcasing Joseon Dynasty with its beautiful scenic view of Mount Seolchangsan and its four spines. I read somewhere that the old houses are over 200-years old and when I was there, it doesn’t look that old! Still in a good condition and clean. A nice choice to spend a quiet afternoon here, and pay attention with the bus schedule."
Nice place to see the tradition,Very special village with many traditional houses. Make a slow walk to enjoy. But watch the schedule of the bus. 
Good walk,A very nice walk that could be interesting if every thing is open in the village.easy walk for all ages.
Nice walk with lots of free experience activities,Not many people visiting Gyeongju will aware of this place so walking in Yongdong Folk Village was enjoyable. Check with the travel information counter for the frequency and the bus stop of bus no. 203 as many local people know nothing about this route. Even the hotel staff can't check any bus information on the internet. The bus takes around 40 minutes from intercity bus terminal to the village.There are cafes and restaurants in the village so no worry about that. The entrance fee is 4000 won/px. Recommend for half day trip.
A very special way to experience Korean traditional village,"Please consider whether this is a tourist attraction for you by reflecting on the fact that people call this village home.This UNESCO site is not a static 'historical' place for a paying visitor but a living and breathing traditional village where tourists are privileged with experiencing a different way of life.You can do a day trip - I suggest at least a couple of hours are needed - or stay overnight. To enjoy the experience, make sure you have reasonable level of fitness for walking up and down those hills!"
Nice half day visit,"Its a must-see place if you can squeeze out some time in your itin. Easy to go KTX gyeongju station or in town. But do check bus no. 203 schedule. Or take bus no. 200-208, 212 and 217. Name of station will be broadcasted in enlishg for a few stops like train staion, a park and yangdong village as i took on bus no.207. I was dropped at an intersection and walk for 10 mins to the main gate. There is a well-fesigned musemu and with english description. Wandering around the village is amazing. Experience local lifestyle, peaceful atmosphere, and traditional building skill. Easy to catch bus schedule back to town."
The history of Korea,"I really recommend this place. It's a beautiful window into the history of Korea. Very nice museum (visit before the tour, you can get there information about what you can see). There is a possibility of English tour (we were unlucky and on that day, no English tours - could be good to call there and ask). Nice walking and landscapes. Good even for families. You can make a longer or shorter walks. Prepare your camera... Photos could be make everywhere! "
Nice traditional village,"Nice traditional Korean village. Still occupied by local people but now it is like an amusement park because of the ticket office in front. The thatched houses are the most unique view here. It is very unique just like gossho-zukuri house in Japan or tulou in China. The location of the village is slightly far from the city of Gyeongju (about 1 hour by bus) and the bus comes infrequently (in total, I spent 4 hours just to wait for the bus). This village along with Andong is listed as UNESCO World Heritage Site."
Nice but nothing to write home about,"The village has a lot of history behind it. Some houses are more than 600 years old. However, after you've seen the first one they're all the same. The village itself is kind of boring. Nothing happening, no villagers around. If it was free it would be worth a visit. With the 4000 won entrance fee I would advise against it. There are many much more beautiful sights in and around Gyeongju.One of the main attractions in the village was closed when I visited, but they still charged the full entrance fee. Very disappointing."
Well- Kept Hanok Village,"Our original plan was to do an over night stay here, but we ended up doing it as a day trip from Busan instead, which worked a little better. We came here with a friend from Korea who showed us around the area and he had a pretty decent knowledge of some of the history. The houses are all very well kept and in good condition, it's a nice place to walk around for a couple hours. There are also places nearby where you can rent Hanbok (traditional clothing) and take photos in the village - lots of people were doing this."
Idyllic site by the UNESCO.,"Gyeongju with three sites UNESCO confidently bypasses Seoul, which has only one. One of them is the village Yangdong. To reach it is not difficult. Bus 203 (9400 out -back and forth) goes about every half hour. Industrial landscapes are gradually replaced by the idyllic - rolling hills and rice fields. Yangdong is a family village, where one clan lives. You can become a gentle witness for a couple of hours of this life. Nothing says about modern life, besides modern motorcycles and cars in the yards. And extinguishers. UNESCO, together with the Koreans watching carefully for authenticity."
Stepping back in time,"Readily reachable from Gyeongju by city bus, the site is more for history buffs. It is a World Heritage Site that has people living on it ie not all areas are open to the public. Those who use walking sticks should bring them along. Most of the photography is of building exteriors."
authentic folk village,"been to many Korean folk villages, must say that this is one of the most authentic village. many people still live here. the houses are well-preserved and walking around getting lost just feels like a visit to the past. getting here was confusing for me. the bus that supposed to arrive, didn't. so i took the taxi instead and it cost me 27,000krw to get there from Gyeongju bus terminal. anyway, when i reached, literally NOBODY was in sight. after looking lost for a good 5 minutes i walked up to the building that somewhat looked like an office.. got the ticket, maps, and took a picture of the bus timetable.i took almost 3hrs just wandering around, absorbing and imagining how the life back then mustve been.. each houses with importance are marked, and clearly signed with simple explanation outside, you won't miss it. most of the houses were built and lived in by some of the great Korean scholars. it was fascinating..perhaps it'd be a perfect visit when it isn't so chilly. for bus going back to Gyeongju bus terminal, head back to the parking lot and look for the bus stop. i was so worried that the bus wont come, seeing that i was literally alone there.. and there wasnt any taxi around. but bless me the bus came albeit slightly late. again, was the only passages on the bus (where's everyone?)it was a great experience."
A place must visit,"A traditional Korean live village, still have people living in but not just a park. Driving is a must, as it will need times to reach there if you take buses. The deeper you walk, you can see the real korean living style in the olden times. Some Korean restaurants are at the entrance of the village. You will need one to two hours to cover the whole village."
Really good in Fall!,One of the best places to visit during Fall for good scenery. A good taste of what old Korea used to look like!
"A nice place, but not in winter!","The impression of this traditional Hanok village to me is a quiet place. I went there on 24 Dec and of course I didn't expect to celebrate Christmas there. There are people living there, but apart from a few tourists, I didn't see any villagers.(spending 3 hours there). You can see some cafe signage but there was no cafe actually. Not only that they didn't do business, but they didn't look like places doing business at all. The scenery is nice. There was one (empty) traditional building opened for tourists to look around, other four were closed (locked). Was it that it was winter time? It is a lovely place but the management is poor (buy tickets before entering the village), what a pity."
Peaceful Korea Folk Village,"If you are looking for a less crowded folk village to visit, Yangdong Folk Village located about 1 hr bus ride from Gyeongju Bus Terminal is the perfect place for you. This village was historical and famous because it was the birthplace for Son So and his families of distinguished scholars and ministers during the Joseon period. The village was built based on feng shui, an ancient art of geomancy to enable continuous blessings for the people and their descendants. There is also an ancient gingko tree about 600 years old still alive and located at the home of Son So. Besides the descendants of Son So, there are also other villagers still living here, so if you are visiting, please be careful not to disturb them !!! Overall it was a great place to be and I has fun walking around, exploring and trying to find all the important buildings located in various places in the village vicinity - it's like a treasure hunting trip haha !!! (there is also a museum located near the entrance for visitors to understand more about the village) !!!"
Unique experience,Along with Hahoe Village this is a unique part of Korean history and culture. Well worth visiting - you can't see buildings of this quality anywhere else apart from Hahoe. Don't miss it - the photos do not do justice to the personal experience.
A great picture taking place,Bring a good camera or phone and go on a bright and sunny day and this little village makes some great shots to wow friends and family about your trip to Korea!
A place to walk around,We visited this village on a very hot day. It is a nice place to stroll around and not much else. Truthfully we didn't make it too far into the village because our children were tired of walking in the hot sun. We mostly took a few pictures and admired the thatched roofs. There was a craft fair set up for the kids to make traditional Korean crafts like kites for free. It occurs on the 2nd and 4th weekend of every month. My kids would have probably enjoyed it more if it weren't for the heat. 
Oldest folk village in Korea (still remain),"There are numbers of buses will bring you to the Yangdong Folk Village. But as far I know, it should be only bus number 203 and 252 will take you inside the village. I took bus number 200 for 45mins and got off a bus station next to the highway. Yes, it is a bus stop next to the highway! I walked along the road next to the railway. The railway looks abandoned but I assume it is still working. After 10mins walk, you will see the entrance of the village. It costs won4000 (each adult) for the entrance fee. I attached bus 203 timetable. Pink color is the return bus schedule :)"
A lovely traditional Korean village,It is a traditional Korean village. People do live there. I was there on the week day and there were not many tourists. It was lovely and wonderful.
Excellent experience in historic village,The few remaining Joseon era Village that is still functioning. Very interesting & informative. Love the view of the area & the architecture.
Excellent and non-commercial,"Intact clan village from the 15th century. Great for a walk, to experience a slow and authentic slice of life."
"Nice for a short visit, not worth an overnight","We thought it would be an interesting experience to stay at a homestay in the village. It is not the easiest to do, since the website we found that lists the options is only in Korean and you have to pay in advance by bank transfer. Thankfully, the hotel in Gyeonju we stayed at (Sugar Motel) helped us with both of those free of charge. For 50,000 won, we had a small room in a traditional house. If it was 20,000 won, it would have been okay, but for 50,000 it was a complete rip off. No food was included, and all of the amenities that they advertised, such as traditional massage and translation services did not exist either. We just had a hard floor to sleep on. They wouldn't even give us an extra blanket for padding, and only gave us one small hand towel to use for 4 people to bathe. It's possible that we just got one of the crappy places. No one else seemed to stay in the village, so if you want to give it a try, I suggest not booking in advance. Just show up and ask around. You might be able to find a decent option.As for the village itself, it is a nice enough visit for a few hours if you want to just walk around and experience an old village. One major downside is that the highlighted houses in the brochure you get with your ticket are all closed, so you can only look at them from the outside."
"Open air museum with authentic buidlings, and with people still living in it.","A bit outside / north of Gyeongju. Recommend visiting with nice weather, because it is mostly strolling outside. Unlike other folk villages, this one is actually still 'alive' with people living in it."
Well worth the busride out of Gyeongiu.,"Beautiful, peaceful and authentic handok village. Well worth the time to get to it. This is not the phony Korean village near the art gallery, people actually live here."
Nice uncrowded folk village,nice to visit anytime as it is not too crowded and situated between Gyeongju and Pohang. On a hillside so the are lots of trees for shade in the hot humid Summers months. And lots of snack shacks and a couple of sit down restaurants. Nice atmosphere for the whole family.
Quaint and quiet village ,Very historic old village. Calming to walk through. Real residents living there. Some might even talk with you. 
Worth to go,"I spent three months in Korea, and this is the best traditional village that I've visited ^^I changed two buses to Gyeongju and another hour to get here but itis really nice place. However, some of the main houses was close and I cannot visited. I think that they suppose to have a free guide in some certain time, but I didnt notice until I was going to left the village. There are a few bus to go to village, you can find the timetable in the picture. I took the 9:00am and left around 13:30 "
A special experience ,"This is an Unesco Heritage, so by definition a place of interest. However what i found especially interesting is that there are about 300 people living there and there is even a school at tye beginning of the village. People living there are selling some local products and based on my understanding the majority works with agriculture. Another interesting thing is tge combination of modern (aircon units) with tge traditional style of the houses. This is a place that worths a visit. I went there by car and found the parking pretty easy."
"Tranquil, lovely historic village","This village is a delightful, relaxing place to while away a couple of hours. There are some steep hills to climb but also easier streets with lush vegetable gardens along the side. One can see the large cabbages, called paechu, from which Korea's unique food kimchi is made. This lovely village is very picturesque presenting different angles where walls ascend a hill interspersed with tiled roof houses or thatched roof buildings. Tucked here and there to break the spell of imagining a visit to old Korea are partially hidden small trucks or vans."
Yangdong Folk Village,Korean traditional houses - tile-roofed and thatched houses - are well preserved in this village. You would think that you feel like living in Korea back in 100 years ago. You can enjoy old Korean cultures by walking along paths and alleys.
"A Slice of Life from the Past, Confucian Style","Yangdong Folk Village is a World UNESCO Site and well worth a visit. However, without a guide or previously arranged meetings, the village may be more difficult to fully appreciate. The village museum will help, either way."
Nice walk around tradition village,"Worth a day if your in the area, some interesting old houses, restaurants are near by and its a pleasant experience."
"Nice village, a bit out of the way","The village is a bit out of the way, and you can hire a car to take you here for ~$40 or take one of many buses from downtown Gyeongju. The village itself is a UNESCO World Heritage site but there's not much to do in the village. There are a few large homes/landmarks but as far as old folk villages I've seen in other parts of the world this isn't anything great. Its better than the Gyeongju cultural village in town but its also harder to get to."
Korea as it once was...,"The only spot in Korea allowed to have thatched traditional roofs, we saw Korea as it once was and talked with the village elder. He was supposed to discuss Confucianism and history, which he did, but wanted to talk about American ""tiger moms"", ""helicopter parents"" and Donald Trump. He had a lot to say about parenting and the clash between old and new values. It was a great visit."
Cutesy village,"To get to Yangdong village, you will need to take a train (KTX) to Sinyeongju station and then take a bus to Gyeongju station. After that it's about a 45 minutes bus ride from the inter city bus terminal to the village. It's best to allocate one whole day to this place if you are planning to explore everything slowly. Be prepared for a lot of hilly areas and walks. Best to bring an umbrella during summer. Don't worry about food as they have places to eat and drink at the village. You must first purchase an entrance ticket and then you will be given a map. There is also an option for getting a tour guide if you want and it's free of charge.Overall, it's recommended if you are into Hanok and culture and history. Good for family with kids too."
A VERY BOUTIQUE TRADITIONAL KOREAN VILLAGE,"Before coming here, I'd seen many traditional Korean villages in the movies. So I felt very familiar with the view here, it even made me thing that I was in a drama scene. hehe :). But one thing surprised me that there were still residents living. So interesting! The village were larger more than I expected. It was clean and neat. There was a museum outside of the village. Some pictures on the wall that reminded of villagers' normal activities in the old times. * NOTE: I came there in April 2014 but I couldn't choose that period at the below button so I chose August 2014. So sorry!"
more authentic than Hahoe,"maybe it was due my visit in the early morning hours of a week day, but the village had a more authentic and 'lived in' feel than overly touristy Hahoe Village near Andong. Fewer restaurants and shops and more residences - though it seems more and more are rented out as well. Nice walks along the houses, showing the different social standing of the residences"
Fascinating open air museum,"Totally worth the trip there. Before entering the village there is a free museum with findings and the models of some houses, quite informative. Then, just walk around and and enjoy the houses in their landscape. "
Enjoy it in the low season,I love it! Traditional Korea village in present time and there are still residents living! Like time travellers. 
Beautiful living folk village,"The village is open to tourists but it is done in a respectful and not commercialized way. Free guided tours in English are available. Plan several hours here to relax and see all the sights. Many residents are generous in opening the courtyards of their homes to the public (not all do this), so be respectful of this. Remember, people live there. I found visitors are respectful though, I am impressed by the Korean people's manners. The village is 500 years old, the tourist brochures and signs (in a few languages) explain the details about the famous sights."
Old Korea,"Visit the old Korean houses, made of wood, where some people still live. Very peaceful, lots of nature. About 40 minutes bus ride from Gyeongju bus station (203 line). Village has a couple of restaurants for a bibimbap stop."
Hilly and enjoyable,"This folk village is more spread out (and hillier) than Hahoe, but is very interesting and peaceful. It's a short drive from Gyeongju. A late afternoon visit was wonderful."
A great walk.. fantastic and interesting!,"This was a highlight we did not expect! A small 'traditional village' in the hills outside Gyeongju. We took the 203 bus, (1200 won) about 45 mins from Gyeongju using the bus stop near the Gyeongju train station, there are several buses that come here, all 20x. The driver will tell you where to alight. Then a lovely 10-15 min walk aside the railway track to the village. Entrance fee 2000 won. We walked for 3 hours around looking at the houses, fields and views. Lovely place for a variety of photos - houses, people, plants, insects... Great day! Had a cool drink in a local house/garden centre.. cheap and friendly. Recommended!"
An authentic village,"Easy to get to from Gyeongju (bus 203). The village contains some old houses that you can go into to visit, but it is not a relic as people are living there. Quite interesting."
Living village,"We were with a large tour group and an English guide so we had no difficulty getting here. The village is active, with people living in it. You can walk around and different areas are open to the public at different times. It was interesting to see the Korean-style homes and how they were constructed. There are lots of hills so be prepared to climb up and down to get to the different homes. Notice the walls and how there are twigs and leaves and dirt on top of some of them. They crow squash on top of the walls, which I thought was quite creative. When we were there, there were people demonstrating different folk arts. Our group had elementary through high school kids. They enjoyed making kites, drawing pictures with ink, and playing Korean games. I enjoyed watching the women spin silk from the cocoons. They enjoyed these activities while most of the adults were touring the village homes."
traditional village,this place has traditional house which has Korean's wisdom is in this house they used many technics to build a house.
Beautiful village especially in autumn,"This is an old village dating back to the Joseon dynasty, unlike those in Gyeongju that are from the Shilla era. I went there by bus, about 50 mins northeast of Gyeongju centre. From a bus stop near the Gyeongju train station, there are several buses that come here, all 2xx. See photo with map and bus schedule below. In particular, 203 goes straight to the village, the rest stopping on the highway 10 mins away from the village. Since 203 is infrequent, and 10 mins walk is really not much different, I took the first 2xx bus at the stop. I relied on google maps to know where to get off, but you can always tell the bus driver and sit near him. It is not a popular stop so it is possible for buses to go pass it without stopping if you don't indicate in advance. Btw, I got a prepaid sim card with 1 gig data plan for 30,000 at Busan Gimhae airport. After you get off the bus, it mat seem strange as it is on a busy highway intersection. But there is a strange scuplture nearby that will confirm you got off the stop. Turn to the north, there is a small walking path beside the road, with a train track running nearby. You will even pass by a small train station along the way. Just follow the path all the way, and after passing under a small bridge, you will see a carpark. Note that near the guardhouse of the carpark is the stop for 203. There is an obvious modern building - head towards it. There is an information booth here, and a toilet. Follow the English signs telling you where to buy tickets. There are toilets in the village near the major sites so not to worry. At the ticket booth, ask for an English brochure (or Chinese, or Japanese). You will be informed which houses are open for visiting, but even these are open only up to the courtyard. You can't go into the buildings.With the map in hand, you can start exploring. In addition, there is a website that suggests routes that you could take. See link to attraction website.In general, be mindful that people are living in these houses. You would not want people poking into your house, would you? But if they really don't want you near they will block it with chairs or sticks, and certainly don't go near barking dogs.For lunch, the restaurants are generally on the right side of the road when you first enter the village past the ticket booth. I asked information booth and was told there will not be English menu. Eventually, I picked one restaurant with a sign outside listing the menu with price. So I chose the price not the food :p See picture below. I figured out later that the first item on the menu is lotus leaf rice set meal. The second is Bulgogi, kind of bbq beef. The third is basically lotus leaf rice plus Bulgogi combo. I chose the lotus leaf rice, it was good.If you really want to experience what it is like to sit in an old building, check out the Suunjeong Pavilion on the far left-bottom of the map. It's a pavilion perched on a small hill. I was able to sit on the verandah and enjoy the breeze. Also, on the map you will see the Seongjubong peak on the right side. The climb is about 15 to 20 mins, and not too steep. You will be rewarded with a view of the village and the surrounding area. The path up is not obvious. From the Ganghakdang village school, head south a few metres until you are forced to descend to the right. Instead, turn left and you will see a small vegetable patch and forest beyond. Get up and there is a sign to the left pointing to the start of the upward hike, but only in hangul.oh yes, at the modern building when you come in, check with the information counter the schedule for 203. I didn't bother and walked out again to take the other buses, but it turned out options are fewer as only 200, 201 and 202 stops at the bus stop (on the opposite side of the road) on the way back to Gyeongju. I was there from 9am to 4.30pm, and visited most of the village. I find the sunset particularly beautiful."
Real ancient village,"There are many ancient style village houses, and still with residents living there. Gives a grimps of traditional Korean life."
It is Chosun's traditional village,"This village is little far from Gyeongju downtown. I drove my car about 3-~40 minutes from Gyeongju downtown. There are some bus. Pohang is also very near from this village so It is better to visit this place when you go to pohang. Actully I imagine some ancient silla's history(because every historic place in gyeongju is from silla...) but it is wrong. This place is Chosun's village and family village which 'Son family' from Walsung and 'Lee family' from Yugang live. Both of family are yangban, nobleman. I can feel that yangban's atmosphere in this village with several blue roof tile house. There are museum in front of entrance. In musuem, diorama of house show the architecture of that traditional house. It is very important place because in village, it is not easy to enter the house. Most of house has owner. That is private place. There are real villagers in traditional house. It is just village. So I recommend just enjoy the atmosphere. If you are interested in Korea's traditional house, you can enjoy more better time. There are several recommended course. Each course take 1~2hr. Although I'm Korean, It is not easy to see the real historic traditional village that people living. maybe here.. and Andong city..?  and other things.. Several lutus pond is very good place to see. There are some Korean restaurant also. I'm sorry that there is no traditional cafe yet. I mean some place with teaism. Some cafe serving the coffee, green tea, plum tea.. etc(several tea korean usually drink) in plastic cup and straw. I recommend if you feel the Korea's traditional atmosphere. It is the best place to feel that. It is the real one. not just in traditional center or museum."
Like the shire in Lord of the Rings.,This was a great find. We thoroughly enjoyed walking around the village looking at the gardens and homes and felt that were in a scene from Lord of the Rings. Would recommend Yangdong over HaHoe.
a bit hard to get to,"We found getting to Yangdong by bus from Gyeongju a little complicated because of the general infrequency of buses to the village. We definitely checked with the visitor's center about when return buses arrived, so we weren't stranded! The village itself is very serene. In good weather, it was very nice to stroll through the fairly large area. You will really feel transported back in time if you ignore the cars and other modern appliances. Someone from the visitor's center gave us a brief explanation of the village's history that was quite interesting. The map we received was difficult to follow, but if you follow the signs throughout the village instead, you should be able to make your way to the different important buildings. This was a very peaceful trip (besides catching the bus) and, on the whole, a unique experience. "
good,Old rural village.English translator interpreted as do not know of all the questions in English not answer I'm gonna. I'm sorry.
Wonderful place for a heritage visit,"Quite a fair bit of walking as you seek out the historical houses or sites shown in the map. However as the villages are still staying there, some places are out of bounds. Happened to me on one important site and is rather disappointing. The place is popular with young school children doing field trips and I've seen at least 2 or 3 groups there. I do wonder how will the village cope when more people seek out this place and start trampling into their houses. When I checked with the tourist info center on the return bus timing, she noted that I am a tourist and volunteered to explain the history of the village to me as I waited for the bus. In all, I'm glad I made this trip."
Immerse in Korean architectural history...,"Am lucky not to wait long for bus no. 203. The bus stopped by Gyeongju Intercity Bus Terminal at 1034hrs and reached Yangdong at 1117hrs. The tourist info centre provides a simple map and told me the must-visit houses and recommend the path to cover them in sequence. Maybe because my visit falls on a weekday, I did not see any villagers. You could see the interior of the houses although you are not allowed to step onto the actual buildings because people are still living in these houses after all. Would be even better to have more explanations of the usage of these rooms displayed for better appreciation. Ended my visit by having a simple lunch in a cafeteria, located just near the entrance of the village. This cafeteria is run by a 70-year old lady and had the simple menu written in Korean."
Our favourite in Gyeongju,"The village is abour 30-40 mins away from Gyeongju city by car. We didn't go by bus but would imagine the inconvenience like the previous reviewer said. Other than that, it is our favourite site in Gyeongju. There is no entrance fee as such.We love the traditional houses and the raw side of the village. There are people living in the village so the houses are not open to anyone. We went into one which sells home made fruit juice and looked at the well they use to get the water. We could see somebody actually sleeping in the house with the fan on.There is no restaurant for people to sit down, people seemed to drive here and spent a couple of hours and left. if you come to Gyeongju for the heritage, then this is one place you should go."
Generally disappointed with visit,"If catching the public bus, bus 203 goes directly into the village. However, bus 203's frequency is once every 50 minutes or so. Whereas the other 200's buses are much more frequent, but you do ha ve to walk about 15 minutes to reach village.Was generally disappointed with the visit. All the important historic houses were closed and cannot be entered. While Suwon's touristy folk village is not the real thing, seeing the insides of the buildings gives a much better perspective of how the different classes lives in the Jeoson era. If the Korean government wishes to protect its important cultural assets from vandalism, visual dispaly showing the interior design, pictures, and videos of hte interiors of selected houses would be helpful."
