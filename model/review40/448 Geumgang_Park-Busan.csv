Only for hikers,"The cable cars take you up to a picnic area and a bunch of hiking trails.The cars doesnt go at set times either and if you are unlucky you may find yourself waiting for a long time before the cars move.I had to wait 30 minutes before a couple of locals appeared and made the staff start the car. If they hadn't told the staff off we would've still be sitting in that car. The only people we encountered at the top were hikers. going to the south gate is basically going through small forest trails and is not suitable if you are wearing clothing for urban walking. I had sneakers, jeans and a t.shirt and regretted that walk. The south gate is not even close to the cable cars and its basically just a gate. so unless you want to go on a longer hike and wear clothing sutied for hiking then do not go here."
Cable car ride,"Take the cable car from Geumgang Park for some breath taking views on Busan and its surroundings. The ride in itself is unforgettable, but when you reach the top it's only a short walk to the Geumjeongsanseong fortifications. The walk is nice and quite easy. Lovely!"
Nice view,"The ride offers spectacular views of Busan. Once at the top it's hiking time. You can go to Seokbulsa (unfortunately it was late and the air was bad) or to the mountain fortress, which is not very demanding. It closes at 6 so don't go too late in the afternoon. Park entrance is 10 min walk from Oncheonjang station"
Go for the views only,The cable car ride offers a fantastic view of Busan and how the city is laid out.Signages at the top are not sufficient and can be confusing for an English speaker.The South Gate is nothing monumental but okay for a little stroll.Go for the view but definitely purchase round trip tickets for the cable car.On saying that I have come across many Korean hikers along the way so this might be good for those who are into trekking.
Great start to a beautiful walk,"Convenient to the Myeongyun metro station. Catch the cable car up to the top, then you have a variety of choices for beautiful walks including to the Seokbul-sa monastery with its beautiful cliff rock carvings. Park provides free insect repellent spray but we weren't bothered by any insects at all."
NOT WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBLE ,Even though you are told otherwise the cable car is only accessible via two flights of stairs and a really steep hill from the car parkDo not attempt unless you can walk 
NOT a must see!,"We got promised amazing views but there weren't any! The so called ""observatory"" is a nice picknick area with tables etc. but it is within a clearing. So you haven't any views over Busan at all - just trees around you. If you love hiking this park is perfect for it but do not expect great views over the city - or only when using the cable car! "
More a hikers place than a tourist attraction really..,"Appears to be some great hikes around here. . but if you're a tourist and you go up a cable car you sort of expect great views back down . . not really the case here apart from of tiny bit of the city from the cable car. . . once you get up there its woods, muddy walks and the occasional brick gate . . also some screeching karaok-ing Koreans half way up which was beyond odd. . . . its a long way out of town for it to be a 'must do' for a weekend tourist....."
Great for hiking/walking,"This is a lovely park both winter and summer. If you are a hiker it's a good hike up to the fortress with walking trail around the fortress wall. Or you can take the cable car to the top and walk as far as you want. The cable car is 8,000kw return and provides a great view, on a clear day, of Gwangan Bridge. To get there take Metro Line 1 to Oncheonjang station. Take exit 1, turn left and then right at the next main intersection. Follow the brown signs to the park. You can see the cable car from the metro exit. Well worth a visit."
"Great ""skyline views"" from the cable car","Came here not for the park but to take the cable car to the top of Geumjeong Mountain where there's the ""much-talked-about"" Seokbulsa Temple with giant rock carvings of Buddha; as it turned out though, I actually came here for the great views of the pretty tall 20-to-40-storied buildings of the city which are ""spread out all over the city"" (not just concentrated in one area of the city as is the case in some big cities), and yes the big mountains beyond the city provide an excellent ""nature backdrop"" to make these aerial scenes from the cable car ""absolutely memorable""! Being said that though, despite those great views from the cable car (as mentioned above), there's ""nothing much"" on top of the mountain itself, and I wasn't able to find the temple I came for; I'm sure I got ""pretty close"" to it (maybe just like 5 minutes from the temple) following the signs & asking people on the trails, going past the popular South Gate (about a 20-minute walk from the cable car station on the top) where I made like a U-turn and walked another 10 minutes to Nammun Village but gave up after another 5 minutes or so when getting to like two ""pretty steep steps"" leading downward since I wasn't sure I would be able to come back up those steps; also, I was ""pressed for time"" with the last cable car to go down the mountain leaving at 6 30 pm and it takes like 45 minutes to get back to the cable car station from that temple (Seokbulsa) with the rock carvings (yes ""the 6 30 pm for the last cable car going down"" is everyone coming up the mountain should keep in mind, whether you're going to Seokbulsa or not, since I'm sure it would take much much longer to go back down on foot compared to only like a little over 5 minutes with the cable car either uphill or downhill).If coming from Busan Station (after arriving by train), it's quite convenient to get here by taking the subway Line 1 from Busan Metro Station (right beside the train station) to Oncheonjang Station from which it's about a 20-minute walk: a left turn after getting out of the station from its front side & going on the overpass, then a right turn about 5 minutes later followed by a pretty much straight way (which becomes slightly uphill) for about 10 to 15 minutes, then a right turn again and you'll see the park on your left shortly after. About the park itself though, there's really nothing much to say except there are some nice flower beds right outside the entrance, and there's a playground or a mini-theme park with some rides (probably just for kids) inside not far from the cable car station."
Very old Cable car.,"This is a old theme park, you can try their cable car. You can find lots of old games inside and nice food around the park. "
Lovely views and trails.,"It's well worth making your way over here from central Busan and walking through the shops and restaurants to the foot of this mountain park. The ride up in the gondola is great and gives you a lovely view over the city. The only negative point was that the directions at the top are not great, making it difficult to find things if unfamiliar with the area. Still, it was a peaceful walk away from the city so was still fun."
I love nature☘,ที่นี่วิวสวย บรรยากาศดี ธรรมชาติของแท้..จุดเด่นที่นี่คือ cable car ..a cable car coming up the mountain. Can see view city of busan spread out in the distance. 
Beautiful views,"Spent a whole day here after reaching Mount Geumjeongsan via cable car we then hiked up the mountain via South Gate which was pretty hard work especially getting back down as some of the slopes are very slippery and steep.I wouldn't recommend the hike for young children but you can ride the cable car up and walk around the park area.We took a photo of the mountain map with the gates written in english and hangul on our phone which saved us from becoming too lost as alot of the signs along the way didn't have english on them.Views from the cable car are stunning.Take subway line 1 to Oncheongjang station exit 1 and turn left and walk straight then turn right at main street and keep walking(there are signs showing the way to park).Walk takes about 15-20mins to get to park entrance,follow signs to ""rope way"" which is the cable car station."
The kids loved the cable car.,"This is a great park to take the kids. Besides the cable car, there is a museum, an amusement park, a grass oval to have a picnic on, and lots of clean public toilets. The pathway to the cable car is sealed and is very easy and comfortable to trek. Another bonus is the pathway is tree lined. Just take some mosquito repellant as there were a few of them when I went in September. The cable car itself is awesome. Children under 24 months ride for free. My two and four year old loved looking down into the trees and the view in general. You can see all the way to Haeundae and Gwangali. At the top of the mountain there are tracks you can take, or like we did, you can sit and have an ice cream, whilst enjoying the fresh breeze and views. "
Best day in Busan,"A really nice steep walk up this hill - maekolli and padjeon available at the top, cooked by a little old lady and tasted amazing. Best padjeon I had in Busan. Lovely views from the top. Takes about 1-2 hours to get to the top. Can carry onto a nearby temple, or go to the oldest spa in Korea - in Oncheonjang (on way back to the metro station)."
I LOVE THIS PLACE. NO. 2 BEST PLACE I VISITED DURING MY STAY,"We read about this place and we were excited to ride the cable car. It wasn't crowded at all this place ! We (4 of us) were in the cable car with 2 other locals. The view was amazing ! There are many places once we reached the peak of the cable car ride but we did not explore all. The walk in the forest is so peaceful and quiet and we spent a lot of time taking photos near the beautiful trees. It was the end of autumn when I visited this place. If I am planning to visit Busan again, I would definitely visit this beautiful place. We took a cab from Oncheonjang subway cause we are not sure of how to get to Geumgang Park. A must to visit if you are visiting Busan !"
Nice view from cable car,It was quite a walking distance from Oncheonjang MRT station. You are able to watch nice Busan view from the cable car. There are few temples around the park and please spend some time taking fresh air here.
worth the walk,"Ask for directions at Oncheonjang station information center. They have a map available. The walk is pretty far, but worth it. And don't forget to visit the Busan Marine Natural History Museum nearby."
perfect,"amazing, perfect view of busan if u go to the tower and also CHEAP !!!! gooooooo !! u shoul go there yes or yes ...... just be careful to not to get lost ..... the signs are not too clear for foreigners"
great view of Busan from far,"as opposed to Busan Tower, where you're in the middle of Busan, from the cable car ride up to Geumgang Park, you will see Busan from afar. Loved the short hike up and the scenary :)If you take the City tour, the ride up via the cable car will be cheaper. Try to stand on the side facing outwards so you get to take some nice pictures, if not the cable car can be pretty packed...."
Ropeway to the trail head leading to Geumjeongsan,"Take a subway train to line 1 north Oncheonjang station Exit 3 across the road to the other side via overhead pedestrian bridge. From here you need to navigate yourself to the foot of the mountain range which could be seen from far with red ropeway rig sticking on it. I suggest you browse the google map for the street view that could lead to the park, cause there are roads that run into dead ends. About 1.5km walk you arrive at Geumgang park marked by four giant Chinese characters of the same meaning. There is nothing much in the park, people come here to take the ropeway to the top of the mountain where you can start to hike. The ropeway ticket is 7,000won return, once at the top you can then start to walk to the ancient mountain fortress of which you will see it's south gate first. Snow had accumulated on the mountain while we were here at just 800m high. The scenery along the fortress with snow cover is just breathtaking. The end of the fortress (the north gate) is some 6 subway station away to the north. Due to the cold we were unable to traverse the mountain range, instead we went back down took the subway train went north to the Beomeosa station went up the mountain again try to reach the north gate. we were unable to make it cause it was getting dark. In Busan here it is interesting, you can actually traverse the mountain ranges by shuffling underground. I will surely be back to walk through the whole mountain range one day."
It's For Hikers or Those Willing To Walk (Really) Far,"This park features fortress gates where one will have to hike to. At the entrance of the park just before the cable car ride entrance (which for us is the highlight of this park) is a walking trail where one can see many interesting things. There is a small rabbit and rooster enclosure (not exactly a farm) with a pond where one can sit around and enjoy the breeze. This is basically a hike park where lots of locals come to jog, walk, exercise and hike.The cable car ride took about 5 mins where view of the entire Busan city can be sighted on its way up and down. On arrival at the top, if one is not willing or ready to take a long hike then there is nothing to do except to sit around and enjoy the breeze. We didn't do the hike as my 5yrs old was not up for it.No entrance fee to the park. Cable car ride cost about W6000 for adult. Getting there was a bit of a challenge for us, we had to walk really far from the bus ride taken from the MTR station."
A beautiful surprise,Took the cable car to the top. Beautiful! Great views and lots of walking. Bring mosquito repellant. ...
Cute park,There are tons of cute things around the main entrance (it's Korea) and you can have a good walk leading into an intense hike (leaving the park) from here too
Great City View and Excellent Hike,"Take the cable car from the Geumgang park and you will get to enjoy a superb view of Busan. It's quite a long and high ride (better than the cable ride to N Seoul Tower). From the stop at the peak, you can hike to the 4 gates of Geumjeong Fotress. The most accessible one is South Gate (Na-mun) which is about 30 minutes walk/hike. On the way to the South Gate, drop by and visting the Hyujeongam Temple too."
Hyujeongam - Nice temple,Hyujeongam has nice Bodhisattva statues. The park is a nice area to go hiking around and has a cable car.
