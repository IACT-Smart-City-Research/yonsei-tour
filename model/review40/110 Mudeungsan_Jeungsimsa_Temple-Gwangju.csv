"Quiet, calm amongst a busy national park","We came on a Friday and although the hiking trails were full, the temple was mostly empty. It was very quiet and a nice way to take a break from hiking. The temple is pretty, well restored and set against Mudeungsan."
Worth the climb up,Had a good climb up the mountain to this tranquil temple with a fabulous view. I'd recommend you make it one of your stop if you are climbing the mountain anyway.
Great.,Well this temple is also one of peaceful area. You can walk along the temple and feel the peace. Well maintained and clean.
Less touristy than other temples in South Korea,We visited in April 2017 when there were less tourists and the temple was decorated with colourful lanterns in celebration of Buddha's birthday. It's a peaceful place just a short walk up from the beginning of the Mudeungsan walking trail and worth a stop on your way up.
Easy Walk from Park Entrance,"Arrive to the national park by bus (54 or others) or taxi from the city center (5 USD). Pick up food next to the parking lot - rice rolls, snacks, hard boiled eggs, or full service restaurants) and then start the walk to this temple. The road is paved the whole way and any age can arrive in about 15 minutes. There are longer more difficult hikes to many other temples in the park also. Enjoy!"
Well maintained,"A lot of temples in Korea look alike. That said, this one was well maintained and not very popular despite being beautiful. Stop by for a moment of peace. The monks here were rather friendly, perhaps because they donâ€™t get as many tourists as the other temples we have been to do."
