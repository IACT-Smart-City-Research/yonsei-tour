The future of Korea,The unique scenery that is a combination of amazing skyscrapers and beautiful park and canal. The best place for relaxing. 
My First Trip to South Korea.,its a close walk from Holiday Inn hotel . and was busy with visitors and locals. it is one of the stops off the City Bus tour.
"A reflection of the quality of life in Songdo, Incheon","An integral part of Songdo, Central Park is a nice space for neighborhood residents and tourists alike. After a long day at the conference, we enjoyed strolling around the park to get some fresh air and interact with nature. It's quite enjoyable to watch families enjoy each other's company, lovers holding hands, and bike riders enjoying a leisurely ride. The best part is it's not as crowded as the parks in Seoul, where one has to compete for space! Central Park is a tangible reflection of the quality of life in Songdo."
Nice Park however....,"Nice Park however make sure you have Google maps turned on to figure out how to get from one side of the Park to the other, no signs!"
Luxurious stay,The hotel lobby welcomes you with a gorgeous granite lobby. The staff is courteous and efficient. The room is pretty luxurious with nice furniture and bed arrangements for different size of families. Our room had a king size bed and a twin bed that was a perfect set up for our family. Breakfast buffet is nice and includes local foods as well as Western foods with good coffee. There are nice restaurants just across the street and a Lotte Mart within a walking distance. The Central Park is also within the walking distance and you can walk through it to more restaurants and shops.
Songdo Central Park,"Songdo is such a beautiful place to visit, Central Park is so relaxing and the perfect place for walking or spending the day with the family, I recommend the boat rides or the bike rides, Songdo is a place to stay away from the crowds, if you are looking for a quiet area to visit."
A large park good for walking.,This park is large and has good walking tracks throughout. It is great for bird watching. There is a waterway that snakes through the park with many good looking bridges and various other features. It is very popular with locals and tourists alike. It is close to many Incheon hotels so is most accessible.
IF you like a bit of a walk - its nice,Its nice for a walk - safe - really nice for an eveing walk - so great light shows and great landscaping 
Clean and Neat,The park is very well kept. The equipment are functional such as the piano and the bells. There is a rabbit area and dear can also be found at the park. Lovely
Outdoor Recreation at Songdo Central Park,"My friends and I visited South Korea around mid to late April 2019. We went to Busan and Seoul for our trip but on the day before our last day in Seoul, we stayed at an airport hotel in Incheon and we tried to find something to do near Incheon before we depart from South Korea and we found a lot of interesting reviews both in Thai and English language about a city called Songdo and their Songdo Central Park. Without further ado, we catch a bus from our hotel and went to Songdo Central Park and the first thing we saw from this park was The Seoul Stop Boating Center. It is a boating center that have many water activities such as Kayak, Water Taxi, and Family Boat. We chose to do 2 activities from this boating center. First was Kayaking which cost 25,000 won per 50 minutes and we also went on a crystal paddle boat that cost 35,000 won per 30 minutes. The prices were a little bit too expensive in our opinion but when we went on a boat, we completely forget about the expensive price because the city was very beautiful. The park was clean and the scenic view of the new city was very gorgeous for us. We have a very fantastic time on our water activities and the water activities here are safe because there are some lifeguards on the Jet Ski ready for you. For the negative points, not only the prices were a little bit expensive for us but when we were there, the place was crowded and we needed to be very careful about other boats when we were on the water but there were less traffic after some distances away from the pier area. In our opinion, the city could not compare to Seoul or Busan. This city is a very new city and when we were there, it felt like we were living in a city of tomorrow. If you hungry or anything, there is a restaurant on the 2nd floor of the boating center. We ordered pork cutlets and fried chicken. The foods were okay and the prices were a little bit expensive for pork cutlet but for the price for fried chicken was very cheap. We would really recommend you to visit this park. It is a very good alternative destination to explore in South Korea, especially, when you stay near Incheon or near airport area because you can take a bus around 30 minutes to reach this park."
Best place to fly a drone!,"The only places to have a fun are Central Park and NC Cube Canal. But they are good enough for relaxation or to play activities such as a bicycle or drone. If you want to stay at the hotel, I will recommend Central Park view and it will be good for one night. 주변에 즐길만한 곳은 센트럴파크 공원과 NC 큐브 커넬 워크가 대부분인것 같습니다. 하지만 이 두 곳에서도 충분한 휴식과 적당한 놀이거리를 찾을 수 있습니다. 1박 정도를 추천드리며, 숙소는 센트럴파크 뷰가 좋습니다. 바다뷰는 벌판이라 밋밋할 수 있습니다."
Great park to have a walk in,Spen a good few hours here. Main reasonfor me to visit was that you are allowed to fly drones there. But be considerate of other people. The day itself i was the only one flying my drone. There are a few food stands and eating places. Plenty of benches. The farm was closed when i was there but looks nice for smaller children to hang out.
Pleasant,Not busy when we came in early April. A bit cold and windy but beautiful clear blue skies. Lovely park for a stroll. Not much to do. 
A great place to go on a Sunday afternoon,"I love coming here, especially in the spring and summer. You can rent bikes and ride along the trails (super easy), or you can rent a canoe and go canoeing on the lake. I don't particularly care for any of the enclosed animal exhibits, but if you come here in the spring you can see all of the beautiful cherry blossoms. Also, I highly recommend coming here at night and grab something to drink at Holly's Coffee and enjoy the beautiful nightscape. Definitely worth it!"
Close to the best hotel,"Very nice place for walk, even by rainy day, nice restaurants around. Around very modern skyscrapers but the place is quiet."
The heart of Songdo,"As someone that has lived in Songdo for a few years, I would definitely recommend Central Park to anyone visiting. It really is something special and different from anything else you will find in Korea. But really it is something that can't be missed! You can easily spend an afternoon or morning walking around. It provides great views of the skyline and even has a water taxi to get around. The park is small so you don't need to take the water taxi or boat unless you want to. There is an animal sanctuary with deer and rabbits that is perfect for kids. If you get hungry, there are a number of different coffee shops and restaurants around. The best time to go is during the fall and spring. In the fall there is amazing foliage and beautiful sunsets. In the spring there are cherry blossoms and other flowers that are worth viewing."
An engineering marvel,Songdo IFD and the city in general is a piece of art and the benchmark of a sustainable city. I love the urban planning and modern infra seen here. Great dining options as well. 
"Songdo Central Park, South Korea",I love this place. Here you will experience peace and just enjoy the modern architecture and nature's beauty. It's such a big contrast to the busy city of Seoul. We had a great walk around the area. And if you are hungry there are places to eat as well as a mall nearby. Definitely a nice park to visit as long as you have extra time to spare when visiting Korea.
Relaxing & Peaceful,It's a nice place to just relax and chill and enjoy the scenery and architecture or just take a nice walk. Also enjoyed the Water Taxi ride (although a short ride but it was nice).
Lovely relaxing walk,A lovely walk in a popular place for locals.Interesting local cultural buildings Beautiful morning reflections A deer park & rabbit island 
Peaceful,"I have never been to Songdo and my friend recommended me to visit as it’s changed a lot in recent years. As soon as I stepped into Central Park, it was so admirable - the view, the lights and the air - so much different than Seoul. I went during the evening so I got to appreciate the night view but will definitely come back again to visit during the day."
A relaxing peaceful park,This is not a large park. It has a man-made lake with a boat rides. You could walk around the park in 30 mins or so. Very peaceful and relaxing walk. There are few very well maintained public bathrooms around. you could rent bike and multi person bike to cruise around. 
Nice park with city view,"Great to chill and relax at this park. It has many facilities including jogging tracks, bicycle tracks and also plenty of spacious grass field to play around. "
large park with many activities to do,"It is a large park with many activities to do, such as cycling, jogging, walking, sailing, and many luxury hotels. There are many cafes in the garden. There is an international luxury restaurant. Not far from the metro. There is a place for you to take a lot of photos. Decorated with many kinds of trees. There is a shopping mall opposite the park."
Lovely,Excellent both morning and night. So many activities to meet your interest. Kayaking is also good. Must visit.
Beautiful and restful!,"I've lived in Incheon Songdo for couple of years and the Central Park is the first place I felt at home. It has beautiful landscape and walking/jogging paths; it's actually prettier than the Chicago parks I've used to walk and jog. On weekends, it's filled with young and old couples and families with children/teens. It's the dating place for picnics and photo taking. A sea-water stream is centered w/in the park; you can rent a boat/paddle-boat float around or take a water-car to take in the skyscraping buildings surrounding it. There are really good eateries around the Central Park. So you can enjoy an entire day at the Central Park."
good for walking,it is good to work and explore the park. it is not huge but well designed and have free wifi as well
"Amazing for family, couples, friends...","This park is beautifully built and when the weather is nice out, it’s the best place to go out for a jog, walk, or even canoeing. Yes, canoeing! They have party boats and canoes and even see-through couples’ canoes where you can see through the boat into the water. I live close by so I pass through the park all the time and it is just beautiful. It’s crazy how such a park is located in the middle of all these tall buildings and growing city. There’s even a small deer park and “bunny island”! So cute!"
Good place to exercise – or just go for a walk.,"The Central Park is well done and has a few attractions as a totem pole out of different masks, the Tri-bowl and some old Korean-style buildings."
Day Visit ,"Visited the Central Park by travelling on the Metro about 20 minutes from Incheon.The park is surrounded by some interesting buildings, has a waterway walk, an enclosure with some deer and a small island with rabbits and other small animals.This is a pleasant park and a nice spot to visit for a few hours to get away from the bustle of the big city."
the best place in songdo,"If you ever visit songdo for some business, you should spare some times to check out this amazing park. "
Great place to stroll and be outside,Nice to visit and a great place to look at from my high rise room in the Sheraton HotelGreat for walks and exercise.
An excellent peacefull place,"Central park in Songdo is really a fantastic, peaceful, highly cleaned, secure and well managed walking way. Lot's of greenery, flowering, unique plantations, botanically important plants, clean lake, boating, motor boats-speed boats ... makes it unique for visitors. It is open 24*7, any interested one can have a walk and relax at any time without any fear. During day hours boating is available and Sun-café for food/refreshment.. at the same time in night hours lighting on entire area, bridges makes it more attractive to walk around. After a long working time in office and businesses, hectic schedules and meetings one can get bore ... then central park is the perfect place to get nature fresh breath and relax the mind. "
"Nice and much needed, but not a tourist destination.","For whoever lives in Songdo of visits it for business, this is a much needed recreational area: running, walking (some people even rent boats to go along the short artificial water body in the center of the park. However, this is not a tourist destination in any way."
Amazing place,"It was a nice surprise to find a place like this in the middle of Incheon. It's a huge and a really beautiful place. The sculptures, the landscape, the quiet lake... amazing. There's some places inside the park to have a drink or to eat something, it's quite expensive but it's really nice. The only think that I think is wrong is the fact that the park has cages with deers and rabbits. I think is not a good place for that kind of animals. Every animal must be free. "
Lovely!,"Vast and clean and a lovely, safe place to cycle or walk away an afternoon or early morning. There's an interesting marina in the park!"
Serenity in the City,Great place to walk around the well manicured paths. There are restaurants for dining as well boat rentals! Truly a serene place in the middle of the city! 
Easy walk around,"The place is not too big to explore. Lots of nice areas for photo ops from the Tri-bowl , to the lake and the beautiful buildings that surrounds the park. A hanok resto can also be found here. The tourist info office is manned by helpful people , there's even a cafe inside the tourist center. . "
Awesome park - perfect for long walks or quick runs ,Enjoy to run there every time when I am staying at a hotel in the area. Also very nice views during the night. 
"Clean, beautiful and full of activity!","After getting done visiting G tower/ifez building, I walked along this park. I was amazed at the beauty of Central Park at Songdo! They have a man made lake, lots of little boats to rent, some bicycles to rent, lots of trees and places to do a picnic in, and you're surrounded by beautiful buildings, restaurants and shops that you can visit! I recommend visiting this place if you have some time in Incheon or Songdo!"
Refreshing Design,"Smack in the midst of this brand new green city - only recently reclaimed from the Yellow Sea - is this intelligently designed Park... Delicately intertwined within Manhattan style skyscrapers, lots of cultural and practicalities, a highly recommended healthy stop if ever opportuned to be in the area"
Take a stroll there!,"However, in this current season of heat, I would recommend taking a stroll there in the early morning or late evening. It was a relaxing oasis amidst the urban density of modern Incheon!"
love it,went only once and I enjoyed walking. great time to relax and unwind. the place is very clean and over all great!
Nice for a walk,"If you want to escape the busy life in Seoul, this is a great place to go for a walk. This area seems to be a hidden gem and well worth a visit. "
Quaint place in the bustle of a Seoul suburb,Songdo is a suburb of incheon which is a suburb of Seoul. In spite of that Songdo is really busy. This place is so relaxing.
Magic From Nothing,"This completely manufactured Park, somehow manages to transcend the fakery, by making the fakery pretty good. The various vertical gardens verge on impressive. This park makes for a pleasant hike on an erstwhile sea of gray commercial buildings. "
Stayed in the city of the future. Loved it.,"Stayed in the Orakai Hotel across the street from Central park. Easy walk to museums restaraunts,Lotte market place and convention center. Short taxi ride to Incheon city and Korean War memorial park. Sangdo is still being built, some large buildings are completed but not in use. Other buildings and large construction projects still being built. Short cab ride to great shopping mall. Very very interesting architecture in high rise buildings. Subway and bus service in easy and convenient. (Taxis were the cleanest I have ever seen. Drivers were always professional and courteous.) Best Of Luck SANGDO."
Awesome place and beautiful park!,"Songdo Central Park is one of the highlights of Songdo. Designed to be similar to parks around the world, it gets the best of each one and puts it into one. I definitely recommend checking it out. "
Enjoyable neat and large park with running trail,This is not far from Holiday Inn at Songdo and from other major shops and hotels. A pleasent walking track with serious joggers.
Enjoyable walk,Interesting what can be done when building a new high-tech city from the ground up. Plenty to look at and a Lotte Mart and interesting hotel and walking
A beautiful experience,"Visiting Incheon implies going into its Central Park. We have visited it by night and by day, and every time there is a little bit more to discover... With its square shape (we've been told that it has been inspired from the one of the Central Park in New York), it has several attractions, from the spots with animals (rabbits in one place, deer in another, fish in the lake) - great for children - to several buildings of interest (museums), as well as traditional buildings (the restaurants in the center of the park, for example) and also traditional bridges over the water. Little boats and hydro-bycicles on the lake are also enjoyable. As a plus, a lot of the important buildings of Incheon (hotels, for example) are placed around the park. By the way, taking a hotel room with a view towards the park is also great. So, even if you have just a quarter of an hour or (even better) 3 to 4 hours to spend, you should definitely take a walk in the park... and leave a little bit your worries aside. It's worth it..."
A walk in the Park,"A very beautiful park in the middle of a new city. Well maintained, clean and spacious creating a place to walk and relax or to short cut from one side of the city to the other. "
Lovely park with animals,We enjoyed walking around Songdo Park after breakfast it was quiet and pleasant. There are restaurants and a small deer park. Nice space among the mega high rise of Incheon.
Beautiful ,I visited here on a cold November day and it was so beautiful to walk around. There are some lovely sculptures. I would love to have been here a few weeks earlier when the leaves were on the trees I would think the colours to have been beautiful. I did this visit through the Transit Tours at Incheon Airport and would highly recommend them.
To stroll around Leisurely.... ,"Nice new park with many features to enjoy it and have a nice time , a channel and boats to traverse it , amazing new buildings , great architecture! Plus the Korean style hotel , hall and restaurant ‘s mall for contrasting .......beautiful autumn foliage in brown , read , yellow. Also opposite you have a street full of restaurants one side and food court the other ."
Pleasant,"I stayed in the Holiday inn Songdo Incheon, which is right next to Songdo Central Park. It is a really well maintained park and on sundays it is quite busy.It is worth a visit on a sunny day, I garantee you can take lots of amazing pictures and if you go there during autumn the scenery is even more amazing. You can hire kayaks and paddle boats, there is a food court there as well. "
Nice modern park to visit if you have time...,"This is a decent spot to visit if you are in the area or if you have a long layover at ICN. i probably wouldn't purposely visit here as my sole agenda. The park is nice, clean and very modern, surrounded by a lot of skyscrappers but can be a tad too windy."
Nice if you have time,"Taxi ride from airport island back across that amazingly long lit up bridge was about 20 minutes but cost 45,000 wan (it is 5500 each way for toll fee and I think this was included)... actually managed to get the return taxi fare for half the price as he used the taxi meter instead of a flat rate. The lights were pretty all around the area of the park, but I wouldn’t likely go there again. It took some time to find a return taxi & the subway ride would have been over an hour"
Beautiful Park in Incheon,Walked around this beautifullly maintained park every day while staying at the Sheraton Grand Incheon Hotel across the street. Came across a lot of people just strolling in the park.
Very nice walk,"Clean, friendly, and full of couples walking the park with children and dogs. If you get a chance visit rabbit island and take a boat ride, very cute."
Nice spot ,We enjoyed walking at Central Park. We stayed at a hotel nearby and we loved this amazing spot. We will definitely come back 
Nace park with lot of greens and rabbits.,"Get a boat and see the park from the river before you get in to the park. Nice way of spending youf afternoon or evening, specially if you are tired with the busy city."
Great park,This is a great park to take in the sights and have a little walk. Tons of modern buildings surrounding the area but the park itself is nice and green. There's a lake as well as the tri bowl which is a must visit!
A beautiful modern park,This park is just next to the metro station (Central Park station) and you would find it quite enjoyable to walk in this park. You would find the Tri-bowl (one of attractions in Incheon) near the entrance of the park and the striking G-Tower about 100m away from the Tri-bowl. 
Nice park for a stroll,Very nice park for a walk. Located centrally in the city. Boat ride from the east boat house is really nice. Several deers present in the park.
Fun times in Songdo Central Park ,"An enjoyable oasis amidst the buildings in Songdo. Great place to bike, walk or just relax...You can also kayak, paddle boat or ride a small cruise ship."
Just a park,Just a park with man made river. A good place to jog and just to relax. You can ride a paddle boat to cross the man made river.
Piece of heaven,"I totally love this place for resting, walking, talking with friends. During my stay in South Korea, I went here many times. Awesome architecture, flowers, peace around you. Totally come here for picnic with friends. And come here even during the night! "
Leisure Park in mid of the city,"Incheon is a modern city and you could enjoy full of relaxation. The hotel I booked was just next to the Park. I was induced to visit this city after seeing the beautiful scenery from internet photos. I enjoyed the walk in the Park and so envy the residents here could seize the day here for leisure walk, exercise, play with their dogs or even just sit down still on the bench. You could feel the quality of life to live here with the Park."
"One of the hot spots, South Korea","Songdo Central Park is a clean and dynamic place where the citizens of Incheon and many domestic and foreign travellers visit. You could enjoy riding a water taxi, canoe and cycles at the park. You can also see cute rabbits and deers who live there. In particular, the park is located at the centre of the area, named Songdo International Business District. 6 good and reasonable hotels are located at the district, such as Oakwood, Gyeongwonjae, Sheraton, etc. Also, there are numerous good restaurants so you can enjoy various foods including Korean, Italian and Chinese. "
A nice park in Songdo,"A beautiful park,with lake,little cafe and a lot of green for a great time in relax.Everything in middle of the big palace of songdo"
Walk after a day in the office,"I was staying at the Holiday Inn, Incheon, and wanted to go for something to eat. Fortunately, Songdo Central Park was close by, and that was the most direct route to the many restaurants in Incheon. The park is not natural at all - 100% man-made, sculptured from a desert of reclaimed land that now forms the new city of Incheon. There is a waterway (hard to call a lake, to be true) that runs from one end to the other, which is continuously cleaned by small barges. Boats are also available for hire, to row or paddle along the waterway. There are all sorts of sculptures, monuments, and historical replica buildings throughout. One of the main features is the ""Three Rice Bowls"" concert arena, which logically looks like three huge rice bowls!The park is pet friendly, and for my week in Incheon, it was quickly became a favourite place for some walking exercise after a hard day in the office."
Nice spot for leisure,"This place has several type of attraction where you can enjoy water-sport above the river, feel the traditional korean village, doing some biking or just walk-around.The atmosphere is extremely nice and joyful. If you are lucky, you will probably see Song-triplets or baby Daebak "
Beautiful Park in a quiet town,"I biked through here on sunset, and this park is gorgeous. A wall of high rises surround the park, giving it the futuristic feel that Korea emits, and while seemingly ""natural"", the caged deer and island of rabbits truly represents how manufactured this place is. Regardless, the park at sunset is absolutely stunning and a well deserved centerpiece to Songdo."
Gorgeous park.,"My flight back to the U.S. didn't depart until late afternoon, so with my morning free, I spent a couple of hours walking around this beautiful park. I arrived at the park at 7:30AM on a Monday morning. Even after walking around the park for two hours, I don't think I saw more than a total of 20 people. It was like having my own personal park. I was excited to see my first ever Korean Magpie and Oriental Turtle Dove. If you have the time, I highly recommend that you stroll through this wonderful gem. "
nice park to explore,"This park is an oasis in the middle of the City. Nice walking trails throughout, lots of activities located in the park including a concert hall and small museum. Plus you can rent a paddle boat or canoe etc to row around the lake. There is also a commercial sightseeing boat. They have a small zoo like area with deer and a few other animals as well. It is close to the hotels and shopping mall"
nice relaxing place,"beautiful place for relax, walking with family orr friends, nice view around, water, bridges, restaurants"
Fantastic,Sondgo Central Park is simply fantastic. You can visit it to have a relaxing time. Good for sporting and oitdoor activities. Highly recommended
Nice Park in Central Location,Songdo Central Park is a nice place to walk around either before or after eating at one of the nearby restaurants or shopping.The boats and canoes look fun and you can rent bikes. A must visit if you're in the Songdo area.
Looking for a quite getaway outside Seoul?,"Songdo Central Park has a scenic view, amazing architectural structures, and water taxi tour in the man-made river. In addition, you'll see rabbits and deer in the park too! It's nice to connect with nature in Songdo Central park. It's a nice break away from Seoul's busy life. How to get there: Songdo Central Park is accessible by subway. If you are coming from downtown Seoul, it will take approximately 2 hours to get there. By subway: Take line 1 from Seoul Station. Get off at Bupyeong Station. Transfer to Incheon Line subway. Take the train going to the International Business District direction. Get off at the University of Incheon Station. Go to exit 4. From Exit 4, you'll have to walk for 12 minutes/790 meters to get to the Central Park."
Place to stroll or jog,"Songdo is pretty sterile city with bedroom communities and hitech companies. Travel to the capital city Seoul is not too convenient either. Any spare time here may be unbearable solitary confinement. Central Park may provide some relief in terms of exercise and/or pastime. It is relatively large park with well-appointed scenic gardening and walking paths. All around you see high rise office and residential buildings. Then, across the street, there is a shopping mall with cafeteria food court. It will help you fill some of free time."
Get some air in SongDo,"Central Park in SongDo is an artificial landscape. Apart from the river-shaped lake with small cruisers, one can enjoy running or cycling on the marked 3km tracks surrounding the waters. Attractive for the many young families in SongDo International City are the deers and rabbits. The latter enjoy living on a small island away from the main track. There are pagoda-style resting places, some exercising stations, and every once in a while the meadow on N-side is used for an open air arts exhibition. If you want a two-some time take a paddle boat from the cafe near Sheraton hotel."
Songdo Central Park - recommend to visit!,"Highly recommend to walk through the Central Park. Great place to go through, to view the nature, the river, great architecture nearby, and to see the authentic Korean Village. Visit the Korean Restaurant near the park."
Huge open space with man made river,"It is a huge park for walk, jogging and leisure stroll with boating options. Would be nice to more green cover"
Good experience and boat ride,Nice place to take a boat ride which was about a dollar per minute for a 5 person powered boat. Rabbit island has cute rabbits. The park is nice for little kids. Overall fun experience 
Good place for a relaxed walk,"I've been to this park whenever I visit this area for business. The park is not too big, but lots of open space and some landscaping. It's a good place for a relaxed walk or jog. My most recent visit was during early spring, so most of the vegetation were still barren, but in late spring the vegetation would look much nicer.A great place to visit if you happen to be nearby."
Clear Park,"Great place for walk or run. Nice location, not too far from Incheon International Airport. Beautiful scenery."
Nice for stoll after dinner,"Relative small park, but nice for a stroll after dinner or to take a coffee. Probably too small to go jogging ""in the park"". Wouldn't plan it as a trip, but if you're in the neighborhood can't hurt to visit. "
Beautiful and clean park,"Great layout and well planned. Very clean and surrounded by the CBD. Very picturesque. Especially during night time, it has a great backdrop of the beautiful lit up buildings"
Quite and beautiful ,"Great place for contemplation walk or a run. Safe and beautiful. The morning I went there, the water was so still and the building were reflected. Conveniently located across from the hotel I was staying at."
Great park to enjoy with family,"This is a great park in the hearth of Songdo, a new development area in Incheon. It is a large park with a big lake perfect to enjoy with kids. You can rent bicycles, small boats and visit a small area with tradicional korean houses. Great sky line and easy to access by metro. Perfect for a day visit. Holiday inn, hilton and central park hotel are very near to the park. "
Ok in Winter," I went through the park end of winter, start of Spring in the night. The size of the park is limited, but the atmosphere is good. Lots of nice cafes and restaurants around. If you are around the area during that period of the year go there but no need to go there long distance "
Niceplace to stretch your legs,I was in the area on business and wanted to get out of the hotel room for some air and to take a walk. The park which was across the street from my hotel is just the right size for a medium walk with nice trail and bridges. Is is very easy to access and there are restaurants and coffee shops at the entrance. The second floor restaurant offers alfresco dinning (in season) with a great view of the park and the building in the area. Nice place to grab a beer and relax. You can even rent electric power boat to take a ride around the pond. Central Park Songdo is great little place to get out of and get some air.
"It's beautiful, an oasis of nature in an urban area","It is lovely for a leisurely walk if I'm Songdo. There are boat houses on either end, the entry is free and it's open at all times but best time to be there is mornings or afternoon. There are rabbits and deer at one end and children can feed the deer but the rabbits can just be seen on a near by island. Many sculptures and fountains, there's a piano which plays automatically and stops when keys are touched.It's a beautiful park, well designed and maintained, clean and lovely. There is also an open air gym and books for children in glass booths.Amazing experience. Everything a park should be!"
Nice place for a walk,"I really recommend this park if you are looking for some chilly, cool stay for a while. Nothing so great."
Pictureque landscape,"I like this Songdo-Dong very much, not just because of the picturesque landscape, but also the plants are mostly well cut into a very attractive forms and shapes, making it a wondrful experience to stroll along the whole park. It was very quiet and enjoyful to walk in the park too, especially during the morning hours.優閒散步好去處!園内樹木參天,绿樹林蔭;有些甚至古木參天,形狀奇特及植物種類繁多,既雅觀又吸引,並且從松烏公園可遠眺市内建築,真的從繁囂中走到恬静,真的值得挨薦。"
Lovely park,Well designed park and has been well maintained. My husband and I walked through the park in the morning while it was still fairly quite. There are good amenities around the park and we recommend a walk through the park to escape the hustle and bustle of the city. 
Nice place to have a date,"You can tell it is newly built, everything looks clean. When I went in October they also had the LED rose garden (the same ones that are at the DDP Museum in seoul) It is a nice place to take a stroll! In the park, there is a building called G Tower, where you can go up and get a aerial view for free! Also near the park there is a shopping/restaurant area called NC Cube Canal Walk. Very cool looking, a lot of container boxes as design and each section is named by seasons."
Great day in the park! ,"We rented bikes which was kind of expense, 10 bucks and hour, but it was worth doing. While riding the bikes, they had a deer farm and a rabbit farm. Everything about the park was absolutely beautiful. I never had so much fun at a park. Definitely worth going to see. "
Great place for leisure,Very nice place to spend a leisure afternoon in a couple. Beautiful sunset view in late afternoon. Many water activities to do.

Great way to relax,"This park sits right across the street from the Sheraton Grand Incheon Hotel. WHat a great way to spend a couple of hours just walking, having a picnic lunch along the many areas of the park all with a peaceful and serene tranqulity and you can also rent a paddle wheeler to traverse the waterway inside the park itself. A very good value especially for couples.."

Central Park Korean Style,Great park for running and walking. Paddle boats are available for rent as well as bikes. There is also a refreshment stand.
Truly Smart City,"Everything a human can think about as to how to be smart, behave Smart and avail Smart facilities is out here. All people who are working in Smart city should visit this place. A very good learning experience."
"Big, modern and spacious","It's big and spacious among tall, new and modern buildings. It's advisable to visit in the evening when you can walk around in the daylight then the light up when the sun set. There are 3 big shopping malls nearby, Songdo Central Mall, Little Mall and Hyundai Premium Outlet Mall where you can go for dinner."
Lovely park amidst the high rise blocks,"Gorgeous well planned park in middle of Song do. Good paths, lots of nice plants and well designed structure and planting. Art pieces are around the park. You can hire bikes, tandems and 4person pedal vehicle as well as rowing boats, canoes, kayaks and dingy from East boat house. There are deer in enclosures and rabbits on an island as well as fish in the lake. Lovely autumn color today."
Nice day,"Spend two hours walking with family, a tiny enclosure with deers is located in the park and man made canal in the park. Good place to relax and take in the sight."
"Great, great 👌","Great Saturday morning... market set the place abuzz with people. Others just happy to have a walk. I wish I had more time, including to walk in the light garden in the night, which did look spectacular from a distance (G-Tower)"
Great test in the middle of the busy town,"Located in the middle of modern town, Songdo. This is the biggest and best place to relax and indulge for individuals and families. I saw many people in the park, but still dorsn't feel crowded. Must visit if you are in this area."
one of the best public spacing park,"I did enjoy the walk, the space, the park itself and I was there from around 430pm and spent 2 hours there only walking within the park. view is stunning, I appreciate a lot how South Korea government offer such a lovely public outdoor space for its people"
Highly technological architectural beauty,"It's one of the best place I visited till now. The view in night is just amazing. The taller building around the park makes it special . I visited it many times . the lake in between the park enhances the beauty of the park. in sum up , i would like to strongly recommend this place to every visitor of Incheon."
Don't use the hotel fitness center. Go for a walk or run in the park.,"Lots of families enjoy the park. There's boating, biking, and a variety of other forms of exercise. Rent a boat and tour the lake."
Escape to the big busy city to the upcoming relax city,"I do enjoy living in Seoul but something just I want enjoy the city without the inconvenience to walk with a large group of people around me. I think Songdo Central Park offers the perfect experience to be in the upcoming city with beautiful parks, cafes, great restaurants and even a shopping experience without all the crowds around you. The people around it are very pleasant and servicing."
Futuristic Park,"This area is all fairly new, it felt futuristic, like something out of a Buck Rogers movie. An ideal park along a created canal, with distant towering new condo buildings. A fenced in zoo area with deer. A boathouse that rents those little pedal boats. Looks a lot different than the mudflats that were here when Chesty Puller & US Marines liberated Incheon in 1950, almost 66 years ago to the day. This whole area is built on re-claimed mudflats, and they did a pretty good job. Some minor drainage/settling issues. Great place to jog, stroll, etc. Feels very safe. "
Good walk in the park.,Very nice way to spend the day. Great place to take pictures. The boat dock is nice. Good coffee and ice cream.
Stroll time,"One stop in the Incheon day tour is the urban planning showcase, Songdo Central Park. Converging in this area are the high rise architecture, waterway, canal walk and entertainment venues. Wide spaces, greenery and strategic resting spots make for one pleasant exploration on foot. Unless preference is for water activities by way of canoeing or kayaking. Adding to the options will be a food trip by sampling the restaurants along the way, though of the high end type. Whether going solo or in group, this place is promenading-worthy."
A great day out,"This is a lovely lake to walk around and to explore.There are many art installations and there is a water taxi from one end to the other round trip, but it is easily walkable in about 25 minutes. I went kayaking with my boyfriend and it was a lot of fun."
For those looking to while away the time,"There's a ""cruise boat"" that will take you around the man-made lake. From the boat you'll get to see interesting buildings, people walking around, and Rabbit Island (an islet actually). Not really worth visiting unless you have nothing else to do."
A work in progress,"Nice quiet park, but not really much to see or do, unless you are in to renting all sorts of boats/SUP's to go up and down the river. Give it a few more years for the trees to mature and it will be nice. Right now it's a good place for a jog or walk to exercise, and the totems are interesting. I'm sure during holiday weekends it's packed with kids coming to see the rabbits and deer and ride the boats, but at other times it can be quite empty."
Songdo Central Park Republic of Korea,"Take the KAL limousine bus from Incheon airport to New Songdo come.(It will arrive within 40 minutes.)There are excellent around the hotels, shopping center and good restaurants.If you are a business trip in Incheon, Republic of Korea it is a very good area.A nice park, can come by subway and bus and the bikes can be rented at the hotelSongdo Central Park is a place for relaxation and jogging.Republic of Korea Incheon Songdo Sheraton, Oakwood, Orakai , Songdo inn ..... close this comfortable hotel."
such a nice place,"I loved this park, it has been created artificially for the locals and you can spend you time on small boats or canoes or walking around. Good place for family or to work out"
"Large and safe, good place to walk/jog",It's really nice to stay at a hotel right near Central Park for the view and the exercise. It's a good 1-2 hour walk to go all the way around it and into the shopping district on the east side.
Great Place for Famiy!,"Brought our kids and they loved to run around. The park is beautiful and well-maintained. It has deers and rabbits for added attraction to the kids.Place for a good stroll, jogging, picnic, pratice photography (because we saw a group of men and women past 40yrs old lining up their cameras in tripods in one area).After walking in the par, you can shop and dine in the near establishments. Aside from the many Korean restaurants, it has Thai, Vietnamese, Western, Italian, etc.Place for everyone^^"
Great place!,"Just the right place in Incheon to chill for friends, family and couple especially in the evening. There are watersports, deers, and especially a good place to take pictures :)"
This place deserves ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️!,"This place is really clean and fresh! I came here in the early of June and the weather is nice, not cold but not hot at all. It's so relaxing that I could spend a day here without going anywhere else. Nice for picnic, doing some family stuffs. You may paddle a boat or canoeing to a rabbit island with your kids or just walking around with your squad and greeting adorable dears together OR take some time with yourself with a nice music while jogging or sitting and enjoying the view. I know I wrote so many 'or' but I can't help it! There are so many things we can do! I can't believe there could be such a nice park in a city (at least not around my neighborhood...) Also, the architecture around here can easily inspire you, like the Tri-bowl. However, it would be a really long ride to get here, which means a high-cost ticket. I do recommend you to use M-Pass so that you can save some money to come here before or after traveling to other attractions. Too bad it's summer, I didn't get to see the golden high grass at all.Ps. There are a restaurant and Lotte Mart around here ,so, no worry to be starving to death xD"
Asia'a best central park @ Songdo,"Hi, I am a Postdoc researcher in National university located at Songdo. I used to visit Central Park and near by places many times. On very first visit I found it amazing model of architecture and surrounded by many high rise buildings, like NEAT tower. As a first smart city of the world, Songdo possesses best park in the Asia. it is believed to be designed keeping New York's central park in mind. There is one river passing through that area and best place I have ever seen till date for couple/family visit and specially camping. As camping is a unique tradition of Korea, many people used to enjoy weekends at central park. Main thing is it is officially allowed to stay night and spend good time with family and friends in personal tents. I recommend this place as a best place to visit if some one is visiting Incheon even for a day. More importantly for luxury travelers there are many high end luxurious hotels adjacent to the park. Last but not the list the public transport of this city is really appreciable."
Nice place to unwind,Excellent park in the middle of Songdo to relax and take in the sights and sounds of locals. Well maintained park with good tracks and lovely bridges.
Fabulous park with scenic waterway,"I had the opportunity (albeit briefly) to walk through part of Songdo Park during a business visit to the area. I entered the park at the end near the Sherarton Hotel and was amazed by the Sunset Deck, cafe, and the boat rental area.You can rent an electric powered 4-person run-about and tour the park waterway. This offers beautiful view of the city skyline (especially after dark) with all of the building illuminated some even with their own light show. I did not get a chance to rent one of the boats, but I know that when I am back in the area, I will definitely plan more time to check out the area and rent one of the boats and to walk the area. It definitely looks like a great time especially for a family."
Songdo Central Park,"This is a beautiful park with great scenery on the shore line of the sea. As you all along the boardwalk, one can feel the cool breeze that is refreshing even on a hot humid summer day in Incheon. The view is spectacular."
Pleasant Area and Nice Walking Trails,The park has a number of attractions as well (none of which we used). There are paddle boats for the lake and there is a food court. 
Pleasant Walk !!,Very Nice Place to walk around and enjoy the beauty of nature . Its having a restaurant inside . That's great too .
Peaceful place to visit for family ,Was there with my friends and saw many families hanging out there. Looked nice and peaceful. Hope to visit there with my love someday. Haha
Beautiful park in the middle of Songdo,I took a few photos of Central Park. Nice place to get some exercise or just walk around. Felt safe here and its very nice to walk around. 
Nice Park,I had a walk through the PArk on a nice Sunday afternoon. Sunday seems to be the busiest day because there were a lot of families having picnic in the park. There is also possibility for some watersports like jetski or paddleboat. The deers and rabbits were also nice to watch and the animals seems all to be quite in a nice condition. The trellies with all the plants was so nice to walk through and the foot spa path was also funny.
Great walking.,Scenic with good paths to walk on. Well worth visiting. Rivers cruises available. Include Ifez observation tower in walk. Great view.
Public Park,"The forested area in the park fills with daytime tents and campers on weekends. A patio on the east side of the park has cafes and small restaurant , and canoes are available for rental."
Beautiful park with traditional Korean architecture.,This is a great park with restaurants and shops in traditional Korean buildings. It is good to get some exercise and also has a water taxi ride. 
"A Great Place to Spend an Afternoon, or a Day ","Bike paths, flowers, bridges, boats, flea markets, rabbits on an island, deer, facilities conveniently located, and it's big enough to get lost in....awesome!"
Nice park with nice plants,Good nice park with nice greenery and good for a work out if needed. Nice cafes around the park as well if you need some coffee.
A treat if you are staying in Songdho,"Songdho is a city in development so it does not have all the ""amenities"" of many cities. But it does have Central Park - nothing on the scale of New York's but space to walk beside water, enjoy fresh air, and get some exercise. And you can get a good perspective on some of Songdho's distinctive architecture."
One shouldn't miss such a park. ,"Although we're staying in a Seoul hotel, I chose to see this park for its great reviews and upon stepping out of Central Park station I was so amazed by the tribowl cultural centre building. As we stroll around the park I realised how awesome this place is! On the west side of the park is a bit more subtle and quiet but as we approach the eastern part we experienced a different atmosphere ! Lots of people, families, lovers, young and old are having fun at the man made lake on their rented boats. Everyone was having the time of their lives as if it's a public holiday! The park has contemporary large sculptures, modern bridges and a small camping site! There's also a coffee shop to relieve your thirst. It is surrounded with modern skyscrapers designed as a modern city ecological city of Korea. I recommend you to see this park no matter how far it is from Seoul! It's free and it's really wonderful to be here!"
Center of Song-do,"Lovely green space and open area in the center of Song-do. Western influence - do you know Central Park NYC? Bikes & Water toys to rent - kayak or paddle etc. with walking and bike paths all around. Well maintained - fountains, look outs, bridges, landscapes - very nice. Come for a quick walk, a picnic or a leisurely stroll. Even read a book from the lending library."
What a great area.,"Recently spent 4 days in Songdo and made sure to walk throuh Central Park every day. During the day there are picnics and family activities everywhere, boat rentals, little cars for young kids all surrounded by bars, restaurants, shopping, and hotels."
The park is beautiful,"It is a modern and giant park in incheon area. It is also a good place to have dinner, take a walk and/or exercise... "
Great way to spend a Sunday,"Great park - there are several varieties of bikes for rent, little mini motor cars for the toddlers, a little lake with kayak and boat rental, walking paths all around, food stands with snacks, even a little animal area with deer and rabbits. In short, a great way to spend a Sunday people-watching in a lovely environment. Recommended if you happen to be in Songdo. "
old meets new!,"i didnt want to head to seoul straight after landing at 7am so i sent my luggage to storage and boarded the airport limousine to Incheon to check out the park!wanted to do water activities but for a solo traveler, i could only do the family swan boat but it wasnt worth it. they had transparant and normal kayaks but was a 2 men boat unfortunately. they do have a stand up paddling boat for 1 but only avlb in summer. didnt opt to rent a bike so i walked around..visited the hanok, cafe and walked by deers and the mini rabbit island! there were also cherry blossoms at the park, it was really beautiful. walked back to Sheraton hotel (opposite) to take the bus back to the airport."
"It'd better if you be there around spring,summer,and autumn.","I went there around the end of winter, but it's quite droughty.I saw many families spending such a great time together.If you have children, this place is highly recommended."
Mind blowing.,Simply put this was incredible. Check out the sky line of state of the art buildings the river the whole park as a whole was something we'll never forget. 
Lovely park,"If you are wanting a morning jog or a pleasant stroll in a park in Songdo, this is the place to come visit. The cherry blossoms are in bloom in the spring and there is even a cafe to sit and have a coffee while taking in the scenery. It's also very quiet which is nice. "
Beautiful park,We love our visit to this lovely park. My children especially enjoyed visiting the deer farm and rabbit island. It would have been better if maps in English were made available.
Love this Park,Mixed with nice buildings and greenery. Its a nice place to stroll around and play with your pets. We saw a lot of dog owners walking their pets. Clean and Very nice.
달리기 좋은 공원 good park for runner,"한바퀴를 돌면 3.5키로 정도 나옵니다. 단일 공원으로는 꽤 큰 규모이며 도로가 좋아서 달리거나 자전거 타기 좋습니다. 다만 날씨 좋은 날에는 사람이 좀 걸리적 거릴 수 있습니다. 가족단위 연인끼리 이야기하며 거닐기에 딱입니다. 주차도 편하고요. 주변에 커넬워크나 컨벤시아도 있고 건너편에 먹을 곳, 까페도 많아 좋네요. distance : 3.5km road is very good. good place to run. "
Peaceful on a winter morning,"A nice, large and peaceful park in the middle of a modern city. Traditional buildings, places to rest, and exercise equipment."
Nice walk,"I went to this park when it was already getting dark just to have some move and relax after long travelling, when I arrived to Sheraton hotel and didn't expect to much. But I was nicely surprised how beautiful park it is."
Cool park,"Even at the winter time its the best place to go. Walking, jogging etc...cross the Sheraton Hotel...Do bir miss it..."
Aerial Perspective,"An excellent place to go for a walk, take a run, fly a kite, ride your bicycle, have a picnic, rent a canoe, or take a leisurely boat ride. From the air you can see that Central Park is filled with several wide paths that twist in and around the park on both sides of the canal which runs through the center of the park. This is a large park (100 acres) and easily would take an hour plus just to walk the perimeter."
Beautiful park ,I love this city so much . If you are at songdo then you definitely have to visit this park. They have lovely deer in the park ! Children will enjoy this place. 
Take a walk!,"Get outdoors and have some fun. There are multiple options. The boats are great for any age. You can have a blast from 1 year old on up. In the warmer months bring a water gun and spray your friends! Picnicking, day camping, exercising, or sight seeing are all a possibility here. Based off of the New York Central Park. Don't forget to see the rabbit island and the deer."
Big park,"It's a beautiful park with heavy snow and big wind that day we went. So it's hard to stay outside for a long time. However, Its a good place to relax and also jogging for sure. And It's also a new developing town in Incheon. "
Amazing city!,"Been there for a week. People overall are very friendly, but don't know much English. However sometimes you see a Korean with decent English knowledge stop next to you and try to help if you look even a slightly bit lost, which ended in awkward situation as we were just looking around.They got pretty parks and brand new sky scrappers."
Nice place to walk,"Song-do’s park is a nice place to walk around and enjoy beautiful scenes. The park is located in the new neighborhood of Song-do. There is beautiful lake and nice café. The view at night is sublime because you can enjoy the view of high building around the park and the light animation. Recently a restaurant in traditional Korean style was built inside the park. There is parking for the park but it is little expensive, you could park your car on the street near by for free."
Impressive but pretty empty,"The architecture surrounding the park is amazing and is reminiscent of iconic buildings around the world. Orienting yourself at the park is simple using key buildings as a landmarks. At the south side of the park is the NEAT (Northeast Asia Tower) which looks very similar to the One World Trade Center in Manhattan. On the east side, there is the Tri-Bowl which reminds me of the Guggenheim and also is the Central Park Train station.We walked part of the southeast side of the park to get to the subway station from the Sheraton Grand Incheon and also retraced our steps late in the evening. Both times we did not get lost and felt very safe despite the fact the park is mostly empty."
Great Walking Park.,This whole area is new and is part of a huge 15 year development project. Its nice to see the city planners have included lots of public space and invested heavily to provide recreation for its citizens and tourists alike.
Chom ,"Beautiful place, good people and have more yummy food!! Don't miss this place!!! I will back again!!! ;););)"
Lazy afternoon trip destination,"Park for Suitable for couples and family outing on a lazy summer day. Lacks activities if you are not boating, kayaking or riding a cycle. Good place for half a day camping tough."
Must visit! ,"Easy to visit, just take subway to Central Park Station, you can reach here in 2 hours. It's a modern and nice park in South Korea. "
Lovely views from the river taxi,"Rode the river taxi up and down the river. Lovely sculptures, architecturally unique bridges and great skyline views of Songdo. "
This is what a modern city park should be,"Amazing place to see all that modern South Korea has to offer. Safe and delightful, must visit and watch the people and families loving life. Great sculptures and other whimsical installations make this a fun day out"
Very cool modern park,Very nice park day or night. Very safe with plenty of families and couples walking around. The lake in the middle of the park you can rent boats and paddle around. Plenty of nice viewing points from buildings around the park.
Lovely park,"A very nice park in such a new area. Plenty of activities to choose from, from boats, to Segway! It's fun to see how parents have remote control cars and put their kids inside and all very know branded cars. A place to go a spend a couple of hours."
Night view of Songdo Central Park in Incheon,This is a park located in the big hotel complex of Songdo. You can walk around the lake. You can ride a water taxi or a canoe as well. It is very good to take pictures of night view of Songdo Central Park since building around there have their own shapes.
Great for relaxing or exercise.,Beautiful park with walking and biking trails. It also has boats in the water for couples or families.
Nice place to spend some time,"Located opposite the Hotel that I was staying in the Songdo Central Park was ideal to go for a wander in the park, but yet be surrounded by a City Skyline. I was surprised at how clean the park and the waterways were within the park, which made it even more pleasurable to have a stroll throughout. I went off the marked concrete paths and followed dirt tracks to be surprised at what was around the next corner. There were plenty of people doing their own thing with their families and it was nice to be in this environment. Although I went quite early into the park it appeared that you could hire small boats, kayaks and even jet skis on the waterways. I was happy though that I did not see or hear any jet skis as I think that would have spoils the atmosphere"
Big park with outdoor activities,"Huge aqua/marine-conservation focused park. You can see the high rises of Songdo from this park and it is indeed a beautiful view. Good for jogging or a stroll, with some exercise stations around. You can also rent a boat!"
Must do in Songdo,"Great place to visit and relax. Take a stroll around the lake, enjoy the beautiful park and be amazed by the contract of nature and the sky scrapers surrounding the place. You can also rent a boat or canoe and go boating on the lake. Also go take a look at the traditional houses built in the park."
Stunning spot to play,Songdo Central Park is a great place to visit with a whole host of different spots to hang out and play...or just sit and people watch. Even in the sub-zero temperatures with piles of snow it was a delightful place to spend some time.
Loved it!,"Loved this park! What a great place to take a nice walk, just sit and relax, or have a cup of coffee! Took some amazing pictures too!"
A nice place for a stroll,"A nice little park that sits along a winding waterway that is filled with pleasure boats for rent. It is a great place to walk in Incheon, but it gets very crowded on weekends. There are often activities, although most are for children and teens.The park is line with an array of bizarre and exotic tall buildings, kind of a place where architects went wild. At night, the buildings feature neon light shows that add an interesting twist."
"The park itself is already amazing, will only get better once the city gets bigger and more lively","Songdo is one of the world's most ambitious urban projects. Construction has been underway for over 10 years, and there is still a lot to do. At the heart of it, sits Central Park. The park itself is stunning. It's fairly big, but above all it's very well designed. At the center of it is a lake, where you can ride a boat or canoe. On the sides, you' ll encounter different types of vegetation, small pagodas for relaxation, and even a mini zoo with deers. The park is surrounded by many tall buildings, including Korea's tallest : NEATT. I happen to love modern architecture and tall buildings, so that's something I enjoyed very much. But the city is stil a work in progress. The South and West sides of the park are still almost unconstructed, which can feel a bit strange. I'd argue that it's definitely better to visit Songdo on a busy weekend when the weather is nice, as you'll have the opportunity to see more people and get to see a lively place, rather than a fairly empty one."
"a good place to take a walk, especially at night.","this park is clean and big, surrounded with modern structures and they give off light at night which is beautiful. enjoy the walk in urban area."
"Beautiful park, amazing surroundings!","Amongst gorgeous architecture and great neighborhoods, Central Park has a beautiful setting and nice restaurants around. Worth to visit"
"Korean ""wildlife"" studies",Come on weekend and study Korean families in their leisure time. Quite amusing to watch them taking a boat trip.
Every sunday I walk along this park.,"Not only for the residents near this park but also for the visitors who are staying at the hotels near this, it's a good place to visit, especially in the nights it has a great view.You can get on the boat on a small lake which is running through this park,you can have various kinds of foods if you just walk 5 minutes."
"Beautifully done, fun park","At 101 acres, Songdo Central Park is a fraction of its inspiration, New York's Central Park. Don't let that fool you. This is a well designed, diverse park that walkers or runners will enjoy. The terrain is not flat, but will not be too much for a slow walker. This park is also a terrific place for families. Bike, pedicab, canoe, kayak and small motorboat rentals are available. Food and coffee are also available and there's plenty of public restrooms. The trees and vegetation are beautiful and there are live animals to see. This is quite an oasis when you want to get out of your hotel. I almost forgot to mention the art! Different types scattered around the park. Don't miss it!"
New York's Central Park and Traditional Korean Culture,"Songdo Central Park is often empty, but it is one of the most beautiful and fun attractions in South Korea. It sort of has a ""feel"" of New York's Central Park, but it definitely has a ""feel"" of a traditional Korean culture."
Great place to get away from it all!,"Even though the park is relatively new , it's beautifully made, with large trees, and outdoor things to do.A parking area is built underneath the park, so it is easy to get there, leave your car, and get into the park."
it's a sweet walk in the park..,"the phonebooth size library standing by the man-made lake had me! plus the unique architecture of the skyrise buildings was an eye candy... the park is not being frequented but if you value privacy, you can actually have it here ironically..."
Comfortable walk in the park,The park is well planned out with lots of walking trails adjacent to bike trails. The trees were recently planted so they are still young and not large enough to provide good shade.
Great Place to stop over,"Songdo is so close to the Incheon airport and great place to stop over for day from the airport. There are beautiful artificial lake, parks, restaurants, and also korean traditional hotel. It is good to walk, riding a bike, shopping and the night scenery is so fantastic with lake and nice buildings together"
I LOVE SONGDO,"Songdo is a new town but LOVELY. I love the park! You can do some activities here. Riding a small boat, rent a bike to go around the park, etc. I enjoyed the park so much <3"
Stress-free place,"We stopped over to relax after a busy day and it was worth it. The breeze was refreshing and you can take all the time you have to just relax and enjoy the sights. The little river had boat rentals so you can have a short ""river tour"" and be able to see more of the area. We were there in spring, so the flowers were truly beautiful."
Nice to walk around in when in Songdo,"Songdo Central Park is a very nice green area to walk around in and is right in the middle of a very futuristic looking part of Songdo. It's definitely not a destination if visiting Seoul, but it's definitely worth spending some time in if you're in the area. It's certainly the most attractive area of Incheon."
Fun and romantic ,"I had a stopover in Seoul with a free nights accommodation across from the park.I hadn't expected to be staying outside of the airport so hadn't planned any activities in advance. The hotel staff recommended this and I visited late on a Saturday night and early (for me) Sunday morning.On Saturday night I walked over from Orakai Songdo hotel at 22.00 and spent at least 2 hours wandering around and taking photos of the light displays on the buildings across the water. I wasn't the only one there but at this time most people seemed to be strolling romantically along the waterfront or purposely striding through to the other side.I probably didn't even cover half of the park that night as it turned out to be very large. I came back after breakfast the next day, around 9am for a quick stroll before checking out at 10.I walked through what seemed to be sporting courts and enjoyed looking at a tiled wall of childrens art, then across a bridge to find the exercise area, book booth, pagoda and access to the city streets on the other side.I saw a vending machine that seemed to sell beer the night before but I don't think the one in the exercise area did.It was quite foggy/smoggy in the morning and not many other people were there but everyone who walked past me said 'hello' in English and seemed quite friendly. Nice place and glad I visited it.  "
A great place to relax,"It is a great park on a weekdays, in the weekend is crowded. There is a little river so it make a good experience to take a rental boat, or have a little picnic, or maybe rent a bike to ride around "
"Great park, great way to relax after a long week",I was in Incheaon on business staying in a hotel across from the park. Had a Sunday to kill and spent the morning walking though the park. The paths are great both day and night. Stopped by the LOTTE mart across the street. The food court upstairs has a great collection of food besides the standard Korean dishes.
Satisfying & Relaxing Place,"Songdo Central Park is a futuristic park in Songdo City. It showcases modern skyscrapers, bridges, etc."
"Good place to unwind and walk, yet still in the City.","This is a park centred around a small lake.It has several paths to take for walkers, double tandems, side by side and for single bikes.You can rent the bikes or rent a boat, it is a easy walk, no big ups or downs, nice wide paths, with red flowers and green trees on both sides or take the river path and walk over the small bridges, stop for a drink and snack at one of the cafés, inside or out. This park is very clean and is a safe place to walk, day or night unlike another Central Park. "
What a great place to spend some hours,"The Central Park is a huge very well designed, heavily planted and landscaped area above a car park.It has kilometres of bike and walking paths, a lake that winds through, traditional pavilions, water features, bridges, fitness equipment, deer enclosure and even stamping stations where kids can stamp their activity map.Boats and bikes can be hired and there is a little honesty system library, that looks like a phone box.The trees, undulating paths, rocky outcrops and particularly the mass plantings of azaleas, make it very photogenic, and there is a new complex almost completed that appears to be a reconstruction of a traditional Korean village."
A fun outdoor park,"This is a great place to spend an afternoon. You can rent OVERPRICED boats, canoes, and bikes. It is great to walk along the canal. There are some great photo spots. Also, you can walk all the way down to the coast and see the ocean and some of the Incheon islands. But there is no beach."
Great place to stretch the legs,"This park is a beautiful oasis in the bustling business district of Incheon. There are beautifully sculpted pathways leading through classic Korean woodlands and rockeries. You can take a ride on the small motorboats on the canal, exercise in the outdoor 'gym' or choose a quiet bench on which to read a book from the 'telephone booth library'. There are many pathways that lead around the canal and park which was great for our family on a layover to Paris - thanks Korean AIr!"

nice place to hangout,"if you like to escape from the crowded and busy atmosphere of seoul songdo is the kind of place that you want to visit, its located in the middle of the city near sheraton and lotte mart"
Good for family,"Good for family. There is bike shop, boat shop and a large ground for family bicycling. there are lots of restaurants and cafes nearby, so you won't go hungry. "
Great walks,Nice to see a park of this size in a city. Great place to take a walk in the morning and watch the sunrise
A bit of everything,"I've enjoyed my time at Central Park. It has many different elements and changes dramatically from sunrise to sunset. Grasslands, water tours, cool bridges, pines, maples, whales, rabbit island, deer canoes, coffee and free books to read. It is surrounded by buildings that are a light show in themselves, but even during the day you feel like your in a canyon of stylised buildings."
A nice park in the middle of a business district,I was staying at a hotel across the street because my flight was cancelled. I went for a walk to get out a bit. If I had my kids with me it would be a great place to take them (I saw several families there) to get out and run around. Nice paths with different trees and relaxing.
An Awesome Park,"There is SO much to do in this park. There are multiple coffee shops, walking/running/biking paths, outdoor fitness equipment, beautiful bridges to cross, and a river running through the middle that you can rent kayaks, canoes, power boats, or ride the ferry. At night, the park transforms into a serene LED lit wonderland that makes for very romantic strolls."
A Stroll in the Park,"While still in a build phase a stroll around the park is a great escape, many things to do check out the book stands as well. A peaceful place to escape if travelling on work or lesuire and great views of the new and increasing skyline"
family park,visited the place on saturday and the place was packed with families putting up tents around the park. Popular family outings where the kids are seen drawing pictures while the adults lazed around enjoying the fresh air. Cycling and boat rides available.Great way to spend the weekend with families.Stayed at Oakwood Premier Hotel which is located opposite Central Park. 
Unexpected oasis,"I could only just see this park in the dark from my hotel room, but the next morning when it was light, I decided to go down and investigate further. It is an attractive park with walking and running paths around a central lake. Some of the park is left as wetlands, and there is still some construction work going on at one end. There are sculptures and areas to sit down, all very pleasant. The park is surrounded by some very modern architecture, so the reflections in the lake are quite spectacular.It was very refreshing to get out and walk around during a brief layover in Incheon."
Beautiful and big,I enjoyed going for a walk or run around this park. There are activities available such as bikes and canoes. Great place for a date or to just relax. I recommend this location.
So futuristic ,This place's main point is the futuristic design of the buildings that make you feel that you're not in Korea or even in Asia. I can't say anything about the building and the landscape because it's too amazing and breathtaking..This place is very recommended to visit for morning jog or just take a walk.Don't forget to prepare the camera since you won't get such views at other places 
great place for a quick morning jog,jogged around here many times in the early morning. safe and clean. If your staying at the sheraton or the oakwood you cant get lost!
Part is still under construction,A large part of the park is still under construction. No worth visiting at this point. Probably will be good once it's completed!
Very Pedestrian,"Sondgo Central Park is a wonderful place to stroll, ride a bike, canoe, or just sit and watch the locals stream by. Beautifully maintained and landscaped. A refreshing escape from the city."
very nice,"nice are to walk, sport (running or rowing) and to relax a bit. nice places suitable for reading and exercising. "
central park is good,I did not actually had much expectations on the central park as to I don't have much information about it. But everything changed when I went there. They say the park was inspired by the NYC central park. I don't have any idea about the one that is NYC but I could say Songdo central park is great. The place is very clean. It is ideal for foreigners also since all information comes with an English translations. Good for a late afternoon walk. The lights of the city are just but romantic for dating.
Nice for a little stroll,I live in Songdo and will go to Central Park for walks in the evening or weekend. It is well taken care of and pretty big for a park. It has a little pond where you can rent a boat weather permitting. When the weather is nice there are is a open air market. It is nice if you are in Songdo but I wouldn't go out of my way to visit Songdo.
"Too manicured, but excellent people-watching","I chuckle at reviews that recommend Songdo as a tourist destination; only come here if you have to, otherwise stick to Seoul and other less manicured areas to experience Korea. If you do come, though, Central Park is pleasant, especially in spring. You can spend an inordinate amount to rent an electric boat and putt around the canal, or bring your tent and day camp like the locals. I especially like the rabbit and deer farms, and the public art is cheeky and fun. Check it out if you're in the area, but don't make a special trip to Songdo unless you're really into modern architecture or ghost towns."
A unique oasis and a truly lovely park,"My family and I were visiting relatives in Korea and we absolutely love Songdo, especially compared to the other cities found in Asia. Songdo was a breath of fresh air for us, and Central Park in particular was a true gem of a find. We were there last fall during one of their open air markets. It is so rare to find such a wide open public space like this in Asia, and was quite a welcome relief from Seoul. The areas around the park are filled with restaurants and cafes, and we had a fantastic time walking around the city. HIghly recommended weekend spot."
very nice!,"Go there on weekends.nice area and nice park,shopping, good and various restaurants and cafes and everything. go to ""NC CUBE CANAL WALK"""
