Nice little fresh water aquarium,This was a nice way to spend an hour. The aquarium is nicely done. It showcases fresh water fish only. It was well costed and interesting. They also have a family of otters and Chipmunks. Upstarts is a history instillation on fishing from the Namhangang River. It is centrally located in the city and easily accessable. 
Take enough time to observe enough in the largest freshwater aquarium in Korea,"They say this is the biggest freshwater aquarium in Korea. It has many kinds of freshwater fishes, creatures, reptiles and amphibians. There's a fishing history museum. And the end of the route is otters. So, if you arrive late, try not to miss the highlight at the end.I really enjoyed watching them. Not a waste of money.- The entrance fee was 10,000 won and I had a special discount of 25% for Visit Danyang Week.- There was a staff inside who provided me a free guided tour with an explanation. Only in Korean.- There's a fishbowl for experiencing with hands. Only for certain kinds.- The gigantic fishbowl for big fishes was incredible. Not at the level of expectation."
Sad to see some of the creatures confined to tiny fish tanks,"While the aquarium definitely caters to children, there is plenty to see for visitors of all ages. There was a good selection of marine life native to Korea (many of them being on the endangered list) although most of them were in fish tanks barely large enough for them to move in. The reptile/amphibian section also had a good variety of rare species but again, the tanks they were confined to were suffocatingly small. Like most well known aquariums there are couple of huge tanks and there is enough to see for an hour."
Danuri Aquarium,"A nice little spot, oddly situated in a small town, not sure who visits here mostly, but it is well presented and mostly with freshwater fish, which amazed me how many types there are!!! "
Lockers and tourist info without crossing the bridge,"Our bus from Seoul (east Seoul bus terminal) dropped us off right next to the aquarium which ended up being very convenient. We found free lockers, bathrooms and a tourist info counter that gave us the schedule for guinsa temple buses. We didn't visit the aquarium, but I thought this would be useful info. So here it is."
