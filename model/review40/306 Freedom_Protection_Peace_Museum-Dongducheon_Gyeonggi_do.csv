Freedom Protection Peace Museum tour,"Haven't been here in about twenty years. It's now much improved. It sits at the base of Soyo mountain. If you come to Dongducheon from out of town, it's well worth yout while to spend the day here, with much to see and do. You can go up Soyo san, hike the trails, check out the MTB trail. Lots of nice little eateries and gift shops. It's especially beautiful in the Fall.The museum has artifacts and a lot of historical information about the war, great for history buffs."
"Make a day of it, see Jajaeam and the Museum (full day)","Definitely think the museum is worth seeing, but not sure it warrants a trip in and of itself. A good day, if you have the legs for it, is to make the hike to Jajaeam Temple in the morning, have lunch in town, and then see the museum in the afternoon. They're both right there together. You'll see the museum off to the right just as you head up the trail to the temple. If you just want to see the museum, then others have described how to get there. Allow 1 1/2 - 2 hours. If the weather's nice you might consider packing a picnic lunch and eating on the terrace just off the 4th floor, which allows for some nice views of the valley below."
Worth the look,"Was taking my wife to Soyosan and was curious about this area so we went into it. Taught us some interesting facts about Dongducheon and the Korean War. Also, they had an old US Army Warrant Officer Uniform in there so that was a plus."
Live near by,"I have no additional information to add in that the recent reviews of others says any and everything I would say should you be interested in visiting this 'must visit' attraction. ""Do Dream"" in the ""Land Of The Morning Calm"" .....Thanks"
"if you are in the area, definitely worth seeing","The Freedom Protection Peace Museum is at the base of Soyosan, one of the most popular outdoor mountain hiking/general recreation areas in Dongducheon. So if you are in the area long enough to get out and about, you should definitely head this way. You can actually take the Seoul Metro to the Soyosan station, which is the last, northernmost stop on Line 1, and walk basically across the street to this area. If you drive, I think you have to pay to park in the museum parking lot, or you could pay to park in the bigger parking lot closer to the mountain if you want to go hiking as well, or you could even not pay to park, I believe, and park somewhere along the street if a spot is available, and just walk to the museum.The museum grounds are beautiful and they have some nice tanks and planes and artillery pieces scattered around, as well as a series of monuments for each country that helped South Korea during the Korean War. The museum itself is a fairly new and quite beautiful building situated on top of a little hill at the foot of Mount Soyo, from which you can see some amazing views of the surrounding area on a clear day. Admission is cheap, a few thousand won per person I think (a dollar or two), and the inside of the place is as amazing as the outside. They have lots of pictures of the surrounding area and Camp Casey and so on from during the Korean War, when everything was dirt roads and rice paddies and little huts, and they have some of them situated next to modern pictures taken from the exact same location and angle yet just in the last few years so you can see how dramatically the area has changed and become very developed and advanced.If you are a war museum buff, like I am, you'll be in heaven because they have absolutely amazing pictures of the war and the fighting and the local area at that time, as well as some weapons and a nice hall displaying the various uniforms and equipment of all the different countries that came to South Korea's aid. There are other museum amenities such as a movie room and libraries and various sculptures and so on that combine to make it quite a nice little museum. It's not like the National Museum in Seoul or anything huge and outrageous like that, but it's actually so well done that I believe even an unbiased normal person without a specific interest in history and war would find the place enjoyable."
Worth seeing,"This museuum has 3 floors telling the story of the korean war, how it came to be, the sacrifices and who participated and why korea is parted in north and south. They also have a little movie room to watch the documentary. 2 libraries, mostly korean but you can also find english books, also you will find old tanks and airplanes they had during the war. I found it very fascinating and worth seeing while in korea. Its very close to the trainstation of Soyosan and coast 1000won for entry (less than a dollar)"
