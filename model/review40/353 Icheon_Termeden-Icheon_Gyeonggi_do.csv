Rejuvenated,"Bathing in the outdoor spa on a snowy day, definitely the best combination. Attracted to the colour of the blueberry, papaya and lavender spas. Slides seemed fun but couldn't bear queuing in the air. Finished off with a thai massage. Thanks Vincent for bringing Z and I there."
"Warm water indoor/outdoor spa, a cultural experience","Termeden is intended to model German-style spas, with some Korean touches. It is rather remote in a distant suburb of Seoul, but there are two daily buses direct to/from Termeden & East (Dong) Seoul bus terminal, that makes it easy. (Note: Korean public buses are Very Well Heated)The business makes only a few attempts at English, on a few signs -- the website's English pages are ten years old. We found no staff speaking English, so be prepared. Because of that, we paid the ""foreigner premium"" (i.e. full price entry fee, rental towels, rental chairs). Food options are pretty minimal, and expensive; there's no bar, but you can buy a can of beer. Upon entry, you surrender your shoes--they are collateral for any fees you incur with the electronic key they give you, so you cash out before exiting.They have a ""doctor fish"" pool, for a small (5000won) fee--very nice idea!Big attraction is the indoor/outdoor pool: during winter, swim outdoors in the large pool, and water slide, even in winter! (the lifeguards wear huge puffy coats and earmuffs!) Also some hot tubs, and a tradition Korean-style sauna (apparently the original structure on the property, a large oven with a very small crawling doorway -- but just warm inside, not hot).Note that the ""Bade"" portion is mixed-gender, with most customers dressed conservatively--shirt over bathing suit. But the other half is a traditional single-sex public bath, where nudity is the norm (rather discomfiting for Americans), and it includes 3 large outdoor hottubs.Tips: 1-towel is not necessary, but you may like your own beachtowel; 2- do you really need a lounge chair? 3-take your own small snack and drink (though they do search backpacks, evidently for glass bottles); 4-take your toiletries, to scrub/shampoo/shave in the public bath afterwards.5- We paid too much: full price is 38000won entry fee! Most locals get half-price coupons online, so be sure to get a Korean-reading friend to check coupang.com. It's expensive, so plan to stay a long time to get your money's worth. There are myriad pools to try."
Better value in summer,"Can't comment on value for money, as I have no idea what it cost. The area is very nice, with warm water in the pool, but a lot were closed (slides, fish pool) when we were there and they said that it's because it wasn't summer season yet. Still a nice place to go for a swim. For westerners it might be a little challenging with the shower and wardrobes as the towels don't cover much and Koreans also don't cover up, but walk around the dressing area freely without clothing. They also don't bring towels to the shower area. Shoes are as always deposited before entering. "
How to get there (from Seoul & downtown Icheon),"Icheon to the Termeden:1. Free shuttle bus (15 minutes; free): picks up at the city bus stop (the one in front of SC First Bank, or SC Foreign Exchange Bank) located across the street from the Icheon Bus Terminal---> Timetable (to the Termeden): 8:20 / 9:20 / 11:20 / 13:00 / 15:00---> Timetable (back downtown): 13:30 / 15:30 / 17:30 / 18:30 / 19:30 2. Taxi (15 minutes from downtown; about 12,000 won one way): taxis situated everywhere around the Icheon Bus TerminalSeoul to the Termeden:1. Basic express bus to Icheon (1 hour; 4,100 won per ticket), then use the free shuttle bus or taxi service (see above): --> Timetable (from the Dong Seoul Bus Terminal; Subway Line 2, Gangbyeon Station): first bus 6:10AM, last bus 10:00PM (bus departs every 30-40 minutes)--> Timetable (from the Express Bus Terminal; Subway Line 3 & 7, Express Bus Terminal Station): first bus 6:10AM, last bus 10:00PM (bus departs every 30-40 minutes)2. Non-stop bus from Seoul to the Termeden, from the Dong Seoul Bus Terminal in Seoul (75 minutes, 5,100 won per ticket): I believe it leaves from Gate 26 --> Timetable (to the Termeden): 9:20AM / 10:40AM--> Timetable (back to Dong Seoul Bus Terminal): 4:00PM / 5:10PM"
German style possibly only mixed bathing in Korea?,"One hour and 20 mins by direct bus from Seoul (Eastern bus terminal, has metro stop, cross the road after exiting, the 9:20 and 10:40 only go directly to the spa, others will terminate at Icheon bus station and you will have to get a local bus to the spa, another 20 mins out). This is a famous ceramics area but you can't but ceramics at the spa. 38,000 per person entry fee. When we arrived it was eerily quiet. In fact after 5 hours there only a total of maybe 50 people turned up, awesome! If you have been to the Carcalla Spa in Baden Baden, Germany, this is probably the closest type of spa in Korea. Possibly a bit smaller and dining options not so great. Due to the small number of people, the big slide was closed off and also a sort of big bubble ride, like the ones you can do in New Zealand (I think it's called zorbing) was not open. Very pleasant indoor and outdoor pools (outdoor warmer than indoor one),usual jet massagers and waterfall massagers, three different scented and coloured pools outside. All is mixed bathing which is very rare in Korea. Koreans are very modest and most ladies wore a bikini but then covered up with mesh like outer clothes and skirts/shorts, but foreigners are ok with bare chests and bikinis. Nude bathing, separated of course happens through the separate changing areas. You could easily spend 5 or 6 hours here, especially after you have spent the 1 hour 20 getting here and the admission fee. The direct bus back ( 4 or 5.30 p.m. sorry can't quite remember )was a bit late, but it turned up."
So Fun~~,This place is so much fun~~~ The outdoor heated pools were so fun to swim around in the middle of winter. The price was a bit steep and they no longer have the Dr. fish but it is a fun place to spend the day~~
"Dr. Fish Pedicure at the Termeden Waterpark in Icheon, South Korea!","My husband had experienced a ""fish pedicure"" in Vietnam in the 1960s, and I wanted to experience this too! In my internet searches I learned that ""Dr. Fish"" is now all the rage in Japan, Korea, and Turkey, not just for pedicures, but for Psoriasis (which I have), too! I found Dr. Fish at the Termeden Waterpark in Icheon, South Korea thru the Tour2Korea website, and during our ""honeymoon"" week in Korea, we took a day and drove there; it's about an hour from Seoul. It's a great family ""German-style"" waterpark, in a lovely forest setting, and the facility is kept spotlessly clean. We got to swim under the waterfalls, soak in fruit-scented pools, enjoy the massaging jets of jacuzzis, have lunch, and then, steam ourselves pure in a traditional Korean sauna! My husband got a massage, but most importantly, we got to spend several glorious hours being nibbled on by hundreds of tiny Dr. Fishes! The giggling of the kids was the best part! We had a great day, and this is definitely a ""must do"", epecially for anyone who enjoys new spa experiences!"
