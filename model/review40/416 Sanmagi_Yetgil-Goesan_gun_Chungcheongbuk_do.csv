Beautiful Korean Scenery,"Sanmagi Yetgil, or Sanmagi Old Road, is an excellent place to spend a beautiful spring Sunday morning. I say morning because it would be unwise to wait until later when people start coming in by droves. Bus loads of Koreans descend on this place to do their hiking; and they take hiking very seriously!The mountains and the lake are pretty and reminds me of my home state of Virginia. The walk around one side of the lake is about 4 KM and most of the path is boardwalk. There is a boat you can take back to the starting point versus walking back the same way which is very nice. Cost is about W4,000/person.There are souvenir shops and restaurants available as well. It's a worthwhile trip and glad we did it! I rated it 4 (Very Good) instead of 5 simply due to the large numbers of people to deal with."
