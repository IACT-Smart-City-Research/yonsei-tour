"Hiking for a first time at Jangsan Mountain, Busan","We had a chance to go to Busan and Seoul, South Korea on 20th-27th April 2019. We decided to go to Busan for 3 days 2 night. We did a lot of outdoor recreation activities there e.g. cruising and hiking but the one of outdoor activities that we recommend you to do when you arrived at Busan is hiking. This activity is very popular for Korean people and foreigners because it was not too difficult to do and we didn’t have to prepare a lot of specific stuffs for hiking, we can wear only normal sneaker and proper attire for hiking. We did hiking at Jangsan Mountain where is the park surrounded by the forest, waterfall, and the natural scenic view. You can also see the Busan city view when you go almost to the top of the mountain. There is tourist information office, public map, insecticide spray service, sand dryer and public bathroom provided. During we walked to the top, we saw the caution of wildlife in the forest and you should not disturb them. You will get new Korean friends while you are hiking because Korean people are very kind and friendly. They will say hi to you all the way, they also look happy and enjoy with hiking. When you come back at the start point and feel so tired, there are a lot of local foods and drinks sell there and also have the area for take a rest. This activity is very recommended because it’s easy to go by public transportation and a lot of facilities provided. It’s not dangerous activity. The important thing is everyone should follow the rules and policy of the attraction respect of local people for making your activities goes well. We would like to recommend that the attraction should have the local guide who can speak English stand by there for facilitating foreigner tourists and should have a first aid service at the attraction if there is any accident."
First time of hiking,"This is my first time to went to South Korea. I went to Busan and went to Jangsan mountain for hiking. It's like the most adventure activity that I had done. At first I took Metro to Jangsan station and walk to exit 10 then I walked from the station to the start point of the mountain but I didn't walk alone I came with my friends. For the start point It has the spray for every hikers to protect the insect then we chosen the way to hike they separate into 3 way by levels which are yellow line, blue line and green line at the first we decided to go to the easier than the least but when we hiked for a while we got lost along the way because the sign is the Korean language we don't understand. It's too difficult to find the right way but it has a few of English sign so we used the translation in the application to help and we asked for the Korean hikers to help us. They tried to communicate and help us as well as they can then they brought us to the top that is the helicopter park so along the way wasn't easy to hike but everyone try the best to go to the top. All of us already pushed our limits to this hike and we really appropriate to the kindness of the Korean hikers. It was fun and good experience for hiking this time. Next time I hope to be there and go to the top again absolutely I will bring my friends to hike together."
Great workout for the legs,"We took the metro green line 2 from Seomyeon to Jangsan - 18 stops, about half hour ride, grab a seat soonest possible. Took Exit 10 and followed the main road (hint: head towards the mountain) to park entrance - about 15-20 min walk. A nice warmup to what's ahead, we walked up the road about another 20 mins to a large open area (hint: giant hula hoops). There are temples midway (hint: temple music & sounds). The waterfall was kinda non-existent - probably due to low rainfall. Go up the rocky steps (hint: hula hoops on your right, rocky steps on left). Else attempt the 45deg paved road - make sure you don't trip else it'd be a messy descent. There are milestones along the road for you to decide whether to go on the beginner/intermediate/advance trails. At one point, we came to barbed wire indicating land mines beyond the fence. We stayed on the right side. Funnily, as we passed one section, a booming voice came over the PA system - we reckon it was a reminder to stay on the path and not wander into the land mines. After a while seeing no one, we started to wonder whether we were on the right path. Fortunately a few locals, on their descent, told us to continue. We pushed on and finally reached the top. Fantastic view of Gwangandaeyo, Haeundae, Igidae. Couldn't see Oryukdo which was beyond a hill/island. Total time to & fro park entrance and mountain top was about 5 hours including meal & photo breaks. Great way to kick off our hiking vacation!Wear sturdy and comfortable hiking shoes with good grip a must."
Hard way- difficult to find right way,"I went last weekend to the top of Jangsan Mountain. It was a really nice view above Busan but difficult to find right way because of no signs at the way. In advance I had look at the Internet to find a description for the way. (Take Subway to Jangsan station and go out at exit 10. Then always straight on until you reach the Daecheon Park and than follow the way ""Peak""). Signs are very sporadic. So I had ask a married couple and they were so friendly that they allowed me to follow them :). I would recommend to climb to the top of mountain ☺ It was wonderful "
Nice walk,"This is a really popular place with locals. The paths are pretty wide and easy to walk, but some places get pretty steep. They label the difficulty of paths pretty clearly and there're little benches along the paths."
"Challenging for novices, but worth it for the view.","In mid-April this year, we climbed up this mountain. What a feat it was, for us novice climbers! We got lost along the way, but some basic Korean and friendly hikers made sure that we reached the peak, after 3 hours or so. Getting up was more challenging than it should have been because there were no signposts, and we often ran into dead corners/carparks. We also made a loop around north of the mountain instead of climbing directly up. Steep slopes and rocks made it rather tiring for us. We were glad to reach 200m within the peak, and we contemplated whether to go up or not. After persisting (in my opinion, the last 200m was the toughest part because of the rockiness), we were awarded with a beautiful view. We didn't stay long though, because we forgot to bring snacks and water up. Down we went by the proper route, crossing through closed eateries and encountering a wild dog along the way. In total, the hike was 6 hours for us.For future hikers: I would give directions, but we went by the longer route. The first part of the hike was fine, but it gets tougher nearer the peak. You MUST bring snacks up, because we ignored the advice from a blog, and couldn't really appreciate the peak properly due to our hunger. Good hiking shoes are highly recommended too. This is not an easy climb, but the satisfaction is worth it."
Trip to Jangsan,A Nice trip. Nice nature and a incredible view of the city when you reach the top. Near Heaundae beach. In the spring you can see a lot of flowers. In the summer it could be to hot. Don't forget to bring water. I recommend the walk☺️
Incredible Hiking a Stone's Throw Away from Haeundae,"I was pretty surprised when I noticed that this hike has not been added to TripAdvisor yet. This is one of my all time favorite places in Busan, mostly because it's so close to our front door. Jangsan or Jang Mountain is the large mountain that nestles Haeundae Beach. And believe it or not you can hike all the way to it's peak for an incredible view of the city and it's surroundings. This hike is super beautiful, although near the top it can be a little unsettling to see ""Danger Land Mine"" signs, but don't worry the area is barb wired off. For real though they weren't able to fully confirm complete removal of mines from the Korean War.There are a couple different routes to get to the top, the easiest to find is the riding the Subway to the Jangsan Station, leaving out of exit 12 and following the road until you get to the park. Once in the park just follow the signs for ""Peak."" It can be kind of confusing as sometimes the English on the signs goes away and you need to look for signs that say 장산 (Jangsan) or just ask a fellow hiker and they will point the way. The second way, and the better way in my opinion is taking the Subway to Dongbaek Station, and heading out of exit 4. Make a U-turn to the right out of the top of the stairs onto the sidewalk headed East. Walk about 100ft and you will see a small walkway tunnel on your left. Pass through it and take a right down a small gravel road to a small farming village surrounded by apartment buildings. Follow the gravel road till the end and turn left facing up the hill. You will see the start of a zigzag path that heads up the mountain. Take this path all the way to the peak, don't worry about the forks in the road, they all connect back together, but a good rule of thumb is always stay left. The hike itself can be challenging at times, and gets pretty steep in a lot of sections, round trip it's about 7-8miles so it's best if you set a whole afternoon aside to make it to the top. Also if you bring 1,000won there is a guy who always sells Popsicles at the top during the summer! It's a nice cooling reward for the effort! I would also make sure it's a clear day, the views are a lot better when there is blue sky. On a really, really clear day you can see Tsushima Island, Japan!"
