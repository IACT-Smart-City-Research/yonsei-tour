Beautiful garden must visit,The final destination of Paju day tour - garden is filled with European styed houses. Another Petite France Gapyeong! Feel very romantic even for family with children. Excellent place for photo shooting. Must visit!
Paju Provence Village,Go there in the evening will be great. Enjoy seeing all the lighting . Nice place. Suitable for teen and couple
The place is so pretty! ,"The place is so pretty! It’s a well-decorated French-European themed complex of stores, restaurants and hangout places. Recommended to come at night time so you can enjoy the pretty lights like I did "

A Fairytale Village,"I honestly loved this village! A gem hidden near DMZ definitely left me wanting to come back! This lovely place is filled with lots of cute cafes, shops and floral shops all round it ~ I would definitely recommend You going there at night, as the whole village turns into a magic place! I felt like I was in a fairytale ✨ Also perfect spot for couples and families <3"
Well made pretty village ,Small and colorful village built by the owner and the shops around are nice especially the bakery shop located in the enter of the village is so good and beautiful tasty
Pretty place,"Recently spent an evening here. Such a pretty place. Had a delicous Italian meal at ""Le Vine"" tasty and great service. Provence looks magical when all the fairy lights come on."
Little Gem near the DMZ ,"What a lovely gem of a French village!! We had a lovely traditional lunch here, followed with a blissful walk around the place. There are numerous coffee places, a lovely garden and lovely souvenirs to buy!"
Out of City,A must place to visit if you want to get out of Seoul. Slightly more than an 1 hour ride (train cum bus) to this place but it's a destination that you won't regret. Am sure this village will look fantastic when the night falls.
Better than Petite France ,"We took bus 2200 from Hapjeong station, and stopped at the bus stop outside Paju Provence Village. The bus frequency is about 15min, and the ride took about 40mins or so. On first glance, it looked really similar to Petite France. As we explored the area, we found quite a number of photo spots, as well as interesting cafes & gift shops. There's no entrance fee, so take your time to enjoy the place & take many photos! "
Visit together with Hairi village,"Provence itself is a thematic village with shops, cafes and restaurants but not worth the trip if by itself. Make sure you visit 2-3 other places nearby if you make it to Paju, such as Hairi village. "
Where I proposed!,"Unique place. I have travelled the whole world. Never seen something like this.7567890876 little lights cover the whole place. With a nice bridge, a castle in the middle of a sea of lights, some little stages with characters, ALL MADE WITH LIGHTS.The fee to go in is VERY CHEAP AND WORTH IT.Very romantic too. I proposed to my fiancee there! And outside the park, there are tons of places to eat and buy stuff. It's a very nice area."
Good for children ,"It's a location of the TV Show ""별에서 온 그대"".Good view at a glance but the detail suck!A lot of couples and families there...All of them takes photos. Not bad but no good!"
Beautiful small area ,This is a small village with few different shops and restaurants. Its well-known because of different korean dramas taking this area as video shooting scene. Not very far from Henryi Cultural village. Worth a short stay for leisure walking and having lunch
Nice lamp at evening,We went there on winter to see the lamp and indeed it was beautiful!But it was a long journey from Seoul and the buses are available on 30-60mins differences.We went to the bakery there and tasted the famous garlic bread. And it was delicious!!! But yeah a bit expensive : 6900won. But it definitely a must-taste in paju provence village!
I never seen such a place before.,I entered here while coming back from west beach. from the road I feel why all these light. But when i entered into the park i was surprised. I have seen the power of LED there. its place for lovers. All think are created by lights. I think during day time attraction might not be there. But in the night it was too good. There Eiffel tower made of LED dears and swans and many more. Lots of designated for clicking photos. Over all place was awesome.
Lovely village in winter,"I were quite proud of myself for getting to this place by public transport during my recent solo trip, I couldn't get the right walking way to this place after getting down from bus #2200 from Seoul, fortunately I met a friendly couple who have the same direction, I follow them for about 15 mins under the freezing weather of -2C , the walking path is uphill and down hill and I couldn't see anything interesting, until the helpful couple gesture to me that we had reached the point, a romantic beautiful panoramic scene with colorful low roof houses in front of me, I like this place very much though this is a fake village but due to the weather and all cute cafe, bakery store and zakka shops, my cold journey is much worth it. It's gorgeous when all lights up after sunset..there have shops selling homemade soaps and candles and others interior home items. This place is recommended for those who love slow life and a very nice place for photo taking."
Feel like Provence in Korea,Small colorful village in Paju. A lot of nice & lively buildings in this area. But it's quite a small. Some nice coffee & bakery shops in the area. In front of the entrance also have French Restaurant and Korean Restaurant.
"Lots of restaurants, good to relax","cute design and small paths are great to look around and the province village has some good shops. But i think it is expensive a little. And there are many kinds of restaurant around the village. I was lucky that I went to optopus restaurant served fresh one. By the way, there is a bakery shop famous for garlic bread. Unfortunately i forgot its name but you can find it easily for sure. Also you can do walk around there and good to relax with friends and family.I want to recommend to visit in spring or autumn! "
Kitschy and waste of time,"Why would anyone want to go to South Korea to see a fake French village? Well, apparently many do because it was in a tour program I was unfortunately on. This place is a tourist trap of colorful shops designed and grouped together to look like a town in Provence. Hence, the name. There you will find ice cream, restaurants, souvenirs, cosmetics, and all sorts of outlet clothing and leatherware. This place offers some fun photo ops but nothing more. Very avoidable."
Paju provence village,"I was there during the Spring, it was a quiet village, I had a chance to take my time to admire the beautiful buildings and scenery when I was having my hot tea on the second floor of a cafe there. It's not a huge area, you only need around an hour or so to walk around the whole area. Find a cafe and sit there to enjoy the quietness."
Nice & Simple,"Very good restaurants within the village, which has an English theme! Food was simple, beer was great. Fresh Seafood!"
