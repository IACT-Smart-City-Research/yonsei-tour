Nice day trip from Seoul,"This was a really nice day trip from Seoul, with opportunity for some basic hiking or resting on the beach. It felt quite authentic too, with not too much influence from tourism, though the downside was that nobody spoke English. To get here, I took the free maglev train from Incheon airport to Yongyu, then crossed the road and took bus no 1, which crossed the road bridge onto the island. It stops at multiple points on the island and I took it right to the south part. There are some restaurants and coffee shops on the island, though do not expect them to speak English! Stopped off at Holly's coffee on the way back to enjoy a view of the island from the mainland. The island is free to get on."
Do Not Come to Muuido Island,"Honestly, I don't know what the other people saying ""must visit"" were thinking. Muuido Island is fundamentally not set up for foreign tourists. There is literally no information on the island to help find your way around and the sites are, well, bland. The restaurants don't speak English (and are far and few between anyway), the island bus is extremely crowded and uncomfortable, I found the whole experience to be entirely lacking. The best fun that I had was feeding the local stray cat with octopus jerky that I bought in desperation from the store. When I got back to Incheon Airport, I felt to relieved.To be fair: if you are a hiker or a trekker, by all means, follow the long paths and enjoy the scenery. If you have a car, great, by all means enjoy. If you're a casual tourist like me, trying to get out of the big city, this is not the right experience for you. If Muuido Island puts up some minimal information about what to expect or how to find your way around, that would make an immense difference. For everyone else, Avoid, Avoid, Avoid."
Muuido musings ,"Catch the 2-1 or 222 bus fromTerminal 1, 3rd floor, exit 7. 2-1 drops you before bridge, 222 after bridge (I took the 2-1 & just walked it from there as not too hot). Super busy at weekends, but very pleasant on a Monday. Best to stay at Hanagae or Silmi. Not much online to pre-book, but plenty here when you arrive. Restaurant menus nearly all in Korean - bring a translation book if you need help! Great food though, and plenty of little markets to stock up on snacks, beer and water. Campers, bring your tent! Perfect place to relax with friends. The bridge has been open for 3 months now, so it gets very busy with locals from Incheon at weekends. A lot of hikers come here (great trails starting from south end of Hanagae - don’t attempt in flip flops! There’s a bit of scrambling up to be done). There’s still quite a lot of construction going on around the island, and I imagine in a few months time, it’ll probably be geared up for foreign tourists (good or bad? Not sure)The no.1 bus will take you around the island - it comes around every 30 mins from all the key places. The tide does go out about a mile - so check before going if you’re making a short trip, as if out, you may be disappointed! "
Must visit,Since the bridge between Incheon and Muuido Island was opened it is easy to visit. Bus one is running to all important places and must see spots on the Island. Just remember to take cash as the ATM does not take international cards
Muyi Island in Incheon,"A little island which is near Incheon International Airport. Maybe, this island will be connected to the land by a bridge. A little trekking in Little Muyi Islet and near Hanagae Beach are recommended in this area. But Silmi Islet which is well known from a movie is not recommended. There are entry fees in entering Hanagae Beach and Simi Islet."
Great place to visit and very hospitable people!,"I went here to explore what Hanagae Beach offers and actually to see a perfect sunset. It's a beautiful beach with a more than 90 ft. tall tower, huts you can rent, ATVs for rent, PFD rental place, a board walk that goes along the rock formations to the left of the beach, and some restaurants, a small market store, and nice trails to walk/jog/take pictures in. And did you all know, this island's claim to fame is the setting of a Korean drama show? lol I don't exactly know what the show is about but they have the house at Hanagae beach with pictures of the actors on the windows and the entrance. Praises for okiecb for putting really good info about Muuido Island! Another info I want to add is there is a bridge getting built. As of 23rd June 2018, it's about 80 percent complete. So to get to Muuido, you have to take the ferry to cross over from Jamjindo Island (mainland). Warning, 8 PM is the last ferry that crosses over from Muuido to Jamjindo, SO DON'T GET STUCK in the island like I did! lol! I had to pay 30,000 won for one night to rent a small hut. It has heated floor, two sliding window, a sliding door, a light, and 4 blankets and 4 pillows. I was lucky enough to meet some good folks there as well! These dudes offered me Korean BBQ, some Soju, whiskey and some Cass beer! Had a blast and a half!!!! Visit this island, get stuck if you want, but be ready to make some friends!! It's definitely worth your while! P.S. I didn't get to see the sunset because of clouds blocking the horizon lo! thank you Mother Nature!!"
Ice on the beach,"What a wonderful place to visit in winter. Very easy access via the car ferry (24,000 Won return trip). Some wonderful beaches which at the time I visited were frozen into a winter wonderland."
Very beautiful place!,"We spent 3 days camping on the beach and I have to say it was gorgeous! There are several activities to do at the place, asides from swimming in the ocean; there is a huge zip line that costs only 15 dollars per person, and I have to say, I am not acrophobic but it was REALLY high. You can pick seashells, I got some pretty impressive ones (and we even had a seashell showoff, I won). Moreover, there was a number of people who were catching clams while the tides were low, and in the end, finders keepers, they got to eat all the clams they found! How jealous... And lastly, there is a tiny stable with two horses, which you can take a nice horse ride along the shoreline and back. A memorable experience."
Hanagae Beach Muuido Island,"We spend 24 hours at Muuido island at the Hanagae beach mid of September 2015. The island itself is cloth to incheon airport. You can approach the island only by ferry or swimming. The bridge construction started and probably finished after 2017. However the ferry boat can load around 40-50 cars. A car round trip cost you 29000 Won. The ticket needs to be purchased before entering the ferry. Ticket booth is close to the entry point. Probably you can reach that area also by bus. Waiting time at this Saturday morning was just 20 Minutes. The ride takes you 10 Minutes and don’t forget the special shrimp cracker to feed seagulls. Many people use this island for fishing and hiking. The island itself is not very big. Hanagae beach has parking facilities. We had booked a small cottage in advance. Additionally you have to pay entrance fee for the beach area. If I am not mistaken a 1000 Won per person. The cottage is equipped with small kitchen (incl.ref, micro wave, rice cooker, sink), ondol room 20 square meter, ondol bed stuff and small 00. Outside you have a small terrace with table, chairs and fire place for barbecue. You have also other choices which you can find at the web page. There are couple of restaurants serving fish mainly. They were not very busy at this time. No any 7/11 at the beach. We found one C&U at the ferry port. During day time there was low tide and few people came to look for mussels. At the beach you can rent a quad 15000 Won for 20 minutes but you cannot leave beach and you cannot go to sea side. Consequently was not our first choice. To be honest I did not see one people driving a quad. There is one tower (something like 15 meter high) were you can go down along a wire rope. Length around 400 meter. One ride 13000 Won. Equipment will be provided there. Most of the people had fun. Only one old lady was screaming like hell. LoL. Obviously Hanagae beach has been also used for some Korean soap drama. Finally it is a nice place for a group adventure were kids could have fun together and the oldies as well. No one was complaining about barbecue and campfire at the beach. We left Sunday early morning back to town and there was no much going on traffic wise. Between ferry and Hanagae beach we visited a new caffee shop which obviously just opened. Nice place with a nice terrace where you can look at all the planes coming in or going out. Coffee, Tea and waffle were good. It is definetly a place for stop over. They also offer camping and lodge. English was no problem at the coffee shop but at Hanagae beach. We may come back one day to Muuido."
One of the greatest tracking course is here!,"This small island is very close to the Incheon airport, there are 2 small beaches which you can enjoy swimming, some season you can collect sea shell at there, but the most great thing that I recommend you to do here is the TRACKING across the entire island, the total duration will be 3~4 hours as a round-trip by up & down several hills which heights are less than 200m. No entrance fee for the tracking but you need some money to use a ship which deliver you to the island from the main island(Airport area)"
Short trip from the bustling city life.,Great place to go for the weekend. You can rent a hut on the beach for cheap. Best time to go is in the spring or fall when not that many people are there.
Great easy getaway from Seoul!,"Visited mid-week (Thurs-Sat). Had a great time and the beach to ourselves. Saturday the crowds started in.Not the most pristene beach we have seen. The tide fluxuation is extreme....like the water is 3/4 of a mile away at low tide, but was still cool to walk that far out and explore the sea bed.Zipline and 4 wheeler rental is beachside as well as good hiking on the island.Make the trip, you won't be disappointed!Basic info as of August 2015: Freeway tolls to from Seoul: 7,600 Won each way. Car Ferry: 30,000 Won roundtrip plus 1,000 won per person I think. Takes about 10 minutes to make the crossing.Beach fees: 2,000 won per person.Beach hut rentals: 40,000 won/night plus 10,000 key deposit.Little cabins as pension rooms also available, my guess is 60,000 won or more per night.Zipline was 13,000 and is about 400 meters long, 70-80 feet tall.4 wheelers were 15,000 won for 20 minutes.Showers are available for a small fee, cold water only.Bathroom clean, no problems.Several places to eat right on the beach, most serving seafood.Small store with basics as well."
transportaion,In response to the person who had to walk to the ferry. There is a bus that goes all the way. You need to ask at the airport as I am sorry but I do not remember which bus it was. You might want to have your own toilet paper on hand.Becky
Relaxing Gem,Went to Muuido on a Friday. Took the car Ferry and drove to Hanaggae beach. Even though it was low tide...the clamming and relaxing walks were memorable. Great sand and the fresh pine smells were wonderful! Next time I will rent a bungalow. Recommend this gem of a place to decompress.
Hanagae Beach- Meh,"I went to Muuido, expecting a ""western"" definition of a beach, and I was very disappointed. I caught the bus from the airport to the ferry (Don't believe the websites that claim they can take you from Incheon station, they lie) walked 20 minutes to the ferry (it was a narrow road, make sure the cars can see you as you walk) and took the ferry to the island. From the ferry station, I took a bus to Hanagae ""beach."" Then I spent 30 minutes at the ""beach"" before deciding to go home. No swimming, no tanning for me. On the plus side the food smelled divine on the Island and the whole journey cost about 10 dollars round trip."
So Muuido,Don't stop at Muuido Island! Take the shuttle bus on the roller coaster ride to the last little village on Muuido Island there you will find a surprise! Beyond the big seafood restaurant is a span bridge built in 2010 so that you can walk across to So Muuido Island. A tiny fishing village hugs the shore but if you follow the sign post in the middle of the village up the hill you will see tiny gardens on both sides of the path full of red pepper plants and houses painted with murals. At the top is a church and community centre. Over the hill you wander down to the seashore. Such contrasts - the old houses and a very large new museum. The design appears to replicate waves! The museum tells the story of this significant village. Just make sure you don't go on Monday as museums etc. are closed that day in Korea. For nature lovers there are stairs that lead farther up the hill above the village and around the side. Great view of the sea and very quiet!
Good island to visit in Incheon -'Muuido (Muui island)',"Muuido(무의도) is located very close from Yeongjoungdo(영종도) where Incheon airport is located.So it only takes about 30 minutes to get to the ferry terminal(잠진도 선착장) from the airport. Muuido is very peaceful island and it's good island to experience the Korean Island.Since Muuido is not that big and far away, you can enjoy some beaches and mountains in a day.Muuido is also famous for the shooting place for movies.You can read more details on my blog.http://fun-incheon.blogspot.kr/2014/06/good-island-to-visit-in-incheon-muuido.html"
Good place for camping,"Most people seem to take the ferry out early in the morning for either day hiking, or spending the day at the beach. If you camp for the night, you can take the ferry out early afternoon and there's no line. Then there's no line out the following morning. I should note most of the eating establishments on Hanagae Beach look like hepatitis or food poisoning waiting to happen. We brought our own food and were glad we did. Also, I think the cabins on the beach are a rip off - mostly foreigners do those. If you have your own camping gear, take your car across on the ferry and save money!"
