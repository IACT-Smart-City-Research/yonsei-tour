Love coming here,"I absolutely love coming here. I usually go to the plant market that is open during the day. I got a lot of my plants from the market at reasonable prices. The place is huge, and it is quite nice to tour it as well as it takes you in a tropical trip away from Seoul. I brought my guest here in October just to show around and she was very pleased with the green atmosphere. She found the people working there pleasant and kind and had a great experience. I will definitely be back in the future. Thinking of getting my Christmas fix here as well. "
Nice Assortment,"We went to this place hoping to buy air plants. Nope, Korea is not the place for this so it seems.. hahhaha BUT, we nonetheless enjoyed our visit. There are a lot of different types of flora here including the carnivores like the venus and pitcher plants that prey on insects. The prices are a bit high but maybe it is also because we went on a Sunday with limited stalls open. They have a comfort room adjacent to the greenhouses (Grocery building) and very accessible via bus."
Huge Flower/Plant Market Centre,"We went there on a Monday morning and discovered the following :1) Use Exit 4 of Yangjae Citizen's Forest Station of the Sin Bundang Line. Walked about 10mins. south east along the main road. The market centre is on the right. There is a 2-storey wholesale auction building, two 1-storey huge white canvas tent for plants and a 1-storey building at the rear for cut flowers.2) We spent the most time in the two 1-storey huge white canvas tent looking at plotted plants. They sell mainly orchids, succulents and air plants. Others are more exotic imported and local plants. It is definitely worth the visit if you like plants or cut flowers."
"""Candy"" Store for the Floral Lover","This is the most well-organised and clean flower market I have visited in my life. For a flowers lover, it is akin to stepping into the candy store. Even as a non-resident, I managed to get some cut-flowers & potted herbs to be used as a present for my Korean friend. I deliberately arrived at 12noon because it is hard for me to restraint buying fresh cut flowers. Totally enjoyed the visit!! Fresh cut flowers section :- Up to 1pm- At the far end, away from the main road-double-storey : upstairs, you can find fresh and artificial flowers, baskets, ribbons etc At the other sections, there are succulents and potted plants. All kinds!! bAccess:Line 3 Exit 7. Upon exiting, just walk straight. You will see people carrying lots of wrapped flowers. "
Search for succulents,"Loved the range of succulents available, big & small. It was hard to only come away with 7 small ones to bring home. Wish this place also has a variety of pots & plant accessories."
"Gorgeous flowers, fresh air, peaceful place","Googled for flower markets and found this one in Seocho. It's actually really near Gangnam and all but doesn't look like it. The surrounding neighbourhood is very quaint and quiet and perhaps cause it's near a mountain (not sure of the name) but the air is super fresh and cool. It's a short walk from Exit 4 of yangjae citizen's forest shinbundang line. First thing that hits you besides the fresh air is that there are really little people walking around (so rare in seoul). So there's plenty of space! the market consists of several areas joined together and there are plenty of orchids, trees, flowers to see. Absolutely gorgeous. If you are a flower/nature lover like me, you'd probably like it too. We spent around 2 hours there and it was just so nice. If you lived in Seoul and would like to buy flowers for your home, this would be the place to go. They are pretty cheap and there's a wide variety. The shop owners are also very helpful."
Good Place for Flower,"You can see all flower.And, Yon can smell the scent of a flower if you go to there when Spring or Fall.I recommend it if you love flower.And, You can use subway ""Sinbundang Line""."
A very beautiful place!!,"Found this place while surfing the web looking for plant markets. Took the short drive out on Saturday and was not disappointed. Very easy access off IC 1 just 25 minutes or so south of Seoul. There is anything and everything plant or garden related out here all in full bloom and gorgeous. Plenty of parking (rare in Seoul). We spent about 2 hours or so, parking was only W2500, which is less than $2.50. Indoor, outdoor, tropical, dirt, planters, water gardens…….you name it them have it. Stall and stall of vendors, inside and out. Make the drive and you will not be disappointed. Right next to Yangjae Citizen’s Forest which looked beautiful as well. We will allow more time on the next trip to spend some time there as well! "
Orchid's Kingdom,"The Yangjae flower market is not only a good place to buy flowers and herbs, but also a nice escape from the hustle of the big city. Once inside, the first thing we notice is the silence. The market is constituted from several connected halls, in which one can find almost every kind of plant and flower, trees, and also some herbs. Unfortunately, there seems to be no particular organization of the halls by type of plants / flowers, so it may take some time to find specific items.Since the halls work as green houses, it is really warm inside."
For those who like flowers,"I was curious to know how the wholesale flower market is like for the late winter and early spring time. So we took the train especially to go this market which is about an hour away from our hotel.One thing for traveller to note. For cut flowers wholesale market which is next to the potted plants wholesale, it closes before 1 pm. So go there early. This is a season of freesia and thus I saw many of this in the market and even along Insading flower truck that paddle and sellFlowers in the evening."
