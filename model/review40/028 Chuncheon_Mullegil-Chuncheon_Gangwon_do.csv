Peaceful activity,Nice peaceful activity on the calm waters of Uiam Lake...Staff run through the basics and you get about 40 minutes to paddle around the lake...
The perfect place to refresh your mind!,"You can relieve your stress by enjoying the nature around it while you go canoing. Before you start canoing, the staffs will teach you before how to do it and all the safety regulations. So don't worry! it's really safe. There will be staffs standing by around to help you if you're having a hard time. Comfortable clothes are also recommended!"
