Lovely afternoon experience ,"Home of the oldest original building from the compound, our kids enjoyed learning about the history. We also hiked the trails behind to see the city walls and shrine."
Great to see as part of the walls walk.,"Great to see as part of the walls walk. Renovated well , similar to those in Seoul but less in size and beauty."
Trip through time and away from modern Seoul,"ONLY VISIT IF YOU ARE UP FOR A LONG METRO RIDE AND A LONG WALK TO THE HWASEONG FORTRESS! This place was in my top 3 of things to do and was well worth the 1 hour metro ride. Take the blue line (1) or the yellow line (B) to Suwon station. There you look for the Novotel busstop and take busline for about 15 minutes (6 stops) and you are there. I wanted to see a historic site not in between the modern office buildings and got exactly what I wanted, with lush vegetation and enough space around it to really take in the historical significance of the site. It´s a smaller palace than the Gyeongbokgung Palace, but less visited so you have all the time of the world to get lost in the labyrinth of little streets and buildings. With the green hill always in the background it really takes you to the past. Don´t be mistaken, it´s a long ride to get here and if it was just the palace I wouldn´t have done it.......but it´s the Hwaseong fortress around the palace that makes this place really worth the visit. And that means: a lot of walking and steps up the hill!"
Great 2 hours or so to catch a little history,"I visited the Hwaseong Palace on a very rainy Sunday, but enjoyed the experience anyway. Admission is quite inexpensive. You can take a guided tour, or just wander the complex on your own. Some areas have descriptive markers, including in English, and several displays of room furnishing, clothing, etc. Tour around the local Fortress walls as well, and meander over to Fried Chicken street for lunch when you are done!"
Nice palace,"It's not as great as the palaces in Seoul, but it's worth a visit (the tickets are cheap). The part I liked most was the martial arts performance in front of the main gates."
Not that special if you've already been through palaces in Seoul,"It's a palace in the center of Suwon Hwaseong Fortress. Good to talk a look and learn history.- Suwon Hwaseong is basically free to access. And I think this is only place to pay except museums.- Haenggung is a temporal area to stay for a king. Jeongjo, the 22nd king of Joseon Dynasty ordered to build this. And you can find the portraits of his travel to here in many places.- At Sinpungnu Pavilion which is the entrance, there's the performance of soldiers at 11 am. It's fun to watch. But, you don't need to cancel other schedule for this.- It's basically nothing special comparing to other palaces in Seoul. If you aren't new to palaces of Joseon Dynasty, you may feel bored. The wish tree near the entrance was good by the way. And the pine trail in the back of the place is nice to walk.- It's a lot of walk inside. Especially, the rear area is on a hillside. Comfortable shoes are recommended."
Interesting historical site,"We thoroughly enjoyed walking the area, seeing the beautiful buildings and colors. there were men flying big kites that added to the interest. Also there was an archery range that seemed a bit too close for comfort"
Incredible palace ,There were very view tourists around while we visited the magnificent palace. Good background English information for main buildings. Lots of wonderful places inside the palace.
Great Sights of Palace Grounds,"For 1500 won for an adult, it is worth the value. We saw how an ancient Korean palace is like, and get up close with the various facilities of the ancient palace. Just be careful of your head as you get through some doorways as it's rather low!"
Worth a visit,"While it is not as big as the Palace in Seoul, the little traveling palace is worth the 1500 won admission fee. I met the nicest volunteer guide there who showed me the most efficient route to cover the key points on the Fortress."
Catch the martial arts demonstration,"The fortress itself isn’t anything special if you’ve been to one of the Seoul’s palaces. Having been a temporary palace, it is smaller in size and no notable structures within its grounds. Visit to the palace is worthwhile if timed with one of the performances at the main gate. We were there for the 11am martial arts demonstration which mostly consisted of sword fighting. First half looked almost like choreographed dance routines but the second half consisting of chopping off bamboo columns and straw stacks was exciting to watch."
Back in time .. joseon period,"The attractive point of the Palace is the reproduction of some typical scenes with wax caracters from the Joseon period in some rooms (kitchen, music instruments, prince reading, soldiers attire, some games at the entrance, etc)"
Having my Jewel in the Palace moments,Pros:- quiet place- not crowded (encountered less than 10 tourist during my visit)- can be combined with the Suwon Hwaseong Fortress Wall tour
Make sure you catch the martial arts display,"The palace was well worth visiting with its many buildings and displays but the highlight for me was the martial arts display that takes place at 10 am each day and lasts about 30 minutes. This is free and takes place outside the gates, while there is a small fee to pay to enter the palace. There are several small displays of characters going about their duties 200 years ago. I guess this is the reason why so many tourists come to Suwon, and if you decide yo visit i can guarantee you will enjoy it."
Part of visit to Hwaseong fortress,"The palace is less busy than those in Seoul but is worth a visit esp when doing the circuit round the fortress walls. This was where King Jeongjo honoured his mother by having a banquet for her 60th birthday. It was also a base for the King when he travelled to visit the remains of his father, Prince Sado. Away from the main buildings, there is a shrine and second courtyard. Absolutely beautiful building and hardly any tourists there so we could take in the place at our own pace. "
Historical site,"The moving palace is mostly destroyed by fire during the japanese invasion and korean war and was restored. The only building in its original condition is building 12 on the map. .Nonetheless it is still a site to visit to learn more of the joesan dynasty. It is best to go with a guide so as to appreciate the site more. There is 600 year old wishing tree in the palace. Do write your wishes on the paper providedPls also visit hwaseong fortress, a unesco world heritage site, which is nearby. "
Small but worth a couple of hours,"We arrived to catch the free martial arts show at 11am. The palace is small so it doesn’t take long to explore. Without having any background information to your visit, you will have lost the pleasure of learning some horrific Korean history and the reconciliation that came much later. So do some homework, read about Prince Sado and his son, Jeongjo. (I love a good tragedy)A walk along the fortress completes the visit.Tip: start early if you want to avoid the hot sun. Hats and sunblock pleaseTip: you can grab a simple lunch nearby. We had yummy bibimbap.Tip: you can purchase cold drinks from the nearby convenience store"
Beautiful Palace built for the kings 60 year old mother,This is a beautiful Palace built for the King’s 60 year old mother. There is artwork at the back depicting all (?) 6000 people and 1900 horses who came here with the King from Seoul. All but one of the buildings have been extensively restored/recreated.There is a 25 minute exhibitions military prowess during the Dynasty in the front at designated times.
Beautiful palace,"The entry was free on weekend I arrived, and a dance team showed excellent sword fight dance at entrance"
Well presented ,We were fortunate to go at midday when it was quiet. Even the school parties were outside at that timeQuite substantial inside though less ornate than the palaces in Seoul. However nice to see this without hordes of people
Very interesting,The palace is well preserved and there are many exhibits that show how life in the palace was at the time.Well worth a visit.
Excellent experience,"I really enjoyed my visit and though in the blistering cold, it was worth every minute. Amazing example of Korean imperial life. It really offers a journey through time and teaches you a lot not only about Korean history, but also about Korean culture and traditions. "
Another stop on your South Korea Trip,"This is a nice attraction for family and kids, where you can learn about the Korean history. This is a self pace tour and I do believe they offer listening devices that cal tell you more about the different portions of the palace. It took me and my friend about 1 1/2 hours of walking the entire palace. I did enjoyed learning a little more about the history of Korea and this is why I recommend that you visit the Hwaseong Haenggung Palace."
Hwaseong Haenggung Palace - Heritage of Korea,"I visited the Hwaseong Haenggung Palace in Sep'17. It is also known as the summer place. It was a surprise for me because being from India, I am used to seeing palaces built in spectacular grandeur, grand arches, palace grounds, beautiful architecture and so on :-)The Hwaseong Haenggung Palace is a very good example of Korean ancient architecture style and anyone who is a history buff would love the place. The palace is well maintained and is a must visit."
In the middle of Hwaseong Fortress,"Its is in the middle of Hwaseoung Fortress. You are allowed to walk in everywhere, not the place where you can only look not touch, but if we compare places what I saw in Seoul, there palaces were much bigger. But as a part of complex, its perfect."
Live Korean history,"This enormous reconstructed palace is definitely well worth a visit but you do need a guide to make sense of it. It covers a huge area and gives you a good idea about royal lifestyles at the end of the 18th/ beginning of 19th centuries. I did not know that it was King Jeongjo himself who created the written Korean language because he considered the Chinese, spoken and written up until then, as too complicated. We were lucky enough to catch a martial arts performance which is colourful and dramatic."
The most beautiful Hanggung in Korea,"Haenggung is a temporary palace/ accommodation for the king when he went out of town. Hwaseong Haenggung is the most beautiful Hanggung is Korea. There is a mural tiles shows up the royal ceremony. And also some spots of the K-Drama scenes, Dae Jung Geum (Jewel in the Palace). On weekend, there are some traditional performance in front of the entrance too."
You can relate this to the Korean soap opera,"The first thing we visited Suwon was to come to see the Hwaseong HaengGung. The palace is relative small compared to those in Seoul and there is no admission fee. There are site maps (in many languages) at the entrance. It helps you to navigate the palace.Due of its small size, it is easy to go around the whole palace within a short among of time. There are life-size models of maids and servants in some of the rooms (kitchen, living room, classroom), which make it fun to look at. In the court yard, there are also 2 life-size models of the main characters of a very well know Korean soap opera. Many people take pictures with them."
Good alternative,"Stunning architectural wonders. So beautiful and peaceful. A must visit when you go to Suwon and when you have a day to spare during your visit in Seoul. It's only 30 minutes away from Seoul by speed train from Seoul Station. There was a tree in this place that's 600 years old. This place has rich in history. Allot one to two hours to visit this place. Lots of good angles for perfect photos. I highly recommend this place. From Suwon Station, take Bus 13 infront of Novotel hotel. It takes 15 minutes bus ride 1,300 korean won."
Mostly Stroller friendly,Nice place to take kids and was central square was awesome. So much going on outside. Suggest you fly a kite and join in the fun. Also a nice grassy hill to slide down in back so bring a bean bag sack or hard plastic lid. Fun!
Worth the Long MRT Ride,"Our original reason for visiting this place was because of the actor Park BoGum. His little bombastic dance in the teaser for ""Love in the Moonlight"" was shot here. My younger sister is such a fan so we included this in our itinerary. Anyway, it was such a long MRT ride from our base stop in Jongno (26 stations) and we were standing the whole time (good thing, my mum, being the senior citizen, was the only person who got the luxury to sit the whole time). From the Suwon MRT station, after eating lunch, we took a taxi and we were dropped right in front of the palace.That time, no entrance fee was collected. They were on a promo, I think. What we only paid for was the stamp paper (we got two for KRW 1000) and it made us checked the whole of the palace grounds (even the nooks and corners) just to see the 10 king's seal and complete the stamp game. I find it fun because most of the seals are well hidden. I'm a geek so it's like finding treasures for me. =)Another attraction there is the 600-year old Zelkova tree. There's a pad paper there where you can write your wishes and then tie it around the tree. I think they deem that tree as lucky.At the back of the palace, there's this stone stairs and if you dare take the hike, you'll see a gazeebo at the top of the mountain. We no longer challenged ourselves to do that because we got an aging mum (lol) but to all those who can, I think, you must try it. =)"
World UNESCO Heritage place,"Out of the capital city, Seoul, if you want find the famous place with the sad history, this is the place. This is one of the UNESCO world heritages and it's worth to visit. "
"Well laid out internally, worth a visit","It was refreshing to find a palace that showed how life was inside the palace buildings long ago (most palaces visited were almost bare rooms), with fixtures and furnishings, and mannequins dressed up. There is a tourist office just outside the palace entrance and the palace itself had information (not sure but there might be guided tours available). We spent just over an hour there as we had to move on to walk around the city fortress walls, which surround the palace. We took a train from Seoul, then a taxi from Suwon station."
To see if you visit the fortress of Suwon,"If you visit the fortress of Suwon which is at 30Km from Seoul, stop seeing the Hwaseong Haenggung palace. This charming small palace with dependences near the mountain is worth a stop. You can join it by bus since the train station."
Historical Fortress,"I knew of this place after watching The Throne (Sado, 2015) and being aware of King Jejong, his father & his grandfather's way of ruling. I was aware that this place was rebuild as a replica. The layout is pleasant and does not require much of walking around. I caught the martial arts show at the entrance and it was impressive. Does not require entrance fee.The fortress surrounds it is unique and i can see a lot of modern city re-planning build around this place."
The story background of the place and construction is important,The Hwaseong fortress and HaengGung could be not so much impressive if you are not aware of the story behind the the construction of this late 17th century buildings. King Jeongjo and his father's sad story will improve your appreciation of these buildings and sites. Don't miss the read the story in advance the visit the sites.
Worth a look if you have time,If you have enjoyed the palaces of Seoul you may be a little disappointed as it is less of the same. That said it is well kept and beautifully restored with small information boards and costumed figurines. The circular walk around the city wall makes the trip worth it and enjoyable.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful.
It's not bad but.,It's kind of restored house. It's good to see by itself but I felt I watched not real thing like replica. There's a zelkova tree which is six hundred years old and people put a note written their wishes on the fence.
Shrine,"This is a small shrine. Around the fortress, or outside i should say. Closes around 5 pm. Looks really nice from up the hill"
good historic palace,"Nicely restored palace. Many of the rooms have been staged to demonstrate their function in the past. Fairly large complex, we were with a guide, so all the history really helped the tour."
Could be much better,"Rather pleasant for a short walk, but has a somewhat empty and barren feel to it compared to other similar places in the area. Little info provided, be sure to ask for an audio guide. Go see the 'emergency palace' in Namhansanseong."
Weekend trip,I went there when touring the Fortress. It is a great place as part of the musuem and fortress in Suwon. Go there. 
Nice and intersted visit lots to learn,"This was part of our one day tour, after going around the fortress we stop here, for the information that our tour guide gave us this was a place of one of the pass rules of South Korea. It is actually relatively large. Also if you have little ones they can go around with a map given to them to stamp each area visited. They also have a show in front of the palace. "
quieter version of palaces in Seoul,"Very quiet on a winter day (just after Christmas). The sightseeing bus around the palace was shut, so walked the site on foot, thereby missing out the fortress. The palace itself is fairly compact, though not many interiors to see. (To see furnished interiors, go see the palaces in Seoul. Then go see the museums for original artefacts.) There was, however, an appeal to costumed K-drama and some food-themed re-created exhibits. Can be done in 30-45 minutes (incl. detour to the hillside gazebo overlooking the palace)."
"If you love history and Jewel in the Palace, go here","Got interested to visit this place because first, it's the place where Dae Janggeum or Jewel in the Palace was filmed (kitchen scene). Second, it's a UNESCO as a world cultural heritage site. I guess those 2 reasons are good enough for us to go on a 1 hr and 30 minutes travel outside Seoul City. =)So many interesting sites to see and the lovely maple and pine trees around the area is a sight to behold. I suggest going there on a weekday so place won't be too crowded. They have several fun and interesting activities for the whole family every weekend (you can wear Jewel in the Palace costumes) so if that's your thing, then go and brave the big crowd. But if you just want to walk quietly, seat on the grass underneath the pine trees, then going on a weekday, just before lunch, is the best time to visit Haenggung Palace. We did not visit the fortress anymore because it has a different entrance fee and we're tired of too much walking already."
My Visit to Korea ,Visiting my son who was based in Korea. Such a beautiful place admire the tradition and the cleanliness. So much history. Worth be listed on places to see on your bucket list. Checked off on mine now ✈️✈️
Daechang Gum movie scene,This palace is not as spectacular as those in Seoul but still very great. It's nice to know that most of scenes in the TV series Daechang Gum set in here
Must see,"If you happen to have an extra day, go to Suwon City for a visit and drop by Hwaseong HaengGung before exploring Hwaseong Fortress. I think most of the buildings there have already been rebuilt but it's still interesting to see."
Great Martial Arts Display,There aren't many of the original buildings that survived the occupation but the restoration does give a sense of the culture and history. There are demonstrations of martial arts and music sessions which are well worth seeing
Small palace in city,It's a small palace easily access from the train station via taxi or bus. I am not particular impress with the architecture but the show is quite attractive. There are kids activities like painting inside if your kids like those sort of things. Anyway I think it's still worth a visit. 
Timepass place,Its good. Need around 1-2 hours to visit. Entry fees is around 1000 won. shows the ethenic korean culture.
Unimpressed ,New architecture made to look old just not impressive. Activities for young kids inside like painting and bead work so would be fun for them but if you're solo or don't care about kids activities or mannequins skip the cheap entry fee and stay left at entry through the public parking lot and climb the hill like many locals do. Short climb but steeper and could be difficult with young children or those who are not in somewhat fit condition. There are stairs or a winding road which would be tough but better for strollers. Halfway up you can get the 'dragon train' tour or just walk the rest of the steps up to the top. If you're moving at a decent pace total time up from parking lot around 20-30 min. When ya get to the top great views of suwon and multiple paths to take in and around the hill. I'd avoid the 'fortress quarters' and climb up and check it out 
Warrior dance was the highlight!,Don't miss the warrior dance routine in the morning (it was 11am when we visited). Other that that there was nothing remarkable about the complex. Its seemed repetitive at times. The feast display was interesting. The Budha temple nearby was good.
Palace in the middle of city center,It is a well-reserved palace and you can walk along with the city wall which is surrounding the city center and the palace. You can find a big market place near this palace and can taste many kinds of traditional menu.
A nice stop before climbing Hwaseong Fortress ,This place is free if you add it as a friend on Kakaotalk. It's not huge but it was a good taste of Korean culture. You can get some cool pictures here. I especially liked the rooms of the kings in their hanboks and you can also get a great view of a pagoda on the mountain from the temple. There's also a place where you can rent a hanbok and get a picture of you in one. 
Okay for history buffs,"Perhaps it was the weather - gloomy, dark and cloudy- but the palace architecture was dull and did not impress me. From the point of history, yes, it might be interesting for some people as there's plenty of palace intrigue, as explained by the guide."
Not so great,"If you are a history lover and are interested to get acquainted with Korean history, then you must visit this place. Otherwise you will be bored. This is called temporary palace and I would say palace is too big a word to describe it. Atleast those who have visited even a very few number of palaces in India would agree with that.But they have put mannequins there to visualize the royal life of the old times, which is good as you can understand that on your own without the need of any guide.There is a tree at the entrance which is considered sacred. According to the local legend, cutting down the tree or its branches is a bad omen but if you write down your wish on a piece of paper and tie it to the tree, then the wish comes true. There is a stack of papers and number of pens available near the tree for people to write down their wishes and tie it to the tree. They are for free. However, you need to return the pen back :)"
Small palace,It is the palace for the king when he visited his father's tomb. The palace is quite small and requires no fee at the entrance. It has nothing much to see but the Martial art performance in front of the main gate is very attractive. Be sure to be there at least 20 minutes before the show to get the good viewing point. (It is very crowded.)There is only one building in the palace that needs the entrance fee. But I didn't get in there because they held some kind of drum performance that required reservation in advance. (Bad for foreign tourists who didn't know where and how to reserve)
The Zelkova tree of Hwaseong Haenggung - one of the most magnificent trees I’ve ever seen!,"Having seen a number of “sageuks” (historical dramas) with different interpretations of the story of the Crown Prince Sado, and having read the memoirs written by his wife Lady Hyegyong, mother of Yi San, who became King Jeongjo of the Joseon Dynasty, I could not resist the chance of a visit to Suwon, where King Jeongjo moved the remains of his father. Knowing that the “haenggung” was a temporary residence for the king while he visited the tomb, I had not expected it to be as glamorous or lavishing as the grand palaces in Seoul. But right near the front court of the palace, there stood this really magnificent 600 year old Zelkova tree which had turned all red in autumn! I was completely awestruck! Considered the sacred and divine protector of Suwon, it was there even before the fortress was built. Visitors can write their wishes on a piece of paper and hang them on a string surrounding the tree. The rest of the palace was worth the visit too, especially for sageuk lovers like myself. It was really peaceful and quiet when I started my visit around 9am in the morning. While walking on the clean and beautiful grounds of the palace, there were chatterings of magpies everywhere, just like in the dramas. Right next to the palace, there’s a shrine housing the portrait of King Jeongjo who, as a filial son, spent much of his reign trying to clear his father's name, and who was considered by some as one of the most successful and visionary rulers of the Joseon Dynasty. The traditional martial art performance (Sunday, 11am) was also quite impressive and worth waiting for."
Doesn't hold up against Gyeongbokgung or Changdeokgung,"Hwaseong HaengGung is definitely a nice place, without a doubt. It offers a good idea of what life and architecture were like in the Joseon dynasty. Anyone coming to Korea for the first time and visiting HaengGung first would probably find it very interesting. However, having visited Seoul's 5 royal palaces first, this place feels much smaller in comparison. The surrounding is also less spectacular. Changdeokgung is famous for its hidden garden, and Gyeongbokgung for sitting right in front of the magnificient Bugaksan mountain. HaengGung doesn't have such a nice environment, although the Paldalsan mountain in the background is very nice. For example, right next to the building, there is aempty lot right behind a school that doesn't exactly fit with the image this royal building should convey. Finally, the place doesn't feel as well preserved as Seoul's palaces. The paintings are not as vivid, the indication signs feel a bit dated... So, definitely worth visiting, but if you've seen Seoul's palaces, it's safe to say you won't be overly impressed."
Amazing,"I went here with my family and we all loved this place!!! The grounds were very clean, the buildings structures were just beautiful. Lots of photo opps!"
Suwon UNESCO Heritage & Palace,"Here have many good event, each day 11:00AM, Wednesday free concert and Weekend festival.Good place for family trip."
Very impressive and beautiful,"Went there with my friends last August, and it was absolutely lovely. There is an entrance free, but it's well worth it. The grounds were immaculately clean, and I loved how the colours of the palace contrasted well with the grounds. There weren't many people at the time of the visit, but I can imagine it bustling with tourists any other time. A beautiful place to visit if you love architecture and cultural spots."
Can skip,"If you have visited Changdeokgung or other palaces, my opinion is that you can skip this. The compound of this palace is smaller (compared to Chandeokgung or Gyeongbokgung) and nothing much to see. You need to pay admission, I think it's 1500KRW for Adult and 700KRW for Child. Go for the dragon tram/trolley for Suwon Fortress instead."
Wonderful Peaceful Palace for the King,"As the guidebook says, this palace is one of the palaces the Korean King rested between wars. The structures are beautifully preserved/restored. We were there in November on a cold day but it was still magnificent. Suwon itself is quite beautiful for a large city. Unfortunately the place closed fairly early so get there early unless they have extended hours for special performances. Lots of places to eat nearby and like most places in South Korea, I found everyone helpful even when they spoke little or no English they try to help you."
Only visited the main entrance but even that was impressive.,I only had time after walking the Suwon Fortress to take a look around the main entrance but even that in itself is impressive and worth a visit if like me you have no time for the full tour.I was there in late November and it was very quiet with nothing much going on... At peak times I can imagine though it is very busy with plenty of lively Korean entertainment in full swing.
Perfect visit in spring,"The palace is well-maintained and when i visited in a good timing, could see some celebrities who are ready for filming. Also the palace has a big foreground and there has been a variety of events on weekends. Paldal mountain is located behind the palace with a good trail to walk shortly. I really want to recommend to visit here in spring around April. Scattering Cherryblossom is definitely one of must-sees in korea. "
One for the history lovers.,"It is a nice place for the ones who have an affinity for the history and traditional culture of Korea. It, basically, occupies a small area of the Hwaseong fortress and hosts many traditional events over the weekend and some otherwise. So, do check the event list and their timings before you plan for this."
Joseaon dynasty's Palace,Here can learn about Korea history & culture.Specailly have many event on Weekend.
wonderful photo opportunities,"Vibrant color. Many opportunities to take stunning photos if you can avoid the crowds. Take your SLR!I enjoyed the staged royal processions. You can follow them through the local streets.Nearby:The palace is located inside the fortress which offers picturesque views, an ancient bell to toll, archeryPlaza in front of the palace which hosts showsSouvenir shop on the right hand side of the plaza"
Worth seeing if you're exploring Hwaseong Fortress,"If you're exploring Hwaseong Fortress, it's worth taking the time to stop and see this palace. It's smaller than the ones in downtown Seoul, but it's lovely. It doesn't take long to see the entire place."
Worth a visit,"An amazing place, the traditional shows make it very interesting.It was a hot summer day. We really enjoyed our time before the rain started boring, that spoiled our day."
beautiful palace,"Don't miss the martial arts demonstration at 11 am or 3 pm, it's very impressing. The palace itself is well restored and it's in a nice area, with green mountains in the background."
Start Here and Ride Train to Hwaseong Fortress,"We asked the bus driver to tell us where yo exit fot Hwaseong Fortress and he left us here. My wife and I are K-drama fans and this site is the set for many dramas, so we visited here first. We had recently seen I San drama so we were historically prepared for what we saw. You can stamp your own documents with royal seals around the palace. When we left we walked up the low hill behind and und to our surprise that there is a tourist tram that circles the area and leaves you at Hwaseong Fortress. Cool."
Nice,"This palace is quite small compared to those in Seoul, but it is pleasant and nicely done up. You won't see the hordes of foreign tourists but you might see noisy Korean student groups."
engaging culture for all the family,"Hwaseon Haenggung is a great place to visit as it has several engaging activities. You can play some traditional games, have a try at archery and see some handicrafts being made. The highlight for me was the Royal Guard Changing performance and the Martial Arts performance, which really gives you a strong feel of the majesty of old times."
Good for historical education,"Along with Hwaseong Fortress, Hwaseong HaengGung is one of unique historical facilities in Suwon City.Actually those are not so majestic and splendid but worthy of a visit to feel historical mood of Korean old history. And this site is very good for a walk because of it's beautiful scenery."
A small and simple palace,"A place for the ancient king to stay when he pass by, a relatively basic palace compare with those in Seoul, yet still worth going as their is not so much tourist spot in Suwon"
Historical palace from Joseon dynasty,"If you ask English guide(at least 4 foreigners group can ask), you can enjoy more. without any historical background explanation, this palace looks a bit disapppointed becos, much smaller than the palaces in Seoul,which are served for King's house. Once a year or twice, King came to Hwaseong from Seoul palaces, so it is small and less coloful. But still meaningful events were held. Next to palace, there is small temple where you can see big golden bouddha who is standing. That is also good to see. "
Fascinated by the Cultural Performance,We were just in time when we reached Hwaseong HaengGung to see the cultural performance. It was good and we were fascinated by it.
A letdown compared to the ones in Seoul. Please proceed to the Hwaseong Fortress Walls!,"When we mentioned Hwaseong to the taxi driver, he deposited us right in front of the entrance of the Hwaseong Palace. After paying the 1500 won entrance fee, we gingerly step in, eagerly awaiting the sights stated in the guidebooks. Hwaseong palace being a gateaway place is no Gyeongbukgong. If you have seen Gyeongbokgung, then by all means you can skip Hwaseong Palace. It is small and can be easily covered within an hour.The buildings have been restored and not as impressive as in Gyeongbokgung. The infamous walls are nowhere in sight. The highest point was a little hill in which we could see the Hwaseong Palace and the market areas in the horizon.Only after leaving the palace did we walk the side streets heading north until we found what we wanted to look for :- the Hwaseong Fortress Walls; which is far more impressive and worth the time to spent in Suwon.So visit Hwaseong Palace if1) You will not visit any of the palaces in Seoul2) You want to visit the palace to complete the Hwaseong UNESCO experience3) You are not fond of climbing the walls surrounding Hwaseong and want to experience the cultural performances held in the palace (which again is less impressive than in Seoul)"
