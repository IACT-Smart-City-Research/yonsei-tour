Chinese and Russian restaurants,"The only reason we were here is because iour bus stopped at Busan Station and the elaborate Chinese-style gateway looked interesting. The few Chinese restaurants didn't look too inviting and we were surprised to find Russian and Filipino restaurants. The only feature of interest was the wall of a Taiwanese school with Chinese legendary characters from The Warring States, writing all in Korean. The side lanes looked seedy with some immigrants lounging around.We finally found lunch in a small Korean restaurant near the main road where the beef and bibimbap were very good and the banchan superlative!A fruit vendor was selling apples and oranges and there were some cosmetics shops facing the pedestrian crossing to Busan Station. "
Ladies of the night,"China Town? More like Prostitution Town! If you want to be chatted by ladies of the night, then this is the place for you! Those chatting you up are unlikely to be waitresses for a lovely Chinese meal. Very disappointing."
DISAPPOINTMENT,"I must say that I came here to find a restaurant for a dinner. I like Chinese food, and upon recommendation of the concierge, I gave this place a shot. Found a restaurant to my liking (decent), and left at about 9 pm to roam the streets and grab the atmosphere.Sorry to say that I would give this place a MISS.I have been in many China Towns around the world, and this must be one of the worst. There are very FEW stalls selling things (mainly poor quality), and at night, it turns into a brothel. This is a mere 100 to 200 meters of China Town, with Russian and Philipa women inviting you for a drink ( I know you know what I mean).Honestly speaking… did not like it that much, and after having a drink in one of the bars… ONLY ONE BEER… I went back to the hotel, feeling more comfortable and relaxed having a few drinks alone at over-priced hotel costs.NOPE… not for me.Actually, the only thing that identifies this place with China Town, is the arch in the beginning of the street… everything else is a miss."
Not worth the visit,"We went to Chinatown for an early dinner before heading back via train to Seoul. Having seen a few Chinatowns across the globe, the one in Busan is one of the most disappointing ones. A bit of Chinese deco, some Chinese restaurants, that's it. And as many other contributors mentioned there are lots of Russian shops, restaurants, bars etc, quite surprisingly. There is unfortunately absolutely no reason to go there."
Give it a miss,"There were Chinese architecture and some decorations but otherwise, there’s hardly anything else. Probably better to spend time somewhere else. "
Russian Town,"We regret coming here as the last thing to visit in Bushan. We thought it would have some nice Chinese restaurants, but at 6pm the streets are quiet and hardly any shops are open. We saw a lot more Russian shops than Chinese ones. There are a lot of bars and karaoke lounges that weren’t open yet. There is a seedy vibe and some Russian prostitutes standing around."
One of the saddest China towns I have visited,China town was relatively small with very few things of interest. A few restaurants but mostly bars. Lots of Russian owned places and also mixed Non-Chinese restaurants. We only spent a few minutes walking around and did not even eat lunch which was our plan. Certainly not worth the time spent. 
Nothing interesting ,Just normal china town ...nothing special ...cheap stores but low quality ...not highly recommended . 
If you have time to spare,"Busan's Chinatown is located in across the street of Busan rail station.I visited here twice last year, it was to have a different dinner party with friends.Though it is not comparable to the Chinatown in Incheon or Bangkok, it was a good experience to be able to meet different scenery and food. Especially, there are many restaurants where Chinese dragon paintings are drawn.The evening menu for seven people was a mini buffet style where you could order 5 different dishes and choose the one you want on a rotating table, finally we picked one of the somen and jajangmeon(noodle with black source) to eat it."
Full of prostitutes,"We were at the train station and saw the sign “China Town” so we decided to have a look as we have enjoyed the China town areas in other countries.Big mistake, the China Town of Busan (and its nearby street called “Texas street” is an area full of prostitutes. Not worth the visit, there is nothing interesting in the street and stores/restaurants were empty.."
No safe for women travellers,"I went with a large group of females friends and we were accosted by a large group of men. Luckily we got out and they did not pursue us further but it is not safe at all, especially at night. There are also a lot of prostitutes and we suspect we saw one who was underaged."
Not worth the visit ,"We decided to walk around and see the sights. Lots of chinese restaurants a few russian resturants and lots of skecthy bars. We saw one foot massage and decided to get one for 40,000w for one hour. It was not good plus the massage ladies were talking loud and watching TV while they did tje massage. I would pass the area if i was a visitor."
Food and Culture,Interesting part of Busan with many nice restaurants and displays. So many restaurants and shops to choose from. Not far from Busan station and well worth a visit if you are in the area. Visited here with my partner in July 2014 and the Chinese restaurant we visited for lunch had nice food and good value for money.
"Intriguing, for sure","We saw the sign for China Town while we stood in the Busan Train Station Plaza, so we went. It was before lunch and there weren't many people around and some stores were not open. Nevertheless we enjoyed the old Korean architecture with Chinese flair, the Russian restaurants and stores, and others like Filipino and Turkish. It's a great place for foreigners- in fact I believe there was a sign stating just that. We went to a tasty, elegant looking Chinese restaurant. It's worth a look if you're in the area."
China Town?,"I was waiting for the train for Seoul so we were hungry and looked for something to eat. My girl was filipino so she knew about some filipino places to eat here. I didn't knew this place was ""famous"". Anyways it doesn't look like a good or safe place. I have friends that have got in trouble here with russian guys at bars. So this place looks like a Russian-Filipino-Chinese small neighborhood, in my opinion is such a bad mix. This is the type of place where you can see juicy girls, prostitution, some mob members as well. We went around 2 pm so it was quiet and empty, common for a place that probably have a wild and crazy nightlife. I don't wanna see how it is at night, this place doesn't look like Korea and a lovely city like Busan doesn't need it. Avoid it."
Quiet walk through Chinese Soviet town,"Perhaps because it was a Monday the place was very quiet. There is a certain sleaze vibe to the neighbourhood but it didn't make me feel unsafe or uncomfortable, certain areas just make their living from certain... transactions I guess. I think this is because Busan is more popular as a beach town so their China Town doesn't get as much patronage as other towns. The co-entwined nature between the two cultures here makes for very interesting people watching."
Don't go.,The sign from the subway says this is shopping area for foreigners. Which ended up to be China town. Which is a street that's quiet even on a Saturday night. Resturant's don't look great. Last thing you want to see in Korea....
"Russian Town, not China town",I thought i was at the wrong place. So many Russian and Russian restaurants. And in general the area was very small. Nothing special.
Sleaze among the Chinese and ex USSR restaurants,Its a totally different atmosphere when I stepped in here; there are plenty of sleazy bars and karaoke joints among the Chinese and ex USSR countries restaurants. Chinese food appears expensive too.I guess it will just be a one time exploratory trip here for me. 
One of the lamest excuses of a Chinatown,"We’ve been to many Chinatowns and most are not great. The best perhaps is in San Francisco. Even the small street in LA that is Chinatown is barely sufficient to be called a Chinatown, much less than the Chinatown in Busan. Nonetheless, we saw it on the bus and decided to take a closer look. There are just a few shops and restaurants that have anything to do with China. Now we didn’t see the Russian mob that other people have reported. I guess you must see that at night. In any case, there ae some restaurants that you might want to try. There’s more of a Russian influence than anything. It’s definitely not worth the effort invested in visiting the place."
small,"It's a pretty small Chinatown, but it's very easy to reach, basically right in front of the train station. Quite a lot of restaurants and shops,like in any Chinatown."
Don't come here,"Don't recommend to come here, especially alone, especially if you're a woman. There are a lot of drunk Russians, South East Asian hookers, and -stan gangs. But a nice thing about this place is that you can buy a good bread in Russian stores and it's very close to Busan Station. "
No expectations no disappointments,"We reached china town because we got lost. It wasn't so bad but there was nothing to rave about. We did eat at a Filipino restaurant and the food was great so I was not disappointed. We were there in the morning and there was not much activity and nothing to cause us any concern either. We went back at night and the place was alive with people going around shopping/window shopping or just hanging out. Lots of restaurants, bars, and stalls selling goods."
Not excactly Chinatown,The only reason we passed through is because that's where we stayed. It looks more like a Russiatown honestly. Not worth to visit. Good location to stay because it's so close to KTX.
Meh.,It's a street with some Chinese and Russian places. You can buy lingerie and beer. That's about it.-------------------
no no it's russian street,"hmm, looks like china town but now it's almost Russian Street. dirty, dangerous street. government tried to make foreigners street like Itaewon in Seoul, but just so and so street now. old chinese restaurants and old russian restaurants and bars. I don't know what to say. "
Not too exciting,"We came here because we were looking for a specific Uzbek restaurant, but the area is not very exciting and not really worth visiting in itself. It is actually China and Russia town and is a bit of a red light district too. Having said that, the people we encountered here were very nice."
Not much of a China town,"I wouldn't go out of your way to see this place. Seems to be more an expat area, and has more Russian bars than anything else. Very quiet during the day, not much better at night.If you are here, maybe take a stroll through the undercover market."
Avoid,"Should change it's name, no *real* Chinatown feeling. At the moment only few other persons except shopkeepers and some Russian tourists."
lousy,One place to avoid in Busan. Doesn't suit the name at all. We saw more Russians and those who had nothing to do with Chinese. Total disappoinment!
Chinatown in Korea,"One of the streets in Choryang used to be called Texas Street when I lived here almost forty years ago - has the place changed and for the better. I went during mid-morning and Chinatown was basically dead; I understand the place picks up in the evening which is close to my bedtime so I probably missed all the nightly action. I find it ironic that the Soviet Union supported North Korea's invasion in 1950 and now many of the bars/restaurants cater to Russians. Oh how times have changed, and I think for the good. There is a Tourist Info Office in Chinatown and they provided me a map of the area and were exceptionally helpful and friendly."
