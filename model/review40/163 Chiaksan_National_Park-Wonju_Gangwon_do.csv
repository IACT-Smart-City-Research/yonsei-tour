A place for Mountain lovers,"Natural beauty with mountain, valley, rainfall and a collection of different rare trees. This is a foreign friendly place with all tracking information in English with local language. Entry fee is 2500 won per adult. "
Path Closed,"A pretty park, but nothing special. The waterfall is hardly worth noticing and the park rangers won't let you continue on the trail to the mountain due to ""danger"" on a warm, clear day with no visible sign of any injury to the many descending hikers, including many children below 10. Rude rangers and biggest waste of time of any Korean park I've been to yet. "
Great view! Tough road but worth it!,Hiking up wasn't easy as there isn't any proper road and there's also no rope at the side for most for the route. So do be prepared it's not gonna be an easy route up hill. But it's really worth the effort heading up and picnicking at the top with the beautiful view! Do remember to bring enough water and a big towel for your sweat! There are thousands of steps heading up and it's not easy! 
Hiking/scrambling to Birobong (the summit of Chiak Mountain).,"Chiaksan National Park is an amazing mountain park with stellar hiking/scrambling. There is lots to do here and you could easily spend at least three hours walking the valley trails through Buddhist temples, hermitages, and waterfalls and pools. But avid hikers and scramblers should attempt to climb Birobong, the summit of Chiak Mountain. There are two trails: Expert and Advanced. Both are gorgeous but very demanding. I did both trails, but I preferred the Advanced trail. The Expert trail is more shaded and narrow, while the Advanced route is much more open as you ascend a corridor of scree at a constant angle. A round-trip hike takes about 5 hours. Leave early and return by mid afternoon. There are food stalls at the main entrance. You can access the park via the city Wonju. Public busses take about 30 minutes. Admission to the park is cheap, around $5 USD. http://navigatioonline.com/2014/12/chiaksan-south-korea/"
Beautiful Gangwon-do Landscape,"Chiaksan National Park is off the beaten path for most travellers. The mountainous park offers some of the best hiking in Gangwon province with a fraction of the visitors. I hiked to the peak of Chiaksan in March and I was suprised to find snow! While I was not prepared for the snow, the hike was still acheivable and very much worth the effort.The peak offered 360 views that seemed to go on forever. Also of interest is the ancient altar found at the top, this is a great reminder that many mountains in Korea were considered sacred. For most travellers Wongju is the gateway city to visit the park."
