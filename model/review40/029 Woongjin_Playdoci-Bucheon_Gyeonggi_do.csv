Nice place for children,From Songnae station ther are many buses going to Wonjin Playdoci. It is one of the big attractions specially for children.Lots of games and amusements for the young ones.
Great Time - Purchase Tickets Online,"Visited the water park portion with my wife and two kids (ages 8 and 4). We had a great time and there was plenty to do for both kids. My 4 year old was not allowed on some of the larger slides but there were some smaller kid areas to make up for it.The food is strictly Korean fare unless you go upstairs to Dunkin Donuts/Starbucks/KFC. There’s a McDonald’s 2km away if you need it. The ticket office charged us 80,000 won for adult tickets and 50,000 won each for the kids. I showed them the prices advertised on TripAdvisor and their website and was able to get a full refund (after purchasing tickets online in front of them). Make sure you buy tickets ahead of time! Also, bring hats so you don’t have to buy them there. The cheapest ones were 5,000 won. The charges started to add up between hats, having to pay 10,000 won per chair by the pools, and paying for life jackets (required for smaller kids).Looking forward to checking out the snow park and aquarium in the future!"
Fun experience familes with younger children!,"Fun experience for the kids! The park was very clean and there were many lifeguards on duty to ensure no kids were monkeying around (and they took their duties very seriously). The 5 bigger slides were available on rotational basis by the hour, as the lifeguards had to be present at both ends to ensure safety before anyone could go. The Spa area was also very good, water pressure was very strong and there were many old folks in the main spa area. There were 4-5 smaller play spas for younger children. Lockers were free, and can be opened by a wireless/waterproof bracelet that also functions as payment mode When you buy food or rent items - you just scan the bracelet at the counters. The staff speak very little english - Mostly locals visit this place in Bucheon as it was quite far from seoul (50mins by train followed by a 5 min bus ride). The kids thoroughly enjoyed themselves at the water park. Highly recommended if you have younger children below 12."
The Best Fun for our Family ,"Our Family super enjoyed Playdoci. Our kids are aged 2, 7, and 12. We got a package ticket from klook, it included all parks ksnow, water, spa) with snow gear rentals, life vests, and buffet lunch. It was a great deal.My kids 7 and 12 years old bravely faced the snow slope. It was their first time to snowboard. I got ski but I was to coward to try and too old (40) to get injured on the trip. My kids fell on their behind, even tumbling 360... My son enjoyed it and learned to snowboard after an hour of trying. We also enjoyed the tube snow slide, even my 2 year old enjoyed it. After 2 hours here on the snow, we went for lunch around 1pm. I loved the beef bulgogi and the monte carlos sandwich in their buffet. (you have to bring your own hand gloves for the snow park) After late lunch, we relaxed iur aching bodies on the water park and spa. There were 4 water high slides in door, which they operated 2 at a time. The outdoor water park was closed during this time because it was still cold. We enjoyed going down the different high slides and cruising along the lazy river, running ariund the splash zone area. We had free life vests with our package but were being charge upon exit. After presenting the package voucher of klook, they just waived the fees. Water park closed at 6pm.The spa was the most relaxing of all. The water was warm and the kids enjoyed it the most. The facilities were very very clean. The cleanest that I have been too. I guess koreans are known for their cleanliness and order even in the different museums we visited unlike other countries. We even had 15 minutes of feet tickling with Dr Fish also included with our ticket.Overall, the park wasn't crowded and this was the best day of fun that we have in our trip. "
Good For July,"In Korea, the summer is really hot therefore people like to go waterpark.The reason why I recommend July is not so hot and not so cold.In August, It's very hot so I prefer to go on July. Also if you pay with MasterCardyou can get a 30% discount. It's a good deal!!"
Nice summer skiing,"We had our first time skiing in Seoul Dec 2015, and we loved it so much that we wanted to refresh our muscle memory, and thus we went to Playdoci indoor ski this summer.We were staying in Myeondong and based on many people's comment, it took about an hour to go there. We hired a private teacher and he took us there in his car.The facility is good, and we settled down the rental things pretty quickly with our teacher's assistance. Now we moved to the snowdoci area, and to our surprise, there were only a handful of customers there, and we didn't mind it at all because it meant we could have the whole place for our learning, not worrying about bumping into others. Probably the reason of few visitors were because 1st of all, it was a weekday, and 2nd local people don't go there for skiing because Seoul has plenty of outdoor skiiing in winter time. So only people like us from Hong Kong will go for indoor skiing. The other part of Playdoci which is the water world part has a lot more people.Back to the snowdoci. Supposedly it has both intermediate slope and beginner slope, and probably because of the few visitors, only the beginner slop was opened. There were 2 escalators carrying people to the top of the slope... the slope run for about 100 meters, and the width is about 15 meters for ski/snowboard, and there is a section for snowboard jumping too. The ice condition was so-so, and there were a few holes here and there. Since there weren't many people, we did improve our beginner skiing and could do some snowplow turn after 2 hours of learning.Another side of snowdoci is the big slide thing, and it was quite popular. People could sit in the big float, and slide down the slope. It was fun and exciting.It was fun and the overall experience was good. Will I go there for indoor skiing again? probably not, as the slope is indeed rather short. Thus, we would save up the budget for the real winter skiing again in Seoul.The playdoci has quite a lot of restaurant choices, so it is easy to spend a day there happily."
Wonderful hidden gem (from foreigners),"We love this place (Waterdoci section of Playdoci) and have visited and will visit numerous times. Very toddler friendly and we all know children of all ages just love water. It is very large with a typical water park section on one side and a 'spa' section that consists of various hot jacuzzi pools. In summer, the outdoor section in open and more rides and pools open up.I have visited indoor and outdoor waterparks in US and things tend to be a little more relaxed here. Food and beverages (even beer) are sold right next to the pools. There are a few Korean quirks like requiring everyone to wear caps (baseball caps are acceptable) and you would notice almost everyone of both genders wear tees and shorts or rashguards over their swimsuits. "
a place for all ages,"This area has a lot for school children as well as elders.An excellent place for walks, a small lake in between,benches to relax, small climbs, a cycling track, beautiful flower trees and plenty of choices for food and drinks- just across the road is WOONGJIN PLAYDOCCI- PAY A FEE BUY TICKETS-children can swim, ski- equipments available on hire, outside basket ball courts and football practice field, a golf practice area- what more u need? Enjoy-get on line 7 to Sangdong station."
