A long walk around a ruined wall.,I was disappointed in that all there is to see is some temple style fixtures attached to the wall and a 4.2 km walk around the circumference of the wall.You can take little walks through the middle but this time of year you only got to see bare trees.
Most picturesque spot in Cheongju!,"We hiked up from the lower gate to the higher one, and it was an incredible experience. It only took us about 30 minutes to walk, but we spent at least that long taking pictures and enjoying the scenery. The main gate was absolutely stunning with the vibrant colors of the ceiling offset with the granite fortress wall, green foliage and the views of the city below. "
"awsome fortress, beautiful and great to get in some exdercise walking the wall","beautiful fortress, with very lovely view, it was nice to wallk very early in the morning with the morning mist and fog, then the sun cam out. not for those with limited physical capabilities, but well worth walking the walls , at a slow pace."
Must to be visited place in Cheongju,"There is only one bus which is bus number 862-2 that running every 25 minutes from Cheongju Gymnasium to Sangdang Sanseong. Sangdang Sanseong is the last stop and along the way the bus also brings us to other tourist attractions in Cheongju for example Cheongju National Museum. There are Korean restaurants operated by locals in the main gate near the bus stop. The hiking trail itself is not so steep, you can see the city of Cheongju from top of the hill. Even if you are not in the mood of hiking, you can just bring your mattress and tent and enjoy the view from the slope of the hill since they also provide camping area. There is also a small lake across the village. You will find that most of visitors are senior citizens who come usually with their hiking groups. Since there is only one bus and it is depart every 25 minutes, you should line up with others and be prepared to stand all the way to your destinations since its always full."
Good spot for a walk,"Sangdangsanseong Fortress was a popular spot for locals as a hiking spot and with a huge open field near the fortress entrance. While nowhere as scenic as the better known fortress walls in Suwon or Seoul, the fortress makes for a pleasant hike for a few kilometers in a peaceful surroundings. Several restaurants in a lakeside area awaits hikers who come back down after the hike."
Great Hike,Sanddangsanseong is a fortress outside of Cheongju. It's a great hike with wonderful views. At the bottom there is a small village where you can get some delicious food and/or coffee and tea. It's especially great in the Fall when the leaves are changing. Definitely recommend if you're in Cheongju.
Beautiful historic site,"You can hike around the fortress wall and enjoy wonderful views on a clear day. There are many places for a picnic, or if you want to enjoy traditional food, you will find some very quaint eateries offering very authentic home- style Korean food."
"Lovely place to enjoy a great hike, great views and a sense of history","You can hike around the fortress walls and enjoy wonderful views on a clear, sunny day. The hike around the walls takes around an hour and a half and afterwards you can enjoy traditional food in one of several restaurants."
Great place to hike and for picnic,"We took a bus from Inter-City Bus Terminal (one transfer) arrived. It was quite easy to get there, just get some information from the Tourist Information Center near the Bus Terminal. It was a Sunday and the place was bustling, but not over crowded, with locals (yes, no tourist). We took the clockwise hike around the fortress wall. There were various great views of the city along the way. We were greeted by friendly locals who were doing their hike. The hike was moderately easy and a good warm up for our more tedious trek the following day (Songnisan).There were a number of eateries there, the locals ate there. We did not patronize any as we packed our own lunch (Gimbaps) and sat by the pond to eat after our hike.Great place to visit, even if you have children, it is an easy hike. "
Make a DAY of it,"This is a hike in some sense. The locals go here for exercise, you will see them in gear and with walking poles. Why not follow suit? Take your camera for the best views of the city! Take some water and wear sensible walking shoes. Walk up toward the fortress entrance (get out of the taxi at the visitor center, two buildings with snacks and a nice attendant who gives out maps, get one. Walk up the field and along the path to the gate, you can circle the whole interior of the village by walking the wall. Go left first to see the view, then walk on for the long path, OR turn back and go right from the gate to the village. This has s pond, coffee, and traditional food tents. Catch the bus back, it goes in a circle then back to Cheongju. "
Sangdang Mount Fortress,It was a fortress to defend enemies from neighboring countries. Now it is a park. You can drive up to the fortress.
Sit and Chill,Such a nice place to sit and chill away from the traffic and buildings. Get some friends and a picnic (maybe a few beers) and spend an afternoon there and if you're feeling it take a walk around. It ends in a nice little village with some restaurants and the bus back to Shinnae.
Relaxing place w good views,"I arrived in my hotel very late and decided to go take a look. I walked around 2h and was amazed. Very peaceful place, not much people. Great views. Take some water there are no drinks available."
A beauty that never gets old,"This is one of the first places most people visit when they move to Cheongju. It is quite beautiful year-round. In my particular case, I visited in the autumn and the colours were stunning. It's a lovely place to go hiking, or just enjoy yourself on the grass with a picnic. Please be aware that getting a taxi back to the city can be tricky. I advise you to look up bus times. If you want a taxi, you'll have to walk about 15-20 min down to the main road."
Historic Sangdangsanseong Fortress,A lovely tourist attraction situated in Cheongju. Take a walk along the 4.2km fortress wall and you will see some amazing scenic views. There is a lovely dam and many traditional shops in and around the historic site. The fortress gates are also something not to miss! An attraction steeped in history and perfect for any tourist seeking some outdoor activities.
Hike or walk.,This is a nice afternoon out of town. Fairly easy walk up a large hill and the ridge around. Nice for cultural interest. Small group of places to eat. Buses and taxies run here from Cheongju.
Beautiful Fortress!,"It was fortunate that I had someone to drive me up to this beautiful fortress. We probably spent an hour here as it got dark very quickly.I managed to snap a few photographs that I would like to share with Tripadvisor.If you happen to visit Cheongju, please visit Sanddang Sanseong!"
"A nice, easy hike.","This was a nice place to hike if you're a beginner. I went during the winter and it was covered with ice.. silly me, but I still had fun and the view up the top was very nice! Took the bus there, nice sights on the way. Plenty of restaurants at the bottom, was recommended the Tofu.. the food was really nice and the owners were very friendly. Good place to go! I think I'd actually go again, and bring a book and just sit and read for a while.. very relaxing."
sangdang fortress,The fortress is beautiful and historical base of korea.
Strategic Fortress in Central Korea,"A fortress has stood on this mountain for over 1,000 years. The original construction of a fortress in this location began during the Three Kingdoms. What we see now is a Joseon fortress built from or on top of a previous fortress. During the Joseon dynasty the fortress went through nine stages of repairs between (1716) and (1836). For anyone who enjoys hiking this is a great location. To walk the entire fortress it takes 2-3 hrs. Keep an eye out for secret gates, which are often well hidden and easily missed. This particular mountain fortress is representative of early Joseon fortress design. For those interested in Korea's history, visiting some of Korea's many fortresses is a great start. I would highly recommend Namhansanseong Fortress, Hwaseong Fortress, and Sandangsanseong Fortress."
A Nice Hike,"It's a really nice hike. Try to go in fall when the weather is not too hot and the foliage is all different colours. As for the fortress itself, while it is interesting, Korea is full of them. Also, it is nearly impossible to get a taxi back into town. You have to get on a far too overcrowded bus that takes forever to get downtown as it only comes maybe once an hour. Many families have picnics there so bring a packed lunch and enjoy your time."
Quite the hike but well worth it,"We visited the fortress on a bit of a cool day which turned out to be a blessing. We had read that if you hike in a counter-clockwise direction the going is less arduous however the report was wrong. Our son, who has visited the Fortress several times, said that it was much easier clockwise. That being said, the views were amazing. Great spot for photographers."
Nice hike around the fortress,Sandang Mountain Fortress is about a 4 km hike around the fortress walls and it is a fairly easy hike except for one part where there is a rope that you have to grab onto to do down a little bit. There is a tourist village around the fortress that is a good place to eat. It is easily accessible by bus from downtown Cheongju but when you get off the bus check the bus schedule for the return buses or you could be waiting a while. You can also hike from the fortress to a museum but I couldn't find the path and after walking along one path for half an hour I decided to return to where I started.
