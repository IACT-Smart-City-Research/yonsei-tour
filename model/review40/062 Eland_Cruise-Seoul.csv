Dont miss this cruise,Night view of the river is very spectacular. A live band provides entertainment on the cruise back. Pleasant!
Han River Boat cruise,"This was the perfect way to end our visit to Seoul.We went by hop on hop off bus to Yeouido Dock and returned by subway.The Elland Cruise ticket office is clearly signposted and tickets are easy to buy or redeem.There is a supermarket on board selling hot food and beers.There are toilets.We took the night cruise which is dazzling,Seoul looks great at night.There is a music show inside.We sat outside to enjoy the breeze.We walked back to Yeouinaru Station (Seoul Subway Line 5)-its about 15 minutes."
Memorable trip,"We booked our night tour (musical) through Elan cruise. We arrived an hour earlier to check our tickets and do the formality. The cruise goes for an hour or so but in the Han river. There is no guide, but you can enjoy the view. It is a brilliant cruise with a great view of the city along the river. They had arranged a unique fountain-show from one of the bridges towards the end of the show. Take a good camera with you to shoot photos. They do serve food and drinks. I do recommend it."
Music and Cruise,"To my surprise, this cruise has many types of service. It provides music cruise, fireworks cruise and others. It is a very slow and steady cruise.The highlight of the cruise is Feeding Seagulls."
Fun River Cruise,"My friend and I went on the dinner firework cruise. I was quite surprised that this seems to be unpopular with tourists. The night we went, it was all locals. There were not many staff that spoke any English and even then, in Korean there wasn't much explanation of what was going on. Wait and don't eat at first. You aren't dismissed in any order, they just let everyone go up at once. There's a mad rush and unless you want to be pushed by some ahjummas, don't go up at the beginning. There is plenty of food. The food was high quality but a bit light on meat options. The cheese tray and desserts were my favorite. They do have an espresso machine which I missed. Don't bother with the coffee, it is absolutely terrible.They had a lovely jazz band and the fireworks were great. Overall it was a fun night!"
Watch out for the fountains from the bridge!,"Dinner while cruising on the Han river. Whole trip takes about 2 hours. Dinner is a buffet, but very nicely done and there is plenty of food. You don’t have to join in the initial crazy rush as there was plenty left. There is live music, which is not intrusive, but I went up on deck and spent most of the time watching the lights of Seoul. After about an hour the boat approaches a bridge and the crew clear everyone from the decks. This is because there are fountains fo water pumped off the bridge as part of a lighting display (a couple who did not listen to the instructions got soaked!).Overall a nice experience."
Lovely night view,This is one of my best experience in SeoulI highly recommend use this cruise at nightBeautiful bridges and night views are wonderful 
Boring,The wet and cold weather further dampened the experience. There was no clear signage to direct us to the correct location. It was a boring experience . Nothing much to see. The band that played a few songs was mediocre.Place was near empty. 
Perfect story cruise,This is my first time and I love it so much. The cruise is about 40 minutes and we enjoying the cruise outside with seagull feeding and enjoying the view around the river. Inside they did the band performance and it was great.
Story Cruise was good sailing with seagulls,"We picked the cheapest one, STORY CRUISE.And it was okay. Recommended if you don't want to spend much.- There's no sign of discount for seniors. But, received 10% off at the ticket office.- Story Cruise only runs during the daytime. So, we couldn't see the sunset nor nightscape of Seoul even though we got the last time slot(17:00).- The crew guides with Korean and simple English/Chinese. There were A LOT of Chinese speaking passengers. With a few locals and very few others.- Other than watching the scenery, there were two things to enjoy. Seagull feeding and music performance. Both are available upstairs. So, staying upstairs will be better. Watching seagulls was the best part with hundreds of flying seagulls.- There's a little snack stand upstairs. They sell foods and anchovies to feed seagulls.- It was a round trip sailing to the west until the parliament.- Story Cruise Ferry Terminal had a buffet restaurant 'Ashley'. It is locating upstairs and has a wonderful view. They provide a discount for those who try both of the restaurant and the cruise."
Cruising on a cold winter evening,"Hello; this was a very pleasant cruise of about 1 hour on the river Han, enjoying the view of Seoul important buildings on the shore and far away.We enjoyed the live music the most.I was impressed by the nice alleys that lead to the dock, both for pedestrians and for bikes."
Great night river cruise with water and light show,Nice boat well laid out. Dinner cruise has great food and good selection. Very comfortable dining room with good service. 
Korean Holiday,"The Eland Han River Cruise was just as advertised. It was a unique way to discover Seoul and enjoy the city's beautiful scenery. We start off at Yeouido Dock and pass by 63 building, N Seoul Tower, Banpodaegyo Bridge, Konghang Train Bridge, Jamsil Olympic Stadium, and the famous Yanghwa Bridge. While on board, we sat back and relaxed as a live band serenaded us, providing a great soundtrack for our sightseeing cruise. We purchased a package that included a buffet dinner at Ashley, a famous restaurant chain in Korea. Even though the buffet had a good selection of foods, save your money, because most of the food was served warm instead of hot and the service was poor at best because the wait staff was extremely slow in clearing the tables. We had to visit the Han River because it is another site that appears in many of the Korean dramas that appear on TV."
Great river cruise with fireworks!,"This experience started out a little weird as it was not clear where to go to get our tickets (using vouchers). But we got it sorted and the food was much better than we expected with tons of choice on offer.Buffets can be dreadful but everything looked fresh and there were lots of chefs/attendants on hand to serve and refill as needed. Dinner started at the dock and then we departed for the cruise part. There was live entertainment, which was a lot of fun. The musicians interacted directly with the crowd, especially the roving sax player. Drinks were available if you wanted them, and we got a reasonably priced bottle of champagne. The night views of the Seoul shoreline were gorgeous. The fireworks from the Banpo bridge were beautiful, lasted about ten minutes. We met a very friendly Korean young couple that we had fun with, and at the end of the cruise when we couldn't find a taxi, they actually drove us straight to our hotel, half an hour away. I can't say enough good things about Korean people. I have traveled the world and Koreans are the most friendly and helpful people I have ever encountered. Anyway, this cruise was fun, the food was good, and I highly recommend it for fabulous night views of Seoul you won't see any other way."
See Seoul by night from the River,"Worth doing. The evening cruise only takes about an hour and is popular with locals as well as tourists. Cities always look different from the water and Seoul is no exception. You pass under many bridges including Banpo Bridge which has one of the world's largest active sculptures - a combination of water fountains and coloured lights that spray out from many hoses shooting out into the river from the bridge, along its entire length. You will get wet if you stay outside while the ferry passes under it. There's live entertainment on board. A nice relaxing short tour."
Horrible birthday because of Eland!,"It was my birthday and my husband decided to celebrate it with an Eland cruise. We arrived 30 minutes prior to departure time. Our departure time was 11:30 and we were there at 11:00. There were two Eland cruise departure ports at the dock. We went into one of them and lined up for 20 minutes. When we got to the lady, she pointed us to go to the office in Korean (speaking no English at all). There was no instructions or directions of where the office was. When we finally found the office, we were 5 minutes before the departure time. My husband lined up and there was only one couple in front of us who took 10 minutes long to have a conversation with the counter lady. The line was long and no one was there to manage the queue. By the time we got a chance to the counter, it was 11:35! When I told her what happened, she just bluntly said ‘it is your fault.’ She offered us to take the next trip but because we had to catch a plane at that hour, we couldn’t take it. There was no refund whatsoever. I had a huge argument with my husband that morning right in front of the counter because I was so pissed that he did not jump the queue to speak to the counter before the cruise departed. But all in all, better directions, clearer map, and better staff training and management would have made my Birthday much better. It was no our fault for arriving half an hour earlier. It is not our fault that there was no sign and instructions of where to go after arriving. It is not our fault for a long queue at the office and no one was there to take our QR code in for tickets even when we arrived early. It’s a total mess at Eland. It was a waste of time to book online in advance because it did not mean anything, you still had to line up which made the delay. And the staff speaks few English and are ill-mannered.I travel extensively around the world and this is the worst customer service experience ever, especially in Asia. Ruined my birthday! Avoid Eland at all cost! "
lovely cruise,"We booked a cruise via Klook and it did not disappoint. While this is mostly for lovers, we were with friends and the cruise provided a good view of the Han River and the city lights at night. "
"Fantastic, five stars! ","Can only give 5 stars for this cruise! We booked an night cruise with music, and dinner included beforehand. The cruise was just fantastic! Watching the lights of Seoul go by was beautiful. The live music was nice, and the dinner at the Marine Buffet next to where you board the boat was first class! It was our anniversary, and we couldn't have had a better night. "
Totally worth it...,"You can buy a ticket at the booth and get there by subway Youido (purple line)... I think there are varying prices like one for dinner, a longer one with fireworks... I believe prices start at 25k won, approx $25"
Cheap and fun!,Great way to see the night scape of the city. Id recommend the sunset tours so you can watch the sun down and see the evenings fountain show at Banpo Bridge
Han River Ferry Tour,"This ferry tour was pretty interesting. I took the Han River tour cruise and I think it was a good 40 or 45 minutes so it was a perfect length of a trip. I got to see the city and all the different bridges. The ride was smooth and nice.But this river certainly needs some cleaning up to do. I saw a lot of dead fish floating about but then also saw some guys water skiing so, not sure if they don't care or if this is them taking care of their river haha. Either way, cruise was pretty top notch. Enjoy!"
Interesting tour ,We did this as business tour and were able to talk over dinner. The cruise had a lot of birthday and anniversary parties as well as a good band playing. The dinner had lots of choices and was crowded for the first few minutes it opened so I would recommend to let others start. The rainbow bridge seemed to be the biggest attraction with everyone going out to see it. 
Beautiful night view from Han river,"40 minutes seem too short. I paid full price at the ticket counter without reservation but you can get 10% off when you buy online. We spent 30 minutes on deck outside freezing cold enjoying night view of Seoul from the Han river, last 10 minuets went diwn to the main hall to get some warmth with Live jazz music. "
Amazing Lunch Cruise buffet,"It's a different experience to have a meal while cruising around the han river, beautiful sights with good food.The music is nice, cruise is clean and upkeep well done. As for the buffet, it's much better than many of the buffet I have been too! So this is really well worth every single cent. Excellent choice for a relaxing 2 hour meal.At the port area, there is any beautiful decoration too which make good photoshoot.And for all Running Man fans, this is one of the spot which was filmed in Running Man."
Don't miss it.,We booked for Han river cruise and we were taken aboard to eland cruise by our guide. We started at around 5: 30 or 6 pm. It was approximately an hour cruise. This cruise plans different themes and activities on different days. We got the chance to enjoy their jazz music band onboard. We were given a complimentary beer or breezer ( as per our choice) too. This cruise was one of the bests till now. Totally loved every second of that beautiful evening !
A Beautiful Evening Cruise,"It was an amazing evening presented by E-Land Cruise. We got good food, good music from the band plus the beautiful city view kept mesmerizing us during the trip. Don't miss the chance to be part of this cruise whenever you're in Seoul. "
Winter Music Cruise,"Couldn't really find a website that is comprehensive in English. Eland cruise website is all in Korean language. It's difficult for any foreigners to book online. I bought tickets from a tour website that charges 1.5 times the original cruise price. Upon arrival at cruise terminal, I realized tickets maybe be purchased on the spot. Cruise started with giving a sparkling alcohol drink which they termed as wine, and a hotdog sandwich. These we were instructed to bring on board to heat up, add toppings and consume while sightseeing. A small joke happened when communication with the staff at terminal couldn't really speak English. I was trying to check what meat goes into the hotdog as my partner does not eat beef. As it turned out they were a little shocked and thought that we were muslims. Haha. In any case, we were a little disappointed when the staff on board told us there is no such thing as heat up. Toppings were only mustard, ketchup, onions, pickles, corn. We weren't hungry any way, so we left the cold 'hot'dog unconsumed. The other passengers were scuttling and shuffling to get hold of the toppings which we couldn't understand what's the interest. Definitely more than enough toppings to go around.The crowd was all Koreans, in big families. Only one other couple was Japanese and two of us singaporeans. They were like us, lost and just as shocked at the behavior. Sightseeing - well, the famous banpo bridge wasn't in rainbow brilliance. It's winter. In fact all the bridges were not lit up. It's just normal city lights. Can't see much in the dark.Jazz music on board - at least it's a nice change to the scenery (actually there isn't much). Singer sang English songs that can hear fly be understood but spoke to audience in Korean. Think the cruise is more for their inbound tours or their family outings kind of thing. "
Morning Han river cruise,"The cruise was about 40mins. We just headed west of Han and then turned back to the port. There were no performances, and no food, so our group simply went to the upper deck to enjoy the view. The sights consisted mainly of man made structures - bridges and buildings, and N Seoul from afar could be seen. The presence of seagulls was a bonus... If you found the winter temperature unbearable, you could go down where temperature was controlled."
Night Cruising,"Spend a wonderful night in the Cruise - Winter Musical Cruise, live performance was very relaxing and the view was fantastic, we couldn't spend most of our time at the upper deck (Open Air) due to the cold wind, overall experience is great and will definitely recommend this cruise to guest that would like to experience Seoul during night time. Plus thing about this cruise is you will get a bottle of Cruiser drink and burger upon disembarkation of the cruise , just pass your ticket to the food counter there and they will handed your meals."
Do a night cruise,"The day cruise was pretty uneventful. If you want something better, do a night cruise to see Seoul's city lights."
Evening Han river cruise,We went with a large group. Large enough to occupy the entire upper deck. The cruise is about 30mins too short as most people were sculling the last of their drinks before the lights were turned off 5 minutes after we docked. It's all buffet and the staff were very good at clearing away between courses. The boat is so smooth that it's hard to notice that you are moving. You might as well be on the shore in a restaurant. Probably wouldn't do it again and wouldn't take visitors to Seoul on it.
relaxing but short,"This is one of the operators of cruise on the hangang river.the boarding point is located in the park area where all the locals meet up for a picnic on sunny days, The cruise is about 40 minutes taking you up the river and back. You get to see a few things on the along the way. But while it takes 40 mintues its really just 20 minutes of sightseeing in a really slow moving boat since it just takes you up the river, do 180 degree turn and backtrack the exact same route. So if you have an hour to spare and just want to relax, then this is a good option. But you would probably be better off just finding a place to sit and enjoy the local life in the park, or simply walk route yourself. Proabaly wont spend more than 15 mintues walkin along the river to see the exact same things and you dont have to backtrack to the boarding point either."
relaxing,"Theres a few river cruises available , we went on an afternoon cruise at 1 pm that went up and down the Han river for a round trip of about 40 mins. Other cruises are available , even dining experiences but ours was just a leisurely jaunt .No commentry as such but it was nice to get out on the water . A stroll in the park afterwards completed a perfect afternoon"
Breezy and cute cruise on Han river ,"Nice guided cruise of 40min on Han river.The guide gave explanation both in Korean & English For 1000 won you can buy a little pack of anchovies on the boat and you are allowed to feed the seagull that seem to enjoy it a lot.You will see Seoul from an original axe! Before the cruise, we tasted the Korean Burger with Korean beek and sweet soy sauce! There was also a green apple coleslaw and tomatoes in the burger!Very tasty !!Now on a sunny day the park around is the perfect place to walk, bike or do a picnic... It is the most relaxed and green place we have experienced in Seoul and we love every minute of it!Must go & do!"
360 View of Seoul,"The cruise was pleasant and smooth-sailing; however, it did get to be quite boring at some point. It provides a beautiful and unique view of the city of Seoul; however, a shorter trip would have sufficed already. Apart from the beautiful city sights on board, do take advantage of other picture worthy scenes before or after the cruise."
Cruise along the river,The cruise along the river is a great way to see the Seoul skyline. Took the boat ride early night and really enjoyed. Music and food during the whole journey 
Han River Cruise- Eland Cruise,"My partner and I arrived at the terminal 10 minutes before disembarkation. Our reservation email stated that we needed to arrive at least 20 minutes before disembarkation, but the metro wasn't in a favor. However, we were able to get our tickets and make it to the boat for the cruise. Because of our late arrival, we didn't have a seat. There were seats downstairs inside the cabin, then there were seats on top in the upper deck all along the railing. We stood at the front of the ship for a little while, then we moved inside to find some seats to rest our feet. When we traveled under the water bridge, they asked everyone to go inside. We turned around on the other side of the bridge and headed back. At that point, the live jazz music started and they played 4 songs. When we got back to the dock, they had an awesome firework show! It last about 8-10 minutes and was surprisingly really good. The only disappointment was my partner and I were hoping the crew would make announcements over the loud speaker as to what buildings we were passing. However, they only made very short announcements to the inside cabin."
Cruise Just Okay,We did the 7 p.m. Evening Cruise. Had been looking forward to a relaxing hour to sit and see the city skyline while enjoying gentle evening breeze and catch up on the day's events. We were lucky and got seats on the upper deck...but within a few minutes the Cocktail Mix Team started up their rap music and the speaker was located very near where we were sitting. So loud we could not carry on a conversation. ALSO they played inappropriate songs with vulgar language which was all in English. I will assume that the team was Korean and did not know the words. Very offensive and would never be permitted in North America and in that style of a venue that was open to all ages. It ruin what was supposed to have been a leisurely relaxing cruise after a long day of walking in the hot sun!
Leisure cruise,"We took subway line 5 to Yeouinaru station, went out of Exit 3, turned down the path to Han River. The E-Land Cruise terminals were about 15 minutes walk along the path. When purchasing tickets (12,000 won each) from the ticket booth outside E-Land Cruise Terminal 1, we were asked to fill in an Embarkation Card and showed our passports. We then had buffet lunch (14,900 won per person) at Ashley on 1st floor of Terminal 2. After lunch we went back to Terminal 1, the staff there checked our passports again before we were allowed to board. The ferry had an air-conditioned lower deck and an open top deck. There were seagulls flying along with our ferry as a crewman was feeding them with small fish on the top deck and it was quite amusing. It was a leisure cruise and the whole ride was about 35 minutes. It was really relaxing to spent half a day to walk along the Hangang Park, had lunch by the river side and ended up with a leisure cruise"
Nice to see both sides of the city.,"I took the 7:30pm Live Cruise from Yeouido Han River Terminal to the Rainbow bridge and back. It is a 60mins cruise. I recommend buying your tickets at the booth ferry instead of online websites since they will not allow refunds if it happens to rain unless you don't mind sitting inside. I was lucky the rain stopped an hour before my scheduled departure and I get to enjoy the view on the top open deck. Make sure to check their time schedule and arrive at least 30mins before departure. It is very easy to get there by subway. How To Get There:Get off at Yeouinaru station (Line 5 여의나루역) and take exit 3.Walk straight along the riverside about 500m toward 63 City Building.You will find ""Eland Cruise"" ferry terminal on your left. (about 5 minutes away from the station. Look for the ""Eland Cruise"" sign. It is near 63 City Building.)"
Entertaining,"I find the cruise a worthwhile activity because I got to relax a bit from all the walking I've done throughout the day and the show was quite entertaining. Although, the live band would have been more entertaining though in my opinion. If I'll do this again, I'll go during sunset so I could still get a better glimpse of the city."
Short cruise with little scenery,The hotel concierge told us this was a 70 minute river cruise. The woman at the Eland ticket booth also said it was a 70 minute cruise. We got on the boat which was very big and nice. It was very clean and in good shape. The boat holds 500 but fortunately there were less than 50 when we went.It was a beautiful day and we were excited about seeing the city from the water. They were blasting music from both top and bottom decks. Different tunes from each could be heard overlapping one another. It was very loud. There were no guided announcements. The boat went up river to the end of the park at a snail's pace and then turned around. The whole cruise was 35 minutes. Nothing really to look at in that short distance.
Nice river cruise,"We were in Seoul in March and wanted to go on night cruise to see the Banpo bridge. Unfortunatelly it is not working in March. Anyway night cruise was very beautiful. When it is cold outside you can have a sit inside the ferry. There are 2 options of night cruise buffet (very costly) and live music. The music wasn't fantastic, but it was a good cultural experience. The musician played the guitar songs and all korean visitors sang along. LOL"
Fun afternoon,Great experience. Chilled vibe with a nice view!! Try making it for the sunset cruise. I still want to go on the Dinner Buffet cruise but if you have some time on an afternoon it's definitely worth it!
Beautiful river cruise,We enjoyed the night cruise on the Han River with the stunning Seoul night skyline in the background. Great to be able to hang out on the deck and retreat indoors when it gets too cold!
Pleasant Cruise,Pleasant cruise on the Han River at dusk. Some pretty light shows and some pleasant music after sunset.It was called the party boat but no alcohol. Very relaxing and look at Seoul from the water. 
Seoul's riverbanks from a fun Han river cruise,"We didn't get any seats, as they were limited, luckily we had great views from where we stood. It was a great evening. No information on what we saw as the tour was not guided. Saw the floating islands with H. and Haeahn Architecture, a new cultural center which various festivals such as performance, exhibition, and leisure can be held which changed colors every about 5 seconds. Lots of great bridges, the Banpo fountain bridge spewing illuminated water. Good 1.5 hrs."
Nice Cruise,"Took the evening cruise which was approximately 90 minutes along the Han River. Cruise was very relaxing and provided very nice views of Seoul. The boat had two levels, the lower being glass enclosed and the top deck was open air. Ample seating is provided on the lower deck and minimal seating is providing on the upper deck (get there early for best seating on upper deck). Fortunately we had perfect weather but would not suggest on rainy day as the upper deck has little shelter. The light and water show on the bridge was a nice feature but not spectacular. At 15,000 won ($15.00) this was a good value for this cruise."
A nice evening.,"We went on a night cruise that was about 90 minutes long that included a water/light show on one of the bridges, and fireworks. We stayed up on top and had great views. They also had a 20 minute performance from a singer, which everyone seemed very interested in watching. I chose to have the top deck almost to myself, and I could hear the singing just fine from there. It was a beautiful evening and I thought the cruise was a very worthwhile thing to do. No spectacular sights, but very nice all the same. And not very expensive."
"Beautiful Light Show . . . But, Overall Just Okay","Cruise lasted about an hour with recorded commentary in English, Chinese & Korean. Seoul looked very glamorous from the top deck as we cruised towards Banpo Bridge for a beautiful light show. However, it was a bit took chilly for us to be outside for too long and overall quite crowded. While the sights were lovely the onboard entertainment was incredibly annoying (single guitar player who was having sound issues)."
NIight cruise,"To get Eland cruise take line 5 and leave on Yeouinaru station,than proceed by walking to peer about 15 minutes ,we take last cruise on 21.00 thickets cost 12000 won/pp,it last about 35-40 minutes , nothing special but you see night city and relax."
short and expensive,"The trip is advertised as taking an hour, but it's just half of that. Not a good deal at all.If you take it, sit outside because inside, the volume of the PA system is just unbearable."
Relaxing,"We really enjoyed this little tour we did it twice, this a real nice cruise on the Han River quiet relaxing with a great night view of Seoul."
Not spectacular but a good way to see Seoul and it's not expensive ,"This boat I took from Jamsil area, a return 90 minute trip. We took one of the later boats and so it was quieter. There isn't stunning scenery but a few of the bridges are well lit at night. A good experience if you have extra time in Seoul and weather is nice "
Nice relaxation for a night cruise,Relax and nice view of the Han river by night.There is excellent music that makes you relax and after 30 mins you can go out on the starboard side/stern of the cruise and take great snaps with the several bridges lit at night.Nice
Christmas Dinner cruise,"I took the Eland dinner cruise from Yeouido pier and enjoyed a leisurely cruise, very nice dinner and entertainment. It lasts about 2 hours and you cruise up the Han river under the well lit bridges. There is a lunch cruise and a dinner cruise depending on whether you want to sightsee in the daytime or see the city lit up at night. For Christmas dinner I reserved a table at the SUJI restaurant in Itaewon and was severely disappointed. No real turkey, just packaged turkey slices and overpriced. To make up for the dismal Christmas dinner I decided on the cruise even though there was no turkey, only duck. The food selection was quite vast and good. There was entertainment and everyone had a good time. I will definitely be going again. Possibly for lunch to see the sights during daylight."
Nice for a company dinner,"My company hosted a holiday dinner at this boat and it worked out well. I cannot comment on cost, as the company paid for everything. I can say that the food was good and the staff very attentive to our needs. While relatively short, it was perfect for a nice dinner and some time for the obligatory speeches by our leaders. Because it was a cruise with friends/colleagues I really cannot comment on the scenery, we spent most of the time talking and enjoying each other's company."
Rather disappointing,"I took the Han River Cruise from the wharf near Yeouinaru station. There was not much to see from that particular trip. Just the Seoul Assembly Hall and 63 Building. Unfortunately it was also raining, so more of a bummer."
Best Han River Dinner Cruise,"Going on this Han River Cruise was one of the highlights of my last visit to Seoul. You embark on the boat in the Yeouido Pier & cruise through the Han River for > 2 hours giving us a fantastic night view of Seoul passing through a number of beautifully lighted bridges including the Rainbow Fountain Bridge of the Banpodaegyo. Buffet dinner was really sumptuous with a variety of cuisine to choose from & there was also live entertainment on board. All in all,l it was worth it and it's a highly recommended thing-to-do when in Seoul."
Great food,"We had the Han River Cruise through E-land with their lunch buffet. Food was really great; don't try their waffles though cause they were harder than cookies.Staff was very courteous but not fluent in English. Their safety demonstration was in Korean so we just sat there and watched the attendant wear his life jacket without understanding a word he was saying.Don't worry about motion sickness or getting seasick cause the cruise was real smooth all the way.Good view but not really exceptional. Would I come back again? Yes, but only for the food."
