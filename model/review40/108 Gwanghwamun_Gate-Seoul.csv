The guard changing order ,The changing order ceremony is a must see! You dont need to buy ticket to see the ceremony as it is held before the gate ; at the area where the ticket counter is. They are quite punctual and lasted moreless about 10mins. 
No Reason to Miss!,"Well, since it is considered an attraction all by itself and it is right next to Gyeongdukgung Palace, there really isn't any reason to miss Gwanghwamun Gate.Visit when the guards are changing, grab some pictures and move on."
Gate To Gwanghwamn Palace,"This is an impressive and large gate into the palace and best seen during the changing of the guard every hour between 10 AM and 3 PM each day.It was built in 1395 but destroyed during a Japanese invasion in 1592, and rebuilt in 1867. A popular place for tourists."
Impressive gate,One of the many traditional and historical gates of the city that welcomes you to the past while standing in the middle of the modern technology of the present
Simple Elegance,"This traditional Korean palace gate, with a distant-mountain backdrop, remained our objective as we ambled North on Gwanghwamun Square. We had come to see Gyeongbokgung Palace, the most important during the Joseon Dynasty, and this main and largest gate to the complex was how we planned to enter. Though the original structure went up in 1395, the gate has endured poor condition, destruction and movement to nearby locations throughout the centuries. The most recent restoration, completed in 2010, is authentic in capturing the original’s look, materials and placement The two-story granite-and-wood pavilion displays a stark-white base, which matches the palace’s outer wall, and a double green-tiled roof. Three archways in the gate reflect how the palace was once entered. The king passed through the central opening, while the crown prince and royal officers used the other two. This beautiful gate, displaying a much earlier-era architecture. seemed strangely juxtapositioned in modern Seoul with nearby tall buildings and much vehicular traffic passing by. A massive courtyard sprawls behind the gate, where visitors can enter for free. An admission charge is assessed, however, to proceed beyond this area. We arrived too late to see the colorful changing of the guard ceremony, which occurs here at 10 a.m. and 2 p.m., but had already witnessed this spectacle elsewhere in the city. Dozens of the myriad visitors standing around wore traditional Korean garments. These can be rented in the courtyard area.For those without time to explore the huge royal palace complex, I recommend a quick stop here to see the gate and timed for the changing of the guards, which does not take place on Tuesdays. There are nearby Metro stops."
Palace gates ,"The gates of the palace, good for photos and specially if you can catch the guards ceremony and changing hours. Check the schedule before coming."
Great for Pictures,The Gwanghwamun Gate is on of the most popular gates in Seoul. All of the gates have an own and unique story which you can figure out. 
Ornate classical palace gate.,It's just a gate as part of the larger Gyeongbokgung Palace. It's an impressive structure to behold. 
Impressive Main gate ,"This is the main gate into the grand palace. While most of these gates look similar, this main gate is impressive. It prepares you to expect the greatness inside. "
Palace main gate,Gwanghwamun is the main gate for the royal palace. Changing of the guard occurs here. A fine piece of Korean architecture.
Hugely Impressive,"I was very impressed by this massive, ceremonial entrance to Gyeongbokgung Palace. When I first arrived I thought there was a row of mannequins dressed as imperial guards, but they are real! They stands so still, honestly it's quite remarkable. The gate is beautiful when seen from both sides. It is possible to see it for free as the ticket booth is well inside the gate.The changing of the guard ceremony is quite something else but even if you are not there for that, it's a magnificent gate and well worth a lingering stop on my opinion "
Main entrance to Gyeongbokgung Palace,"This is the southern gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace and is the main entrance to the palace. It has 3 arched gates. Formerly, the centre gate was used by the king, while the other two were used by crown prince and royal officials.Upon entering the gate is a huge square where the changing of guards take place. It is free for public viewing as it is just before the palace entrance where ticket is required. Hence time yourself to witness the changing of the guards ceremony at 1000hr and 1400hr daily."
The Palace Main Gate,"Gwanghwamun is in fact same location as Gyeongbokgung Palace of the most famous Chosun Dynasty. To come here, you can take the subway or walk along Sejong-daero. When you plan your trip, don't be confused by the name and mixed up with other Gates or Palace in Seoul. During the Civil War of the Koreans 1950-53, Hanseong (Name changed to Seoul 2005), this Capital City of the Chosun Dynasty was four times changed hands and all buildings were totally destroyed. Gwanghwamun now is only a replica of the historical site. To visit Gyeongbokgung Palace, you have to enter here. At the square right after, there is a ticket booth that you can obtain tickets to enter the Palace.The square between the Palace Entrance and the Main Gate Gwanghwamun, is the place for the famous Guard Rotation Ceremony show twice a day, at 10 am and 2 pm when you are not allow to enter till recess or finished. To attend the show is free.For videos of the show, you can watch at the map site of Gyeongbokgung or the Gyeongbokgung Gate Guard Rotation Ceremony at my tube."
Changing of the Guards,The best time to visit this area is during the changing of guards. It can be quite a spectacle to observe. Make sure to fall in line early to be able to position yourself near the front of the gate for the best view. It's a nice traditional ceremony. May not entertain small children.
The Guards,Great opportunity to see the changing of the guards. Free experience as you pay when you go beyond this area to enter the castle itself
Small with a grand performance!,"We enjoyed this place and to our surprise it was perfect timing to watch the changing of the guards. The costumes were all so colorful with a narration in 3 languages. Very entertaining as well as educational. No need to rush with the photos because they give you an opportunity to actually take a photo beside the Generals! There are stalls around the place for food and refreshments, take note of a small waffle place on the left where people seem to queue forever!"
Free and great!,"Be sure to visit around the changing of the guard, if you want a photo with the guards they are OK with that, just do not interact with them, stand alongside and take the pic easily.Once you've checked out the gate, continue through and check out the HUGE palace complex."
Changing the Guard,This is the fourth and southern gate guarding the Gyeongbok Palace and is where the changing of the guard ceremony is performed daily. Good photo opportunity
Great to view at night.,Found this place on the way to KFC just close by.It is best to see at night all light up.Just a walk around.
Cool Place,"We actually discovered this by accident, thinking it was one of the palaces. All of Seoul's historical places need to be explored, the culture is amazing and they take very good care of their sites."
Nice architecture,"It is a gate with a nice architecture , well maintained, colorful, many people around but you can spend some time just admiring the building details."
Well worth visiting,"If you can time a visit here with that of the changing of the guard it’s a wonderful experience. From admiring the outfits, the beating of the drums and the traditional marching it feels really authentic. It drew quite a crowd on my visit so it’s worth getting there early if you want a prime view!Lots of visitors dress in traditional outfits adding to the atmosphere. There’s plenty to look at without having to enter the main temple area but the contrast between the surrounding modern cityscape and the history inside is inspiring. If you’re in the city then popping in is a must!"
A cute little temple type structure,Doesn't take more than a few minutes to see this. Very small and easy to get to. But still lovely to see considering the heritage and history of the location. 
Worth the trip!,"This can and should be included with a visit to the palace. But even if you don't go into the palace, you watch the changing of the guard, and see some traditional Korea."
Great Place,"There are many in Seoul but this one is bigger and imposing than the others, to see at the beginning of the park."
breathaking,"first thing you will notice, the ever majestic view of the entrace to geongbukong palace. here where they will have every 10 minutes the royal guard changing ceremony"
Impressive structure,Picturesque structure fronting the Gyeongbokgung palace.It can be photographed as a whole when you go in front of the plaza near the subway.Otherwise a side framing will do.
I LOVE IT,A history site in the middle of bustling city? You just gotta love it. It is free entrance fee to Gyeongbukgung every second Wednesday of the month of free everyday when you wear Korean tradition clothing.
Big gate,"This gate present traditional Korean way build gates. It is rebuild according to old gate. During day time, front of gate have qurad changing ceremony which is nice to see. But still, it is just a gate with three door. Nothing special."
Amazing Place,"For them who love to take a picture or love history, this place is a must.. you can rent hanbok outside the palace if you want to take a picture with a hanbok.. you also have to take a look at the time of ceremony in here so you can watch the ceremony."
impressive place,"It is a very interesting place to see when walking in the area, with a typically Korean architecture."
Entrance to the Gyeongbokgung Palace,"An impressive gate at the entrance to the Gyeongbokgung Palace situated at the north end of Sejongno. Aside from being an historically significant gate dating back many centuries, this is where you can view the changing of the guards each day. Once the event has completed you can actually take photos standing beside the guards although you are not really advised to take close pictures of their faces."
The gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace,"Great place for photo opportunity, although it can be very crowded. You can take photos with the guards outside the gate."
watched the changing of guards,we stood by the gate to watch the ceremony of changing of guards. the guards were wearing proper uniforms and the demonstration was most authentic. highly recommend.
easy to find,easy to find coming from the metro. watch out for the changing of the guards - can be watched for free.
Great Monument,Access is a bit complicated due to the heavy traffic at times but climb up the old rampart and you will be rewarded with great views. It has been beautifully restored and the gate looks amazing.
A MUST visit place and temple,If you go to Seoul and miss this place your trip is worthless trust me there nothing like this awesome gate and temple
WORTH A VISIT,One of Seoul's best known sights. Impressive and definitely worth visiting. Definitely of interest to a western tourist. We visited it during the Lunar New Year so an additional attraction was the sight of many Koreans wearing traditional costumes.
Gate of the Palaces!,Best place to enter when going to the Gyeongbokgung Palace. Gate in the city I must say! Unique experience for us.
Impressive gate and some spectacular shows on the day I visited,"The Gwanghwamun Gate is very prominently located at the northern end of Sejongno ""boulevard"" at a busy intersection with pretty heavy traffic. It is the main and largest gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace, in Jongno-gu, Seoul. I visited this area one Saturday afternoon and I was absolutely thrilled to bits to walk into the square behind the gate and find that a major, colourful show was in progress. It seemed to be the reenactment of a major battle from the Joeseon Dynasty many centuries ago. I couldn't follow the story line but the King and his courtiers seemed to be in attendance as well as two colourful opposing factions who went through some rather spectacular fighting scenes to the accompaniment of music, lots of drumming and gong bashing. And all for free. Wonderful. And made all the better by having the luck of beautiful warm, sunny weather"
Historic place,"This is a must visit for history lovers, watch changing of guards and a very well preserved place that is."
Main gait - try to see the changing of the guards,"Try to time your visit with the spectacular re-enactment of the historical changing of the guards, also an acoustic spectacle. Apart from this, be impressed by the sheer dimensions of the compound..."
Wonderfully preserved and decorated,The gate is very imposing (as they should be) and wonderfully decorated with intricate designs and colors. Arrive early in the morning to have the area all to yourself.
Cool!,Made it to Gwanghwamun Gate in time to watch the changing of the guard. They are dressed in traditional clothing. Cool to watch it!! Recommend if able to see!
nice,"The gate of the biggest palace is realy nice, next to a bussy road but i don't mind. nice when the gate is open"
i didnt know what to do here,"at the front gate, u can find some gatekeepers which i was thinking statues at first, but after two hours they change their swift and they wear traditional uniform, so can take documentation with them. "
Amazing to witness their culture,Changing of guards starts at 11am and happens every hour. It's quite an experience. It feels as if you are transported back in time. 
Traditional Architecture in The city,Amazing scenery of the historical gate in the middle of city. The ancient architecture and advanced city exist together. The King Sejong statue was located across the street.
Just beautiful,"While crossing the gate, I felt like I was crossing time. It was beautifully designed and well taken care of. "
Wow,"I can't even believe that this is the gate from long ago. It is easy to locate. By the way, I am shocked at how they still using the big wooden blocks to holds the entrance door. Wow"
Packed with people!,"When you come and see the guard exchange ceremony, you will expect a lot of people watching. They have a schedule (found it somewhere) for the guard changing and it looks really cool. If you have time and if you want to stay under the heat of the sun or under the winter cold, then there won't be any problem. It's also a good experience anyway. ;)"
Great historical site,Large building with lots of history. Great place to visit. Be prepared to walk as the property is very large.
Sits in a beautiful square,"The Gate itself is great for pictures but the square is lovely. It contains fountains, statues and sculptures that are definitely worth seeing. Take exit 2 at Gwaghwamun metro station to access square."
Fantastic experience,Truly an experience to see and go through. We went through to see the changing of the gueard here which was a good 15min experience. 
Don't Miss the Royal Guard Changing Ceremony!,"Gwanghwamun Gate is a main entrance to the Gyeongbokgung Palace, a must-see for visitors to Seoul. This historic gate and palace harken back to Seoul's Joseon Dynasty while sitting in the middle of a modern, bustling city, and the juxtaposition is fascinating! (Note that the gate and palace are reconstructions of the originals.) There are multiple reenactments held throughout the day, and it is well worth it to schedule your visit around one or two of these. The Sumunjang (Royal Guard) Changing Ceremony was a colorful and exciting experience for both kids and adults! Held at 10 am and 2 pm daily, it is a twenty minute ceremony with vibrant costumes and drumming. Try to arrive about 15 minutes early for a good viewing spot. There are also military training demonstrations and other performances. Even better, the performances are free and open to the public! Check the schedule before going, and poor weather can result in cancellations. After the ceremony, head into Gyeongbokgung Palace to learn more about Korea's royal history. Note that there will also probably be loads of tourists dressed up in hanbok, traditional Korean garb taking selfies."
Majestic gate,This is Southern gate to the Gyeongbokgung. It is very majestic and nicely restored. The gate is facing open square and modern downtown Seoul. A great view of the city. 
Nice bid and bueatiful,"very big gate, it is the main entrance of the palace. don't forget to click snaps with palace guards. "
Landmark gate to the Royal Palace,"This spectacular gate is the main gate to Gyeongbokgung Palace, it is quite beautiful to see from afar and close up, it is not as old as it looks. A gate has been present at the front of the palace since 1395, but unfortunately there have been many rebuilds over the years, this version of the gate received major restoration and was completed recently in 2010. It is free to enter through the gate and view the palace from afar or go on to purchase a ticket to enter the palace."
Beautiful!,"I loved starting here then heading to the shopping street. It's huge and majestic. I hadn't seen the castles yet, so this impressed me maybe more than it should. Kind of a pain you have to cross the street to get there, but well worth it since it was a gate from the original gate around the city."
South Entrance to Gyeongbokgung Palace,"This gate is located at the South end of Gyeongbokgung Palace and where the guards are stationed for the Changing of the Guard Ceremony. There is no admission fee to pass through the Gwanghwamun Gate to observe the Changing of the Guard Ceremony.You do need to buy a ticket to pass through the next gate, Heungnyemun Gate, to enter the grounds of Gyeongbokgung Palace. The ticket office is just to the right after passing through the Gwanghwamun Gate.The Changing of the Guard Ceremony occurs in the courtyard between the Gwanghwamun Gate and the Heungnyemun Gate. There is no shade in the courtyard when watching the Changing of the Guard Ceremony and it is advisable to wear a hat, sunglasses, and sunscreen. Some people used umbrellas to provide shade."
"Great place to take pictures, grand old gate",A great place for your family to take pictures of this grand gate of the past. It is beautiful to look at and unfortunately you're not allowed up.
Wonderful Landmark,"For sure a stunning landmark from Seoul ... it the main entrance for the Palace.It has all details of a heritage attraction, also is well located so you'd like to spend time around the district."
Bricks looked new,"The southern gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace.Some parts such as a banner, roofs and paçade might be old, probably. But, it looked quite new overall. I would've liked it better if bricks looked old.The southern and the main gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace. Lots of visitors and guards. Especially, people come to see the changing ceremony of guards.On the other hand, when the people mention 'Gwanghwamun', they often consider the area before this gate."
Changing of the Guards,Understand that there are several sessions for the ceremony for changing of the guards. We were here at about noon and managed to caught the ending. Not sure what would be the right time to come. 
Beautiful gate,The gate connecting the palace with the Gwanghwamun square - this gate is similar to hundreds others. Nothing too great about it but I liked these Korean gates built at a lot of places. Shows the history of Korea though they seem to have been reconstructed. 
Amazing building!,"At night it looks amazing, it was very close from the place i was staying in, so I looked every night."
Impressive ,"Night and DayYou should go early in morningTo the the guards parade It s really unusual , via this gate you have access to the first courtyard of the Palace "
Mystery of Gwanghwamun,"The building are really old and have a historical-cultural look that really mesmerizing. At the end of the journey, you might have wanted to have another round of it. You'll feel mysterious and full of curiosity on the amazing structure and allocation of building there."
South (Peacock) Gate at Gyeongbokgung Palace. 10 & 2 Royal Guard change,"This is the South(Peacock) Gate at Gyeongbojgung Palace. At 10 & 2, there is the changing of the Royal Guards ceremony. You don’t need a Palace ticket to see it. All the “guards” are outfitted in uniforms from the early Joseon Dynasty and carry “weapons” from the 15th century. Many of them even sport a fake moustache and goatee. The long feather in their hats is from quail. This is designed to show the traditional rituals from that time period."
Changing of the Guard at Gwanghwamun Gate At Gyeongbokgung Palace,"The ceremony starts at 10. Your perception of a ""gate"" changes with this enormous structure and the absolutely huge yard space after you enter. We entered from the side gate and ran and ran and ran.... We watched the colorful ceremony take place. Afterwards, we continued on to the impressive Gyeongbokgung Palace."
Entertaining,We stayed near this gate and thought we would just go and visit quickly. The guards were entertaining and let us take pictures with them & even moved so we could stand between them in the one picture. Very pretty at night all lit up.
Only go if you can make changing of the guards,Definitely schedule around changing of the guard ceremony otherwise it is just a gate with a few guards at the front that tourist get way too close to for photos. The ceremony is about 15 minutes and you get to see traditional outfits and music. 
Love it~,"I like to come here every season and get different pictures in different weathers and at different seasons. The government usually provides different cultural experiences for the public, and even provide a special queue for foreigners (So even if the maximum quota is closed to the limit, foreigners can go...) I love this place!"
Definitely Tourist place,"Taking picture in front of this gate. Because it is a mandatory visit to this Palace and the gate is one of the most famous and Instagram photo ever.In the morning not so many people and good to take picture by yourself. Afternoon, usually too crowded with so many buses and tourist from all over the world. "
Great pictures of the guards ,We were there during the changing of the guards! These guys were very imposing and very popular.Hint: Try to be there just as they are arriving. You will get all the drums and noise that goes with it!Definitely recommend
Beautiful Palace,"I'm not sure what I should expect as I'd never visited a palace in South Korea before. The price was good, and they had an English speaking tour 3 times a day as well as headphones with translated services. It was cold the day that I went, but still beautiful. "
Beautiful,A very well kept and maintained palace with unique designs with beautiful and colourful wood carvings. worthwhile going and spending the time to see it
Colourful Parade,"The daily Changing of the Guards is the best attraction for this Palace. I very like the way they set up a special area for the children. After the parade, do go to the front of the gate to take picture with the guards, up close and get personal."
Beautiful,"Really beautiful gate, along with the palace and the vincinity area. Make sure to wait for the guards exchange, it is another bit of Korean culture you can see there."
Changing of the Guards,"It was mid morning in Seoul and the temperatures were way down the centigrade scale. The coldness of the atmosphere did not stop us from going the Gwanghwamun gate to watch the changing of the guards. We arrived at the gate with plenty of people whose purpose was exactly like ours. After a few minutes of waiting, with clock precision, the changing of the guards started. It was fun to watch. We had some pictures taken with the guards. The event was delightfully enjoyable. "
Beautiful architecture,Is you like Architecture and history this is a great place to go. Is right in front of Gwanghwamun Square. You wil find in this street museums and Sejon Center for the performing Arts.
the gate to the gyongbokgung palace,"we were having greater experience when visited this place in the morning, and wait until 11 am where you can see the changing guard ceremony, very interesting"
Ancient and modern times!!,What a wonderful view in the city hall... when you walk on street you can feel both ancient times and modern times... it was amazing to me.
Good for a photo,This gate is lit up nicely at night. I wouldn't make the journey just for this alone but it's so close to the DDP and some pretty good shopping (also the Cheonggyechong Stream?) so make it a part of your itinerary if you will.
Modern & Tradition,"Seoul is a city of Modern & Tradition. When visiting Gwanghwamun Gate / Square, you can see beautiful buildings, plants. and it was like time stopped. People wearing traditional Korean cloths."
Worth half a day's walk,"Watching the changing of the guards in their colourful uniforms is enjoyable. The Palace garden is hugh and taking a morning stroll is a good exercise to breathe n enjoy the fresh air. Other places of interests are nearby, hence a good one day touring the area is convenient."
"Changing guard ceremony, part of palace","If you visit Gyeongbokgung, this place is one part of the palace that you should see. Some of guardians stand in front of the gate. Don't forget to watch the changing guard ceremony. "
Gate visit,If you have a chance to go here it’s amazing. The changing of the guard it very much worth watching. Arrive approximately 15 minutes prior to get a good location to watch. 
Amazing historical palace,"This is a nicely preserved palace with the interesting parade and guard changing ceremony that should not be missed in the morning. However, the -5c temperature, couple with strong wind in the early morning make it unbearable to enjoy the place. There is a museum next to the palace which one can visit if it is too cold outdoor. If not because of the weather, I can imagine it will be really nice to walk around the palace slowly and enjoy the architecture and history of the palace."
Part of your palace visit - walk down the main road to see this,"This gate is one of several in Seoul, and located near the main palace sites. Walk down the boulevard on your way to Insa-dong or Myeong-dong nearby."
Make sure to see guard change,It is a part of the Gwanghwamun Palace. Make sure to see guard change. We loved it. Very nice and you can try guard uniforms for free.
Awesome Asian Architecture,"When in Seoul this is a must-see stop. The gate is colossal. In ancient times, the royal guards of Joseon Dynasty performed the given task by guarding the Gwanghwamun Gate, the entrance of Gyeongbokgung Palace where the king ruled the country. Since 1469, the ceremony has taken place and its record has been consulted for the present reenactment ceremony.The reenactment of the original ceremony began from 1996. The gate guardsmen serve their sentry, perform the changing of the guards, and hold a parade. The guards' uniforms, weapons, and accessories as well as their strict ceremonial procedures catch the eyes of passersby, especially foreign tourists, when guardsmen perform the changing of guards in traditional costumes at the main gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace in downtown Seoul. Since it is hard to experience traditional events in such a big city like Seoul, citizens and tourist really enjoy and love it. It takes place every day except Tuesday.Major Highlights: The Royal Guard-Changing Ceremony is a great opportunity to experience a rare traditional scene in Korea. Be sure to bring a camera to take lots of pictures. The guards’ splendid costumes, with their brilliant primary colors, are a real pleasure to see. If you have some spare time to kill, make sure to visit the palace and enjoy the beauty of Korean palaces following the ceremony."
Royal Ceremony,"In here you can deepened your knowledge about Korean Culture, the ceremony is amazing. The gate is so large and you can take a picture with the royal guard in the entrance. You have to take your chance since the guard have specific shift time before the next guard take their place. Don't forget to bring an umbrella, it is very hot there."
Photo op with the royal guard,"Go here after you done visiting the Gyeongbokgung Palace, you can have photo opportunity with the royal guards. Located just in front of the palace."
Grand old gate,The gate is huge and grand and such a contrast to the high rises surrounding it. Don't miss the guard changing ceremony and do visit Gyeongbokgung Palace too.
Old ancient City,"Few hundred meters away from Tosokchon Samgyetang. We decide to go in have a visit after for a late lunch at Tosokchon Samgyetang. I was an eye opening experience if you are first time visiting to these kind of ancient city. It's big, we spent a few hours there seeing the refurbished building from the 13th centuries. A lot visitors also rent the Hanbok from nearby shop around."
Changing of the guards,This is the main gate of the palace. It's full of tourist and too crowded for my taste. I just took some photos and watched the changing of the guards then left.
historical landmark,one of the entrances to geongbukgong palace. here is where the changing of palace guard takes place. King Sejong and General Yi SunShin statue is just opposite
Iconic gate,This is the iconic gate of the Gyeongbokgung palace. Watch out for the change of guards and the procession being held here in different times of the day. Closed on Tuesdays.
A beautiful part of historic Korea,"While there is no shortage of attractions around Gwanghwamun, you shouldn't miss the gate to it all. "
Entrance into History,Experience walking through the gates before entering the palace and it will take your breathe away.Highly recommended to witness the changing of the guards at 11AM.
Grand gate,"This gate is the main gate of the Gyeongbukgung Palace. It was founded by the first king of the Joseon Dynasty in the late 14th century. They say that it translates to “may the light of enlightenment cover the world.” The gate is made of granite and the centre has a gate tower above it. During the Japanese occupation of Korea, the original gate was destroyed. The present gate was rebuilt in the late sixties using concrete. Gwanghwamun has its name written on a sign on the gate, and it was personally written by former President Park Jeong-Hui. There is a changing of the guard ceremony that takes place every morning. It is very colourful and a joy to watch.On either side of the gate you can see the word “Haetae” which is a mythical unicorn-lion that is said to protect palaces from fire. Admission to the gate is free."
See only the Gate,You are literally just looking at a huge gate in this place. You can spend your time here for 15mins to 30mins. Nothing much to see here.
Fun part of a visit to Palace,"This is a fun part of a visit to the palace, as it offers the guards wearing traditional garb and carrying swords and spears. They do a fun little changing of the guard ceremony periodically, which is also neat. Worth a stop for sure!"
Another gate but this one best for photos,"Difficult to find, which is surprising, as its overshadowed by adjacent buildings but great for photographs "
Pretty Cool to See,"Was roaming around and stumbled upon this place on accident. Wasn't much happening the day we went, but was nice to see it and get a few photos."
A beautiful reminder that people have been around for a while,"If you love historical places, this is a great stop for you. Seoul has a lot of these historical stand-alone buildings but each one is slightly different and unique.for me it was worth visiting. I love to learn how people have been making Beautiful things for centuries. These gates and temples are no exception to that. Wonderful that this important history has been preserved."
Nice,"It’s the gate to the palace, good place for photography and its on main street with statures and many coffee shops and restaurants. "
A standalone building,It is a standalone building leftover from the past. There may be some historical importance but it is nothing special.
Gyeongbokgung Palace's Main Gate,Admire the beautiful architecture. And learn about it's history. It's a quick walk from train stations around Jongno. You're not going to miss it. You can watch the changing of the guards at 10 am and 2pm year round (If I am not mistaken).
Main gate for Gyeongbokgung Palace,"We came round to this main gate after exiting a side gate where lots of tourist buses were waiting, when we had finished exploring Gyeongbokgung palace. There were guards in colourful costumes guarding the entrance. This gate was right in front of Gwanghwamun square and there were lots of tourists taking photos."
A fascinating experience,This experience gives a flavour of ancient Korea meeting the modern world.Young youths dress up in traditional Korean costumes and have pictures taken outside this beautiful setting. It is a stunning and beautiful sight to behold. The changing of the guard is a colourful and interesting experience. 
Great entrance to the city palace.,"You can see the traditional guard here and their change. Also through here, you get to the palace and park behind."
Beautiful,"We went to see the gate under the night lights. But it turns out it was open at night. Absolutely beautiful and maybe because there's wasn't many people, more so. Something to be said about something so old and then having cars driving back and forth so busily in front of it. "
Beautiful gate,A beauftiful gate with nice traditional architecture. Most of the time you can see the traditional Korean guards around the gate where you can take photos with. They have at certain times a change of guards ceremony.
A landmark in Seoul,"I have walked past this gate many times, also entered it a few times. It is a landmark in town, looks good and some activities around it."
Largest and Majestic ,"It is the main gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace. The largest and also the most beautiful and Majestic with the mountains in the background. Don't miss the Changing of the Guard Ceremony and Guard Duty Ceremony twice a day. You can see the reenactment of palace guard with colorful costumes, traditional weapons and musical instruments. Strong Recommended. "
Impressive,Great site to see. A long way down the boulevard prepares for the approach. And it is a not to miss site.
Take pictures with guards here,This ancient gate leads to the palace. It is where you can snap pictures with the guards after they do their change of guard parade. Don't forget to snap pictures with the unicorns outside the gate. They looked similar to the Chinese Lions guarding the gate.
Fabulous!,"This gate leads to Gyeongbokgung Palace. Just outside across there's flea market that has a stall that sells Hanbok at really cheap prices. So before entering Gyeonbokgung or any palace, drop by this place! "
Entrance into a time machine,"Going through the Gwanghwamun Gate is like entering a time machine into another period.... the Joseon Dynasty era. The gate blends in perfectly in between the ancient Gyeongbokgung Palace and the modern buildings and plaza across the wide busy boulevard. The area around the gate does tend to get very crowded, but it is still worthwhile to take a photo with the palace guards in traditional Joseon-era costume for a priceless memory of your Seoul trip. "
Magnificent day and night,Magnificent structure dominating the square. The guards make it a wonderful spectacle. Make sure you return at night as beautifully illuminated.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful 
Huge ancient gate!,So grand! It also has a good mountain background! Those fascinated with Asian (Korean) history will have a delight. 
Best way into the Palace,Part of the palace behind it so make sure you go in this way. The guard changes here so don't miss the show!
Big Great Gate,"Great place to take photos but that's about it. However, should come to this place to take pictures as it is one of the popular places to take photos."
Great timing on our behalf,"Right next to the market, so thought we'd have a look. We were fortunate to see a changing of the guards: very formal, yet fascinating, and no crowds.Awe inspiring."
nice old gate,Nice place which shows you the history of the Korea like old days and really nice to visit all the time
The Grand Entrance to Gyeongbukgung,"It's an impressive and grand gate that leads you into a huge square and into the palace. If taking photos of imperial guards is your thing, then this is where you can go to. You may also catch the changing of guards times."
Gwanghwamun gate,"Gwanghwamun gate is a part of Gyeongbok gung palace. Ceremony was made at near the gate. This should be visited as the part of Gyeongbok-gung palace, not separately. "
Icon of Seoul,"Not a lot to see but still a must see as it stands among modern skyscrapers, a strange contrast and a national treasure and "
Historical point,"This is the main gate direct to Gyeongbokgung (palace). Go through there is an offer combination ticket that include 4 palaces and 1 shirne for visiting, price as 10,000 won."
Pass by to make some photos,"Gwanghwamun Gate play important role in Korean history and I am not the tour guide to tell you stories here. At the same time I can tell you that it is still worth to pass by to make some photos, especially taking into consideration that Namdemun market is located just a step away from this gate so that you could combine two point of interest. "
Beautiful!,"Beautiful gate during day as well as night when it is so nicely lighted. During the day, the guards in they colorful outfits are something to see."
It's the entrance to the palace,I can't imagine anyone going here jus for the gate. It's the entrance to the palace and where the changing of the guard takes place. The inspection of the guard is fun to watch. 
Interesting!,"Great to see some history in Seoul. Easy to get to from downtown. Can be a bit touristy, but worth a visit."
Front entrance ,The excitement begins when you come to the front entrance and see the guards at the gates. Many people taking pictures and waiting for the changing of the guards. 
Gate To GyeongBokgung,You Can Take A picture before go to Gyeongbokgung palace and take a picture with the guard of the gate too
Impressive,Really cool to see the changing of the guard ceremony at this imposing gate to the Royal Palace. Great restoration of a historic site.
Famous gate opening the door leading to Gyeongbokgung Palace,Imposing gate where you'll be able to see the guard changing ceremony happening at specific times of the day.This ceremony lasts for approx. 10 mins and is commented in korean and english languages. 
Ok,"I alighted at Gyeokbokgung stn but left via Gwanghwamun station exit 9. To me, i thought Gwanghwamun was nearer. At the point of my time visiting, there was some form of flea market and further down there is this Sewol ferry disaster memorial happening. 3,000 won for the basic entrance. There is guard changing ceremony happening twice a day. Worth watching. Other than that, it is all good. Must visit when you are in Seoul! "
Attractive Architecture,Nice structure to get into the Palace. Large courtyard behind the gate. Changing of the guards behind the gate.
A beautiful gate.,"This is a beautiful gate, leading to the Gyeongbokgung palace‬.There's a big courtyard behind the gate where the changing of the guards takes place a couple of times a day.Do not miss this ceremony, as it it absolutely lovely."
Fascinating gate,"Although we did not watch the guard exchange it is definitely a place to visit. Especially in contrast to the modern buildings surrounding it, it sticks out and gives Gwanghwamun square its distinctinve look"
The entrance to Gyeongbokgung Palace,Walking distance from Gwanghwamun square. Entrance to Gyeongbokgung Palace though you have to pay a fee before you can enter.
Historical Must-See,"The Gwanghwamun Gate is right by the Sejong monument, adjacent to a museum underground that takes you through how the Korean alphabet was formed. Long story short - it's a beatiful area right near each other, and definitely one you should check out! "
entrance to the palace,big open spaces to walk aroundlots of touristsnear a train stationpalace gate itself and its walls is a tourist attraction too lots of cops during my visit since there is a protest activity
Gwanghwamun Gate,Gwanghwamun main gate for changing of the guard but because of protests they cancelled it. Still impressive even without changing of the guard also see square.
Main gate of the palace,"This is the main gate to the same name palace. It was fully renovated 6 years ago, but it conserved the same shape and characteristic of the ancient Korea times. It is a good example how to preserve a country history."
Great addition to the Palace,"Very nice contrasting views, the guard change ceremony is also interesting. good for photos and for sightseeing"
Must visit when you are in Seoul,"Must visit Gwanhwamun Gate when you are in Seoul because it is located in the Gwanghwamun Square, easy access by subway or buses."
See the Royal Palace through the main gate,and get a pix with one of the palace guards standing in the middle of it with the Palace in the background. Awesome pix!!The name of the gate translates roughly into “may the light of enlightenment blanket the world.” The name symbolizes the resounding dedication that the people had of the Joseon Dynasty. Look up on the internet what happened here during the Japanese invasion to dampen the spirits of the Korean people.The changing of the palace guard ceremony (done strictly for tourists now) happens daily at 10A and 2P (20 min) and at the gate at 11A and 1P (10 min.); we didn't get to see it because of snow. Too bad. Should be spectacular because of the colorful costumes.
Beautiful gate,I visited the gate at a time there was no changing of guards. It is still beautiful and picturesque. This is a beautiful site to take in together with the Square that is nearby.
Picturesque,"Easy to reach by metro, stop at Gyeongbokgung station and 5 minutes walk to reach this gate, outside Gyeongvbokgung Palace. you can take photo with the guards wearing traditional hanbok. From here also you can walk to Gwanghamun Square in only 5 minutes. "
Quick stop and look,Nice bid rebuilt gate. Worth a quick stop for a look around but really not much point in spending too much time...other things to see.
Must see with the guards,"On its own it will not tickle the pinkies, but with ceremonial guards it becomes a favourite with the tourists. And for this reason it is best to get in early before the bus loads of selfie stick toting tourists arrive. It is the only way to get a reasonably tourist free photo. If you are in the area for a while then also watch the changing of the guards from the outside."
Don't miss the change of palace guard ceremony,"Nice backdrop for pictures :)We enjoyed the change of palace guard ceremony.Other than that, nothing more to do."
beautiful palace,"If you have a good travel guide, you will get the story behind this place. We had a chance to see the changing of the guards, not so grand but interesting. "
"Magnificent, panaromaric view with ancient soldiers patrol show","It locates at the city centre, leading up a super wide center part of dual carriage traffic, City Hall, and surrounded by modern buildings and hotels, and makes up a perfect fusion of image. Ancient soldiers were smart and attracts lots of tourists taking photos. It's just close to any hotels at Jung-Gu, recommend to ride taxi , which is low fare and efficient."
Gwanghwamun Gate,At the end of the main street and 2km form the hotel. Easy flat walk or catch train. AS you walk down you can go part of the way underground and brows the shops. Also great in poor weather. Closes at 4pm
"Gate, Palace, Plaza and Museum in one place","Gwanghwamun Gate, Gwanghwamun Plaza and Gyeongbukgung Plaza are all in the same area and accessible by foot. Just for photography and a taste of local cultural and old buildings. Do visit the palace museum behind, which is free of charge."
Impressive. Right smack in the middle of Seoul,The grounds are huge and it can be a struggle if you are with seniors or toddlers. Interesting to walk around during afternoon. Not too crowded with tourists when we visited.
The entrance to Gyeongbokgung Palace,This gate is the entrance to Gyeongbokgung Palace. Do stay and check out the Royal Guard Changing Ceremony if you can!
Just front of Gyeongbokgung Palace,Just front of Gyeongbokgung Palace. Should take a good picture with hanbok ! Front of Gwanghwamun is a crowded road side. 
Gate,"My first temple visited in Korea. Quite a good first impression. Big gate, great location in the city"
Nothing special,"It's nothing special, 2 minutes is enough for this place, so if you don't plan to go to the palace behind it, no need to go there. "
Traditional Korean beauty.,"A beautiful example of Korean traditional architecture, however you really need to go through the temple area and garden to appreciate the magnitude of the area. Really worth several hours of wandering."
3 Key Icons,"Just as you get out of Gwanghwamun station you are greeted by the statue of Lee Soon Shin, King Sejong followed by the Gwanghwamun gate to Gyeongbok Palace. "
Historic landmark,Located by the side of a busy road. It was before you enter the palaces. Good for photography. It was nice a spectacular view.
Outstanding !!!,In the middle of the city you run in to this spectacular entrance to the main Palace guarded by old style dressed guards. Its just spectacular !
Well known landmark of the city :),"Centrally located, watch the guard changing ceremony and get dressed up in traditional clothing :) Enjoy!"
Just a gate. The best spot for photography is across the road.,Looks majestic. Good for photography. The best spot is across the road so that the whole gate will be in the picture.Another angle will be from the side so that the long wall on both the right and left will go into the picture. 
Beautiful structure,"It's the entrance to Gyeongbokgung Palace, with some kind of ceremony at 10 am and 2 pm. The architecture is beautiful and magnificent. I would recommend of going through here when visiting Gyeongbokgung Palace, which is the main attraction.Do visit during Palace opening hours."
The Entry to the Korean Dynasty Palace,"This Gate is the Entry point to to the Gyeongbokgung Palace, when Visited you can see the Guards Dressed in the Traditional Attire that were used in the Kings rule, the Guards are like Statues and do not move an inch. Overall, the Place is a must visit to Enlighten oneself with the Korean History."
boring,We took 2 trains to get to this gate and it was the most boring thing ever. Hyped up to be this amazing gate but you couldn't even get close to it. Not worth it. Nice thing is that the surrounding area is nice. Good shopping and restaurants in area.
The gate is nice but...,The gate is nice but it is the palace behind it that is the real attraction. Not worth the trip alone but if you are first at the gate you probably already plan to visit the palace as well
"Nice, but not very exciting","So you go there, you see the gate (that basically looks like every other gate in seoul) and that's that. there are guards there that will take pictures with you, but not very interesting. Might be good for parents who just want some cool pics of the kids without a lot of hassel."
Magnificent Structure,"The gate is the entrance to Gyeongbokgung Palace. There are guards with traditional attire at the gate standing there just like a statue. At specific times, there will be guard changing ceremony. To arrive here, you can either exit from Gyeongbokgung Station (nearer) or Gwanghwamun Station (will arrive at Gwanghwamun Square first).The structure and the whole cultural experience is worth a visit."
Gate to be,"Main gate of Gyeongbokgung palace, you must be present during the Guards ceremony if you want to come back with souvenirs."
Great picture spot!,This is the main gate into the palace grounds. Stop here for a photo for your memories! A great spot.
Worth a look,"Although it has been rebuilt, the stonework is original, and it's interesting to see where the original city limits were. The shopping district/centres are right near here too."
Great place for photo opportunities and architecture lovers,This is a great place to see while visiting Seoul. The architecture is very interesting and photographs well. It is fun to see and not a lot of time is needed.
Mighty gate to Seoul,"I find the gates to the city walls fascinating. Occasionally there are Guards dressed in traditional Korean clothing. It's not like some guards, these will talk to you and permit photographs to be taken at close range."
Must see,"From Gwanghwamun Square/Plaza, this beautiful gate is the first thing you'll see when you cross the street to Gyeongbokgung. Be sure to arrive in time to the Changing of the Guards. "
Newly reconstructed gate,"This iconic symbol of S Korea was reconstructed in the early part of the 21st century. Royal guard in traditional dress, changing of the guard ceremony twice per day most days. Combine with visit to fantastic palace - entrance is cheap, but discount for seniors with passport ID."
Historical Attraction,A visit to the Gwanghamun Gate takes you back in time. Nearby establishments shows the modern cityscape of Seoul and Gwanghwamun gate reflects traditional Seoul. The royal guards at the gate are dressed in traditional costume from the Joseon dynasty. Added attraction are the changing of the royal guards ceremony so have your cameras ready. The performance is held twice daily (one in the morning and one in the afternoon) except on Tuesdays. There is also a portion near the gate where you can experience wearing the traditional costume. 
Great place to see in Seoul,"A great land mark when you come to Seoul, Korea. Massive gate to you see when you stand in the middle of the main street in Seoul."
Impressive site in the center of Seoul,"Amazing view with the mountains as backdrop,always a site to see.Try to make it by sunset to get a spectacular view"
A majestic landmark,A very majestic gate that is a landmark of Seoul and opens the way for Gyeongbokgong within. You will likely see guards dressed in traditional uniform standing in place.
Just beautifully preseved architecture,"Beautiful entrance into Gyeongbokgung Palace. Watch the changing of the guards which happens every hour. I visited this on Saturday morning and found many young Koreans dressed in their national customs posing with tourists for photographs. If you don't wish to visit the Gyeongbokgung Palace (entrance fee of 3000 Won), you can still go inside these gates and walk inside the courtyard and take photos. "
Majestic,"The view here simplifies the majestic culture of korea somehow, though i really dont know the whole story of korean history. "
Number 1 Tourist Attraction,We walked from out hotel and it is very close to the huge market.It's South Korea's Number 1 Tourist Attraction. Worth the visit.
Looks grand,"I love to see the change of guards which takes place in front of the gate. Its amazing to see all the guards can stand still for a long period of time, and refrain from making big movements! We enjoyed teasing them, just to see their reaction...but no! We were the ones laughing instead!"
At Gwanghwamun Gate,"I visited this place every time I visited Korea, which it is already three time. And everytime I went there there always had a show like a ceremony of changing royal guard shift time. Never bored to watch it cos I do really like the Profile of Royal Guard that remind me of Korean Historical Movie such as Dae Jang Geum. Hehehe"
In the heart of Seoul - walking distance from main train station,This is one of the original gates to the city. It has been painfully restored after an arsonist set fire to it a few years ago. If you are in this part of the city it is well worth the price of admission (free).
Another must visit palace,Even wonderful if you can go on the schedules of the changing of the guards. My hubby was lucky because he gets to join the ceremony. He's in charge of the drum beat. They also have free costume where you can try for few minutes for picture taking purposes.I highly recommend a visit.
Takes your breath away,Driving along a main road surrounded by modern office blocks and then suddenly by the side of the road and right next to the busiest market place in the world is this beauty! Just go and take the photos!
Lovley gate,This is a really nice place and it stands out between ancient Korean culture to the fast pace of modern city life!!!
"Interesting Place, must go while in Seoul","Amazing place, be prepared to walk and take a lots of pics. It takes around 2.5 hrs to complete the whole place.Check the time for the guard shift change, they do it twice a day!, really nice, I suggest you start the trip and on you way back to the exit you schedule to be at the gate for the shift change.Most of the place is stroller friendly but at some spots you'll do better leaving the stroller in some corner and continue by foot.In the middle of the whole area there's a small cafe where you can refresh, ideal for kids to take a rest and drink some water."
crowded everyday,the gate is swarmed with visitors everyday.. sometimes u can take with the warriors stationed there... 
"Stop for a snapshot, or stay to explore","This is an easy enough spot to get to, and if you're pressed for time you can do a quick stop to see the gate without paying cost of admission to the rest of the site. "
Must see,This is one of the must see Gates to visit. I'd recommend doing one of the tours to really learn and understand everything the way of life and the history of these site. It's huge!! so make sure you have good walking shoes!! and if you go in winter.... Yikes!! make sure you're wearing every warm piece of clothing you own :) 
Nice palace,The palace was close to our stay myeongdang and went by taxi for 4000won and there was some show kind of thing with actors wearing ancient soldier clothes. It was interesting.
historic and majestic,I loved that there are so many things going on in front of this gate. The guard changing ritual is something to see. This is the place one should definitely go see on the first day of the trip. 
Gwanghwamun,"The gate to the palace of Korea's past kings, Gwanghwamun is a beautiful place to visit and take photos."
Timewarped!,The gate of entry to Gyeongbukgong Palace-I felt timewarped passing through this gate. I was lucky enough to witness changing of the guards. I thought the guards were statues! So this is how it looks like i.r.l. It was like being an actor in Korean TV series or much like being transported back in time.Make the Gwanghamun changing of the guards part of the itinerary and take a selfie with statuesque gate guards. It's worth the experience.
Magnificient!,"Imagine you were standing in front of the gate few hundreds years ago, before entering the palace. It would be an overwhelming pressure and you'd feel like a small ant lol. Big thumbs up for city to preserve this magnificient gate."
landmark,"I would say it's one of the main landmarks of Seoul, you will probably go around it if you're going to the Gyeongbokgung palace, good photo spot."
It was close :C,This place it´s amazing you can see the history of korea! but it has a problem it clases at 4pm so take care! now it has a program with night visits so it´s good! at night it´s more beautiful!
beautiful palaces! must see!,this is an amazing palace with so much history. loved seeing it. definitely worthwhile to see while visiting korea!
Spectacular gate,"We visited this as part of the palace tour. You really want to get there for about 10am for the changing of the guard, as they do a wonderful ceremonial display right in front of the gate. A must see."
Massive Gates,These are very thick and well built gates leading into the Court yard. The first in a layer of protection from intruders.
Symbol of Seoul,"This is one of the must-go place for travelers. At night, it is fabulous. You can wander around the square as well."
Gate to preserve the past,"It is located near the ticket admission counter and guarded by 3 guardian, in blue and red traditional outfit and a unique hat with beads and feathers. You can take selfies with them but their expression wont change."
Amazing,"The gate is located right outside of the Gyeongbukgung and if you are on a tight budget or not really interested in palace/historical architecture, visiting this gate itself would be satisfying. If you were to visit the gate during the palace's operating hours, there will be ""guards"" dressed in traditional clothes by the gates and at certain time of the day you could also witness the change of guards. If you would like to take a clear picture of it, taking it from the opposite side of the road would be nicer as trying to find the right angle to take the whole picture of the gate from right in front is quite difficult."
Fascinating,"We came here after lunch and Tosokchon, and it was the time of changing of guards. It was fascinating as the guards had very colourful costumes, and they are very tall to say the least! You are allowed to take photos with the Guards but make sure you don't touch them. I am unsure if they will draw their swords in Defence as they look formidable!"
Just Visited it,I only got to see it from the outside but it was still beautiful to see. It is near the American & Korean Embessies
Be sure to catch the changing of the guards,"We stumbled upon the changing of the guards at 11 AM on a Friday on our way to Gyeongbokgung Palace. This gate is one of the entrances to the palace. The ceremony lasts only a few minutes, but is quite entertaining and it is free. Try to time your visit to the palace to allow yourself to see it. I think kids would especially enjoy it."
You have to see it to believe it,"This is a very well preserved area of the city. On the day we visited, there were soldiers and priests in costume and a procession throughout the entrance to the palace."
Historical place to visit,"If you want to join the guided tour, you should enter this gate. English and Chinese tours are available for foreigners. One of the historical building that still keep good in Seoul..."
For history lover,"The Korea palace also a nice place to visited, you can walk across the road to visit the Gwanghwamum square."
Gateway to Korean History.,"The main gate of Gyeongbokgung palace. If you want to join the guided tour, you should enter this gate. English and Chinese tours are available for foreigners."
Lovely!,"This is the main gate into the primary temple in downtown Seoul. My husband and I unfortunately missed the changing of the guard, but I hear it's great!"
a gate to the past,this gate seems like a gate to the past to me. once you're inside the Gyeongbukgung palace it feels like you're back in the past. but when you look above the gate you'll see all the tall building/skyscrapers. the view was like a combination of past+present which was amazing
Interesting landmark,"You cannot miss it since it is on your way to the Gyeongbokgung palace. Careful with the car traffic, especially if you want to take a photo from the middle island of the boulevard."
Entrance to Gyeongbukgung,"The Sumunjang (Royal Guard) Changing Ceremony normally takes places at 10am/2pm for 20 minutes. On most days, you may also be able to try out the Sumungun (Gatekeeper)'s traditional outfit before and after the ceremony although we did not partake in that."
Great...huge and wide open ,Decided to park my car and pass the traffic hour to take some new pictures around the gate. King Sejong and admiral Lee statutes sits directly in front of the gate. Tons of cafes and restaurants around. Take the subway...parking was quite hard to find.
Entering gate of old palace,This gate is actually the entrance gate of the old palace. You can just walk through inside this gate to the palace.
Gwanghwamun Gate,"the gate is nice place to take picture, great korean architect. you can watch the changing of the guard."
Tourist Picture spot,Good for a touristy picture shot on a good weather. Also try to time the visit when there's the change of guards since it's different from the ones in UK
Favourite spot for tourists,Connected to palace and a great view for photographer. Beautiful scenery across the road. Great place to visit !
Majestic!,"From the Gwanghamun square, you can see this gate from a distance with the mountains on the background. We were lucky to watch the changing of the guards ceremony. It was a wonderful experience. "
One of The gates to the City of SEOUL at the time,"now with the city expending doesn't have the same use, it's more of like a statue there, on your tour around the city you will hit a number of them "
A nice gate....,"Got the train there, got our, walked by and walked away. Another classic Korean building in the same colours etc. as the others but obviously not accessible for the public. We walked down the road and fond the City Hall which was much more interesting."
The gate before entering the Palace,It's the gate where you can watch the changing of the guard before entering Gyeongbok palace. Beautiful!
Major city landmark,"Everyone should see more than once, can't miss it at the end of a grand avenue, also visit the attached palace, Insadong and other areas nearby, very centrally located"
Must visit,"This is nice place to get photo and see change of guards ceremony. You can also view the 2 famous statues (King Sejong the Great, one who created the Hangul and Admiral Yi Sunshin) on a Gwanghwamun Square. Do not forget the museum underground right below the square. "
Historic place,"It is the main and largest gate of Gyeongbokgung Palace. They let people in at night in summer and the night view is totally different from during the day. If you where Hanbok, you can enter for free."
Good attraction and reachable by MRT,"To Gwanghwamun gate , get off to Gwanghwamun Station. After come up from subway you will see the famous statue : Admiral Yi Sun Shin and King Sejong. You can see the gate when taking picture under the statue. "
"Important historical building, Watching the Changing of the Guards - 11am, 2pm & 4pm","Gwanghwamun Gate is the main gate to the UNESCO World Heritage - Gyeongbukgung Palace in Seoul. This is a national landmark originally built in 1395 and symbol of the important Joseon Dynasty in Korea that is worth spending a few minutes to look over prior to entering the palace for your visit. The present gate received major restoration and was reassembled with wood between 2006-2010, returning it as closely as possible to it former glory. The base of the gate include three passages, topped by multiple wooden floors, which are elegantly carved and highly decorative. If you time your visit right, you can watch the 'Changing of the Guards' ceremonies held outside Gwanghwamun Gate. Ceremony times are 11am, 2pm and 4pm as of November 2015. At other times of the day, you can take pictures with guards in front of Gwanghwamun Gate. In the end, this is an important structure and inclusion of visits to Gyeongbukgung Palace. Give a few minutes here to appreciates it architecture and hopefully the 'Changing of the Guards' ceremony if possible."
A nice place to get a picture in front of for sure,"This gate is at the end of a nice walk north of the City Hall, along the large square and pedestrian area. Walking there can lead you by several sites worth visiting and taking pictures with, along the way (statues, a big square, etc.). It is very beautifully lit at night too. From there you can then turn right (when facing the gate) and take that big street to Insadong in a few minutes (which is another lovely place to walk, shop, and get a nice Korean meal). "
