Scenic area,"There are lots to see at Taejongdae Resort Park. Unfortunately I had little time, therefore I went straight to Yeongdo Lighthouse as that was the ""must-see"" attraction for me. You can choose to walk the entire park or take the Danubi Train, which I opted for due to time constraints."
NO train ride during rain,We turned up at the wrong time and the trackless Danubi Train service was not operating due to safety reasons as the roads were wet from the long drizzle. It was a large and expansive park so we decided save our walk and give the attractions a miss to visit another attraction nearby. 
Prepare to Walk and Climb Stairs Here!,"You may chose to walk around this Park, or pay 3000W for the Danubi Train, which has 3 stops (namely Observation Deck, The Light House and The Temple). You may get in or off at any station. Personally first and second stops are recommended, but not really at the third stops. Prepare to walk and climb stairs especially to the Light House. Going up the spinning stair to the top of Light House, and you could enjoy panoramic view of the area, breath taking. If you have more time, walking down further and you could buy and enjoy some fresh oyster!If you plan to visit this Park, avoid weekends as waiting and taking the Danubi could be long with tourists and local crowds.You could also take a small ferry with a fees around the park, agents will approach you just before entrance to the Park."
Nice park with few lookout,"We went there as part of Busan city tour package and inside the park we took danubi train bus which takes you around inside the park. We stop by at one of the few look outs and enjoyed the view. If you have time, worthwhile to give a visit."
nice place to go,alot of nice views and photo stopstake the train if u are lazy to walk do note the waiting time is around 30 mins.
Still a lovely cliff walk,This is my second visit after more than 5 years and the place is as nice as I remembered it. Visited on a warm sunny day and the seaviews were spectacular. The divers/fishermen were out in full force selling their catch at the foot of the cliffs. I was impressed with how efficiently the tram car service was run and also how well maintained the toilets were.
