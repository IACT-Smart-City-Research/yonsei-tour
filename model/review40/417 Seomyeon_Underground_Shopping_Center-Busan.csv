Overrated ,"I was disappointed by the ""mall"". Couple of shops under ground, full of subway travellers. I definitely expected something more than what I got. Luckily it's close to other attractions etc."
Shops closed early,We took a train from Busan station to Seomyeon for shopping around 6pm+. Had dinner first and realized Lotte closed at 830pm and the shops in the underground shopping area were closing soon too. Seoul is still a better place for shopping.
Cross Under the Street,"I’m not a shopper, and so when I saw a sign for the underground shopping center I ignored it and kept walking. However when I wanted to cross a wide and busy street, the only way I could do so was by going down and walking under it. That is how I found myself in the Seomyeon Underground Shopping center.The shopping center is quite impressive even to the non-shopper. A myriad of small stores, and with, to the unpracticed eye, quality merchandise, the shopping center stretches seemingly to infinity. It might be noted that I didn’t see any store or stand selling food.I will not return unless I once again have to cross that street."
Never Ending Shopping!,"We stayed in a hotel nearby so we decided to pay a visit. There is the lotte hotel basement food alley and you can connect to this shopping underground. Rows of shops on both sides. Massive! Clothing, cosmetics, shoes, etc.Only issue is for the branded shoes, you are not sure they are real. The non brand shoes are cheap if you do not fancy brand or image. However, quality is not too good.We bought some face masks as gifts.We did not see any high end cosmetics but the usual nature republic , etude, etc.The good part is buy 1 get 1 free for 10,000 about sin $11.30 so its good. Only issue is tend to be heavy so u need to have more baggage allowance.We only buy a few t shirts for this trip. Personally, did not fancy korean fashion as they are either very plain looking or very floral. Also free size seems small. There was socks for sale everywhere...1000 to 2000 won. All types of design but mostly cartoon characters.It was raining outside so we were glad we were here. However, since it was rainingm many oeople also came here.We keep walking oblivious of where it leads to and when tired we get iut, took a taxi vack as it was raining heavily outside. We could not walk back too tired to walk back. Overall a good experience. But wear comfy shoes."
Underground shopping center in the heart of Busan and directly under the Seomyeon train station.,"Like those underground shopping in Seoul, Busan's Seomyeon undeground shopping center can be equally interesting with a wide variety stores from fashion wear to souvenirs to health & skin care products (like Innisfree, Nature Republic, Etude House, the Saem, Holika Holika, Olive Young etc....), you have it all. Although most shops are similar to those of the ones you find in Seoul, there are some unique fashion boutiques stores that provide interesting fashion wears at reasonable prices. You can spend 3 hours in this underground shopping center if you are that type that like to look at most if not all the stores more attentively.. otherwise, simply browsing through the shops may take you about 1-1.5 hours of your time there. "
Brilliant for rainy days,Great prices and lots to offer. Indoors & air conditioned. Fairly long and busy underground tunnel with many stores for shopping. It also connects with subway station.
Long long underground mall,"If you are out bargain-hunting but wanting to stay in-trend, you are in the right place. I recommend walking a large circle first as some articles of clothing are repeated in other shops as well. As a larger-size woman (US size 10/UK 14), bottoms were difficult to find in free-size but form-free dresses and tops were easier to work with. The average price of a top here is 10,000won to 15,000won. It's mostly clothes of free-size wear for men and women, along with some shoe stores. Be prepared - the strip is very long and terrible shoes will only make it worse. The bathrooms are located on the ends of the mall though I think I missed one as I went through the middle."
Huge underground shopping,This place is like the air-conditioned flee market. I bet you can get lots of bargains from this place. Try to avoid visit this place during work check out period as it will be super crowded.
underground tunnel with many stores,Fairly long and busy underground tunnel with many stores for shopping. It also connects with subway station. Ended up buying s small desktop alarm clock.It is located near Seomyun market.
Cheaper alternative,It's crowded due to the huge amount of community travelling to work and school. But you can find good deals if you search hard
Enjoy the shopping!,Passing by this underground shopping ctr each time v need to go back to Arban Hotel. Shop till you broke :0)
Big underground mall,"We didn't do much shopping in the underground mall in Seomyeon, just bought a souvenir, but the shops weren't really that appealing. By far the best thing about the mall is that it has heaps of entrances, so it's great for crossing the busy main street!"
Huge underground mall that seem endless,A lot of cosmetics shops around here & plenty of clothing stores. But most of it are already for autumn seasons & the cosmetics shops are quite repetitive. Good to go one round but that's it.
great seafood,"Great shopping and eating. Loved the restaurants, variety of seafood to choose from. Visited in the night with friends"
"As malls go, bad","It's a underground mall. Cramped, generally a bit dingy, with nothing special in the way of deals. Some value as a brief visit as a relatively big example of something common in Korea, but don't go here if you are looking for good shopping or a nice place."
Large shopping area by the Metro,We walked thru here to get to the Metro. Lots of small places for shopping and food. Was not paricularly impressed.
Fun shopping area,I was here countless times as my hotel was just nearby. Quite hectic place with everybody walking really fast. A convenient shopping place.
Seomyeon Undergound Shopping Center,"We stayed in the apartment (35-1) where walking distance 10mins from Seomyeon Underground Shopping Center / Train Station. We walk through this shopping centre almost everyday, as we need to travel by train to other station. We were mesmerized by the shops and it seems like never ending shops on your left and right sides. From Exit 9, turn right heading to Lotte Mall and left to Bujeon Market. Everywhere was so convenience from this station. The shops open until 10pm at night and was still crowded. We so loving it. Crazy shopping especially all beauty products."
One of the bigger underground shopping centers in Korea......,"This is probably one of the ""bigger"" underground shopping centers in Korea, similar to the big Myeongdong one in Seoul.Almost every subway station here in Busan (& Seoul) has an underground shopping center & similarity in products are evident. Just more or less. Bigger or smaller.Worth a visit if first time here & if you are around the area."
"Good fun, but really; the prices in Australia ae just as competitive","Easy getting lost in the labyrinth that is the Seomyeon Underground Shopping centre. I found the number of exits to be bewildering - perhaps I'm getting old - meaning that you can come up literally blocks away from where you want to be.The shopping choices are many and varied, however as stated in the title; it's no cheaper than Australia so no real value buying anything."
Shopping at Cheap Prices,"Take a metro line 1 or others to head to this crowded and popular shopping markets that has on offer many a bargains on clothes , jewellery , shoes , coats etc A little bit of bargaining goes ."
Popular underground shopping,"The Seomyeon Underground Shopping Centre is very big and centrally located around the Seomyeon metro station. As we stayed at Beomnaegol, which is just one station away, it was easy for us to come here. We could even walk here. The underground shopping is very popular with locals and tourists alike and you can find clothes, beauty products, food, shoes etc here. It is fairly crowded since Seomyeon is a pretty central station metro lines 1 & 2 passes here. There are many underground shopping centres located throughout Busan adjoining the various popular metro stations."
Shopping!,"Stuff are cheap here, good for walking and buying cheaper than average clothes. But can't try on and can't really bargain. "
Underground,"Part of Seomyeon Station, a big one. Lots of stores for clothing, makeup, some food as well. Reasonable prices for everything "
What a Mall,"This underground mall is accessible through the Seomyeon Subway Station. Located at the heart of Busan, this place is very crowded. You can find almost anything here. The price is affordable as well. Up top of the mall and station are standing the Lotte Hotel, Lotte Duty Free, and Department Store as well."
Pawalg,"The underground mall is linked at the center of Seomyeon crossing between Lotte hotel, Lotte Dutyfree and department store. Very interesting place to go."
Very good,Place was bustling in the evenings where most shops open for biz. Lots and lotsa of skincare and shopping at great bargains.
Shopper's Paradise,"This underground mall is linked to the Seomyeon Subway Station. The station itself is very busy as it is located in the heart of Busan and it also serves as a transfer station from line 1 to line 2. Many convenience stores, cosmetics shops and chic boutiques line the underground mall which stretches quite far."
Convenience shopping place,"It is lots of shops but not good quality clothes, outdated fashion, nothing to shop for souvenirs, no tradition local shops, it is ok for cosmetic stores and convenience in between transits in a rainy day only, if you have any other place in mind to visit, you are not going to miss it."
Women's paradise,"You can find almost all the brands of Korean skincare here, lots of clothing and shoes shops as well. It's a long stretch and the price are reasonable. Korean are generally polite and friendly. If you take any of the staircases to go up, you will still end up in a nice shopping/eatery area. "
Nice shopping place,"A very nice place for shopping with low prices, a lot of shops on your right & your left for more than 500 meters."
Women's clothes ally,"Nah. 90% of the shops sell,ladies clothes. No souvenirs. No nice gifts, just your kids size cheap dresses. You can leave home without this. "
Busy underground shopping street.,"Convenient located at Seomyeon. Large variety of skin care shops can be found, brands like Aritaum, innisfree, Missha, Tonymoly, Études house etc. The prices here are comparable to seoul and maybe cheaper if there are promotion. Sales person speak relatively understandable English. Ideal place to spend an afternoon especially if the weather does not permits you to go out door. Overall experience is heavenly for female shoppers, nothing much for guys though..."
Do not go out of your way just to get here,I only came to this place because it was next to my hotel. I would not recommend it to be on any tourist's must-see checklist. It's where all the older folks hang out and naturally the clothes shops here cater to the older generation. There is nothing to eat here and none of the ubiquitious cosmetic shops around. Not comparable to the underground shopping arcades of Seoul which cater to younger people.
For old folks and locals,"The fashion there was dated. seemed like it was mainly catering to the locals. For youngsters, I would highly recommend the Seomyeon district, with its small outlets. if you want something safe, then try Uniqlo opposite Judice Taewah. I only used this underground shopping area to get from my hotel to the subway. It was rubbish."
Busy busy place,Very cool shops that had some good prices. i was able to find just about anything I needed. I can't wait to go back.
