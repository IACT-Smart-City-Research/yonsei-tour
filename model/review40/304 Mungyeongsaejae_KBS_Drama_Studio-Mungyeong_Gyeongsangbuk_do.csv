Filming Location for your Favorite Dramas,"This is a fairly large set used to film more than a dozen historical dramas (the specific titles are listed at the entrance). It is a nice place to walk for an hour if you are into that sort of thing. I'm no historian, but I guess they represent various periods of Korea's history. For a small charge you can dress up like a historical monarch and pose for a picture on a throne. Admission was just a few thousand won."
DID COMMUNITY SERVICE IN MUNGYEONG,Such a good place to visit if u want to know further about KDRAMA historical scenes. Hahaha I enjoyed here b I enjoyed the Rail Road Bike in Munyeong too.
Nice place. Blends well with environment.,It's amazing to see such realistic built up for drama and they have even 'cloned' Guanghwamun here. I just feel they should probably have more signs indicating which famous drama scenes were taken from which settings. Anyway I didn't explore the whole area but it was well worth the 2000â‚© entrance fee. 
Good place to see Korean traditional structure,"C1 ( 2015.04.25 ) This place was located between Mungyeong Saejae Provincial Park's gate 1 and gate 2. This outside studio was made some famous Korean traditional drama with beautiful landscape. In studio, many Korean tradtional structure was installed, and was beautiful. There was bigger than I guess. If you visited Mungyeong Park, must visit there to know Korean structure."
