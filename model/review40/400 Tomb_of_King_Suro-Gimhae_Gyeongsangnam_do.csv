Zen.,A worth visiting if you are in the history of Korea. Easy access via public transport. Also visit the Tombs nearby it was very interesting!
A well treat place along with parl,Did visit with friends. Super calm and historical prospective of King's and other graves. There is associated a small Museum which indicates Korean culture. 
Out on the fresh air,There are some nice walking tracks with information panels.The tracks tell you the history of the Land of Gaya
Recreational place,a good recreational place with small Meseaum inside the park. A best place for couples and lovers. There is a small compound inside with different colored fishes which play with visitors. A nice place indeed. King Tomb burried under heavy mud. 
Take time to see,I would recommend going to this close to sunset. You can get some fascinating photos as the light changes and the shadows move around some of the pillars.
Tomb of King Suro,"This is a park in which there is a tomb of King Suro, the founder of Kaya Kingdom. There is a Korean-style traditional house where you can experience Korean cultures."
"Nice place, still off the beaten track","I have found this a very nice and worthwhile place to visit. Its attractiveness to me came from It being a well maintained place, yet very tranquille. There are other better known and grander places, but these will be much busier also. I have visited the tomb twice during different trips and have found it very quiet both times. The tomb itself is interesting (especially if you have not seen any in Korea), and the complex also has a few buildings in traditional ancient Korean style. Just outside is a tourist information, and the Gimhae national museum is walking distance.I have given it a solid 4/5 stars, very much worth a visit if you are in the area."
It's a tomb.,"I went off to the tomb not entirely clear on what to expect. The tomb itself is a giant mound of dirt with animal sculptures, which is nice, but nothing spectacular. If you've been in Korea and have seen a lot of Korean architecture and sculptures, this is more of the same. It's worth a visit if you're new, but if not, it's not anything really unique."
Nice place to relax,It's very quiet and there are some benches around so it's a really nice place to bring a book and just relax.
Wang Suroh ,This place is very beautiful and its history is well preserved. Its a great visit especially if your interests gravitate towards Oriental history and culture. There is some great food too.
Good place for picnic,I like the open space and ancient korean architecture. But what I like most is the open grass that is clean enough to have a picnic with friends. Especially with family. All facility is great and a nice place to spend the weekends
