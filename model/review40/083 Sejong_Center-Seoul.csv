Seoul Cultural Center,"This huge performing arts center caught our eyes when we walked along Gwanghwamun Square, heading North toward the Gyeongbokgung Palace. On the square’s West side, the 6-story building, with three underground levels, displays traditional Korean architecture, along with modern elements. We decided to delay our visit to the palace and to go into the Center after we saw the entrance to a museum in one of its underground levels behind the statue of King Sejong on the square. Free, the museum offers two exhibition halls, one devoted to King Sejong and the other to Admiral Yi Sunshin, both important men in Korea’s history. Each hall was so well curated that we ended up staying for 1 hour rather than the anticipated few minutes. Hungry, we stayed even longer in the Center to have a Korean lunch at one of its many restaurants.Returning from the palace, we decided to visit the Center again. This time, we looked around the lobby, which was well maintained and included a ticket counter for the various events held here, such as concerts, art exhibitions and operas. We sat for a while, drinking tea at a table near a small snack bar before leaving for the Gwanghwamun Subway stop in the square. It provides easy access to the Center."
If you love the arts then this is a 'must do' on your list,"Sejong Performing Arts Center is a world-class auditorium worth visiting if you're into the arts or music. I attended a performance by the Korean Contemporary Dance Theater - a performance worth every bit of the 10,000 won I paid for the ticket. It was a mesmerising glimpse into the world of Korean modern dance. Enjoyed every moment. Prices for most concerts and performances seem reasonable. I purchased my ticket 1 1/2 hours before the show, when the box office opened."
Excellent Studio Ghibli exhibition at the moment,"No doubt there will be plenty of reviews about the excellent performances that happen here, but I'm here to plug for he excellent Studio Ghibli exhibition which is running until March. It presents the posters and the artwork for all the films from the last 30 years, and the audio guide is a must. Sounds like there are regular exhibitions which happen at the arts centre so check out what's happening if you've missed this one!"
Great venue that deserves more attention and respect,we were performing at the venue with an Argentine Tango company.We were warned that it was an outdated and difficult venue but that couldn't have been further from the truth.This place is world class. Would happily perform there again or pay to see one of their may well programmed performances
Sejong Centre,"For so many times I've been to Seoul, I have never thought of visiting this place. This time I went there was all because of M.C. Escher's exhibition. I thought it would be on a small scale, but indeed the works being shown have occupied a whole two floors of the exhibition hall. As a matter of facts, various concerts and exhibitions are frequently held in Sejong Centre. For those who wants to enjoy a show or an exhibition while in Seoul, this could be a place to be paid more attention to. "
It's nice,"I came here for Hunder Wasser presentation and it's great. I always thought that Sejong Centre is a music performing hall, only to realise that on its side is a hall that goes vertically that supports art presentation. Staff here do allow people to take pictures as long as it's not flash photography. As a matter of courtesy, it always pays to ask first. The layout is straight forward. You started out on the ground floor and worked your way to the basement. You knew it when you're at the end of the road where there's a souvenir shop at the end of the tunnel. Seoul has the capital to bring in world leading presentations and I'm thankful for such opportunity."
Excellent centre for musicals,"i visited 4 times in February for musicals. Access is so easy with both the city hall and gwanghwamun metro stations close to/connected to the centre. i had seats on the ground, 1st and 2nd floor, on both left and right of the stage. With capacity of 3k pax it is a large scale hall similar to seoul art center but i prefer sejong. For some reason the seats on the 1st floor provided a better view compared to seoul art centre's 1st floor. In fact even the 2nd floor seat i got was a decent view"
Stunning..............................,"I visited the Grand Theater to listen to Diana Krall. It was my first time to the space it was very easy to get to. The facility itself is beautiful, the stage setup to how the seats are positioned are perfect I sat on the floor level but I am quite sure I would of had the same experience if my seats were else where. The only problem I encountered has to do with me personally, I am 6'2"" and after 1hr of sitting in the seats my knees were screaming. There was no intermission during my show so I sat for 2hrs straight thank goodness the seats themselves were comfortable."
decent location for art exhibitions,located very close to the subway exit (gwanghwamun) this place has very good exhibitions in seoul. They don't allow you to take photos inside by the way compared to few other places in seoul that really dont care. 
Chess Musical,"Amazing centre, very easy to find from the subway station and the staff were polite too in helping us find our seats. Amazing view of stage even from second floor which is where we were"
World class,Seen the hunchback of Notre Dame Very nice from 2nd row from stageFor females Bewere Washroom line during intermissions was super long 
I recommend you visit the story of Admiral Yi Shun Sin,"In the basement of Sejong Art Center, the story of Admiral Yi Shun Sin is located where you can learn more about Yi Shun Sin and his career. As a Korean, I'm really proud we have a hero like Admiral Yi Shun Sin. You will learn more about his career and experience the turtle ship he has made for fights against the Japanese at that time. 4D experience hall is also inside. After you look around the story of Admiral Yi Shun Sin and you can move on to the story of King Sejong nearby."
"Terrible acoustics, lamentable service","I will never see another orchestral or chamber music performance here ever again, and if you're going to see a concert with musical pieces you care about, I heartily advise against it. The way the hall is built, the air conditioning actually drowns out lower-volume portions of the performance, as happened once during what might've otherwise been a deft and subtle decrescendo during a series including a famous German pianist. No one was sure when the performance ended, and when it was too late, the rumble of the air conditioning drowned out the quiet timpanis. The conductor actually stormed off the stage. The service is also either hit or miss, being either as simple and straightforward as it should be, or completely inaccessible with no alternate options for booking given. The smaller halls are better, but mute the dynamics of the performance. I would only ever attend an orchestral performance at the Seoul Art Center in the future, though audiences in Seoul are so poorly behaved that it makes me question whether I will ever subscribe to any future concert series."
Good place to enjoy concert!,"I visited ""M theater"" several times, which is suitable for concert."
Telephone reservations not possible for non Korean speakers!,"On two ocasions in 2012 I have telephoned the Sejong Center to make reservations for ballet performances. When the booking office answered the phone I explained I wanted a reservation please can anyone speak some English? Both times there was talking in Korean, giggling and then the phone was hung up in my ear.The second time I was so annoyed I waited 2-days until my classes finished early and I could take the 2-hour journey to Gwanghwamun by bus and subway. of course tickets were sold out!I explained to the staff their actions were very rude - they said ""sorry, sorry, sorry"" Now, unless I can get a Korean-speaker to reserve seats for me I just don't go to performances at the Sejong center - thank goodness most of the best performances are at the Seoul Arts Center!Prior to 2012 there was always someone at Sejong Center who spoke enough basic English to help a customer with telephone reservations. I hope they can do the same again in 2013! "
