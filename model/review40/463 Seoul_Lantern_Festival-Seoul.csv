Stunning ,Mid November don’t miss this beautiful event in Seoul! Located on a small river Cheonggyecheon on Euljiro this is so beautiful at dark! Many families and a very pleasant and nice walk.
Managed to catch it for 5 mins before lights off,Rushed to visit the lantern festival but only managed to see it for 5 mins before lights off. Should leave the lanterns on till 11pm or 12 midnight as there were still many people lingering after lights off. 
Beautiful,The light displays were beautiful and is worth making a trip going to see them at least once if you are in Seoul during this time.
Great Festival,"It was such a nice time seeing all the beautiful lanterns, that are is very nice, and we had a great meal near by!"
Very beautiful!,It’s absolutely worth seeing! Just take a long walk near the stream in the evening. There are different scenes from eastern and western fairy tails and legends and some light projections on the walls. Looks really amazing and is not far from Myeongdong - in a walking distance(20 min).
Really beautiful,Worth it. Nice time along the river. Great lanterns but Too much plastic.Floating lanterns and candles are in plastics!
Beautiful!,"Just been to the first night of the festival. The activities haven't started yet but all the lanterns are on display.This year's theme is Fairy TaleThere is a mix of Disney and Cultural lanterns.We were blown away by the quaity of the lanterns.There is a great, safe atmosphere while walking along the banks of the stream, and we were so lucky with the weather tonight.It's definitely a must do whilst in Seoul."
Fun lanterns on water,It's the exhibition of traditional lanterns(yeondeung) on Cheonggyecheon Stream.People stroll and enjoy taking photos with them.There are other events like wish boats and lotus lights.There's no need to spend money. It's good to visit and join.
Fabulous autumn evening activity,It happens every November and is a wonderful attraction to stroll along the Cheonggyecheon stream. The artists let their imaginations soar and the lanterns can be fanciful or literal.
Lanterns were so pretty!!!,"I came here to watch the Seoul Lantern parade, and it was beautiful!! So many big and beautiful, and culture lanterns :)."
AMAZING,"The parade was just perfect, everything was gorgeous. The people were dancing and celebrating everywhere, the feeling of festivity was incredible. A memorable experience."
Lanterns -river of lights,"This is well worth a visit to Seoul, the size and variety of the lanterns amazed us. We would return to Seoul just to see this again. Walking along beside the river with many locals and visitors was very enjoyable. The photo opportunities were endless."
Lovely Walk,"Wonderful way to begin the festive holiday season. From the first Friday in November to the third Sunday in November bright lanterns are on display. Celebrating history, multiculturalism, or pure entertainment this was a fun display. There were vendors of food, wearable lights, and an opportunity to make a floating lantern yourself. Easy to get to on public transport (metro: Jongo 3-ga Station, Jonggak Station, or Euljiro 3-ha station) and a short walk to the river. The lanterns are staged in the water along 1.2km between Cheonggyecheon Plaza and Supyogyo Bridge. Lots to do in the local area as well. Would definitely go back and bring the children. Photos just can’t do it justice (at least my iPhone photos!). "
A night to remember,"This is a wonderful way to spend an early November night in Seoul. Located a short distance from city hall and FREE to anyone it is worth a stroll along the little river. Often seen in K-dramas, it is even more beautiful at night with all the light designs during the Seoul Lantern Festival. Enter on the west side of the river and walk along to see this year's creations. You can either climb back up the stairs at the end to go to a small street festival with food and such or cross the last bridge to view from the other side. Be advised it is not the easiest to hail a cab in this area because of the number of people so be sure to plan your trip accordingly."
Awesome ,This is a must if you’re in Seoul in November we went last night and it pretty amazing it’s about a couple of km long and you get to make a floating lantern 
Great way to spend a weekend,"We had a wonderful time in Seoul and visited the lantern festival. The water was pretty and the lanterns were quite the site. Our 6 year old son had a wonderful time. I also can't say enough about the street venders selling food. Amazing, you have to try!"
Colourful & Carnival-Like,"We visited the Lantern Festival about 3 days ago. This year (2018) is the 10th edition of the Lantern Festival, running until 18th November 2018. Although the atmosphere is more colourful and carnival-like in the night time, nevertheless, it feels worthwhile even to see the artistic and detailed lanterns in the daytime when the Stream is quieter and with fewer visitors.At night, the western end of the Cheonggyecheon stream (near the Jonggak and Jongno-3-ga metro stations) gets lit up with these beautiful lanterns and crowded street stalls and activities at the street level. It becomes even more crowded on weekends with locals flocking to the carnival like event, so best to visit on a weekday. Taking a leisurely walk, you can probably cover the entire distance of the lantern festival (estimated about 2 km) in about an hour, while taking photos along the way. If you can avail more time, you can even, for a fee, buy a small lantern midway along the lantern festival, write your well wishes there, and then release the lantern on a designated part of the Stream.A good to visit activity during autumn season in Seoul. A nice evening walk venue after dinner. Good activity for the entire family."
Seoul Lantern Festival,"It is very nice and enjoyable festival, where many activities are displayed along with cultural introduction. A wonderful international gathering."
Wonderful Festival,"The best experience in Seoul because this festival is so amazing, wonderful, and beautiful. So many food stall and food trucks operating throughout the festival. This festival be held at Cheonggyecheon Stream. I think this is the best lantern festival in the world."
The Best Experience in Seoul!!!,This is a wonderful opportunity to see a lantern festival in Seoul and the best experience visit this festival. This festival was amazing. You will remember it for the rest of your life. Don't miss this opportunity.
Fun but pales in comparison to Buddha's birthday spring festival,"This festival offers some beautiful and romantic nighttime scenery in the heart of Seoul. It was fun to wander along the Cheonggyecheon to see the colorful lanterns displayed in & along the stream. However, this festival pales in comparison to the much larger and more elaborate lantern display in the same area for Buddha's birthday in the spring. It would be fun to see the fall Seoul Lantern festival if that is when you are visiting the city, but if you have a chance to see the lanterns at Buddha's birthday it is much more impressive!"
Festival,This festival was amazing! So much good pictures to take. Street were packed! Lanterns and figures were beautiful 
Amazing colorful festival that is a photographer's paradise!,"This is a truly awesome festival that I would highly recommend to any visitors to Seoul. Highlights include a fantastic parade of amazingly intricate paper lanterns as well as performances of traditional Korean dance and drumming. Visitors to the festival can create their own paper lanterns, beaded jewelry, ink drawings, and other crafts as souvenirs - often for free or very little money. There are a few options for snacks and refreshments, but you will have to walk a block or two away from the festival for a full meal; there are tons of restaurant options available just outside of the festival area."
Been there. Done that.,"Korea has a lot things to offer. Seoul has a lot to offer. If in center besides of other places of interest this festival is nice place to visit - takes not much time, free entrance, close to other venues. A nice way to spend a couple of hours. Even though i was there during anti-president rally it was safe."
Nice evening walk at the Seoul Lantern Festival,"After work, we took a taxi to the Cheonggyecheon Stream to see the Seoul Lantern Festival. I enjoyed the walk and the interesting lanterns. I like that it started in ""prehistoric"" with the dragon, and ended up with a modern cartoon character."
Colorful,This is a low key festival situated right on the canal. It's quiet and subdued. Romantic at night. Easy access from the train station.
Lovely athmosphere,Strolling along the Cheonggyecheon Stream in the evening during the Seoul Lantern Festival you can admire the colorful masterly artworks floating in the water. Very beautiful.
novel way to spend a couple of hours,nice walk and interesting lanterns although most of the display was kids cartoon characters or corporate promotions in the form of lanterns. where there were independent artistic displays they were great and the overall spectacle is very impressive. went on Sunday night and while it was popular the crowds were very manageable for a capital city event
Fantastic! ,Well worth it it even in the rain. The canal itself is pleasant and the lanterns on display are amazing. Really lit up sculptures is a better description. 
best lantern festival that I have ever seen,This is a wonderful opportunity to see a lantern festival in downtown Seoul. They usually have it for a few weeks every november. You can expect thousands of people walking beside the stream of water but it is best seen from the street level. Don´t miss this opportunity!
Highlight,"big parade of illuminated artifacts in the Cheonggye-cheon Stream Area and others in front of the Gyeongbokgung-Palace - even if one monument looks like massive material - it is paper on wires - really worthwhile seeing! if you want to really experience the best of Korea, visit during this festival. You will remember it for the rest of your life."
Lantern Festival,"Wow, how lucky to strike the last days of lantern festival in Seoul. A captivating exhibition of lanterns depicting scenes from daily life etc. It was less than a five minute walk from our hotel to the canal area where the lanterns were set up & even though it was crowded people were very polite & not pushy. This was a lovely time of the year to visit as the autumn leaves were still vibrant.For visitors, this was a FREE attraction."
The best festival in Korea!,"You have not seen Korea until you have attended this week long event. From the parade, stream floats, to the Temple activities, if you want to really experience the best of Korea, visit during this festival. You will remember it for the rest of your life."
Go there at sunset and stay until dark!,"The creativity of Korean paper artists is incredible. There was a big parade of illuminated artifacts between May 6 and May 15 in Seoul in the Cheonggye-cheon Stream Area and others in front of the Gyeongbokgung-Palace - even if one monument looks like massive material - it is paper on wires - really worthwhile seeing! If you want to see these beautiful creations next year, consult the lunar calendar - the festival is not always in the same period!And if you want to take pictures, go there when dusk is falling - full darkness does not give the best pictures! Great news for budget travellers: the visit is free!"
Lantern Festival Every November,"This is a beautiful place to visit in good weather and/or during a light festival. There is a very popular lantern festival held at Cheonggyecheon every November. Lots of people attend but it is worth it. Don't forget to bring a camera! The city also puts on art festivals and laser shows but you will have to check Cheonggyecheon's official website for event dates. Even if there isn't a festival or light show, it is worth the visit especially in good weather like in the Spring or Fall. It's a great place to go solo, with your family, or as part of a romantic date. Some of the bad reviews here say it is boring and not worth the trip. I'm sure if you go in the middle of Winter, it won't be as good of an experience as going in the Fall with the beautiful foliage and nice weather or during the Lantern Festival. Cheonggyecheon is basically a small river. Nothing exciting but it is a nice oasis from busy city life as well as a place where many events are held throughout the year. It is also near Myeongdong and Gyeongbokgung Palace so you can make it as part of a larger sightseeing trip of that area."
