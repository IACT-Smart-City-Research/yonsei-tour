Fantastic Displays,This is a perfect introduction to the local Korean history and culture for any foreign visitors as everything is so well displayed and informative.It certainly gives you a fantastic insight into how the local people lived their lives and some of their traditions and practices.It's very easy to spend an hour or two wandering around - highly recommended if you're visiting the Gwangju area.
Great,Free entrance. Well arranged. Good for study the history of korea life style. All the display have both of English and korea to explain.
Highly recommended for first-time visitors to Gwangju,"For non-Koreans visiting Gwangju, this museum is a great introduction to the history and culture of Korea, specifically the Jeolla region. The exhibits are nicely done and the English translations here are easy to understand; in fact, the English explanations are some of the best we came across in this area. The exhibit on the history of Gwangju and the special exhibit did not have English translations, which would have been interesting to be able to read, but English speakers will find the majority of the museum informative. I believe there is normally a nominal admission fee, but we paid no admission, probably because of the Chuseok holidays. If you are visiting or new to this area of South Korea, you will find the trip here to be a rewarding time spent during your stay."
Nice look into the local history.,"Nice way to spend a day in Gwangju. The museum is not too large, it should only take an hour or 2 to get through. Pretty informative about the traditional local way of life. They have good dioramas which give you a good sense of the time. I think it was free to visit, or just a small token fee. Usually there are volunteer guides who speak English, so you can have a free guided tour. Outside of the museum, you are on the Biennale grounds, so there is a nice park to walk around, there is the art museum, a small amusement park, and there are usually some events happening in the area. You can easily spend an afternoon here."
I live close by and inside it is nice and cool. ,"As it is free, it is a good place to spend a hot korean summer afternoon. However it looks virtually the same as all other folkvillage museums. Korean histeriography is characterized by a strong nationalist underflow and these kinds of museums are one of that underflow's results. Also little explanation in english. "
Interesting culture,Our visit to this museum gave us a unique glimpse into ancient Korean culture. It has beautiful displays and only take about1 hour to see.
Underestimated,This was a really interesting find. Well written up and displayed. I learned a lot about old style life here. History and culture well shown.
Very nice museum,"A place to visit to learn Korean history, culture, food and to understand the population. You can ask for a local guide for free. "
Learn about Korean customs,We took a cab from our hotel (Firenze Hotel) and the cost was about 5000 won. The museum is well-organized and most of the information is available in English. The museum traces the customs of Korea from birth to death. I especially enjoyed the displays of local food since it helped me to identify some of the things we had been eating. The museum takes 1 - 2 hours to visit and is free. It's next to the Art Museum and you can also walk to the Gwangju National Museum from the Folk museum (ask for directions). It's about a ten minute walk. We visited both museums in the morning.
Archival Museum of Gwangju's history,"interesting archive and installations which documenting and resembling the customs and traditions of Korea, in particular Gwangju."
Great place to visit on a rainy day!,"It was interesting to have a glimpse of Korean customs, dress, foods, and religion. There are a lot photos, figurines in period dressing, and examples to help explain things. I wish there were more artifacts that could have been included in the museum."
Great museum!,"Great museum which we unfortunately only got to visit at the end of our 2 week South Korea trip. It made a lot of things we had seen clear to us, as there was finally some clear English explanation! Highly recommend this museum if you want to learn about how Korean people used to live, what their customs and beliefs were, what they ate, etc."
Well worth a visit.,A fascinating insig into the history and people of Gwangju. Definitely worth a visit. The staff were helpful and friendy and different language guides helped.
Great information on the Korean way of life,I really enjoyed seeing all the tools and objects that are part of Korean culture and history. The displays were more meaningful for me because our tour guide and told us about so many of the objects displayed. The dioramas are very detailed and interesting to look at. In the summer the A/C was challenged so you don't need a jacket like usual in a museum. The staff went beyond the call of duty when they escorted three of us under umbrellas to find a taxi in a nearby street. We were so thankful for their help.
Excellent display of Korea folk customs,"Although this museum is not free, the admission is minimal and worth in every penny. Daily items used in Korean customs are well organized and displayed with many lifesize models. "
