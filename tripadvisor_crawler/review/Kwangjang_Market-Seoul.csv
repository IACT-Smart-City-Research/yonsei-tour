Lots of “street food” options,"Was initially a bit confused and intimidated by the setup but eventually found it be a very way to discover new food. Not sure who is buying the clothes on sale but the food stalls definitely attract lots of customers. Just need the guts to sit down at one of the places and give the offerings a try. Seems to be segmented a bit by seafood, noodles, etc. Ended up having delicious food for very little money. Food stalls were closing up fast at 3PM when we were there so get there early enough to have options."
Love it!,"We went there as part of our ""explore Seoul"" trip and it was worth it! The atmosphere and energy were unmatched. The ox head meat made it worth the hassle!"
Good for one visit only?,"My family sat at a stall that was empty at the time (but as we finished our lunch all the empty chairs were almost full). Tried the great spicy tteokbokki and shared some mandu (dumplings), gimbap, fish cakes and bibimbap. Perhaps not the best food I ate during my stay, but very decent.The issue I saw was that most food vendors seemed to serve the same dishes and although I can’t compare their cooking styles, this fact would make me think twice to return. When we went to see the Myeongdong Nanta show all the street vendors were offering their innovative cuisine in the streets (including lobster with cheese) and all the stalls offered something different. I wish this market offered that (or at least some type of) dish variety."
Busy food stall market & other stalls,Easy to find from subway exit 9. This market is busy with food stalls & lots of variety. An excellent way to try a little of different korean foods. Other stalls for a whole range of products & goods. Various lanes of stalls spread out so you come back to a central point then take the next avenue. 
A taste of Real Korea ,"We watched Netflix show about street food of Seoul and it was a must do and see for us when we visited Seoul last week. We managed to find the stall from the show which makes the famous mung bean pancakes . The market was so big and it felt like it wasn’t ending. You can find anything there: food, clothes, fabric, sea food ... it’s definitely a must visit in Seoul as you will experience a real Korean culture. "
Korean street food classics,"The Kwangjang (sometimes spelled Gwangjang) market is a real foodie heaven. Many resources on the internet say it closes at 6PM and this may be true for many of the shops, however the food scene seems to be going strong at least until 10:00 PM. Here you will find many street food classics such as mung bean pancakes, Korean blood sausage, dumplings, steak tartare, fresh octopus and many others. All menus are in English, I don’t see why you would book a tour to come here to eat - read up on the Korean street food dishes and venture out on your own - I met several nice Koreans as I was hoping from stall to stall who was very friendly and wanted to share their food culture and their Soju with a total stranger. Geonbae!"
Kalguksu and mung bean pancakes!,"Came here for the knife cut noodles and mung bean pancakes. Loads of shops selling hanboks, traditional decorations and snacks."
"The ""Soul of Seoul""","Street food markets always represent the beating heart of a country.Here, in Gwangjang Market, you can find the true traditional korean food.There is a lot of attractive food; try as much as you can in order to have the most genuine experience possible!"
Just as good on a second visit,Street food in abundance. Live fish for sale and local delicacies (unidentifiable to me). Sitting at a stall or one of the rooms is probably better than getting a take-away as the 'to go' option involves a lot of plastic and polystyrene packaging.
it’s good for tourist to come but the food here is not good," Full of foreigners. Good place to walk around, see different foods, get the market atmosphere, but I wouldn't eat here. obviously it's pricey and targeted tourists. street food in Korea be like plus this market is more expensive."
interesting place to visit,worth a visit to check out the food. didn’t spend that much time here but my favourite stall was the kalguksu (knife-cut wheat flour noodles in soup) and mandu (dumplings) stall made famous by the netflix street food show (happy to report that it is worth the hype and the possible wait for seats as it’s now a hot spot for foreigners thanks to the show). it’s also a good place to shop for fabrics if that’s what you’re looking for!
Food you should try,This market is more about food than other stuff. You can try a lot of diffrent food. If you are around you should try to eat there!
Korean markets,Big markets. Lots and lots of stalls. Dry goods. Cooked food. Textiles. Linen. Toys. Souvenirs. Korean craft. Good to explore especially during rainy day since it is covered. The textile sections on ground and upper floor is enough to make you lost. All good price. Don’t miss out the food stores. We had the noodle and dumpling at one of the Netflix street food featured stores. Not disappointed. 
Fantastic market. ,Went specifically because I watched on Netflix. Found the noodles and dumpling stall and the crab stall. Both amazing. Really good food from wonderful hardworking people. 
Delicious,"Fantastic market with heaps of small street food stalls. Pretty big area covering the block, heaps of stalls to walk around and can sit down to each at eat. Heaps of variety, catering for truly Korean food. Very tasty and fresh."
Great market,"Gwangjang market is a traditional Korean / Asian market. Lots of stalls selling all kinds of edible products, some raw some cooked. A great Street food location or buying some fresh fruit."
Lots to eat,"You are spoilt for choice in the market for eateries. The centre food court has many small stalls that offer pancakes, noodles, rice rolls, live octopus, and more pancakes and more noodles. You can also purchase fresh vegetables, seafood and other raw food for your own cooking as it is a market. Another interesting thing to buy is cloth. Rolls and rolls of colourful and beautiful cloth are for sale here with many shops owners trying to make a living."
Must visit for an authentic and cheap Korean meal,"Gwangjang market is the place to see the locals do their daily marketing. Besides the usual tteokbokki ( spicy ricecakes), you should try the fried mungbean pancakes, served with a delicious soy sauce onion dip. This market caters to the locals, so it is as authentic an experience watching Korean people buy and sell. A food paradise for people who love to eat or cook."
Shopping and eating and clean bathrooms!,"Lots of great shopping and a huge center food court. Great fun, clean, reasonable prices. Loved the clean bathrooms."
Amazing!!!!,"What a colourful and sense evoking experience with so many things to eat, smell, see and be a part of! A fabulous market. The kimchi dumplings and mung bean pancakes were amazing! Some good options if you are vegetarian."
I had a blast ,"This place is a must see to in my book. I had a Seoul Korean native who lived in the States for 25 years give me a tour after moving back to Seoul for the past 11 years. Took me places that tourist would NEVER see and many Koreans don’t even know about it. This was one of his stops and gave me the history of the Market and how it grew and expended over decades. This is the largest traditional Korean markets and is known for food, silk and anything you want to find. You can also book a tour through TripAdvisor "
very disappointed,"Went with my brother to have a good experience as seen online. One of the food stall owners was very pushy and persuaded us to sit down after saying she'd give us ""service"" (free food). We ate some and asked if we could take the rest of the food away as we wanted to leave quickly, still thinking it was ""service"". Also important to note I spoke Korean though I'm not 100% fluent. I was quite naive, and at this point she added more food that we didn't ask for. I then asked how much this would all be(as it was a lot for free food) and she told me it was 16,000won. I then felt pressured into paying because she purposefully gave us a lot of food without asking. The stall owner was very old and our Korean wasn't good enough to argue with her. My brother was also feeling sick. At the time, there were a lot of people as well as the weather being very rainy and humid, so we just wanted to get away as soon as possible. Make sure to be very firm with what exactly you want to eat and always ask straightaway as to how much the food will be or make sure that the food is still ""service"" if offered."
Great Market Place to experience local culture ,"Great Market Place to experience local culture & food. Many tastes of local Korean food like the Korean pancake, noodles, kimchi, gimbap, seafood & etc. Dry preserved seafood can also be found there.The other side of the market is fabric area which closes in the evening after the food market comes alive.Walk around Jungno-gu you can also find fruits & flower markets."
The best food,Tried all the 3 shops that were featured on Netflix. Loved the experience. Netflix 1 Dimsums @ 5000 KRW were delicious2: The raw crab in soya (very expensive 20000 KRW) for a small crab.3. Pan cake (average - nothing special) the experience and the atmosphere is super.
Traditional market,"This one of Korea’s largest traditional markets, with one section selling authentic Korean street food. It is crowded with tourists as well as locals along the narrow alleys. For some stalls, there are some seats for customers who ordered pancakes, Korean dumplings, braised pig's trotters, gimbap, seafood, etc. If you are adventurous, you can try the raw octopus tentacles.There are also stalls selling fruit, vegetables, meat and fresh seafood. I purchased some apples and peaches, which were rather expensive. Suggest you buy fruits from other places."
"Souvenirs, food, something for everyone","No, this is not an upscale, ultra-clean chain department store where credit cards are king -- it is a market with numerous food stalls are centered along the walkways and sellers of fish, produce, silk, souvenirs, kimchi, housegoods and junk line the walkways. For me, all the food looks alike but obviously some are better than others as they are very busy and others have no customers. When in Seoul, one really has to visit -- not necessarily buy, but at least visit."
Ideal for local street food tasting,"If you want to taste local street food easily, Gwangjang market should be one of your stop in Seoul. Easy, tasty and cheap."
Must visited place on Seoul,"I went there with my korean friend and we tried raw beef dish and korean pancake, which is the popular dish of Gwangjang market. Both were delicious especially korean pancake. I loved it really. It is worth to mention that the vibe and atmosphere there was amazing. It was a bit crowded but that what you should expect to be in local market. There are many things for you to try there, so it is better to go with friends so you can try more dishes."
Authentic Local Food,"It is really just a market solely focused on FOOD! Wonderfully authentic and delicious Korean Food! The shop keepers are very friendly and welcoming and can speak a multitude of languages ranging from english, chinese and japanese, so communication really shouldn't be a problem no matter where you're from. All the food is fresh or made on the spot and you can see them prepare it. You can either take away the food or sit down at the stalls themselves to enjoy the food items. Price wise, it isn't expensive at all and you are utterly spoiled for choice of what to eat at Gwangjang market. There is a lot to see and observe and is a definite must-see location when in Seoul. I'd personally recommend ordering the kimbap, japchae, jajamyeon, pumpkin porridge, tobeokki and the kimchi pancakes!"
Nice concept ,It's like a food market where you can buy street food and walk along the street to find more food. Nothing special unless there is a specific food stall that you want here. 
Food food food!,"If you love traditional Korean food, this is your heaven. Don’t miss the kalguksu stall owned and operated by Yoonsun Cho, covered in Netflix’s Street Food. Yum!"
Nice market to walk around ,"It's a nice traditional market to look and walk around, but the food section is very crowded and the food selections are actually very similar although there are many stores, and the food vendors would keep trying to sell you their food and may come off as pushy and aggressive which I really felt uncomfortable with. The food selections are mainly street foods such as tteokboki, mandu, fishcake etc, the mung bean pancake I tried was average."
Lots to see and buy,"I was brought by my friend to see this local market. There are a lot of food stores, selling a variety of products. In the east side of the market, there are a lot of food vendors selling mungbean pancakes to cold noodles. On the second floor (or first floor if you are British/European), there are vendors selling traditional Korean wedding dresses (similar to Hanbok) and also second hand clothing."
Mung bean pancakes,Mung bean pancakes for lunch - yum. Shame you have to find a corner to eat them. This market is a food heaven as long as you can stand the crowds. There are some alleyways around - go for a wander and you will find some hidden treasures. 
Big market,"5 sectors in this market: 1) food 2) clothing 3) Daily necessities 4) dried food and titbits n fruits 5) wet markets for seafood. Love the dumplings from one stall right at the end of the food alley. Many aunties are selling similar food but depending solely on each skill to attract patrons. The other alley are stalls selling korean costumes and modern clothings. You should bargain, but not too much. Another alley has stalls selling daily necessities, like towels, scrub towels, etc. And another alley has stalls selling the different types of titbits like seaweed cracker, seaweed, almonds. There is also another alley like wet market, selling seafood and dried fishes."
Netflix Street Food featured vendors inside,"We came here for lunch and entered on the textile entrance of the market. About halfway into the building is when we finally started to see the food stalls. The first stop was a fish cake stall where we ordered two, each W1000. Both came impaled on a stick along with a cup of broth. Both types of fish cakes were decent and the soup was flavorful.We were still on the hunt for a good lunch spot when we came across a stand with a large photo of Netflix on it. It turned out to be one of the vendors, Yoonsun Cho, showcased on an episode of Street Food. It was food stall #70 and had one of the largest seating areas which was a stand-alone stall surrounding the cooking and prep areas compared to all the others we walked by. We had to wait about ten minutes before a bench opened to accommodate the whole family. During the interim we watched her make some of her hand cut noodles and prep a number of bowls. Everything we tried was very good from the kimchi mandu to the hand cut noodle and the cold buckwheat noodles (we ordered spicy but it didn’t pack much heat). Overall they ran a very efficient operation for the lines of people wanting to eat here and the food was reasonably priced at W5000 each for majority of the menu items.There also was a mung bean fried cake vendor featured on Netflix but we were too full to give hers a try.The market was crowded and together with all the frying the temperature got a little warm inside."
Great place for local eats,"The food section of the market was still buzzing at 7 pm on a Friday, other sections were mainly shutting down or closed. We stuffed down hand pulled noodles by the Netflix celebrity, washed down with rice beer, gimbap, tteokbokki and live baby octupus. Would definitely visit again and allot more time for discovery. "
A lot of local food,There are a lot of Korean local food and I'm not surprised that they are not that hygienic. The market itself is too crowded and I don't feel comfortable with it.
Great place for local food!!,"Many stalls selling the same things, so pls read up or watch Netflix before going over. Have to try the mung beans pancake and knife noodles and dumplings. Go where the locals eat!"
Great food,"The food here was great, I had the mung bean pancake. Apart from the food, this place is super crowded and the shops are pretty much the same shops you see all over the city."
Real Seoul,"Although I hadn’t seen the Netflix special about this market, I loved the food and the fact that it’s not a tourist market. Well not yet Yes we ate at the now famous store and had dumplings which were amazing. "
Lot of street foods,You can find lot of street foods here. These are the korean traditional food. Recommended to visit to have a good experience on the street food.
Yummy!!!,Full of local korean food like real live octopus!! A must try in Seoul!This is also the best place to buy food gifts to bring home. Bargain!!
Food will blow your mind,"I came here for some souvenir shopping which was very successful, but my mind was blown by the food court. I wish I had been as careful as I was with the souvenir shops, not buying at the first store because the deeper I got into the food court the better looking the food got, but I was already full! The fried pancake filled with pork, sold right in the crux of the market was delicious. My daughter and I had fruit slushes out on the street side, but had we stayed toward the middle there were many more flavors available. Great atmosphere and great prices. Not much bargaining going on."
Wonderful Market,"A MUST visit if you are into following media tracks such as KD drama and other popular places. We went to this market to try NETFLIX handmade star :)The noodles were springy and yummy! The entire process can be seen right in front of you. dumpling and noodle making. As simple as 3 cauldrons to cook everything to serve people who would wait in 3 layers behind the stools.We had the handmade noodles (5000Won) and the mixed dumplings (5000Won)Both simple but for some reason we ended up going back the next day to have it again. Simplicity at it's bestNote the stall is near the south gate (stall # 70). If there's something worthy to add, try to find the place along the middle of the walk way as everyone practically sells the same thing but it is only this stall who the overflowing customer (the magic of media). this means the other stalls are not so keen in helping out find her. before you leave, don't forget to buy some of the local KR crackers (Yummy) and kimchi - ALL TYPES! There are a lot of souvenirs too for giveaway though price is not that different from Myeongdon...maybe 100 to 200Won cheaper."
Various food for all day,"Local market full with various local food. Price is not cheap but not expensive. Reccommend to walk around before make your decision because almost shops there have same food but some different menu. Not only food but have others like cloth, souvenir, etc. "
#imightseoulyou food trip,Lot’s of good food and too crowded also its one of korea’s old market thats why its a landmark tourist must visit when they go to seoul south korea. 
Bad,Good for street food but way too crowded. The markets in Japan are so much better and well organized.Worth the visit tho for the food. Try blood sausages and pig foot.
"Good food, try a few things",The market is full of snacks and other items that can be great souvenirs. It also has things for the home if your living in Korea. The best thing about it is its delicious traditional Korean food. Definitely try the knife cut noodles and mandu. The mung bean pancake is good too. It tastes like a thick hashbrown. I would definitely recommend this place in the spring or fall 
Very nice. Lots of food and lots of choices,I came here directly from the plane. It was a very nice visit. I bought a few packets of snacks and had wonderful food that were freshly prepared and piping hot. Price-wise : very very reasonable. I would definitely come here again. It was really nice and vendors are nice and not at all pushy.
Traditional market with great local food,"Very nice train station and very accessible. Busy market with lotsa local food, go there with an empty stomach to try the local food. Sells fresh fruits and kimchi, also local souvenirs and snacks to bring back as gifts. Many stalls selling similar snacks and food though. Must try the mung bean pancakes and chilled vegetable gelatins. "
Ahjumma had us running through Gwangjang,"When we visited, my husband and I were looking to buy hanboks. We entered a building where they were selling hanboks and the first stall didn't have the style I wanted. But she motioned for us to follow her. She left her stall and ran (with all 7 of us following her) to another shop just to help me find the hanbok I wanted. We ended up purchasing from the shop she took us to, then we went back to purchase my husband's hanbok from her shop."
Korean local traditional street food,This place sells all kinds of korean local traditional food. Tourists and locals frequent this place. 
Cool,You will find ecerything from this market. It is all cheap and you can find also the traditional things like hanbuk their traditional clothes
Must go at least once,"Gwangjang market was our go to brunch destination. They offer things from spices to fresh seafood, pickled food to textiles. But let’s be honest, my only reason for going there is to eat. So many rows of food stalls and so many things to choose from. We had to come back twice to sample all the food we wanted. I love the meat/mung bean pancakes, the kalguksu with mandu. You can also get the live octopus (sannakji) here. Oh and don’t forget to try the hotteok (honey pancake).Get off at Jongno 5-ga station or Euljiro 4-ga stationHappy eating!"
Good variety of merchandise & local eateries,Come early to soak in the busy market sounds & smells. Great range of merchandise from socks to hanboks. Interesting restaurants selling live octopus & raw beef. Supposed to be a local delicacy. Good range of banchan to buy home as edible souvenirs. I love my pickled sesame leaves. 
Live Cuttlefish Experience,Well as they say it’s a must try so at this market you will have many chances to try We tried it at this place and although not my favourite I can say I’ve had it Lots of snacks and pancakes to try too 
Interesting market with plenty of food stalls,"We went to Gwangjang Market in the morning. Lots of food stalls selling similar stuff. Tried the mung beans pancake and it’s delicious. We went in a group so that we can try a bit of this a bit of that as portions are big.There’s also live octopus... but we didn’t enjoy it so we didn’t order this time. Overall, good place to spend an hour or two."
Beware of Ahjumma-sticky-fingers!!!,"Gwangjang Market is very busy and now it seems the owners have learned to take advantage of this.I went into an accessory shop to buy my niece a few things for her first birthday. The ahjumma quoted me a price of 46,000₩. While she went to the back to get a plastic bag for me, I placed a 50,000₩ note on the counter. I turned to look at a few more items while she was packing my things. My back was turned away from her, and she tells me I gave her 5,000₩ instead of 50,000₩.I know for certain I had two 50,000₩ notes with me because I had just gone to the ATM and withdrew them.I asked her if she had CCTV in her store...and of course, she didn't. Her ""friend"" another ahjumma store owner (conveniently) walked up and said she was watching the entire time and a money switch was not possible.The whole situation was sketchy and it seems like these ladies do this as often as possible.I suppose I could have called the police, but without CCTV, I felt I really didn't have a choice but to leave....without my 45,000₩.So....shoppers beware. NO MATTER HOW LONG YOU'VE LIVED IN KOREA and even though you believe Korean people don't steal....never, ever, ever....leave your money on a counter. In my 10 years here, I never thought this could happen....glad my lesson only cost me $45.‍♀️‍♀️‍♀️"
Awesome market I didn’t even know about,"As I left the Shilla hotel I thought to check my walking itinerary for the day with the concierge and she recommended that while walking from ddp plaza to cheeong stream that we stop at this popular market. It did not disappoint. There is a gorgeous inner 2floor market for custom made Hanbok. This would be the place to go! We got to eat all of the night market street foods, did awesome souvenir shopping and we wanted to eat all here in this one market too. "
Interesting Marketplace With Plenty Of Delicious Traditional Korean Food!,This is a hugh marketplace selling all sorts of goods. If you are looking for affordable Korean souvenirs and gifts then you may want to pay a visit here and the kimchi prepared and sold by the ajumas (in sealed bags of 1/2 or 1kg packs) taste so good. There are also plenty of delicious traditional Korean food stalls lined throughout the entire place. The Hotteok (mugbean pancake is a must try here!)
Crazy food market ,It’s crazy in a positive way by walking through the food market on weekends. The live cooking looks so amazing and the food is so fabulous!
"If you have been to Gwangjang, you have seen the entire Korea","Basically a market that has everything you need to see, to buy and to eat. All under one roof. A good stop before heading home. Buy all you need, pack and say see you again Seoul!"
One of the Best in the World,"I love markets, and have been to many all over the world. This one might be my favorite. Spend an hour browsing, then pick the spot to eat that you think looks best. Order some food and Soju. You will be happy. "
Mind blowing ,"The two markets I visited in Seoul were Namdaemun and Gwangjang, both on a Saturday. I enjoyed Gwangjang the most. It was more crowded, especially in the afternoon. The street food style eating is much better than Namdaemun. There is everything you could want. We ate bimbap and tteokbokki while seated on a heated bench; 3000 won each and generous. At another stall, we ate a honey pancake. Delicious! Walked around for a couple of hours, including across the street where there are many climbing gear shops. Expensive, but fun to browse. One even serves beer and coffee. Look for the one called “mygear”. Vas’s beer in a 16 oz glass is 3000 won. Coffee made to order. Very nice host. I would come back again and would recommend to friends. "
Yummy food and people,"Abundance of food, price very reasonable. this market also sells clothing and household stuff. Must go!"
Gwangjang Market - All under one roof,"The market is one of the oldest and largest traditional markets in South Korea, with more than 5000 shops built around 1957 and 1959. Sells all food, house hold products at a very reasonable price."
Food choices are many!,This area is frequented by locals.You get to feel to local atmosphere in this market than the other markets in Seoul.Traditional Korean food is must to be experienced here.
FOOD ,Checking off my bucket list of eating live octopus... this place is filled with delicious made to order food. 
Korean Street Food Choices,"This place is accessible and offers several Korean food at affordable prices. The aunties are nice too. The market also sells other things than food, but I believe most tourist go for the food."
Meh.... Thats all I have to say to this market,"We were so looking forward to this. It did disappoint. May be because we were there in Feb, but we found it a bit lame. There is nothing special at this market that we can get anywhere else in Seoul. There is nothing really that would make us go there again."
Local flavor,"It's a huge market, fill with hanbok and clothes selection. Venture to the other side for hundreds of store selling the same thing. Pick your favorite auntie or lady and enjoy the food"
Lots to eat ,"This is a very good place to visit as there are food and clothes and all sorts of things. There are many nice foods , local korea food to try. "
Local food in a unsatisfying environment ,"There are many stores offering local food. If you hope to have some Korean food, it is the best place to go. However, the environment is quite worrying since the market is quite dirty and lacks enough cleaning facility. I am afraid of the tableware is not clean."
A Foodies Paradise,"A great place to sample the culinary delights of Korea. A must visit but it can be hot in the summer, which is why then the Juice stands are mandatory. Highly, highly recommend. Be brave and try the live octupus, we wimped out!"
Surprises at every turn!,"We went on a tour with a local guide and found the market to be lively on a Sunday night. There was plenty of food and drink to choose from. I recommend anything fried & try something you might not have eaten on a regular day - mine was a kimchi mini crab! You can sit on the heated seats and enjoy the company of other travelers or take your food to-go. The smells will remind you that you are in old school Korea, and probably that you're hungry! Plan to spend at least two hours here eating and touring the shops. Take cash as it's easier and quicker to pay in won."
I do recommend,"Whether you like Korean food esp Korean street food or not, you will still enjoy this place. I recommend weekdays than weekend esp Sunday. some places closed on Sunday yet still lots to see and try.... be aware of crowds on Sundays, the market has very narrow street due to heaps of stalls there. hustle and bustle for sure and heaps of street food and traditional Korean rice wine as well. "
Freaky food,Loved this market where you can get chicken feet and octopus:) The vendors were nice and it was tasty.
Foods everywhere!,"I like this place! You can try many local foods here with affordable price. My recommendation is Dakbal (boneless chicken feet) it’s VERY delicious! Ah, and a little bit spicy but not too much "
Affordable street food and snacks,"Took bus from MyeongDong to market for lunch and bought Korean snacks e.g. rice crispies mixed with honey and nuts, fresh rice cakes. Ate gimbap, raw octopus, crispy fried pancakes in one of the stalls. Squatted like a local to eat blood intestines, liver, lungs etc. Market specialised in selling blankets, fabric and winter blankets (which I was told can be vacuum sealed back home)."
Wonderful food. Awesome atlosohrre,Excitement in the air as this place is bustling with lots of activities. Good food as well! Highly recommend this place. A stall with a sign that says ‘Best Millet pancake in Korea’. Got to try .. locals Q for this food. I guess they can’t be wrong. stall is at the North 2nd gate. This is just one of the many good food in this place....
Great experience for any foodie!,"Absolutely loved our experience here. So many food options including dumplings, mung bean pancakes fish, doughnuts, red bean crepes, soups and everything in between. Go hungry! Would highly recommend"
A unique undercover market well worth the visit,"My partner and I had an afternoon free while in Seoul, and after checking some possibilities decided that Gwangjang Market appeared to be within a decent walking distance from our hotel on the western edge of Myeongdong.Using our trusty Google maps we set off... and what a journey that turned out to be. For some reason we found Google maps (normally very reliable wherever we travel...) tended to get a bit confused at times around Seoul...) to take us on a somewhat weird path to Gwangjang Market... down a variety of minor streets and laneways... on and on we walked, and walked, and walked... until FINALLY we located Gwangjang Market, and what we THOUGHT was a main entrance, off Cheonggyecheon-ro Street, so we entered.It is an indoor market, BUT... all we could see were aisles and aisle of what seemed to be mainly fabric, bedding, manchester, linen etc. shops and stalls, AND... they were almost all closed! What a disappointment, after having followed Google for maybe 25 minutes around strange streets. This certainly is a large market, somewhat along the lines of Chatuchuk Market in Bangkok. We checked down various aisle/passageways/arcades, but just more of the same, and virtually nothing open. But they weren't the types of stalls/shops we thought we would find here anyway.After several minutes of checking out various arcades, we were about to give up, when we decided to checkout way down the other end of a very long aisle of shops where there appeared to be some kind of a food shop open. And Hey Presto...!! Here was what we were looking for.It turns out the Gwangjang Market is more huge than we thought, and that there are apparently two main areas. The first being the more commercial area that we had encountered (off Cheonggyecheon-ro Street), and then at the other end of this huge complex, AND... with its own main entrance off Dongho-ro Street, was the market we thought we were to be visiting. Lots of unique food stalls and street food, bric-a-brac, fruit and vegetables, a huge variety of drink and ice-cream shops and stalls etc. etc. This part of the market is a huge market in its own right. And this part of the market was VERY busy when we visited. It appears to be more popular with the locals, with families buying treats, food, ice-creams etc. for their children, tourists sampling the street foods etc.From what we could gather, the more commercial part that we initially entered into is apparently only open certain hours or days of the week, whereas the part we now found ourselves in is apparently open every day. Eureka...! It wasn't a wasted day after all.I love to sample street food items in whatever country I am visiting, so this section of Gwangjang Market certainly provided a wide variety of options. Gwangjang Market is definitely worth a visit if you have a couple of hours to spare, excluding your travel time to get there. You could probably get away with an hour there, or you could easily stretch it out to at least two hours.Oh... and regarding travel time... We departed Gwangjang Market via the Dongho-ro Street entrance, and THIS TIME Google maps presented us with a much more direct, and more obvious route back to our hotel, which we could have done in almost half the time on the outward journey... except that we dropped off in the Myeongdong shopping streets for another look around, and to get dinner."
So many markets! Glad to have visited this one,"When we were there, the locals definitely outnumbered tourists, which is a good thing. The buffet breakfast in our stomachs allowed us to take our time watching what eateries the locals were patronizing. They know what's good, so I'm following them. Obviously, we can't read Korean, so I just took pictures (see attached). The best pancakes seemed to be the one with the orange sign (says since 1994). We sat in front on the benches with tables, enjoyed our 4000 Won pancake while watching customers go in & out of the dine-in restaurant. Plus, many locals were buying takeaway plastic containers of uncooked pancake mix. Amazing, it's that popular! Then 2 different stall owners told us to eat the 2500 Won Japchae (transparent noodles with sesame oil and soy sauce) from this lady at stall #41. We just sat on stools holding our plates and watched this endless line of folks buying the 3 things they sold. We were also impressed how the 2 ladies left their money sitting in 2 bowls for all to see and everyone stayed honest!"
Shop! Food! Yum!,"Great market with many interesting selection of food although most sell the same items. You have to be here with empty stomach else is like walking in casino. Hope you can get the most yummy store! Please note that sun a lot of retail stores is closed, but crowded for the food alley :) Yum!"
Eat like locals,I went to Gwanjang Market for the local food and I was overwhelmed by the choices and the crowd (both locals and tourists). Better decide what you wanted to eat before going there for dinner since this seems to be peak time. Take outs are possible though so you can just buy to go.
Excellent ,"I love this market. It's with full of nice yummy food. You just can't decide which stall that you should sit and eat. But, it's all the same on every stalls that offers. The food is super yummy and fresh. "
A view into everyday life,"This is a good stop to finish your day, try some local food (and by this I mean what koreans eat everyday), and, in the meantime, do some bargain souvenir shopping.The place is crowded and you’ll have to navigate yourself trough people and stands, but, all in all, if markets are part of your interest, it’s worth a short visit. "
Worth to visit ,Gwangjang Market near to Ihwa Mural Village. Lots of local foods here and the taste is quite good. I bought kimchi from here because the ajumma let us try n the taste is good.
Local market experience,"Great experience for tourists visiting Korea. Various food stalls located in the middle of the market, do try them, the food there is generally tasty as well."
Lively traditional market,"Gwangjang market is one of the oldest traditional markets and is is fun to visit. It is packed with many food stalls selling street food, fruit,vegetable meat and fish shops and also shops selling kitchenware, textiles, clothing and more. One of the popular items sold in the food stalls is the mung bean pancakes. These are deep fried and cut in pieces - making it easy to eat with chopsticks and you can dip it in soy sauce. I thought it looked greasy but it was delicious!"
Good place to grab some local food,"Well, basically a covered local market, where you can buy everything you need and don’t need ;-)However, it is also a place with many small food stalls, where you can get local meals for a reasonable price. Many locals Fettheit lunch here. Everything looks perfectly clean, so we had no concerns at all to sit down on one of the small benches and get something to eat, it was very good."
Food and Fabrics,"If you are looking for local food, this is a must visit place. There are plenty of food stalls in the market and you will be spoilt for choices here. The Korean pancake is one of the more popular choices of food here. The other point for this market is definitely its fabric shops. This is literally the place to shops Fabric especially the famous Korean Silk. You have to walk through the market to find the best bargain and I can tell you its gonna be a long walk coz the market is so huge. Its open in the morning and to go here, you can take subway Line 1 and alight at Jongno 5-ga Station and use exit 7 or 8."
Came for the Food!,"At first, I walked around the fabric section of this market and then ended up in the food portion. I am a big foodie and instantly my eyes widened! Vendor after vendor, of seafood, fried food, vegetables, street food, etc.. I was in heaven. The stalls were pretty repetitive, but there is still a huge selection. I tried a few fried items first, delicious. After browsing the stalls I sat at one and ate a bowl of fresh Bibimbap. The bowl was filling and very affordable. The market itself was crowded obviously in the evenings, but there is plenty of room to look, sit, and eat! I recommend coming here for lunch or dinner at least once during a stay just to sample a variety of food items."
Market with full of delicious and cheaper food !!! ,"This gwangjang market was inly 8minutes walk from novotel ambassador seoul dongdaemun , and offer so many variant of korean food , love it !!! And the price is even cheaper and open until midnight.Beside food, also selling so many things, something for house and all, great to explore korea in this way"
Just a local market,"Just another local market selling all kinds of stuff. Clothes, textile and local food. You see tourist and locals hanging around here."
Street food paradise,"Tons of street food stall selling similar traditional korean street food. Full of tourist during my visit. You can also find some shops selling clothes, snack, ginseng etc... in the area. But food is definitely the highlight here! "
So glad to be back again!,"If you are in Seoul, this is the place you must visit! Such a variety of food is available for your tastebud! Pa-jeon, Nok-du-jeon, bin-dae-ddeok, ma-yak-gim-bap, etc.Oh, and inner side of the market offers many stores that offer beautiful traditional korean clothes for you to wear at very billiger price! Try them!"
 Nostalgia Walk ,"Nice to walk around the market place for city folks, but food wise nothing fantastic. Most stores sell almost the same food under the same section. "
Busy Food Market,This is a bustling market with may stall selling traditional South Korean dishes. It was a good experience. I realized though that the price per order are no cheaper than eating on the other restaurants that we've dined in. 
Go for the raw beef! Really! ,"This enormous market is an absolute must visit when you’re in Seoul. The market sells goods and foods and this review will focus on the foods. First, it would be impossible to do this market justice by any single review. One could spend a month here and still not discover all that it offers. I was interested in trying Korean beef tatare. I found my way to “raw beef alley” and picked a place. The beef here is delivered each morning and is of the highest quality and freshness. I tried my dish with a chopped live baby octopus on top. Most westerners may balk at the dish when they see the chopped tentacles moving about on top of a mound of bright red raw beef. Break the egg yolk on top and dig in! I guarantee it will be one of the most delicious dishes you have ever tasted. If you eat sushi and like your steak rare, then it’s not much of a step to eat Korean beef tartare and live baby octopus. "
Food and shopping,"We were spoiled for choices for the many food stores. Wet market to buy condiments and kimchi. Also there are many knick knacks and snacks to bring home.If you are interested in hanboks, there are many shops that sell them."
A colourful market where everyone was friendly,"The market is huge - there are sections selling clothing, textile, bedding, kitchenware; but most people congregate at the food stalls. Be sure to eat kimbap, tteokbokki, mandu and all the other Korean delights. I loved the bibimbap and bindaetteok or the mung bean pancake a lot. The shops also sell souvenirs like roasted laver, honey butter almonds - all at a cheaper price than bigger retail outlets. It's a wonderful place to visit indeed! "
Wow,If you don’t like being around a ton of busy people don’t go! It was fun and we saw so much! Plenty to eat and walking. It’s a must do. 
Fantastic gimbap and mungbean pancakes,"We came to Gwangjang Market for lunch & loved it so much that we came back for breakfast on our last day in Seoul. We had the gimbap and bindae-tteok/mungbean pancake that the market are famous for. Both were great, we especially loved the mungbean pancake, with it's crisp golden outside & soft inside. We also had kalguksu/knifecut noodle soup with mandu/dumplings. It was fantastic! Would recommend Gwangjang Market to anyone who visits Seoul."
Place for local food and traditional items,Eat eat eat! All kind of banchan ( Korean side dishes) ! First time trying out raw marinaded crabs. The taste is very flavourful! Must eat with rice ! 
Traditional Korean Market perfect place for food trip and souvenir shopping,"We went there to experience different kinds of Korean street food. The place did not disappoint! Upon entering the market there are already few food stalls inviting you to buy their food but we kept patient and strolled more. Then we saw these lines of food stalls in the middle of the market offering different kinds such as dumplings, noodles, pancakes, chicken feet, rice cakes, and a lot more! We weren't able to try them all but our tummies were really satisfied. We will surely visit this again when we go back to Korea!"
Take a peek into Korean culture ,"Authentic traditional market. Many local food to try on. Reasonable price. You can get many other things here beside local food. Clothes, daily groceries, hanbok, etc. Highly recommended. "
Nice to look aroubd,We had a nice cheap soup noodle dish with dumplings here. Very lively and busy. A lot of the stalls serve the same thing. Worth a visit! 
Nice place ,"A better place for eating and you’ll see a lot of things , localfood, stuff , people ... It was nice witnessing this place ... "
Where locals shop clothes and eat mungo cakes,"The market is very clean and easy to Find. The specialty is textiles, clothes and street Food specially mungo cakes and bibimbap. There Are a lot OF cheap winter jackets and bed warmers with rows OF stores selling different kinds OF textiles. But The highlight is The fresh lay cooked mungo cakes, bibimbap and to die fish soup. There are also live octopus sashimi but we didnot try IT."
Go and Eat,"A market where locals shop is a must-visit on my list everywhere I go. Although I am not sure I think I got a feel of that at Gwangjiang ( or Kwangjang) Traditional Market. You can find anything you can think of, from food to household items. A section of the market is dedicated to street food capably managed uniformly by older ladies who do not shy from fighting for your business. 3 items are ubiquitous— Korean sausage made of pork blood and sticky rice, japche stir fried yam noodles and vegetables, and rice cakes. A kiosks sell nothing but fried mung bean cakes. I cannot say they are the tastiest food I’ve had but try them all, if only for the right to brag you have done it! Then walk it off along the very pleasant Cheonggyecheon Stream nearby. "
Perfect place to eat & shop like a local,"If you like Korean street food, this is the place to be. There are dozens of food stalls serving yummy Korean dishes like noodles, dumplings, bibimbab, raw squid, hundred types of kimchi, etc. It's fun to walk around and try different food. Souvenirs sold here are also cheaper. Behind the market is Cheonggyecheon stream where you can take a nice walk to burn all the calories from those delicious food."
Nice to walk around,"Nice atmosphere and lots of things to see and eat, but sadly smells like which can be offputing overall it was good"
Looking for something to buy? Try this place🤗,"After visiting Insadong, my friend and I went to Gwanjang Market. It has many things to offer but what I like the best is the variety of to try. I enjoyed trying different street foods especially the octopus marinated in chili (I forgot the name) I will go back to enjoy their food again. It was late when I saw the bedsheets and different comforters. I think the prices of cloth and bedsheets are cheaper there than in other markets I visited. I need to bring larger suitcases next time so that I can buy things I want in that market."
YUMMY ADVENTURE!,"As you can imagine, at the food street this is extremely touristy; however it’s a great one pit stop to try all the different kind of snacks!What we loved about it was it’s variety, though you can find almost the same food at each stand... it’s a nice atmosphere to soak in!We had the braised pork intestines, tteokbooki (not sure if I’m spelling this right), japchae! Also bought a bag of mandarin oranges from JeJU!We came around 1pm and it was bustling! Easy to get here on foot from the subway!"
If you like the vibe and street food!,I enjoy the crowd but the food I ate was pretty so-so. I had Korean pancake and it was too oily for me. Even so I would like to give it a try again with other stall. The sidedish stall looks yum. The market was clean but some vendor might be a bit aggressive.
Overwhelming but still good to visit ,"Lots of vendors selling fabrics, clothes and food. Pretty intense and overwhelming inside. Food stalls were all the same. Sellers were very pushy. If you stop to look, they automatically try to hand you a menu and make you sit. We had to keep on walking so that we wouldn’t feel pressured to buy, which didn’t allow us to focus much. Once we decided to stop at one of the stalls and try out the pancakes, they brought out 2 when we only wanted one so we ended up having to pay for both. Felt a little tricked because we’re foreigners. Wanted to look at fabrics, but every time we would stop to check them out, we would get harassed by the sellers and when we’d decide not to buy, they’d get upset and start becoming unfriendly. It got frustrating a bit. We did checked out one souvenir shop where the seller was a very nice sweet older man. Overall, it was an interesting place to see. I would still recommend it."
Not Bad,We having a dinner here. There are some food is famous at the market and must try. You may buy some Korean snack there as it really cheap compare to other market.
Korean Neighborhood Shopping,Good way to see Korean local culture. Lots of opportunity to eat local food and shop for Staples. You can find some shopping for tourists but basically a place to immerse in a culture. Worth a few hours of your time
"Just look around,but do not buy","This market has become a trap for both locals and tourists.It used to be a place to get some mouthwatering street food, but after it got popular, they no longer accept credit card and became super expensive. Not to mention unhygienic and rude atmosphere. You might want to try out just a little food there, but do not plan to have a whole meal because that will cost more than fine restaurants in the city. The quality has been falling for the past few years. Even for Koreans, this place is tough not to get ripped-off. (Oh, and the government actually protects shop owners from doing those kind of things because they consider them as being ""vulnerable"" compared to corporate-owned restaurants. Accordingly, there will never be an improvement)"
Everyone selling same food,"The Mung Bean Pancake is a Must Try. The Japchae (glass noodle), the pig's trotter and some other dishes are all over the food alley.Those stalls selling the Korean snacks are willing to go on bargains, esp. if a relatively huge amount of stuffs are bought. A friendly couple of this store even offered free yoghurt drinks to my kids and were happy to reduce prices with small free packs of snacks like seaweed in the bag "
For Foodies,"For a foodie like me, this place was like a foreign haven. It has all sorts of Korean food. Absolutely worth the extra pounds I gained!"
A great place to eat ,This is a fabulous place to come and try some great Korean food. Snack your way around the market and leave stuffed and satisfied. 
Fascinating....,"Seriously, I really though Seoul is all about hiphop, high end, classy stuff, but after my week long stay in Seoul, i realized that Seoul is really rather people city than the classy nature I thought previously.Gwangjang market is truly a gem of what like really living in Seoul like, and how they enjoy so much in here as the food is good, cheap and come in huge variety.Please do come here early to start enjoying, as the crowd keep coming in endlessly...Have fun, its worth visiting and is FREE to do so .. :D"
Amazing variety of foods,"Spent a couple of hours wondering around with my family, stopping at various stalls to try the foods. Soups, dumplings, omelettes, noodles, fruit juices - and a variety of sometimes recognisable meat products. We saw most of it cooked before our very eyes. It was so intense and jam packed with new sights and smells.  Absolutely worth a visit. "
Interesting place to eat and be introduced to Korean food.,"Went alone one afternoon, had Kimchi Dumplings and a sweet Cold Noodle dish with ice cubes. I’ve travelled across different parts of the world and found Korean food to be quite sweet, as well as pungent. It was cool to sit in the market and l got talking to a girl from Taiwan. Only downside is that a lot of the stalls are very similar, but still a cool place."
Great market to spend your evening,Gwangjang Market is a great way to experience an abundance of Korean dishes from sweet to savoury. There are so many stalls set up in the middle with some normal and weird food on display. Walk around the different areas to see the clothing and textiles too!
Food market true to its name,"Huge market for foodstuffs, clothing and FOOD!Popularized by Runningman, celebrity chefs, and more, Gwangjang market gives a glimpse into what Korean food culture is like.Simply put... so much food! Bring enough cash! ...skip the dumplings"
Food and Textiles,It’s definitely a place that has abundance of food. Come in the morning and try the variety out. There’s a millet cake with red bean that’s really famous but personally I don’t think it’s the best. There’s a lot of textiles as well as plants. A lot of fabrics to make coats and shirts and many shops sells souvenirs and Hanbok (Korean traditional dresses). There’s salted fishes as well as raw octopus for consumption. 
Lots of food and stuff,"Lots of food and wholesale stuff to buy. I am unsure if the prices are any cheaper but its a great experience. We bought some local snacks from the snacks stores. The hanboks there are really pretty, even for kids too. Worth the trip if you have something to buy."
Explore the maze of shops,"Coming from the US to Korea has shown us many things we never knew existed, and many things done differently than we ever considered. Gwangjang is one of those. It is densely packed maze of little tiny shops and street vendors that is wonderful to explore. The food vendors offer a wide variety of novel foods, prepared right in front of you. The traditional clothing stores are dangerous to those of us with little will power and a love of cultural garb."
Go with empty stomach,"You got to visit this market if you are in Seoul. It shows you what things Koreans buy for their kitchens. From various type of chilis, veggies to ginseng and silk cocoon. But the best part is the food vendors. Huge huge huge numbers of them. Good food but inexpensive price: best. "
"Snacks, Souvenir, Traditional Clothes, etc...","One of the Korean traditional market where you can see and taste the local foods, experience the local shopping, to see the local foods, vegetable, fruits, Korean traditional side dishes, seafood, Korean Hanbok, etc. You may go to the Majeongyo underground shopping centre, they sold handmade traditional souvenirs and it is a little bit cheaper from the one in the market."
Street food ,"I went there only for the the street food and haven’t been disappointed. I had chicken feet, tteokbokki, maiak kimbab and kimchi pancakes. I loved every single bit of everything I ate. Attention though because they have 2 separate menus for locals and foreigners and if you don’t speak or read korean at all you might pay 2000 or 3000 won more than locals for the same food."
Interesting Korean traditional market,It is very interesting Korean traditional market where you can taste local street food. There are also a restaurants in the market where you can sit down and have a little more formal meal. The pity is that nearly all the food vendors are selling exactly the same traditional food. It would be nice to add some variety of modernized Korean food like what you can find in the other part of the city.
Great Shopping Experience,"Gwangjang market is good for ladies shopping. as variety of clothes specially ladies wear you can buy from there at reasonable price compared to other malls in Seoul. There are food stalls, one can enjoy Music which is playing on streets. People are enjoying there all the time. Good people. Good Place."
Must do when in Seoul,"Loved this place. Sights sounds and smells really make you come alive. The food was the main attraction for ourselves and this is in the centre of the market. Make time however, to take in the fish, spice, kimchi and textile stores on route. There is a massive choice of places to eat, with each type of speciallity seeming to have the same location with different stall traders servicing the same option in each area. Prices are clearly shown and standard across the piece. Not as cheap as I expected but still much better than western prices. We chose to have just one type of dish (portion ) at each stall so we could try as many things as we could before getting full. Mung bean pancakes were our fav!4000 a portion. Bibimbap 5000 was really good. Fish cakes in a soup were nice at 3000. Sundae a blood sausage filled with spiced sweet rice were fantastic, they are served with cooked liver which reminded me of my child hood 6000. Bottled water is provided free - one central bottle from which you fill your own cup. Alternatively look for stores on the side selling Cass beer in small cans for 2000. Kimchi as usual was served complmentary. Didnt try any fish stuff as off to Busan later. Deffo a great place to try most of Koreas fantastic food in a great atmosphere."
Great street food with too much choice,"Big food market, crowded with a confusion of sights, sounds and smells. I was wandering from my hotel looking for somewhere to eat on a sunday evening when many surrounding restaurants were closed and suddenly came across this market with an over-abundance of choice of street food.Common format was to have a cooking stall at the front onto the street with some tables in a room behind. Sitting at the tables was a bit less frenetic. Not much english spoken, but got by fine with 'point and smile' as menus have pictures and an english title for each dish. A meal (a sort of half pancake, half omelette with green beans and seafood) and a beer was 16,000 Won.On a sunday evening I seemed to be the only tourist among thousands of people, many buying a take-away in metal foil containers. Going to the market for a desert of deep fried sweet pastry with a dipping cup of sugar also seemed very popular."
Great street food,"Great place to try all the different Korean street food, not for the people on diets. Also lots of good Korean products"
A must visit!,This is my favourite market on earth. A lot of delicious street food all over the market. It’s the true part of daily life in the city. I highly suggest visiting the market for a true local experience.
As crazy as any big market can get.,"Gwangjang is na interesting place to visit. Big, chaotic, full of people, varied business. We had a great sushi in one of the small booths. Definitely worth a visit."
Walking around,The market is very big full of street food and small restaurant. Visiting in the afternoon is very hot in summer. Visiting at night to taste the street food will be much more pleasant.
If you like traditional market you must visit this place,"Love this market! Apparently, this market is divided into sections, there is bibimbap section, hanbok section, etc. Market is clean and nice. If you like traditional market you must visit this place. They sell a lot of things, varieties of fermented goods (their fermented octopus kimchi is to die for), beautiful hanboks, korean cookware (that ramyeon pot you always see in k-dramas, stone pot for bibimbap,etc), food stalls (dumpling, pumpkin porrridge, mung bean pancakes, barley rice bibimbap, etc) and many more."
A Mish Mash of Everything,"Spent an entire morning at the market...you can get fresh produce, freshly blended juices, freshly made ice-coffee, ice cream, the mung bean pancake and for us Malaysian women, go crazy for all the pre-cut various different cloths available at USD10 each. There is Korean Silk, cotton, washable silk, linen, etc...Bed-linen of various sizes and shapes and styles and makes, Oh Man...decisions, decisions."
"Busy local market, worth to go","Large local market provide food, gifts and Korean dress. Best place to see local things if you first visit Seoul."
Large Food Portions,"Very nice visit; however, I wish I knew how to tell the street food ladies to only give a half portion or small portion. Many were confused when we were just sampling different foods and not finishing. We wanted to leave room for the next stop."
Eat with the locals,"Gwangjang Market Is known to be one of the first permanent markets in Korea and is a popular tourist destination. The market is famous for its textiles; there are hundreds of stores that sell silk, satin, and linens. The stores here usually supply fabrics to the different market like in Namdaenum, Dongdaemun, and department stores. Aside from the fabrics, this place is also known for their food. There are many food carts in the middle aisles selling different local dishes like bibimbap, dumplings, mung pancakes, live octopus, rice cake, blood sausage and a lot more."
Over rated ,"This is probably the biggest and best food market according to the media, went there 1st thing in the morning, very disappointed. Lots of stalls but majority are the same food. Tried to cover each stall, unfortunately I couldn’t eat that much. Went there in winter, and the best thing was the seats were heated! Yes they were heated, how good was that for winter and an open space! But the food ... pretty average, nothing special. I was actually quite disappointed after my trip to Korea overall. I tried all the famous food I saw on the Korean drama, none of them were good. I was very keen on Korean food before, loved everything from the Korean restaurants here in Australia, but since I been there and tried it? I would say the Korean food which’s not from actual Korea is lot better. Korea is quite expensive compare to other Asian countries. Was there for half month and traveled from Seoul all the way down south to Jeju island, the only thing I felt good was the green tea waffle from Jeju island . So if u ever go on food trip, go to China, best food ever on the planet"
Not as impressive the second time round,"Visited Gwangjang 2 years ago and really liked it and went back this year. It didn't seem as impressive as before and the stalls were quite repetitive. We had some bibimbap at a stall then had some japchae - I ordered one portion and was served two miserable overpriced portions by the corner stall. Then we had mung bean pancakes. Interesting array of Korean street food, some of which are less common like the seafood dishes. It's a tourist trap so beware of upselling and some badgering. "
So so overall with the occasional gem,"It's a big market (or really collection of markets as there are other markets in the area) and there are some really great bargains to be found.There are tons of food stalls, but sadly they seem to all have mostly the same items and the ones I tried were ok, nothing more."
Over rated,"We heard great things about the market, went in the afternoon on a weekday. Lots of offer with loads of stalls but it’s all the same. Fish, vegetables and juices, or bedding. Depends what you like but I have been to much, much better markets unfortunately this one just wasn’t worth the train ride for us. If you like to take photos it’s a good spot I guess."
Interesting But Intimidating Food Market,"Having seen the Gwangjang Market written up many places as somewhere you had to visit in Seoul, my family went for dinner. We were very disappointed as it was much more intimidating than expected. We had already been to many places to eat in Seoul and to various markets. Gwangjang was among the most frenetic, crowded and dirty of them. We were not inspired to eat there. Instead, we were more comfortable with the street food in Myeongdong. I'm sure this is an instance of a difference in Western and Asian sensibilities, but I feel that Western tourists should be made aware that Gwangjang is not like anything you would be used to in the West."
I love the food,Easily to access via metro. Love the food here such as mungbean pancakes and other. Is full with tourist and foodssssssssss. 
Local delicious!,Must visit this local Korean Market with varieties food and daily items can be found in this market. You can experiences changing stall by stall tasting different local delicious as most stall have limited seating area.
Traditional market place,"A variety of Korean street food sold there - mandu, bibimbup, tokpokki, pancakes, noodles etc. Price is not really cheap though. Other sections sell textiles, snacks, souvenirs,hanbok etc. Interesting place to visit."
Yukhoe and Sannakji,"Probably the best place to try one of korean specialty food, yukhoe, sannakji, and bindaetteok! They also sell a lot of korean sidedish (banchan)a"
Traditional market,This is a great place to buy gifts for family and friends as well as enjoy delicious and traditional street foods in Korea. :)
A Market that is differently good!,"Most markets in Seoul offer the same stalls and after being to a few, it can be tiresome... except for Gwangjang Market! The food is real and local! The Mung Bean Pancake here rules its all! The Live Octopus is acquired taste but kids liked it!"
Went to food market,"The market has different sections selling different items so we went only to the food street to try their local delights.Had the mungbean pancake, famous donuts and also live octopus! Alot of their locals eat there, tourists were browsing more. Great local experience!Donuts were freshly made, located at the far end of the street. This stall is made famous as it has appeared on TV prog thrice! Be prepared to queue, but queue moves pretty fast. Go there n try for the local food experience and korean food culture! I went with a local guide so i did not have problems ordering food. But I realised that the hawkers are really friendly and welcoming unlike some local markets in other countries when you don’t speak their language. If you have time, do visit this food street!"
Authentic market experience,"Lots of stalls here selling hanbok, hanbok fabric and other stuff. Came here for the food. Food selection was varied and also very affordable! We sat at an ahjumma's stall and ate small kimbap, tteokbokki and jokbal. All were delicious! We loved the jokbal :) This ahjumma also serves live baby octopus and other food.At this market we also got to eat sundae, as well as fish cakes.We left with our tummies full! Definitely coming back here on my next visit. "
Immerse in the Korean Culture,"A market serving Korean cuisine, selling Korean titbits and traditional costume. Came here to really enjoy the authentic Korean food. Don’t expect clean and nice restaurant. If you expect that type of standard then this is not a place for you. It’s really the sit at the streetside-hawker style of eating. There are plenty of tit bits to buy, ranging from ginseng sweets / dried seaweed to chocolates. Also ginseng and other products for making Korean soup. There is a segment with traditional Korean costumes and selling Korean textile and pillows/cushion. The market is structured with a few streets branching out from the Center. Each streets covers their on specialty too. This is also the place I had my fresh live octopus! It was yummy and fresh. Tried the raw beef too! There are also plenty of stalls selling noodles etc. You can also bargain at the titbits stall and costumes stall."
Nice market,Nice market with foods to choose from and textile and hanbok to choose from. There were many stalls that are selling same kind of foods around there. Lovely place with good food and some snacks or clothes to shop around. 
A great preview of a local market,We did not have enough time to enjoy the sights and tastes of this local market. There was a wide variety of food on sale and the sight of the old ladies selling their wares was insightful about what an active lifestyle would do to add years to life. Definitely worth a visit.
Awesome Food,"We came mainly for the raw beef and octopus. There are many small restaurants selling the same thing. We picked one with a good review and it is actually a Michelin Star restaurant, how surprising! The food tasted so good and fresh. There are also booths selling pancakes, fish cakes, tteokbokki, kimbap and other snacks. "
Great place to visit ,"Despite being a market, it was clean and feels very comfortable. Great place to have a simple meal. Would recommend the greenbean pancake, gimbap and bibimbap there! Stalls there were very friendly.Went around 4pm on Friday and there wasnt a lot of people. Great time to eat and buy souvenirs & tidbit/snacks. "
Great place,"For a break for a lunch or just for discover the Seoul street foodI just ended up here randomly !It s not a big market but the food alleys are really interesting, the weird things like octopus, the smells of the potato bread , etc etcColorful, full of live , smells , spicesGood place"
Don't miss eating here!,"I felt that this market gave a true Korean experience. There are plenty of stalls (all serving slightly the same meals - bibimbap, gimbap, rice cakes, fish, etc) and you just take a seat and they serve you! Easy as that. It's a great place to meet locals, expats, people watch, and drink. It is complete chaos and super super busy but it is a really cool environment. I came here two nights in a row and will 100% be back. Truly authentic."
"Textile shops, some food street after 5 pm","visited this place around 5 pm and some of the textile shop already closed and replace with food street. However, not very much diversities - we only found dumplings, fried chinese style egg with pork and vegetables.....plenty of stall selling the same food "
Spacious modernized market,"Traditional or modernized? It's a mixture of both as there are stalls that remain tradition selling traditional stuff while some furnished their shop with air-conditioner selling Hanboks. They are divided into sections just like other markets in Seoul that makes it very clear which section you are in. There is a section selling food, which, normally patronized by tourists more than locals. The food stalls there selling identical food stuff so tourists can just choose any stalls to eat them. There are also shops surrounding the food stalls selling food items too, perhaps slightly more expensive as they dun seem to be crowded unlike the stalls outside. You can get most the stuff you need from this market, from raw food to cooked side dishes, cloths, mattresses, blankets, Hanboks to cooking wares."
Market delights in Gwangjang,"We took the Seoul Metro to Jongno 5-ga Station. From there it's about a 5min walk to Gwangjang Market. The market has clothes and food merchants - we arrived just before lunchtime which enabled us to walk/explore without any issues. Once lunch begins, you will see workers from nearby offices/businesses flock into the market and sit at the various food stalls - usually a shared bench/table which surrounds the vendor stall. There's all manner of Korean food which caters to all different palates. The market also has a large number of Hanbok clothing stores which line the alleyways as well as stores which provide jewelry for the Korean weddings. There's also many men's suit and clothing shops where you can buy suit material or ready-made shirts if you desire. As you explore the many areas of the market, there's even live seafood shops which have produce available for purchase, as well as traditional Korean snacks. We had lunch at one of the many vendors and tried the bibim naemgyeon cold noodle dish and my wife had a noodle soup that had wide rolled noodles (made in front of your whilst you wait). If you love exploring, visit Gwangjang. It's also about a 15min walk to Dongdaemun area. Highly recommend visiting this market."
Go for lunch and beers ,"Eating from the stalls is a must. The food is good but the whole experience is what I like, it reminds you of where you are as it is very ‘Korean’. I had lived in Korea for 3 years and I really enjoyed being in the bustle of the market."
Interesting. Came back all the time before I know it.,I like this place but never thought I like it enough to write a review until my most recent visit. I found myself naturally drawn to this place. I came to realization that you can find comfort in the food here. Some bread and butter shops may seem unexciting but it tells of the locals' life. Very interesting food options and excellent for the mini explorer in you.
Traditional market and food stalls,Our guide said most of the goods here were lower end. Liked seeing the fresh produce and fish for sale. I was extremely surprised to see English translations of the offerings of the street food at many stalls.
Many shops selling similar things,"Gwangjang market located a stone throw away from Jongno 5-ga exit 1, is rather overrated. When I visited, it was packed and although there were many stores, they mostly served similar things. Price wise, I would say it's rather reasonable. My friend and I ended up buying our food and walking over to Cheonggyecheon Stream to enjoy our food away from the crowd."
Limited food choices,"Usual food they sell here are seafood pancakes, kimbaps and noodles. Cheaper prices but limited variety of food. There are more food choices outside the market for a dollar or two more."
Tried the pajeon here!,"Our guide mentioned that if we say Gwangjang Market, he gets hungry just by remembering how good their Korean pancakes there. So we got curious and went to see the place. We took the bus and it's very convenient because it stops right in front of the market. We ate their Korean pancakes (pajeon) of course. There's a lot variety, vegetarian, or with meat or seafood. The place sells a lot of other things, food stuffs. It's a great place for people who loves to eat! "
Food and souvenirs ,"The market is covered with shops and stalls of food, souvenirs, utensils, cloth, handmade products. They basically sells same and similar stuffs. You can large range of street food here though. From mung bean pancake to porridge to kimbap to bibimbap to mandu to live seafood to raw beef and etc. The market is very convenient too, it is right in front of a metro exit. "
Not impressed ... ,No very impressed at all... same kind of food in every stole ... was interesting to came there... but I wouldn’t came again and I wouldn’t eat in here again .... not worth it 
It was okay.,"This place was recommended to me, but I thought it was just okay. If you're in the area, I would check it out, but I wouldn't go out of my way to see it. There are a lot of markets in Seoul, and this one didn't seem special to me."
Must visit traditional market in Seoul,"I always enjoy visiting traditional markets wherever I visit. Gwangjang market is one such place definitely worth visiting in Seoul if one wants to have a true local experience different from upscale markets Seoul has to offer. Great place for those who want to try Korean street food delicacies. Good place to pick up few souvenirs too … we found a good shop where we picked up colourful silk bojagis - Korean wrapping cloth, which make a cool gift. There are several shops selling textile and we bought some Korean silk cloth for dress. Rest of the time was spent exploring all the local food and vegetables on sale all around! Very nice atmosphere to enjoy."
Traditional market with lots to experience,It is a traditional market where you can find all kind of local products where the local would go. There is even a eatery place where you choose and eat.
Best Market for Korean Traditional Food,"Gwangjang Market is the place where you can find any Korean traditional food with reasonable price. Open till late around 9pm. Have visited it twice during winter, the hot topokki and japchae, plus soup for the drink, just warmed my body as I needed. One of a popular places to visit in Seoul, no wonder the market was quite dense by tourists during lunch."
Great market for street food and textiles.,"Lots of great street food and friendly vendors. It's a great market also for hanboks, Korean bedding, and housewares. And there are some souvenir shops at the ends as well. Definitely itinerary-worthy."
ONE OF THE BEST MARKETS AROUND!,"I went here suuuuper hungry and I was not disappointed with the food! Tried mayak kimbap, sundae, odeng etc etc and yukhoe (raw beef) which was really goood! I don't even eat raw food, but when I had this... It was just good and did not taste raw at all! They also have fruits and other stuff, but the highlight is definitely the food the serve. The price is very reasonable and the place is very easy to locate. "
A must!,"Huge market, many different things to try. Prepared right in front of you, it's difficult to choose at which store you want to sit down to eat... so I've been here a couple of times already haha. "
Nice local market with a side trip to costume jewelry factory,"The market visit was an interesting one as sellers where anxious to have you sit down and eat the food that they were cooking. Local people ignored us tourists and enjoyed their meal. Some of the local dishes were not for the faint of heart. Our guide took us through a factory where costume jewelry was being made for retailers through out the world. There were several hundred little shops with one tow two people working. Nothing was for sale to the general public, It was amazing to see how nimble the workers could put things together and how quickly they could do it. A nice experience."
Good eats,"Lots of food stalls in the area. However, there are sections of various but similar food. For example, one area was for the korean pancakes, another for seafood, and another for pork feet and blood sausgae, etc... In addition, there were shops for traditional wear and Korean snacks. You can use the Seoul City Tour hop on and off service to get here or arrive via other modes of transport."
Tasty pancake and noodle,"The stalls are selling the similar foods ie pancake, seaweed rolls, noodles, dumplings, bibimbap etc. Must try the pancake! It’s tasty! "
Breakfast in Gwangjang Market!,"This is one of the oldest traditional markets in Seoul and is considered one of Korea’s largest traditional (and most beautiful) markets. I was recommended by the hotel’s Concierge to visit Gwangjang market if I am interested in authentic, local street food and window shopping for silk items and kitchenware (including utensils and cookware). At first sight, the market will look a mess but as you enter the maze of inviting stores.The food section of the market was further north with some food stalls entertaining snaking lines of up to 10 patience customers. I found myself a small seating spot and had the following for breakfast: Topokki (Korean Spicy Rice Cake) Japchae (Korean Glass Noodle Stir Fry) Janchi Guksu (Korean Warm Noodle Soup)This is definitely a place I would live to re-visit if I was in Seoul again. Smelling, hearing, seeing, tasting and just being there in the middle of Gwangjang Market; doesn't get any better than that."
Nothing fantastic ,All the stalls seemed to be selling the same type of street food. Not much of a variety. Left the place after trying out some of the food and purchased some kimchi.
Great Korean Street food ,"We had an amazing experience at the Kwang Jang street market. They have authentic Korean street food, a plenty of different small shops to explore and the atmosphere was great."
Various Korean food offers!,I really had a good time at Gwangjang Market. The food that they offered here was scrumptious. I really do enjoyed having a Hotteok and a Raw Octopus which is we eat it alive. The souvenir here was a bit cheap compared to Myeongdong and has various choices. What I can suggested if you guys go to this place please empty your stomach before you go here and try all the food in this place. It’s worth it.
Always loud and smells of food wafting in the breeze.,"It's a traditional market with a mix of prepare food stalls and shops with areas to buy raw ingredients. A must see for anyone coming to Seoul wanting to taste of traditional Korean food. The shop and stall owners can be a bit too friendly trying to get you to eat there, but its all part of the charm. It is jam packed at night so if you want to visit, I recommend going for lunch and sampling food as you walk through. There is some variety in types of food you see but generally encompasses: kimbap(Korean seaweed rice rolls), Tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes), Jeon (battered pancakes with fish, veggies and meats). Food is cheap and non pretentious. Bring an empty stomach and an open mind to try a few new things. "
Great Food hidden in the Market,"Lots of food vendors option for you, taste is pretty much the same around here (it taste good) we didn't choose to sit at those vendors outside as there are too many people walking around and it bang our back. So we chose one of the restaurant with heater which we can rest and get warm with good food. They also have live octopus (Sanakji) at the Market, there is a shop located at the beginning of the street which i will not suggest you to go (sorry i forgotten the name, we went for the Sanakji randomly). Service is bad, there is no table for us and they ask us to sit outside with no proper table to eat, the octopus was stated 6000 won and they say they have, once we sat down they say that they don't have it. We felt cheated."
Wonderful Local Foods,"This is just one of those MUST DO items. A great selection of local foods prepared right in front of you. There are at least 100 vendors here with a great array of food, items and treats."
Kwang Jang Market outside building sign,"I use naver map to walk to this building from my hotel , lots of made in China clothes , wares here . Came here for food only where we had the fried pancake which was delicious , the fish steamboat we had there was tasty , one of the shops was Michelin star for beef tartare with raw egg on top , live octopus . "
Fine but we could not eat anything,"Having grown up in Western countries, we could not eat anything there. Lots of interns and food we are not used to. Maybe good for local Asian."
If you can sew-this is the place!,"This market is mainly fabric, linens, Korean Hanbok outifts and housewares. The food vendors are in the center of the market. There is row of all Bibimbap with heaping bowls of vegetables. Then there are rows or vendors serving chicken feet, rice cake, kimbap and soup. The prices were reasonable and the food was hot. We tried just about everything. You could probably find just about any fabric here, even for suits. Bring cash for the food."
"Great market, MUST eat beef tartare and live octopus!","This market offers both foods and garments, you'll realize most of the food vendors here offer almost the same food, and when you're here there's a few food you must try here, that is the beef tartare and live octopus cuts.for beef tartare, go to that restaurant that slices their beef fresh, you can see from outside the window, this restaurant serve live octopus as well."
Lack of variation,"Tourists would be able to find some local, delicious and cheap Korean style food here. However, the stands in the market basically all sell the same thing and it's lack of variation. "
Quick lunch ,A market for food and fabric incredible large area be ready to walk should you arrive by bus! The food choices are huge good quality but like often before street food does not mean cheap in Seoul! We had some of their famous mung bean pancake' was ok but tasted better before' plus rice cake on slice sauce' same comment for that dish' the area was busy and the staff was a little short on temper at the first location! We moved on to sample the blood sausage and a spicy stew of offal meat both brilliant' one dines on small wooden benches out of plastic cups' we stopped with this the dumpling and noodle soup will have to wait until we return
Great place for food but that's about it...,"Great place for Korean local foods. Lots of stalls all selling similar food items. Aside from that, not much is worth visiting and I believe most tourists come here just for the food, as we didn't see people checking out the stores that're lined around the whole market. "
Really Fun,"This is a wholesale market. You can buy really beitiful traditional bedding, fabric, Hanboks that are the traditional Korean Dresses. The color are incredible and beutiful. You can savor cheap street food, loke gimbap, jokbal,bindaetteok and more."
Go if you like food,"I asked the hotel for a market to see and take photos and they recommended Gwangjang market. The market has food shots - seafood, beef, pickles etc. But the best part is a the center it has many food stands where you can get various Korean dishes - spicy rice cake, fish cakes, pajun pancakes etc. It was super cold when I was there but the benches are heated. It is all open air. I had a good time there."
Food food,"This market is one of best place in our trip, people in market so friendly and I can eat almost all the street food of Seoul in this place. I will come back to there place if I go to Seoul again"
Local market with lots of food and souvenirs 本地小吃手信市場,Nice food and souvenir shops. The souvenir shop owner is very nice to let us try everything before we buy. The price is fair. The most popular snacks is the green bean pancake and rice roll. Worth to try. 手信店可以試吃後才買，價格便宜。值得一試的小吃有炸綠豆餅和麻藥飯卷。
A traditional street market in Seoul,"This is a market over a hundred years old. Inside there are many shops selling Korean traditional food and you can sit there to enjoy the tasty food like kimbap, dumpling, seafood etc. They use electric cushion so that u wouldn’t feel cold. "
Delicious pancakes,The food stalls here sell about the same items. A must try is the pancakes at a corner sit-down eatery near the entrance. You'll have to wait in line there and all the customers eat that dish!
you have to go there at night!,"It was so cool place. I've been there for a while. I love there foods and vibes : ) I think there is perfect place to feel the traditional market of Korea.I've visit Gwanghwamoon, insadong and Gwangjang market. those Foods are pretty cheap and delicious. Acually I've been visited few years ago in Summer. It was so hot ....... so it would be better to visit in Winter.you can also buy so many kinds of Souvenir in there. Have fun and enjoy that place"
Local Foods,"You can choose various Korean local dishes under a comfortable market environment. Recommend Korean style maki (Gimbab), vegetable pancake (Bindaeddeok) and Korean style sausage (Soondae)."
"Local food, worth to try","We visited this place at dinner time. This market offers a lot of local foods, from fried food, gimbap, oden, rice cake, sundae, and many more. The price is around 3000 to 5000 won. Be sure to sit on their stalls and point the menu that you want to eat. Otherwise they will give you a lot of foods, including the things that you don't order. To enter the food's section, you can take exit 8 from Jongno 5-ga station. "
Good food and atmosphere ,"Enjoyed some mung bean pancakes with some alcohol which made for a memorable meal. Shops sold the same stuff - the usual street food fare like pancakes, kimbap, fish cakes, etc. "
Perfect Local Market for Foodies!,"There were so many stalls to choose from, but honestly they all look about the same. We choose 2 stall that had some locals sitting down, and ordered quite a few dishes including blood sausage, narcotic gimbaps, japchae, bibimbip, and mandu.Everything was delicious except for the japchae (which was flavorless). Be sure to double-confirm what you order with the ladies manning the stall though, as we were half-forced to eat something we didn't order in the first place (apparently she asked us in Korean, and we had unknowingly agreed to). If you are a foodie visiting Seoul, Gwangjang Market is a must-visit!"
good place for korean style,"this is the good place to eat the special Korean food, such as fresh octopus, Korean traditional noodle, Korean green bean cake, rice roll extra...... this place very closed to the subway and easy to find. And this place also have some other Korean food like kimchi and Korean style stuff. this place very interesting . I suggest if you have time must go here.. ................"
Crazy market,"One of our Korean friends took us Gwangjang Market. It was an interesting place to be =) You can try to eat live octopus, boiled bugs or just watch those who are eating them. There are so many souvenir shops.There are also plenty of cheap textile shops but quailty seemed poor to me. If you want to go where locals go, this is your place"
Not a filthy market,"Took the subway to this place. We enjoyed our visit here so much. We ate with the locals, we ordered Bibimbap rice , korean ramen and mandu and ate it in a crowded food stall where you sit side by side on a long bench. It was fun. We bought from every vendor we saw like the jap chae, mung bean cakes, gimbap, strawberries and rice juice. My daughter fancied the Korean made comforter and we ended up buying one. The korean ginseng is cheaper here so I bought some as well. If you are determined to buy yourself a hanbok better buy it here. They have different designs and sizes. Surprisingly, this market smells good and is not filthy for a fact that fresh and cooked food is sold at every corner. Our tummies and our shopping bags were full on our way home. "
A Bit Disappointed,"Long for eating from food stalls but it was way too cold to eat in the market. It is not a covered market and it was under minus 10 degrees. Couldn't enjoy anything with masks, scarf and thick jackets on. Only stayed for a while and left with some disappointment. Be prepared if you com here during the winter."
Cheap finds!,"We were able to buy cheap luggages, shirts and sweaters for cheaper price than when you buy somewhere else, it's also in great quality! WIN WIN! TIP: You should go here on your first day in SoKo, especially if you're looking for cheap sweaters and stuff. And go here if you wanna buy souvenirs and Kpop items. "
Love the market atmosphere,"First time coming here to the market with the family. Love the whole market atmosphere. See all the food carts, especially the ahjummas selling bindaetteok. You can find all sort of food here, knick-knacks, souvenirs, and even clothes (at night). "
A little pearl in Seoul,"A must-go place if you are traveling to Seoul. The market offers great variety of textiles, spices, supplies but especially and most importantly.. food! A lot of local food by korean aunties, that are super nice. Many stalls actually sell the same stuff, but you can just try randomly. Not necessarily the stall with more people is the best! You can just walk and wander around while you eat different food! "
Stalls mostly closed on Sunday,Most of the stalls were closed when we went on a Sunday morning around 10am. So it was rather quiet and didn’t really get to experience the real market atmosphere. The food stalls were open so we tried their mung bean pancake. Seems that different stalls sold different kinds. Try the Gimbap too! There were some stalls that sold kimchi that you can vacuum pack to bring back to your own country:) 
Traditional market,"This is the traditional market where it have variety of foods, drinks, snacks, souvenirs, dresses and etc. Must try their mung bean pancake. We bought a lot of seaweeds and nuts as souvenirs from here. Some of the owner speak Chinese and English as well."
A market for ordinary people,"A market for ordinary people,many kinds of traditional food and everything in this market with lower price"
Colorful native Korean costumes,"This is one stop I really enjoyed, the market was quite extensive with lots of stores selling Korean dresses, souvenirs, trinkets, food stuff and lots more. And a great thing happened!!!! There where English speaking tourist aids in the market to help you figure out the lay out!"
"Sight, sound and smell of a authentic market","This is as authentic a market in Seoul as it can possibly can be. That it has become a tourist attraction with its own dedicated team of official guides is proof that this is no ordinary place despite its very ordinary setup. Plenty of stalls to get your food, drink, souvenirs, fabrics and, our favourite item, the almond nuts. The shopkeepers are a pleasant bunch, and they'll even throw you a special off-the-shelf item if you buy a lot (which we did) and they are, surprise, open to a bit of bargaining. But I suppose its because we're tourists."
Authentic for food and hanbok fabrics,"There are various markets around town, and you should visit several to see the differences. This one has lots of authentic food stalls and fabric stores selling hanbok fabrics. You can purchase clothing and coats here (be sure to bargain), as well as quilted slippers, bags, and vests. Worthwhile to see!"
Great market - buy your honey butter nuts here!,"Great market, we went there to grab some food (kimbap/ bindaeteok etc.) and had a great time - you basically sit in front of the little stalls and eat and go. After that, we walked around and there were many stalls selling souvenirs (seaweed/ honey butter nuts/ ginseng extract) and bought a few things. The stall owners don't really speak English/ Chinese, but communication was alright. The price of honey butter nuts here was definitely cheaper than in Myeongdong"
Traditional Korean Market ,"This is one of the oldest traditional market in Seoul, and best place for tourist to come here for the korean street food. Bindaetteok (mung bean pancakes), Hotteok (pancakes with brown sugar filling), Tteokbokki (stir fried rice cakes), Gimbap (rice roll), Sundae (Korean Sausage) are few “must eat” food in this traditional market which you should not miss. It’s a place for you to experience local eating culture, and it’s conveniently located Exit 8 or 9 of the Subway Jongno-5 station."
Great food and an authentic experience!,"It's amazing to get lost in the stalls of this market! So many food options from exotic to tame. The stalls are mostly run by ladies and most make the same thing, with a few that serve other stuff like seafood. Lots of tteokbokki, soondae, gimbap, pajeon, etc. It's a bit overwhelming to decide which stall to go to, but try to look for one with locals eating there, usually a good sign!"
Best food stalls ,"Pretty much only came for the food. Many to choose from! I had to have the sundae, kimbap and bindaetok which were all amazing "
Fun market ,"If you are looking for a traditional cultural feel, this is the market to go to! Lots of interesting food stalls n food produce. Local Korea n products too!There are quite a few food stalls selling live octopus dish! Fun place to visit n experience for all ages!"
A must-do for a foodie!,"I always stop by Gwangjang market whenever I'm in Korea (which is every year for the last 4 years.) Koreans are more reserved than friendly. So don't expect smiley vendors. To some, they might come out as rude. Out of the blue, I had one old lady server who stopped by my table, grabbed and poured my 1/8 cup of sesame oil/salt and pepper on my dish--without a hi/smile/nothing. It might look rude but it's more motherly. She's just showing you how to eat it. You can sit on any vacant seats. Order up. It's not expensive. Beware of the boneless chicken feet. It's seasoned like fire chicken/불닭. It will set your mouth on fire. This market is also famous for bindaetteok/빈대떡/mung bean pancakes--crunchy, savory, and delicious with rice wine or beer or soju. I also tried fresh octopus. They wiggle and might get stuck in your throat, so chew like a mad man. Have fun! "
Worth a visit if you are looking for something price competitive,Got to this place to look for winter wear. We ended up with a big bag stuffed with winter wears all for just less then $200!
More than can imagine or do,"Please try not to rush through. Enjoy the sights, sounds, people, and atmosphere. Found this excellent booth with snacks to bring home. Sorry, I can't help you find it. The ahjumma was the bomb."
traditional food,This place is for people that enjoy traditional Korean dishes in a street style dining style. My favorite is cucumber kimchee but they're are many unique dishes to explore.
Food junkies heaven,"This place if absolutely a must see for food lovers. Enjoyed by locals and tourists, this place is always swarmed. We enjoyed kimbap, odeng, bibimbap, fresh made noodles, bindaetteok (at the center of the cross roads). Many locals were additionally queuing for hotteok, so we decided to get that too. Absolutely loved this place; research youtube for the best stands."
Must visit at least once,"It is a market frequented by locals and tourists, I was told. There are many food stalls to try many types of Korean foods, which is a good thing if you are travelling solo. There are also stalls selling Korean snacks and souvenir."
Lots of hawker food here,We went there during lunch time and we were surprised for a number of hawker food at there. You can try the famous live octopus here if want.
"Food prices are expensive, not so hygenic but fresh Kimchi is good......","This is a ""tourists"" market with tourists prices to match. You see mostly tourists eating at the many food stalls ( & buying at the shops). Food prices here in particular are indeed Expensive & taste not that great - although it is supposedly to be a local market. And the environment & stalls areas are not very clean/ hygienic. The food prices here are about the same or higher than those in the various nicer shopping streets cafes/ food outlets. Considering this is a humble market setting & environment , prices are without doubt expensive.Come here for the experience if first time. We come here in every visit - not to patronise the expensive ""local market food stalls.""But to buy delicacies like fresh Kimchi & anchovies. Freshly made Kimchis are very different from those sold prepacked in supermarts.An elderly lady stall specialises in making this fresh Kimchi. A vacuum-pack of 1kg cost W10,000."
KOREAN SILK,High quality korean silk. go straight to Hyun Woo Silk. bring your credit cards and cash. splurge. it's cheaper than in KL
Gwangjang Market.,"An impressive market and well worth visiting if you want to get the feel of a real Korean market, or are looking for souvenirs of any description."
Must go for foods at this traditional market,"We took subway to Gwangjang Market. We love this traditional market cos you can sit right in front of their stall enjoying foods, beer & atmosphere. Majority of their stalls selling same foods like pancake, live fresh octopus, blood sausage, Korea traditional fishcake & a lot more. They also have restaurants there too but I still prefer stalls in the middle of the walkway. "
Expensive Mistake,Went to try all the food. Got pulled in a restaurant offering korean pancakes. Mistake letting the staff choose the stuff. Large portions and charge the earth. Think they pretend they did not understand when we ask for small portions. Eat at the stalls.
Not my type of food and dirty environment,We went here to eat dinner. We were surprised that the area is dirty. It smells as well. We had to go around several times to find a clean restaurant. Food was not to our liking. 
Go for the food at this traditional market,"This is another well known traditional market but the goods offered are much the same as any other market. the real draw is the food which will be quite exotic to most - I saw ""drug octopus"" and ""Dog Meat Soup"" amongst the very big emphasis on seafood."
Old market with great snacks ,"Subway to Jongno 5-ga Station (Seoul Subway Line 1), Exit 8 OREuljiro 4-ga Station (Seoul Subway Line 2 & 5), Exit 4. There will be tourist guide personnel in red outfit patrolling the place. Stop them for directions if you need. There will always be 2 walking together; 1 speaks Mandarin and the other English.No need to worry which entrance or gate you are going in, as the one place is not really that big and it's interlinked. We visited the 2 famous stalls highly raved for their Gimbak (rice roll aka japanese maki) and Bindaettok (fried pancake). You can get bonchan or side dishes there. They help to wrap them in boxes and triple wrapped in cling wrap. Prices is quite competitive and varieties are quite standard. If you want more varieties, can get from Lotte supermarket and prices are quite close. "
Local market,You can get all sorts of Korean local street food here. We bought snacks and souvenirs at pretty low price in this market. Recommended for those who would like to get some Korean souvenirs for their loved ones.
Amazing. Must see. Must eat. ,"This was by far the best part of our trip. It’s an outdoor market where you eat local food, drink local beer, and have soju.The food vendors are lovely, friendly and fun. We tried almost everything and it was all amazing.The market has little souvenirs you can buy around the center as well as fresh food market. The other side is purely textiles.The food vendors are right in the center so you can’t miss them. "
Most traditional,"I think this was the most traditional market but I was quite disappointed. I went on a thursday night around 6pm but 75% of it seemed to be closed down. There were vast rows of food stalls broken up into sections where they all sell the exact same thing. For me, I enjoy going to a market so I can see a vast variety of foods and try different things like at a buffet. I had one of those fried mungbean cakes and then left."
The perfect place to experience traditional Korean market,"There are many shops in this market, fruit stalls, vegetable stalls, clothings, bags, dried food products, traditional Korean wedding sweets, kimchi, shoes and culinary. There are also food stalls selling traditional Korean food. Most of the shop owners speak very limited English, food stalls menu has English translation on them. "
Loads of food stalls and I got to try Soondae,"It's a great bustling market and in a central alley has loads of places to try street foods. I'd been meaning to try Soondae (a kind of blood sausage with glass noodles in it and served with liver) and got my chance here. It was okay if you're into black pudding, which I am. Aside from that there is every other well-known street food on offer and it's a great place to get a feel for these. There's an excellent juice stall at the southern entrance which did an excellent kale, apple, banana, and pineapple smoothie too."
"Street food, textile and korea grocery","We came to the market primarily for street food. There are many food vendors selling similar things: mung bean pancake, rice cake, pork leg, octopus snack etc. The place was very crowded and the space was quite tight. A lot of the owner seem to be able to speak very little English and some Mandarin. We just picked the stalks with most people, assuming that they were better. Food was ok, and on the spicy and salty side. Mung bean pancake was good. It was greasy but we shared it among 4 people, so no big deal. We also strolled along the alleys. Most of the stores sell textile, seafood, kimchi and some traditional Korean food. In the middle of the market (not the food area), there were 2 people wearing the red uniform with an ""i"" bag. They were the ""information center"". They can answer any questions about the area.I don't see any public washroom there. If you see the information dual, you cna ask them."
CHEAP SNACKS,"For those of you who are looking to buy cheap snacks and souvenirs, this is the place to be. The famous honey butter almonds only cost 5,000 Won here VS 7,500 Won in Myeongdong. I'm so glad I went here because I hoarded snacks and was able to save a lot of money. The food was good too!!!! "
Go hungry to sample traditional foods,"This huge market gives a traditional look at Korean foods, clothing, fabrics, notions---so many items that one can spend an entire day at Gwangang or other markets in Korea. Go hungry so you can sample a variety of foods. This market had beautiful hanboks--traditional Korean dress. The children's clothes and adornments were especially charming."
Mainly traditional food stores,"Other than a few overrated street food stores, the rest is just shops selling traditional Korean food, such as Kimchi and dried seafood."
Try traditional korean food,I'd try all the food there if I had the stomach capacity. Quiet in the morning and not crowded at all so you can enjoy a meal in peace. 
Crowded!! Cheap seafood.,"Interesting to see the crowd if you dare to brave it. We managed to find seats at a stall that sold seafood. Very cheap! Sine we were not into shopping, there was nothing else except to expert the place and eat something from there."
All the food stalls sell the same items ,Seriously it was as if they were all selling the same thing. Very cramped and busy. Some of the food stunk. It was however a unique experience. But I feel there's far better food markets in Seoul. Metro exit 7
Great food experience ,Wow what a great spot. The variety of food was great. I had Bibimbap and a cold beer. Apart from food there are so many other stalls there as well. 
food market at night,many kinds of streetfood to eat. Really crowded at weekend. Should go a bit early. Really close to Cheonggyecheon Stream. 
Late night food,"Perfect for some late night food delicates, the usual market is open just till 8 pm, but the food stalls are open much longer..."
Korea traditional Market,There's alot of food! And it is pretty delicious. Most of the stores there can speak chinese. The food portion are pretty big too. So it might be better if you go in a large group and order a variety of dishes. There's only 2 of us so we didn't manage to order alot as we are afraid that we couldn't finish it. Love the food. Would love to go there again.
Food and Fabric,"This place is impressive if you're up for some super traditional hawker style food set ups. Very fun to see people sitting around eating noodles and different dishes. We went when we weren't hungry so we didn't eat anything, but it was interesting to see none the less. I would recommend to check this place out for a meal, otherwise, I'd pass. The fabric was nothing to see unless you want some dress made or something. "
Have to visit the market - have to experience it,"We love visiting the market - with all of the stores, food vendors, and people. One can easily get lost in the market (my companion who had been there several times just got lost after using the rest room), so best to have a plan if you get separated. If you are looking for kitchenware, hanbok, clothing, souvenirs, bedding, or just some great food, this is your place to experience some great Korean culture. We went upstairs into the Gwangjang hanbok market and ordered custom made clothing. We highly recommend this place. The smells of some of the foods might be challenging to foreigners. Just a head's up."
korean traditional market,"Gwangjang Market, is a traditional street market and it one of the oldest market in Korea.Also,It popular market.Some area in this market dirty and with Awful smell .It is good place to buy korean traditional clothes Hondbok. Also,It contain food court.It tourist spot.The bad thing is Bad Smell in the market."
Place to watch and try various genuine Korean tastes,"Though this is well-known to tourists, foods here aren't that touristic.As most visitors are aware of, the highlight of this market is to eat. And tourists can easily have dishes sitting next to common old generations of local people.Having lots of menus in open spaces, foreign visitors are going to enjoy watching and won't have much difficulties to pick what to try. Prices aren't high either.In addition, there are volunteers ready to help."
Nice Market To Know Korean Better,"There is a saying if you wanted to know about one country, then go to their market. That's true. If you wanted to know more about Korean lifestyle, then go to Gwajang Market. You can enjoy all the traditional and daily food they ever have after work. Try every special dish while enjoying talking with the local."
WOW! Amazing food,"If you are travelling alone, or not alone, this is the best place to go to eat. Multiple food stands that you can just walk up to and point. Food is cheap and delicious. Excellent place to taste local food. "
Lots of amazing street food!,"This is a traditional Korean market that sells a whole range of items, from fabric to food to groceries.Highly recommend the Korean dumplings (mandoo), sushi rolls and especially the fried mung bean pancake! That is a must try! You can easily have enough food for your lunch/dinner there, so be sure to go there on an empty stomach!In winter, some of the stalls have heated seats, which is a nice touch."
food galore!,"your head will spin at the sheer amount of food options in this place! it's very much alive and buzzing at night, with tourists and locals alike. the lovely ahjummas will try to rival each other to get your attention, walk around to decide which one tickle your fancy. loved the kimbap, look for a stall in a corner with Running Man poster plastered on the wall :)"
Mung bean pancake...,"...and then nothing else! They're simply delicious but absolutely swimming in oil. If you're older than 20, don't try and eat one o your own. But just the plain pancake was excellent.Lovely place to wander round and look at traditional shops doing everything from metalwork, tailoring and selling fresh fish,."
Good Gwangjang,"This is one of the more touristy spots. Lots of Korean friends and Seoul natives said they'd never been there before. There are dozens of food spots - friends told me to always go to/wait for shops that are packed, as those are often the ones with the best dishes. It's definitely easier to go with a Korean-Speaking friend (not as English-accessible as other markets and neighborhoods)."
Too crowded ,It is kind of dirty and always crowded. Most of foods are cheap. ($2-5) some foods are not. Don't expect clean dishes. 
Exploring the local food,"Gwangjang market is the real local food market you can find in Seoul, Heart of capital!.The market is clean and well organize. 70% of the owner is the elderly people that can prove enough how long this market run!Recommending : RAW Octopus, TOKBOKKI and else(many shop sells the same things)"
We came for the food!,"A short walk from out hotel, we wandered around here for about an hour tasting and eating many different foods. A great place for the food!"
Great atmosphere,We entered the market from the west entrance and found ourselves in the real deep end of the local market. Got to see the shopkeepers having lunch in between piles of merchandise. Got a map of the Kwangjan (Gwanjang) Market from helpful guides for tourists stationed at the market. Proceeded to the section on the eastern side with food stalls and found a great bindaetteok eatery. Would love to return to try some more local fare the next time we are in Seoul.
traditional fun,an area full of little shops and smiling faces for buying traditional and touristy items. Plenty of eats as well.
Bustling market -- must eat mung bean pancake,"Went there to experience the local market and of course, food! There were many stalls are selling the same things and the ajummas would call out to you. Look out for the stalls with celebrity photos and visits by TV stations. Best part was the mung bean pancake, so delicious! And sikhye which is a sweet rice punch drink!Snacks such as honey butter almonds and seaweed are cheaper than in Lotte Mart."
Great place for a cultural experience!,"One of the oldest traditional markets in Seoul. Street food galore! They are famous for their mungbean pancakes & the mayak kimbap (minature sushi rolls). There is no other place I would go for mungbean pancakes. In addition they sell many In addition to food, they sell a large variety of inexpensive goods. Sometimes we found that the souvenirs are less expensive here than Namdaemun. "
"Food, food everywhere!",This is a great market in Seoul. You can basically enjoy a wide variety of Korean street foods in one place. It's not expensive and you get to see the most popular snacks in one place. The bindeteok is a Korean mung bean pancake which they grind on the spot and fry. The visual is amazing. Must go.
You should visit this place!,"Apart from being promoted as one of the traditional market you have to visit, this place is really worth your time! You can find Korean delicacies from street foods to a full course meal, Korean snacks, hanbok shops, clothes shops, medicine shops, wide ranges of Kimchi, seafoods, and Korean souvenirs at bargain price. Especially for food, you should try the market's signature foods including makjang kimbab, bindaetteok, tteokbokki, nakji, sundae, and red bean porridge. The best time to visit is in the afternoon. There are food stalls with similar foods but if you have time for some researches, you can try to find the best, the oldest and legend one among them to taste the best delicacies."
Clorful old market,come here in the evenings and eat at the food stalls. It is an experience with almost no tourists and local food and next to no english speakers. I enjoyed it.
Delicious treats to be had at this night market,"Gwangjang Market is a short walk from Jongno-5 station. At night, it’s mainly the food stalls that are open. The market was really busy; many Seoulites out and about on a Saturday night. We were hoping to try the bindaetteok (mung bean pancakes), but the queues were incredibly long, so we selected a stall where we had tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes), mayak kimbap (Korean-style nori rolls) and japchae (vermicelli noodles). The lady running the stall was lovely and the food was delicious."
Night Market,"We came here later in the evening for some dinner. It wasn't very busy, as I think the shops and stuff are mostly only open during the day, but the majority of the food stalls were still going pretty strong. We walked around the whole thing (didn't take too long) before we decided on a place. Keep in mind this isn't exactly the ""grab and go"" kind of street food. You can move around and try different things if you want, but in these types of markets I prefer to just find a place to sit down and enjoy myself for a bit. The stalls are generally more like little stationary outdoor kitchens (kinda all adjacent to each other) with benches in front for seating. Unfortunately my Korean is horrible so I don't remember the names of what we had, but we sat down at a stall and had some dumpling soup and a spicy cold noodle salad which we'd had at a couple different spots around Korea. The stall owner seemed super concerned about our ability to handle the spice level of the salad, but it was similar in spice level to to a pretty spicy kimchi, so it wasn't too bad for us. If you like to eat a lot of Thai or Indian food (and therefore probably have a tolerance for a bit of spice), you should look for it and try it because it's delicious. It basically is cold rice noodles served with a spicy sauce and a bunch of veggies. The dumplings were good too, it was a nice soup to have on a chilly night when you're sitting outside eating. A group of middle-aged Koreans came and sat next to us while we were eating, and one of the guys was really friendly and shared his shochu with us."
Average Market,Lots of stores however doesn't feel very unique. Just textiles and food stalls. Not sure if I would come back.
Authentic Korean Food and Ajummas (...but ask the price first),"I came to Gwangjang with a couple of friends in the height of summer (early July), and the atmosphere was everything you would expect from an Asian food market. It was sweltering with only the occasional fan; it was dense with people bustling by to get their fill of kimbap; and it was very local. The general sentiment was that you were one of only a handful of foreigners wandering the place, and the local ajummas (Korean old ladies) were constantly trying to herd you to sit down and partake in their delicious, sesame-infused offerings so that they could prove to other onlookers that they were tourist friendly. Many of the workers and food purveyors spoke enough broken English for you to get your food and get it paid for without any problems, but it was kind of a moot point, because each little stall only had a handful of options, and they usually had their dishes set out so you could just point and ask for an order. There were little stalls that specialized in kimbap (some offer a tuna version, so just ask for ""cheum chi"" kimbap if you are tired of the garden variety), others ""japchae"" (Korean cold glass noodles with veggies), and others Korean potato pancakes with leeks (and a scrumptious onion sauce that you should ask for double portions of). Overall, the food was good and some of the food purveyors were really friendly, but others weren't. I made the idiotic mistake of forgetting to ask a stall owner how much a handful of mandu (Korean dumplings) was before the lady plopped them into the steamer. She told me afterwards that they were $5 (the standard street price is between $1-2). Luckily, she was sulking about something and forgot to get the mandu back out of the boiling water while I was eating the rest of my meal, so I left just after I finished my other entree. She could overcharge another customer for those later.Ladies like that are usually the exception. But, it's Seoul. It's fast paced, and people are churning out thousands of customers every Saturday night. It's not a perfect experience, it's just an experience. Sure, there are flies buzzing over some of the dishes, but this is what you're paying for. You could easily buy kimbap in a convenience store, or you could get the local atmosphere and eat your Korean pancake awkwardly while sitting over a plastic stool made for a toddler, surrounded by heaps of trash and excitable scads of locals. Just head over to Gwangjang."
an interesting place to visit,"well, it's a subway stop and a traditional market. most venders sell similar products/food so this place won't take you a long time to tour. stop by, grab some korean street food and go. across the street, there are many restaurants that specialize in chicken soup and grilled fish, so make sure you save enough stomach space for that."
Good location for local food and souvenir,"This is the location where locals shop. Massive place for clothes, food, street food, restaurants, souvenirs, snacks, etc. I headed to the Yukhoe shop and loved it. This is more a local market and I could only find maps/signs in Korean. Therefore locating specific locations within the market could be tricky. "
Lots of interesting local street food in a otherwise traditional Hanbok/ladies fashion market,"Went there with my family when we were in Seoul during June 2017. The nearest Subway station is ""Jongno 5(o)-ga station"" on the Dark Blue Line 1, which is 4 stops from Seoul Station or 1 stop from Dongdaemun station. Right after one take Exit 8 of Jongno 5(o)-ga station, beside is the Gwangjang Market. There is a main local food street alley that cut across this large Gwangjang marke, selling lots of interesting local food/snacks, ranging from inexpensive & popular Mung bean pancakes, Korean Kimbap (similar to Japanese Maki roll) to mid range traditional Jokbal (braised pig trotters) and to more expensive fresh seafoods like live Octopus & Abalone to go with the Korean Shoju. But what amazes me the most is the ""Ganjang Gejang"", a Korean traditional disk that uses raw... (you read me correctly...) 'raw' crabs/prawns/fish roes lightly marinated with either soyu-based sauce, or more spicy bean paste sauce. As for rest of Gangjang market, we saw lots of shops selling mainly traditional Hanbok, beddings materials and some ladies fashions. For those who have plans to visit/ or have visited Dongdaemun (1 subway stop away), could perhaps consider sparing some time (around 2 hours) and some space (in your stomach) to check out this interesting Gwangjang market."
Food market,"Gwangjang Market is a traditional market in Seoul.you can go by subway till Jongno 5 ga,exit 12..and cross the road.In this market,they sell various food..but i think it's similar from 1 stall to another..And you can buy snacks here..peanuts etc"
Delicious light evening meal,"Came here Saturday evening with friends to try the famous mung bean pancakes. We ended up making our way around the market trying mini kimbaps, japchae, tteokbokki, and the mung bean pancakes from different stalls. Everything we tried was delicious. The only reason I give it 4 stars is that other food markets I've been to have more variety. Definitely worth a visit though for the food and local vibe! "
interesting local market,Locals come here for dinner and the food served here in the open stalls is catered to the local taste-buds. Definitely worth a try and the experience.
"Nice markets, foods pricey","Nice markets, it was huge and lots of entrance, you can find almost everything local. The foods abit on the pricier side."
Great experience and photos ,"This market has everything but the food alley towards the eastern end is the main draw card for visitors which is vibrant and full of colour. A wide variety of fish, vegetables and meat on offer mostly deep fried. We tried the pancakes which were delicious albeit a little oily.Easy walk to either DDP or Jongmyo.Thanks for the vote if you found this review helpful."
Interesting location for traditional Korea culture,"Interesting location for traditional Korea culture, you can buy hanbok from this place price depending on the detailed of the hanbok chosen "
Delicious food and crowded with local people ,"This market is famous for delicious food street, especially raw meat. I enjoyed some foods here and everything is so affordable price."
Lots of food,I love to explore and experience the culture of the country I visit. This market was so so nice to visit. Not many tourists....lots of Koreans eating and chatting. Old women cooking korean food. You just sit anywhere you like and eat what seems delicious. If you love markets....food...and new tastes....this market is a must. I warmly recommend this market!! I lived it!I was a bit hard to find but that was bcuz I got lost. Ask ppl and they will show you the directions. It's near the canal and have metro near it. I was on the streets and was looking g for something else initial and got lost. But if you start with visiting this market it's easy to find if you follow the map 
Food and Souvenir Galore,Indulge in delicious local food with the locals.Indulge in shopping their local foodstuff and souvenir.This is definitely a great place to absorb the Korean culture.
Probably the best Market I have been in Korea - BUT MENU is hard to find,"Great place to go as they have many street food along the market. The only problem is, they might not be able to speak English and will be hard to order (pricing is not listed well so better ask before ordering)."
Great market to discover Korean street food,"You can discover in this market many Korean street food such as mandus, kimchi, gimbap (Korean rice rolls)..."
Worth it just for the pancakes!,"A busy Asian market: crowded, noisy, with unfamiliar items, but that's part of the experience of going!The highlight was definitely the mung bean pancake. The stall we ate at was in the middle of intersecting paths - yum"
Trying a local food center,"When I was there, It's about dinner time (5PM). Shops on the main street were closed, but the food streets were very crowed with tourists and residents who were having meal with their familiars. Bibimbab, Gimbab, variouse fried-pancakes and more like to serve for everyone even fresh seafood (OMG). Just visit there in the afternoon, you will find thing are interesting than my experience"
Food rather than Shopping,"If you are looking for a place for shopping, it may not be a good choice as it is mainly a fabric market, with limited shops selling seafood, snack, and fruits. However, near the Eastern gate, there are loads of shops selling traditional food such as the raw octopus, and traditional noodle. Some oof them provided English and Chinese menu. Better compare the price before sitting down as the price are quite different in different shops."
Market for bibimbap and pancakes,"A big market for bibimbap, pancakes, cut-noodles, japchae, Chilli rice cakes etc. English menu (small prints) are hung up at the front of the stalls. Be careful to read the menu.. we saw one that says dog meat. The market is also good for getting souvenirs at a cheaper rate than myeongdong or namdaemun. If you like to get fresh ginseng or kimchi, you can find these there too. We bought fresh ginseng to attempt making samgyetang and the store wrapped it very nicely in baking sheets and then in plastic wrap. There is a large kitchenware store run by an elderly couple who speaks English. He introduce us to different grades of metal utensils and warns us against buying cheap & poor quality utensils made-for-tourists that can be found in the touristy areas. "
Tourist spot,A must-see tourist spot. Go there for breakfast. Line of stalls for people to sit there and eat. Traditional market for tourists and convenient from the station.
Amazing Fabrics,"Definitely worth a visit to this market even if you don't sew. Mainly sells fabrics, national costumes and great food.If staying in Seoul catch a taxi to the market, approx $8Aud."
Market food like the olden days,A traditional market with almost anything you want to live seafood. At first I was wanting to visit this place as it was featured on many tv programs. Got there and was greeted with a full stench of seafood market and crowds of people gathering in the middle eating trotter or some type of offals. then in the middle of the market things got really crowded. I managed to find a good spot in the middle of the market where they have tteokboki and hotteok and the famous Gimbab. All is good but after a while at the market I was really missing the comfort of a modern place and not getting bumped by every passerby. Food was great but you will need to bear with the other aromas around you after all it is a traditional market.
the place for night market food,"Get everything from hanboks to the most authentic Korean street foods such as jokbal, soondae and bindaeddeok. it's a wonderful throw back to the marketplace lifestyle that's been largely gentrified now in Seoul."
Lots to see and eat,"Go early in the morning before the crowds appear! You will not be disappointed. It was originally a market for clothings and related materials etc, but in the centre of the market is the food stalls. There are so many choices. Go to whichever one you fancy, sit on the bench in front of the stall and order. Eat with the locals - though I must say there are lots of tourists too. A good experience."
Traditional market where you can find everything,"It is an everyday market where you can enjoy food, fashion and everything at reasonable price. It is open almost all day long, usually from 9am to 23pm. Famous dishes include Soonhee's Bindaetteok (mung bean pancake) and mayak gimbap (mini Korean sushi rolls)."
Good place for your stomach,"3-5 mins walk from subway (Jongno 5-ga Station-Line 1), Exit 8. The food very nice and not expensive, as it considers street food varieties. You can see a lot of fruits, hanbok, cooking utensils, etc over here. There is a big stall selling all snacks, candy just at the entrance of the market."
A great market experience with none of the extreme push of other Asian Countries,We went there for an evening meal after doing the Stream. The traditional mung bean cakes (Bindaetteock) are a must if you have tried them before. We sampled other pancakes as well but did not match the valour of the Bindaetteock. As other commenters have said there are arguments with some people but it would not be a market without this.Pick a spot that has good sit down area - you will appreciate it after a long day and packed with Korean local. Be clear about what you want and there will be no problems.A kind thank you to the owner paves the way for next tourist.
Many local food that you would try,"When I reached there about 4-5PM, almost shops were closed. so, I go directly to the food zone. Local food shops are available and so crowded."
A place where there are many local food which you can eat on the street.,"A long street of items, mostly food stalls, selling more or less the same items here and there. Pick a store of your liking and eat with the locals over there. Some stores are more popular as they may have feature in blogs before, thus you may have to wait for a short period of time. If not, you are choose the lesser crowded store for a simple meal in the local way."
Rude service and less hygienic,"I went with my European friend who visited Korea for the first time to show him a Korean local market food. As soon as we got in the food section. people were luring us very loudly and kept forcing us to order. That was also quite annoying for us to decide the shop. My friend asked me a name of the food, so I just was watching without asking. Then the owner, understood English, said chicken and started to prepare the dish even we did not order nor seating, whatso ever. My friend didn't want to. So we walked. All of sudden, behind us , the lady started insulting, shouting us swering words in Korean! I was very very startled and offended. When we chose a shop nearby for a glass noodle, the owners were not nice either even if we ordered the dish. And kept us pushing order more dishes. It was around 10 pm after dinner, we went just for snacks, but most of ladies(owners) were rude, and very harsh! As far as I know, this spot has been quite famous and popular but with this kind of rudeness and ill-mannered ways, I have doubt about their longevity. When I tasted the food, it is below average taste. Of Course it is cheap food. I could also see some flies on the unwrapped food in the air. I wondered how these food will survive during the hot summer! They do not have any hygienic concept, I guess. I could see they do not clean their hands properly to serve after eating something. There are a few seating restaurants which are kind and nice with better food in this place, but I should have searched in advance and should come during the daytime. I do not recomend the open air shops to eat."
Visit is a must for foodie ,"A lot of traditional Korean food in the market with low price. There are three main streets in the market and lot of food trunks line up in the market. I like this place and go for food hunting every single time I go to Seoul. The ""ahchuma"" (the ladies in food trunk) are good enough to feed you. "
Good local food and experience,"May not be the cheapest but for sure brings a local flavour. Game for local food? This would be the convenient place as many are found. The Mungbean cakes are probably the most favourite by the crowds, around 4k each which is a decent portion for 2-3 people. Morning is crowded, noon or just after lunch time is better if you asked me."
Vibrant and exciting market,"Went to the clothes section first and the stalls were already packing up. Decided to venture further down and the food and wet market was thriving with activity. Many stalls were selling similar food, snacks and drinks so be sure to compare before buying. Try to have a meal in the market where Uig can sit on benches or small stools and see the ahjummas prepare the food in front of you. Though their English competency is poor, surprisingly most could speak Mandarin. I'd suggest you try to speak Mandarin if you can.Tip: get pre-packed samgyetang ingredients here. They include a large ginseng in them which would make great souvenirs to ppl who love to cook. Can't find them in e-mart, homeplus and other supermarkets "
Pretty fun - the food lanes are the most exciting part,"This is a fun market to spend an hour or two. It's not so big, there's no real need for one of the tourist maps. There are not many tourists if you come here around 11am. At around 1pm it gets busier.The market has a bunch of different sections. Selling kitchenware, clothes, fabrics etc. Most of these didn't really catch our attention. Some stalls are selling quite good and fresh looking fish and other seafood. But we were staying at a Hotel...so no need for that. By far the most interesting part are the food lanes. Even though many stalls are selling the same stuff it's still a feast for your eyes. If you love offals/organs you'll find some treats here. But also the typical ""pancakes/omeletts"" made out of mashed beans (deep-fried) which taste great. And countless soups/hot-pots with a huge array of different veggies. Places and tables here are small and quite limited. Some stalls packed....some quite empty. I guess the locals know more than us tourists.There is actually a 2nd floor...but nobody seems to wander around there unless you came here for something specific. A fun little market, but actually you only need to see the food section.If you have limited time only in Seoul and you only can visit one market, I would choose the Namdaemun Market. Bigger, better, more fun, more food, more stuff!Wanna know more about me and my trips? Check my profile."
A place to savour..,"Where can I start. Gwangjang market is like nothing you have seen before. Numerous food stalls and lots of friendly locals.You will need to be brave to sample what's on offer and its best to have a good look around first before you decide what goes on your plate!This place is very kind to your pocket, I spent a good couple of hours here and hardly spent anything. This is a must see place if you are travelling to Soeul."
FOOD!,"So much food to choose from. You can eat with the locals and it's cheap as well compared to other places. There is limited seating if you go during busy times. We mainly went to eat but saw the market stalls, and we did get lost but was so glad we found the food stalls."
Busy!,The Gwangjang market is quite large. It's basically a + sign extended very far in each direction. If you try to enter the market area from near the train station you will encounter a hug textile market and get lost in the process. I can't even explain how to navigate your way out of it.The food is very repetitive. You'll see the same thing 20 times so if you see something you like just sit down and eat.It was decent but not great. The novelty for me was how crazy busy it was and how quickly the staff work.Heaps of seafood so if you don't eat seafood you will struggle.Grab a hotteok outside on the street stalls before you leave if you can find it. Hotteok is the best.
Great tourist site!,"Gwangjang Market is a great cultural and food experience. Everything from knick knacks, beautiful clothes and blankets, and everything you can imagine to eat. So fun watching the cooking stalls prepping the food, and seeing all the interesting food. Great place for dumplings and pancakes. Wish I had all day to eat my way through this site."
Awesome Market - Textiles ,The best textile market. Many hand made farmers. You can be fitted and clothing seen for you. Seamstresses in the isle ways working and also in the shops. This is Hanbok haven!! 
Traditional Market ,Gwangjang Market is a traditional wet market in Korea. It has many hawkers selling local food and stuffs. Many people will go there for their food. It's really fun to walk one round in the market to see how the local hawkers doing business and what interesting food they have. A good experience and interesting place to visit !! 
Local Food Market,"This is their local fish and food market. They have lots of food and a fun experience to try it out. They have small seating area around the table. Interesting. We tried the clam soup, it was good. "
A must do whilst in Seoul,"My girlfriends and I recently visited Seoul and although I have been to Seoul numerous times before, I have never been to this market. We took the subway there and it was not difficult locating the market. We were hunting for good local food and found them at the bibimbap stall no. 39 where we ordered the famed dish along with some dumplings, octopus and chicken feet. I didn't fancy the chicken feet but my friends sang praises of it. In fact, we went to the same stall several days later and we ordered pretty much the same thing. Each dish was 5k Korean won.After tucking into the food, we went around hunting for local souvenirs. This can be found scattered all around the markets. In fact, many shops carry similar goods and all one would need to do is to find the best prices for the goods. Later on, we stopped to have one of the pancakes but it was huge and we could only finish half of it amongst the 5 of us ladies. You would need about half a day or slightly over that at least to do justice to this place. The market is only a short distance from the famous Dongdaemun market along with the many fashion malls. "
Giant market for clothings and foods,"We visited the market a couple of time to look around and purchased freshed fruits and vegies, dried seafoods, cloths and accessories. We didn't try any local foods as they are high in carbs. If you want to purchase Korean gifts and modern and traditional clothings items and cloths this place is highly recommended for variety and price. "
'twas a good deal,"I enjoyed my 10 am breakfast of hot bowl noodle dumpling soup in this market. I bought a lot of almond yogurt for me to bring home. The price is cheaper than the groceries. I had the pancake, kimbob and preserved octopus being bought by kilograms. I spent well my pasalubong budget money here. I will visit Gwangjang Market again when I come back."
A waste of Time,I loved this little Market. We went at night time so a lot of the stalls were shut except for the main eating market area! its very raw and local and awesome. Not much english going on but lots of menus with pictures. Everyone is super friendly and the food is very fresh. We had a bowl of dumplings and noodle soup. And of course some kimchi on the side 
A fun market,"We visited the market on a tour as we wanted to see some unique food. The market is very large and sells lots of local street food as well as fabrics. Some stalls are by hawkers. Others sell unique local dishes such as a local cod soup, stuffed squid, and mung bean pancakes. There are lots of food stores which sell dry goods and vegetables. Would be of particular interest to those who are not from Asia and not used to food stalls. "
All the things,"Has everything you'd want to buy in Seoul or all of Korea.Huge selection of food, both fresh and cooked.Really a must see place."
A must-go,"This rather small market is a definite Seoul Must-go-to place. Try Korean dishes along with the locals, and don't be shy in your choice of food: you'll be rewarded with the appreciation of the local guests, the curiosity of the stand cooks and an incredible palette of unusual tastes.(My favs were the seafood booths). The local pork rice sausage was also delicious."
A peek into the locals market,"Interesting place to visit. But don't be fooled by the aunties at the stall.. They will tell you to come forward (with hand gestures) and make you sit down and eat something from their stall. It is a kind gesture, so it seems hard to say no. "
Definitely Recommend.,"I have a weak spot for markets, especially ones with food. There is no shortage of that here! Actually came here twice over my weekend visit~ There are a lot of textiles and whatnot, but my focus was more on getting as much delicious and cheap food into my body as possible~! The lady vendors are very nice and engaging, also had a nice experience trying Sannakji here while the ladies were having their staff meal. Definitely recommend."
My favourite Seoul market,"Huuuuuuge. Well laid out with different sections for different products. The street food area was absolutely brilliant - very difficult to choose an option. Good for souvenirs, fish, groceries. Oh and traditional Hanbok costume."
"Bustling with people, both young and old","Lots to shop and eat but crazy crowded! We were pushed, grabbed and elbowed by the crowd, mainly the elderly ladies. Be prepared to brave the madness during weekends! Despite that we still enjoyed a scrumptious and authentic lunch over there. Bought some local goods and made our way out right after! "
Gastronomic tour at night Seoul,"It's kind of a traditional place to eat at night, street food everywhere, any kind of, delicious potato pancakes, blood sausages, kimpab, pork legs etc. the most popular there is raw beef with raw egg on the top - long lines of people could waiting for their turn outside. Also raw and alive octopus is very delicious here"
"Compact, bustling, genuine",This is not a typical tourist trap but a place locals come to shop so a great glimpse into everyday Korean life. All different types of stalls in a compact area selling everything from fabric & bedding to food & clothing.
Crazy busy ,My sole purpose coming here was to find some fabric to take home for my wife. She is constantly making crafty items for others and for sale. The place is quite busy and you have large selections of different foods to choose from. I did not think it was hard to get around however you are to step aside when viewing it you could be pushed on someone else. Lots of cheap eats here if you are on a budget. 
Good dinner option,The market is quite compact and easy to navigate around if you come at night time as all the shops have closed. Plenty of food options to choose from. There are small restaurants on the side but there are also market stalls in the middle of the market when you sit and eat in front of the sellers. Price is very reasonable to eat in one of the stalls and portion is quite big. Love the Korean blood sausage.
Interesting,"This place was interesting because it looked like a Korean version of the Philippines' Divisoria, and it was a bit fun to go circles in it but you'd definitely get lost if you're unfamiliar of the place."
Hidden gems for tourists ,"I was brought here by my Korean friend. The place was full of stalls selling korean daily food, and was busy serving mostly locals. They are open as a market during the day and turned into sort of like a food junction at night. Very interesting."
Local delicacies at its best!,"Went to Gwangjang market as part of the day tour I have booked myself for. For anyone who has never been to a live market, well this is the place you have to visit! Lots of stalls varying from sales of textiles to live seafood. Sit yourself down at any of the food stall to enjoy live octopus, freshly fried pancake or bimbibap make on the spot. This market used to be frequented by locals only and as more and more tourists requested to have a feel of the local lifestyle, Gwangjang market became a intersection for the curious tourists and local folks. "
Lot's of different food stalls ,"This is a great place to eat lots of different food like tempura, seafood and many other dishes. And compared to other places it's pretty cheap. Even our 2 small kids (2 and 6) loved the place and the food! We had a great time and experience. "
Local food and shopping,"This is a market where you find lot of local food and shopping options. You would not be able to find fashionable clothes but if you are shopping for your elderly folk at home, there's lots of options. Local food like mung bean pancake, live octopus, and blood sausage can also be found here. Some of the ajummas selling them can speak Chinese too. A must visit."
Great place to explore local culture,"This market was not too far from the subway station, less than 5 minutes I think. The market was big with 5 food alleys where we had dinner and found the dishes were delicious and cheap (of course!). Besides that, my family also tried a lot of different banchan (kimchi mostly) at various shops. This is a very great place to explore local culture and cuisine for those who visit Seoul for the first time like us!"
Food galore,This is just approximately 500m from the ibis Ambassador Seoul Dongdaemun Hotel. What a nice surprise!
"This market is super fun, especially meet a few very fun loving shop owner.","This market is by far the best one i have visited because of the people i met (shop owner). The one i like best is Mr Na Derk Yum (sorry did not get his shop name) a souvenir shop owner. He loves Abba and play their song always. He is a very funny guy, he dance the 70's moves for us and he know who is Joseph Schooling. (know where i am from, right?) He also gives discount and free gift. "
Great market food experience ,Great market food experience. Many stalls with tons of options. Recommend to keep orders small to try as many dishes as possible :)
Everything from hanbok to fish,This market sells everything. Busy even on a weekday. Don't use a stroller there as some of the aisles especially near the food stalls and linen section are really narrow. Good place if you want to buy souvenirs and hanboks. Many food stalls selling everything from pancakes to live octopus.
"I'm here just for food, and I'm satisfied","One of my friend want to try the ""Squiggling octopus"" he found on a documentary (and lots of youtube clip), so we looked for someplace local.We were here around 20am and the place is packed with people. Most food stalls has English menu, so language is not a problem. The food looks the same across various stalls, but that's not a problem for us since the is our first time anyway."
FOOD,Full of local and tourist who were on a food hunt. This is a place to go for some local food.Recommended to walk around before ordering as there are some stalls who had the same menu. Wish we could have the capacity to eat more as there is so many things to eat but we were full from just 3 types of food as the servings was huge.
Our Visit to Seoul,"WOW interest Market, A must see and visit. Food outlets flat out and market huge. Had a great sit down meal and enjoyed the ambience . Can catch the subway and or a 20 minute walk from our hotel next Chungmuro Station "
Market with eateries,"If you are daring then try the live octopus :-PReal Korean silk is KRW 25,000 ++ for 4 meters. Don't be fooled by the KRW 10,000 price tags. HWSK gives discount for Malaysians. Pathways are slightly narrow and there are some idiots that drive their motorbike through the market to deliver/transport. "
"Super Local, Vibrant Market","I enjoy walking through this market - all the varieties of food stalls, different types of seafood on display at fish vendors...all the locals are eating great local cuisine. "
Night market adventure,"I miss Asian market; particularly a traditional night market with lots of food stalls and fresh groceries. It was on top of my list to visit since I learned of it from a travel book. Sadly, I did not get to try any of the pancakes. Still, it is pure entertaining to people watch and enjoy the sight. I bought few dry food; and now realize that I probably could/should have bought a lot more! It was slightly overwhelming but fun. t would recommend anyone not to miss this experience."
Traditional Street Market South Korea ,"Looking for authentic Korean food, don't missed it to know more about South Korea at the oldest traditional street market, Gwangjang. "
A must,"Visit this market is a must if you will travel to Seoul. Many things to see, buy, eat, you will find that Korean people is kind."
Definite must go for cheap and delicious food,"I hit this place up everytime I visit Seoul. Most, if not all, of the food is delicious and affordable. My favourites would be the mayak kimball and mungbean pancakes. Some places even offer english menus, but pointing and gesturing works for ordering as well! Eating in a bustling market definitely adds to the experience, definitely not one you'll get from a typical restaurant."
Traditional market,"I'd rather say traditional food market cause I'm not a big fan of traditional stuff except for FOOD! If you happen to come here, please try the Bindaetteok (Mung Bean Pancake), it's quite oily but worth it. The crispiness and the texture, omg and the sauce (onion and soy sauce i think), I CANNOT. Besides, there's this raw seafood plater which is incredibly good! I would eat San nakji (Raw minor Octopus). A lot of people couldn't stand looking at it cause it's cut into smaller pieces and because they are raw, they're still wriggling and jiggling HAHAHA. But I love it. Go and try for yourselves."
Score great eats and cheap hanbok!,"Great beef tartare as well as some raw seafood and sashimi. They have other stuff like Korean sushi and pancakes, etc. Overall a very traditional market and definitely a must visit if you are looking for something a bit more original and traditional. I scored two kid hanboks for 30 bucks total and that price cannot be beat!"
Korean street food and traditional market!!,"Get your eyes full and stomach full of Korean food craving fulfilled here. Experience the madness of a traditional market with colorful kimchi, food wares and cheap stuff."
Food galore!,"This is the place to go to eat like the locals. There are stalls everywhere mainly set up through the middle of each long corridor with restaurants along the side. Each ""stall"" will cook their specialty for you. Price ranges between 5000 - 10000 won. It's communal seating and if you are there during winter, the seats are heated too!So many options that you won't know what to order. Best order and share from one stall and then move on to another. There are also other stalls which sells their side dishes, seafood, dried foods, cakes etc. Quite a good place to walk around. "
Must See,"Walking around in this area gives you an understanding of Seoul traditions. People are nice and not aggressive. Its a busy area, but a must see"
"Nice Market, Lots of Food","We came here on our 12 hour layover from LAX to Chiang Mai. I've never been to South Korea so I figured it would be a good chance to see a little of it for free. We took a 5 hour free tour from ICN which took us to a village and the market. I wanted to try Bulgogi in Korea so we found a place but it was just ok. Next we tried the dumplings and dumpling soup. These were better than the bulgogi, but we were full and couldn't try anything else."
Fabric Shopping,Love the bad set. Very sweet and comfy. The cotton were very cheap and affordable. here is where to get cheap souveniors
The Best Street Food Around! ,"This place is always a delight to visit! I have gone three times now. Once in the summer, fall, and even winter. When the heat is too much to bear it's nice to get a cold bowl of Namyeong and when's it's freezing in Korea hot tteokbokki always hits the spot. They even warm the benches for you in the winter. All in all the food is amazing and the atmosphere is fascinating. This is a must see and experience in Seoul! "
fabulous,"This is a great place to add to the itinerary during your stay in Seoul. It was very busy and a bit chaotic but a sign of a very good place when it comes to eating there. The food on offer was impeccable. We had the chance to try 'raw octopus' for 15,000 Won. Be prepared for crowds but well worth it"
Perfect for shopping,This is one of my favorite place to go every year when I visit to Korea. It is like time square in New York but all shopping center. There has many things to eat and buy. Specially night time is perfect time to visit. Highly recommend to stop by. 
Not recommended,"It used to be an interesting place but it was too exposed on media. Different kinds of food may look nice on t.v. but the taste wasnt that good. If it is on the way, it is ok to drop by, but no need to plan to visit. "
Eat and Eat and Eat,"Come hungry. We had a one day stopover in Seoul and chose this market for lunch. So glad we did. Fortunately we had taken in a historical morning walk and palace tour before we arrived because we were ready for lunch. Note: Walk the whole food sections before you sit down to eat. There is a wide variety of stalls and types of food. Pick the one, two or more that appeal to you most, then try something you have no idea what it is!. Ddeokbokki, bibimbap, kimchi, bindaetteok, pajeon, kimbap, jasaek goguma to name just a few. Some of the portions can be overwhelming so bring a friend, order a variety and share. After you have had your fill, finish walking the multiple lanes of stalls of local made wares, household goods, fabrics and anything else you could think of. Then grab some cookies and candies to take home for later after you have recovered. Be prepared for the crowds, it is a popular place and seats can be few."
This really should be in the top 10 attractions..,"I've had foreign friends visit this place multiple times and they have told me that nothing beat this experience. Especially the food here is very authentic as it is humble and can be a quite unique dining experience. It tends to get crowded and even for a person who hates being in crowded places can enjoy this place as it is a unique scene to see hundreds eat and drink during late nights. I recommend that no one neglects this special gem, it is truly a Korean dining and cultural attraction that will give you the first foot into this city. My personal recommendation is:Eating Nok Do Pancakes and Soju and Makguli at SooENae, which is located in the center of the market."
I just couldn't say NO to the street food,"I had some street food at Gwangjang Market in which I don't normally do because I have a bad stomach. The street food at Gwangjang was so tempting, I just couldn't say NO."
Mung bean pancake really nice!,"Market was easy to locate and took my family to try some mung bean pancake. As the only person in tm family to understand and speak korean (even though I am not korean) we then went to some stalls as I took my family to try market food. Went to a stall that served spicy rice cakes, japchae, odeng and various foods. I ordered the spicy rice cakes but the women gave me odeng instead and wouldn't take back the odeng even though we hadn't touched it. Was not impressed but had to have it and ordered the spicy rice cake elsewhere."
Various Streetfood,This is the place to be if you are feeling hungry near Dongdaemun. You will find lots of authentic korean food to fill your tummy.
Street style food,"Great place to try street style korean food. Many options, some are delicious. Cultural. Worth visiting at night time."
Vibrant and exciting market,"Went to the clothes section first and the stalls were already starting to close even though it was only around 6pm. Maybe it was because it was eve of Seollal. However, when we arrived at the market at ground floor, the place was bustling with activity. We enjoyed the street food and even sat down twice to enjoy pajeon and other various seafood with japchae at another stall. There were also many shops selling similar snacks and health foods such as ginseng. Their prices differ so don't buy at the first stall."
Eclectic mix,"I stumbled on this market quite by coincidence while just roaming. I tried the Kyoja here. This place was interesting enough to come twice - once by chance, and the other time by design. The second time, I looked at the other wares sold there and bought a neck pillow that had a case made from traditional fabric. This place is interesting, the storekeepers are very friendly, and it's a good place to just be."
eat and eat and eat,came to gwangjang market to eat and there are literally lots of food to eat. And they are all delicious! I tried tobboki (not sure how to write it) and gimbab. 
Umm...locals don't come here ,"Ugh! As a Korean, I feel so bad foreigners come here and have to eat fake, dirty, over-priced food. The market seems big, but when you look around you will realize most sellers sell similar food with same price. If I must recommend one market for you, i will guide you to either Tongin Market near by Gyeongbok palace or Mangwon Market near Hongdae. If you really really want to see what Gwangjang market looks like, just look. Don't try food here :( especially if you are trying street food for the first time."
Best market for street food,"I come here for breakfast every time I go to Seoul. Amazing street food guaranteed to fuel your whole day activities. Very friendly ahjummas if you speak Korean, but even if you don't, it's not very hard to explain to them what you want. The market is very neat and clean, not your typical Asian wet market."
So-so market,Majority of the food stores sells the same food. So there's not much variety of food to choose. Not that fantastic for me as the stores are half opened when i was there during lunch time. Would go back only when i don't have other place to go.
Korean street food mecca,"Gwangjang market is one of the oldest and the largest functioning market in South Korea with around 5000 vendors selling different things like food, textile, etc.Seriously, Gwangjang market is the culmination of the diverse and delicious flavors of Korean street food. There are plethora of food to choose from but don't miss their gimbap and tteokboki (rice cake in spicy sauce). With 20 USD worth of Korean money, you can get a nice lunch of your choice. Gwanjang market offered some of the best street food I have eaten so far. It's a mix of old and new, modern and traditional, all under one roof. As long as you keep your mind open to new flavor and taste, you will likely to enjoy your visit in this market. The market is clean and there are paid toilets (clean as well). Other than food, you can also find textile shops, even traditional medicine ingredients shops. Perfect place to get authentic Korean souvenirs with bargain price."
Make sure you try the food!!,"We came here twice in our visit just because the food is really good, although it does get busy and a little noisy."
Good exprience,"Good food, Good exprience. A lot of food to choose. It is a big market. A market in Seoul which you should NOT missed."
Interesting market,Went there to see local food and look around and ate a delicious dumpling soup with Kimchi with locals at stand #3 where they spoke enough english to help me and teach me how to eat things properly!
Old traditional market ,"When there for lunch. Street food - fish cake, red bean bun, green bean pancake, pork pancake etc. Lots of stalls selling dumpling soup. Walkable from the subway station. Lots of traditional shops selling pots & pans, mattress etc "
Don't bother eating here,"Interesting to visit but don't bother eating here. 99% of people eating there are tourists with about 95% tourists from PRC. We tried one stall and had fish cake in soup (KW3000) , pig intestines (KW10,000), rice cake in spicy sauce (KW2000), fried glass noodle (KW3000) and one bowl of rice. We were charged KW22.000. We couldn't figure out how it came to KW22,000. Did the bowl of rice cost KW4000!? We could have eaten better food in a proper restaurant for the same price. Definitely not worth the money for street food."
Foodie paradise,"We loved our foodie excursion at this market. There are different kinds of food to choose from. This is also the market that was featured in different variety shows like Running Man. This is a great place to eat local korean food, cheap and delicious! Of course be prepared to speak Korean as they don't speak english here! "
Be local at Gwangjang Market,This is a really good place to have your meal and taste local food. Some of the recommended food to try here are the pancakes and the dumpling which is located almost end of the street. This is also a good place to purchase food products and local tidbits.
Gwangjang Market,Easily accessible from the subway. Good place to eat but the much hyped tekbokki and pancakes are so so only and expensive. The mungbean pancakes are good. Some stores are very friendly. A must go place in Seoul.
Good food at night!,"We went only at night, when majority of the shops were closed. But the food street was open, many stalls selling similar foods. But it all tasted good. Helped that the food looked good as well!"
Tour of an old market ,Place of full visitors looking to try out the local food. Visited a stall which sold local food and Noddle soup was fantastic. There was never ending of customers who came and ate the stall especially for the vegetables pancake and bimbap. It was strange seating on a hot bench. There was another stall selling fresh seafood stew/soup (I think). The customers was given stools to seat outside the shop. It must be good as the local Koreans was not queuing for it. 
Go for lunch or dinner...,"Main purpose for coming to this market - dinner. At this place, one can sit down in the many stalls in front of the cooks, order and eat on the spot. The only reference that I got is to go for the stalls with the largest number of people. We bought the pancake and brought it with us as we sat down for the mandu (dumplings) - the stall owner said ""OK"". After dinner, we just walked around the various stalls selling souvenirs - bought the honey butter almonds and fresh pomegranate juice."
Strange and tasty food,"Got off at the wrong subway station but that's how fun adventures come about. We hit the almost empty market at around 10pm and followed the laughter and shouting and came across a whole range of stalls selling food (the happy sounds were from Koreans drinking soju, the national drink - gotta say, the Koreans do like a drink!). I tried food that I hadn't even hear of before: sea pineapple (an edible sea squirt - believe me, its more of a squirt than a pineapple; think slippery and slimy, and looking like an ugly squat alien cucumber, served as sashimi; only for the brave), sundae (made by boiling or steaming cow or pig's intestines that are stuffed with rice), tteokbokki: thick dumplings in a spicy sauce; boiled big heart, spongy and tart. And off we went into the night."
One of the best traditional markets in Seoul,"Gwangjang Market is one of my favourite places to explore in Seoul, also one of the oldest traditional markets in South Korea. At Gwangjang Market, you must try the Bindaetteok (Mung Bean Pancakes), a snack that's greatly loved by the locals. It goes down really well with Makgeolli (rice wine)!"
Real Korean local market & food,"Local Korean food in the street food atmosphere. Various type of Foods, seafood, steaming, hotpot or fried. Don't expect that you will sit in a nice restaurant because it will be just a bar seat, eat and go. Just pick one, the most long queue.There are also clothing and tourists stuffs available in the market."
Great fun,Spent 2 hours there.Tried ahujma pancake and live octopus. Local fruits distribution - grapes and strawberries 
For yuk-hoi,"visited there to try yuk-hoi(uncooked beef), but it's far too hyped and not worth it especially with that much of people and hassle."
"Street food, souvenir and more","Its a huge covered market with everything from street food to souvenir to fabric and more. If you can fit it in your schedule, its worth an hour or so strolling in it."
Definitely worth a visit,This market is in the middle of the oldest part of Seoul. There are many indoor and outdoor restaurants. The pancakes are the specialty. You can also browse the flea market type stalls selling anything from food to clothing. 
great street food choices in busy market used by locals,"Heaps of stalls, cheap food. It ranges from the confrontational live octopus kind to straightforward vegetarian friendly options. Its cooked fresh, the locals are happy to squeeze up and make room for you, nobody minds if you don't speak Korean. I had a ball."
Visiting," In the three-month summer holiday vacation, I travelled to Seoul, which is the capital of Korea. Korea is a country that gathers different kinds of snacks and food. This time my friend takes me to a traditional market of Korea which called Gwangjang Market. We go there by subway. Gwangjang Market is a local market for people to seek the delicious and naïve food. Actually, we know this place through a very famous television programme called Running Man. The television programme also visits the market before. As we all know, most of the Korean food are spicy. There are all kinds of traditional snacks in the market for you to have a try, like rice cake, breaded fish stick, fried chicken and so on. The most unforgettable food for me is eating the raw octopus, the feeling is really special. I advise the tourists can take it as a lunch or supper as there are many choices to choose."
Deals and meals!,"We came to Korea from tropical Saipan in December, inconveniently lacking winter clothes. Hit up the secondhand market area and got ourselves some warm, funky clothes on the cheap, followed up with a great little lunch. Much better prices here than in the more touristy areas."
Vegetarian delight.,"Metro stop for Gwangjang market is Euljiro 4. Once you enter street level, head N. After one block, you'll be crossing an intersection which is a bridge across a narrow stream below. Before the next major intersection, there will be entrances to the market on the E side of the street. For the food zone entrance, head E (right) at the major intersection.The mungbean pancakes & the gimbap are vegetarian delights. The bibimbap can be. If not, have the meat 86ed. Herbivores won't be disappointed if you're into cabbage, fresh herbs, grains, sprouts, & red peppers."
"Crowded, but gives you a taste of local culture","This market gives you a taste of the local culture in Seoul. For a unique local experience, have your lunch or dinner here. Avoid weekends at nights as it can get extremely crowded."
Huge market place!,"There were many food stands, household items, and clothing. Almost anything can be found here. The food stands looked really good as they cooked much of the food in front of you."
Nice food and shopping!,"weird when shopping here but worth. what i mean shopping at here is you can buy a lot snacks from here with retail price ! believe me, cheaper than other places. regret never buy a lot. Great food here and crowded !"
Same street food sold in stall after stall,"This food stall market is a nice attraction for an hour or so. There is plenty of food to buy, but you'll see the same food being sold in stall after stall, e.g. rice cakes, mung bean pancakes (I bought one from the stall with the longest line - and wasn't impressed at all), etc. I also tried the dumplings and noodles in a popular stall - and wasn't impressed by the dumpling or noodles either. There are also places for people to sit within a stall, although you will have to be buying the food from that particular stall.The market also seemed to be a little less clean than some of the other markets I've seen, so you should take that into account. I would also suggest going to other markets like Myeongdong if you desire a greater variety of food as Gwangjang serves the same stuff in many stalls... It did seem to be a place where locals went so even if you do not eat the food, it's an interesting place to visit."
Good for a touristic walkabout,"We came here via metro line 1 (Jongno 5-ga station) and walked a short while to the market. So it is quite accessible. Its southern side is flanked by the Cheongyecheon river, so a nice place for a walk after eating & exploring in the market.It is a very busy place.There is a wet and dry section of the market. The ""dry"" side retailed all manner of daily necessities such as textiles, apparel, shoes etc. The wet side has a stretch of hawkers selling seafood, vegetables etc.Probably the highlight is the food section where there are many many cart stalls set in the middle of the alley ways. There are seating places in front of these stalls. Most, if not all of the visitors eating there seemed to be tourists!"
Ok,"An average market. Plenty of local food available. However, personally I don't like the taste. If you have limited time in Seoul, you may skip this place."
Great local food and a hidden gem,Try the gimbap and pig trotters. Beware! Portions are huge! My personal favourite was the kalguksu (knife cut noodles) with pieces of zucchini and gim (seaweed). The mung bean pancake seemed to the draw for both local and tourists but I found it to be too heavy and oily for my liking. I had a nice piping bowl of red bean porridge which was a savory alternative to the usual sweet dessert we are so used to in Singapore. Get your kimchi here too!I bought plain canvas tote bags for 2000 to 3000 won each from the traditional stores and some Korean knick knacks (much cheaper than Insadong). The bags were of good and sturdy material. Plus there is a hidden second-hand market on the second floor. 
Cheap Shopping in Seoul,"One of the best shopping destination for tourists looking for local products. Also there are a lot of store selling colorful Hanbok. There are Goods, accessories clothes in very inexpensive price."
Traditional Korean Street Food,"In this crowd and popular traditional market offer a good selection of Korean Street Food with a reasonable price such as Korean pan cake, sticky rice cake etc. So it is a one stop shop for Korean street food"
Traditional Market in Korea,"Said to be the biggest market, this place sells everything from clothing through traditional medicines to food.The place is known for traditional mung bean pancakes.It is not touristy and the majority of visitors seem to be locals.Worth a visit in the evenings."
Local market with great food & good for shopping,"2nd visit here. It is a mixed of wet market with other stuffs. You can get clothes, blankets, daily essential, fruits & vegetables, and lots of seafood here.What make it famous is the street food in the market. You can just sit down at the stalls & enjoy the freshly prepare food. As vegetarian, there choices are quite limited. But I like the Original Gwangjang toast by the old grandma at the end of the market & the red bean cake near the middle cross junction inside the market.But my main purpose to be here is for the raw Korean Ginseng & the dried seaweed. We also bought a set of Korean cutlery, dried persimmon, nuts & snacks. We ended up with so much stuffs (enough to fill in 2 XL sized Longchamp bag) that we have to go back straight to our hotel:)"
Best place to try Korean Food,"We stopped by to have a quick browse of the market while walking past along cheongye stream to Dongdaemum. Should have saved my stomach to have our meal here as there was so much food to try. In the centre of the market there are heaps of little food stalls where they sell various korean food- street food. Dokbokki, soondae, gimbap, bindaeteok (mung bean pancake - a must try), bibimbap, savoury pancakes, noodles etc. Each stall has some seats surrounding it so you can sit down to eat or you can buy your food to take away.I didn't get the chance to walk around the other areas of the market but i did walk past an area where they sold lots of fabric/ material and also saw quite a few stores selling packaged korean snacks"
"good food, local and cultural goods","good local foods with many choices, buy small portion so you can taste as much type of food, wet and dry market with clean environment, buy snack, traditional food pack, cloth material as souvenir "
Good Place for Korean Food & Shopping,"This is a place for inexpensive shopping for fabrics, clothes etc with a section dedicated to a whole bunch of food outlets. The shopping is nothing extravagant but prices a were cheaper than in big shops. We went in late afternoon for a stroll in the shopping area (browsed stuff) and in the end, enjoyed a wide variety of Korean food complemented with a bottle of 'rice wine', which is a low alcohol drink (like beer). We got a combination plate that had about 8 different items. It was a great way to sample the wide spectrum of Korean street food. Though inside a busy market, the food outlets had space to sit inside.It is also good for people-watching as the locals teem for shopping and eating. Great to watch how the food is made then-and-there. However, the walking spaces are narrow and can be difficult to maneuver when crowded."
Market place for korean food and snacks,Went to this place for breakfast and many stalls sell korean food. We can eat there as they provide stools to sit and can take away also. You can buy many korean snacks and food also here. Price is cheaper than supermarket or others sold at Namdaemun market.
Heaven for banchan dishes,"I came here for the second time to buy banchan (Korean side dishes) to bring back home. The first time we came, we brought back some fermented squid side dish but in small quantity. We regretted it then since it was very delicious. This time round, we couldn't buy much too since my sister had just given birth and was not allowed to have seafood for a few months. There's even marinated raw crab which we loved when we bought it the first time round. Just tell the person that you need to take it back home on flight and they will be willing to seal-wrapped the food with no additional cost. "
Street food to your heart's content,"It's one of the best places to try all the wonderful street food you've seen on TV or vlogs. A food lover and a photographer's paradise. Many of the stalls/vendors are famous, so you can be sure you're eating the best food.It's a must-do experience. The atmosphere is amazing. The food is not only delicious, but cheap, as well."
Great place to eat greasy street food & get hanbok made,"I love coming to these markets every time I'm in Korea, just to soak up the wet market atmosphere and to eat lots of delicious junk food! Come on an empty stomach and leave with takeout containers to last you another day or two.Just to be clear - these aren't wet markets. There are fabrics, tailors, traditional embroiders, souvenir shops, and shops selling household items - but there are also people selling fresh fish, banchan, vegetables all adding to the chaotic atmosphere which I love.My must have treats (in order. They will package everything in takeaway containers if you ask ""pojang hae joo saeyo"".1. Crispy, hot bean pancakes dipped in vinegar sauce with onion pickles. Eat one, take a few away. Some will sell just the batter for you to fry up at home (look for ones that grind their own beans -pictured)2. Mayak gimbap: literally, if you eat if you're think ""they've put crack in this. It's so addictive""3. Soondae steaming hot vermicelli ""blood pudding"", sliced and dipped in the special shrimp-salt mix4. Hobakjuk: steaming hot bowl of sweet pumpkin porridge thickened with glutinous rice flour. Heaven.4= Patjuk: same as above but with red beanHint: If you're there in winter, pick up a bag of freshly roasted chestnuts outside (one of the street vendors on the kerb) and try eating a few with the above porridges. It is a marriage made in heaven, and a quite traditional combination. Also, make sure to ask if they will do a ""refill"" if you're dining in (Koreans also use the word ""refill"")5. Twiggim: Korean version on tempura - battered, crispy shrimp and vegetablesThe place is also great if you want fabric or hanbok made. It's not that friendly towards people who don't speak English, but not rude either. They will try to understand you. There's not much point looking at every stall as everything's practically just a repeat. If you see some seats become vacant in a busy looking stall, just pull up and point at what you want, and you'll do just great.Not a great place to take strollers / not particularly wheelchair friendly unfortunately. Take breath mints if you're companion is sensitive to garlic and blood-pudding-breath like mine is!"
Lots of traditional eateries and goods,"This is a traditional market selling food and daily necessaries. Many kinds of Korean eateries, and the portion is big. Worth a visit!"
Kimchi!,"You can buy traditional items here! It's cheaper and lots of shops which is easier to find. There are many shops that sell different types of kimchi. You can tell them you are buying back and taking a flight, they will help you wrap up . They sell lots of fabric and buttons . It is a textile centre! "
Food and shopping!,"This market is great to experience Korean food delicacies. From bintteok (mung bean pancake) to raw octopus they have it here. The market is huge with lots of allies, and they also famous for fabrics. We tried many kinds of foods here: meat pajeon, soondae, dumplings, small raw crab kimchi, and a few others i can't remember. It's also a good place to shop for korean snacks as the price can be cheaper than convenience store. Just watch out for the old ahjummas that try to increase the price if you're a foreigner :) But it's a good place to visit, especially for the food and the local experience."
Great soondae!,"If you like soondae, this is the place to go to! Very fresh, thick and perfectly tasting soondae! They also have other food there with plenty of places to sit. Fun environment to get pocha food. It was very crowded with lots of people eating and drinking together communal style."
Market Place in Korea,"This is a must visit for tourist where they get to see and experience local Korean food, Pancake, and many other souvenirs.The pancake is the most popular dish and it's great to go with a bottle of magoli.The market is located nearest to Line 1 Jongno 5 Ga. The place is tourist friendly and vendors are nice and polite."
"Skip the shops, go for the local food","Don't think you'll find much to buy unless you're in the market for traditional fabrics and clothing.Lots of street food, might not appeal to everyone. You'll find more 'traditional' street foods like Kimbap, spicy rice cakes, odeng, bibimbap (vegetarian), lots of grannies and ahjummas gathered round for their meal time-gossip session (store holders involved). The mung bean pancakes are yummy though! Crispy on the outside, and pure deliciousness inside! Doesn't taste anything like I would have imagined (I have a slight aversion towards anything with beans except beansprouts), in fact more like a thick rosti with extra ingredients inside. I'll skip the tempting-looking bowl of hand cut noodles next time though."
Street food and local shops,"It was crowded past afternoon. Most food stalls sell the same types of food. As we went on Sunday, some shops were closed."
~ Tips & Observations ~,"1. Definitely Not a tourist market. It is the oldest market in Seoul and famous for fabrics and traditional clothing.2. Best visited for the food, though YMMV. 4 food lanes, converging together in the middle in the shape of a cross. Mostly locals, with the occasional camera toting tourist gawking.3. Open late for food, 'till midnight anyhow. Yet, this late sees only 1/4 or less food vendors open, although virtually every type of food served here, with one or two exceptions, will be found this late. 4. You can search youtube for videos of the market, showing which specific foods are available. Lots of choices, but no restaurants with menus. 5. Stopping by at lunch or dinnertime is great, the entire place is packed with locals eating and makes for a lively scene. 6. Be adventurous. Try things outside of your comfort zone.7. Clean, sanitary environment, so don't worry about your belly.8. Seating is by bench, ordering is as simple as pointing. Simple as that!9. Best approach- walk all the isles, 4 with two lanes each so 8 rows really. Scope it all out, then pick two or three places to sit down and eat at. Order lots of variety, sample and share!"
Interesting visit for a local food adventure,"The locals really enjoyed there. The market was a feast for the eyes but not quite up our alley. Expect tight seatings, unfamiliar tastes and drinks are served by other stalls unless you go for the small restaurants. Suitable for snacks rather than meals."
Outdoor goods of all sort but great place to snack,Our hotel was across the street from the gwangjang market. We came here for snacks and a couple times for lunch. There are a variety of outdoor stores and you should be able to find anything including counterfeit clothes. The gem are the little small stalls with as affordable snacks and food. 
Palce to eat and walk,"Went to this market place for dinner and walk around. There are quite a lot of variety. From vegetarian to meat / seafood. And of course, a must eat on their pancakes (kimchi/seafood). The difficult part is when you order your food, the locals do not understand English and will not know what we are referring to. Best to be more specific or try using google translate and show them what you want. This market do sell quite a fair bit of dry products too. I bought some Butter Honey Nuts and lots of seaweeds snacks."
Tasty street food,"Yes, there are lots of tourists here, but there are also many locals who come to eat. There is a great selection of food to try at very affordable prices, our favourite were the mung bean pancakes! There is a metro exit next door to the market so it is easy to get to via public transport. Alternatively take a stroll down the canal which runs alongside the market."
Street,There is a lot of street food here at very affordable prices. Fresh food and vegetables too. Good location is Seoul
Meant for Tourists,"Food was mediocre at best. You can get better street food at other districts such as Hongdae or Ewha at a cheaper price. Many of the vendors are hostile too. The next morning, I talked to the receptionist at my accommodation about Gwangjang and she told me that Koreans find Gwangjang to be a ""terrible place"" (with her limited vocab) and asked who recommended me there. My advice is to skip this place and visit Namdaemun Market instead."
"Local touristic place, but could deliver Korean ordinary atmosphere","This market is odd place, and that quizzicality could be explane like this: modern form of traditional market combined with touristic place.Gwangjang market is famous with two factors: Traditional street foods & Market.Street foods in Gwangjang market is unique. It could be compare with Jeon-Ju, that level high. Locals also visit well for Three famous foods; 육회Yukhoe(Korean beef tartare), 녹두전Nokdu-Jeon(Mung bean pancake), and 마약김밥Drug-Gimbap. If you interested in exotic foods, you should try these. Level of difficulties are like follows; Yukhoe >>>>>> Drug-Gimbap > Nokdu-Jeon."
Great visit for street food lover!,"This pretty crowded market sell all kinds of korean street food, and snacks. Lots of stall selling fresh mung bean pancake with soju here, and a whole lot of other stuffs such as soft shell crabs, deboned chicken feed, blood sausage, etc.You can also get the live octopus here, if you don't feel like going all the way to Noryangjin fish market for it.We went around 5 pm on a holiday and it was very crowded, I heard from our food tour guide that in the morning there are less people and alot less crowded."
Lots of choices to choose from specially the typical korean food you don't usually see,One thing about this place is it's your typical market. People selling food and stuff for a cheap price. The cleanliness of the place can be a bit doubtful but one can never be to careful. Someone recommended this place to me since i told them i haven't have Japche and Gimbop and i found them here however i was a bit dissapointed when one seller used her barehands to get the japche and place it in a plastic bowl for me to eat. The taste was really good though and i wasn't able to find other places selling it. Tried their mung bean pancake and it was good. We went here a little early so there wasn't much people and not everything was open yet. I think the best time to go here would be afternoon to night time.
Reasonably priced with everything under the roof.,It is a big market selling practically everything from modern traditionally Korean food to clothing etc. Bought a few packets of Korean ginseng with herbs and dried fruits. The price is reasonably cheap. Saw mostly local Korean customers with few foreigners. A little narrow and crowded. .
A huge market,"Gwangjang markes is huge and contains both food stalls, grocery shops, clothing and garment shops, kitchenware shops and more.It is a well spent time just to walk around. And if you are hungry it is a great place to try some local cuisines. Korean dumplings, mungbean pancakes and hand-chopped noodles are just a few of them. "
Traditional Market,"The Gwangjang Market is nearby Dongdae Mun. I knew the place from Korean variety show – Running Man. They had some games and ate some delicious food in the traditional market. I was totally attracted with Gwangjang Market. Therefore, I recorded this place in my Korean schedule. It was my first time went to the market, so it was hard for me to find the location. Fortunately, met nice local people helped me to find market. Arrived the market around 6 p.m. so decide to have dinner in there. At the time, there was not so many people. A lot of stalls closed, most of them all sold the same type of food. I found a stall and seated to enjoy the food. The stall’s auntie was so friendly, she tried to speak a little Chinese to me. She was very cute, feed me to eat the food and then took picture. I was so surprised that her actions. It was an unforgettable experience in Seoul."
Brilliant market,"Had a great time visiting this market, the different foods were just amazing, in fact there was so much to sample we had to go back another day. The mung bean pancakes were fantastic as well as the dumplings and the Korean fried chicken.All in all this is a must visit if you are visiting Seoul."
Best Mung Bean Pancakes,"This is just a ridiculously busy spot but we went back twice. The Mung bean pancakes which can be had from numerous sellers here is simply outstanding. I had a couple of varieties and enjoyed it all as well as spicy ricecakes, korean fried chicken, gimbap, sweet potato pancakes and the list goes on!"
Lively place,"This is one of very famous street markets with a long history. You can buy fabrics, hanboks(korean traditional clothing), beddings, among many other things! There is very famous eatery alley where sells many foods so you can taste with cheap price!"
traditional Korean market,Food stalls and hawkers are everywhere. You can find the traditional Korean food here. A bit messy and dirty.
"New York, Hong Kong, Taiwan","I have been to many street food locations globally; none is comparable to the size, variety and hustle and bustle of Gwangjang Market. The unique cover at this market is high enough for air ventilation, shelter the hawkers and patrons alike from heat in the summer, rain, wind and certainly snow in the winter. The method of cooking maybe different from one stall to the next, you will find the same sort of orange color gochujang used for almost every item on displace from every hawker, they tried to pull everyone to their stall, just like the San Gennaro feast Little Italy in New York, the food is delicious just like the spicy crabs on Temple Street in Hong Kong, and the variety, just like Jiufen in Taiwan. Certain food items maybe offensive to some Westerners, I have even tried my first live octopus there. Barbaric but once in your life time …. Gwangjang Market is designed as a tourist destination, but worth your time for a visit, a good experience"
A Riot of Sound and Sites,"I was so glad the this gigantic market was just down the street from my hotel. It is a world of its own: over 200 stalls selling food; textiles, clothing, you name it! a MUST SEE!"
A true gem,"Be prepared to be astounded but if one wants authentic local food that caters to the locals, this is it. The best kimbap and fishcake soup I ever had from an old lady who works by herself, perfect with a side of cold soju."
"Yes clothes predominate,but the street food. WOW","Covered market ,great when it rains. Everything from bedding to clothes. Fresh meats,fish ,and vegetables for sale. There is also great street food that delights the palate."
Typical market that has to be visited,Great place to buy typical korean things or just to eat typical food. Do not be surprised by the number of people it is very very crowded but it is part of its charm.
Overall ok experience ,"What I enjoyed: The experience of visiting and walking around a traditional Korean market, you will see lines of stalls with their food laid out/being cooked in front of you, and you can choose which stall(s) you fancy, take a seat at their benches/slim tables and eat. If you don't know Korean it's fine, pointing at the food to order would work as well, some of the stall owners can speak a little English/Chinese. What I didn't enjoy that much: Was quite crowded when I visited. The food was average only, not the best I've had in other markets/other parts of Seoul. "
Foodies! go to Gwangjang market,"Foodies will want to see how delicious this place is! hahaEvery corners you can find street food, mungbean pancake, chopped noodle, rice cake, korean pork blood sausage, jabchae, bibimbab, dumplings, beef tartar, bbq restaurants... so many to talk about! When you finish one alley, you will be so full yet!"
A bit overatex and hard to find,"This place has a variety of street food, however you can get this kind of food around Seoul from restaurants or street vendors. Its not worth the long visit and going out of your way to find it. And even though it's old, it's more dirty than charming. Worth skipping, do if you have extra hours to kill only. "
Bizarre old market,"Hmmm this was a unique market filled with food stalls. This market is mostly visited by people in their 50's and older. The vendors sell food that most young Koreans don't eat. You can find ""typical Korean food"" like kimbap and jabchae but the market specializes in the unusual Korean food you see on American travel shows. Only recommended for the brave and curious."
Must see!,This market is worth searching for if you want to eat cheap street food in bulk! The food wasn't the greatest we had in Seoul but we enjoyed the experience of sitting with locals at their tiny little food stalls and watching them make buckwheat noodles while we slurped our freshly made dumpling soup. So good to just sit around eating and people-watching! Afterwards we just roamed around the market trying different snack-foods. Very satisfying! I would highly recommend this market for a fun lunch experience!
Avoid it,I went there to buy the traditional custom to my family. I found a verity of products however they don't speak english and that make it hard to communicate. In addition to that they don't accept credit card only cash. There is no souvenir shop which I found it strange.I have doubts about the food safety and hygiene. I don't encourage anyone to eat there.
horrible dining experience,"went there at night for its famous mug bean cake and pig tongue and boy there were both such let down. the mug bean cake was very dry and tasteless; and the pig tongue is not well seasoned and taste gamy. and mind you, they were not exactly cheap also! the hygiene of this place also look questionable definitely overrated imho. will not return"
Eat eat and eat,"This is the place if you want to eat street food but the portion here is big. We just try 2 stalls here. There are kimbap, dumpling, noodle soup, raw meat, etc. the price is around 5000won per food."
A huge market with so much to see and eat!,"The Gwangjang Market is huge (with several entrances) and is categorized by types of goods/services offered. There are several sections in the market dedicated to fashion, shoes, textiles, dry food and candy items, fresh seafood and cooked food section, fresh flowers and fruits etc. Among all, in the center of the market are the makeshift food stalls that are popular with the locals and foreign visitors. There are so much to see, do and eat here!Well, when in foreign land, one of the best ways to fully immerse and experience the local culture is to visit the traditional market, which Gwangjang Market is one of them.We arrived at the market at around 12.45pm after visiting/walking around in Dongdaemun Market and it's Stationary and Toys Street. It took us about 30 mins to walk here (though we could take the subway here, just one station).As it was lunch time, we decided to have lunch here and immediately chose a makeshift stall (actually this was recommended by someone though most stalls here are selling similar food items with some pork knuckles the Korean version, intestines of the pig etc) and tried its Gimbap, Fried Rice Cake and Fish Cake Skewer. The food was great and yummy and of course unique. The Gimbap equivalent to the Japanese's Sushi, have sesame seeds over and was very nice! The Fried Rice Cake was nice too except a bit spicy (for my friend but not for me) and sticky. As for the Fish Cake Skewer, it was fresh and nice too. In fact, the lady stallowner also served us cups of the fish soup which was very good and flavourful.The 3 items cost about 8000 won and was very much worth it, because they are delicious and quantity is such a large portion. In fact, we were very full till quite late in the evening before having our dinner. A must try!Thereafter, we walked around the market for a while buying some local souvenirs and food items. Most of the people here were very friendly and polite and not pushy for sales despite being located next to one another and selling ""me too"" products. The prices here were reasonable and lower than other places and some stallowners would also give you free gifts.A must visit place in Dongdaemum and you will be able to fully indulge and experience the Korean's culture and food cuisines. Highly recommended.* Actually I have recorded some videos of my travel trips but no way to upload here to share. Do contact me if you want to see and can catch them in my Youtube account!"
"Gwangjang Market – where I love the cotton, crepe and others","My third visit since 2012 – I love the cloths here. The cotton and crepe particularly, spoilt for choices and reasonably priced. Compared to those available in Malaysia. The Ahjummas/Ahjushis are friendly, ever willing to show you the cloths spread out. I buy these to make Malaysian national dress, the baju kurung, to work. The cotton is so comfortable. If you are looking for Korean silk, there is 1 particular store that most regular Malaysians are familiar with. However, I noticed that the store doesn’t replenish, seeing almost the same pattern that I saw in 2012. Or perhaps only Malaysians buy them…With the fallen ringgit, the price for a 4-meter Korean silk material has gone up but if you are a Malaysian female used to the Kelantan/Terengganu “silk”, I would recommend try the Korean silk. Beside the cloths, the seaweed here is also much cheaper than those in Myeondong, almost half the price. There are food stalls and souvenir stalls. Quite an interesting place to visit. You have to take line 1 Seoul Metro and get off at Jongno5(o)-ga, as you exit you will see a few pharmacy stores. Take a left, walk a few minutes and you will come to the entrance of Gwangjang market. The path branches out somewhere in the middle, the cloth path somewhere on the right. The rest is food and souvenirs. The market closes early, perhaps 5 pm"
Very unique,It is never usual for me to see pig head at market place. It seems very normal for Korean to have fun with it. Unique experience. Great location.
Great food,"Stopped by to walk around and have lunch. The market does get crowded but that is just something you come to expect while traveling Asia. The food was excellent, and while some vendors try to get you to come to their stall, most are not pushy. We will go back the next time we are in Seoul."
The best Kimbap I ever had,"Knew this satll from Paik's show and do not even have the address to find it. BUt we happen to found it using our 6th sense. Just follow the path way where people sell cloth and fabric... if not, try and eat whatever you want in this market. The choices are various."
Most Favorate Korean Traditional Market in Central Seoul,"I lived in Seoul for many year, and working in Jongno. KUANGCHANG market is one of my favorate market with good taste and economic price. My favorate menu are Korean sausage in 60 old restaurant - Grandma Soondae, Kimbap and Bibibap and noodle in cart market. Could free park in weekend or easy to access from Jongno 5 ga subway station."
hate the smell,"When i entered the market, it smelled really bad ( a mix of different seafood and meat and who knows what else).And the variety of food is also not thaaat great.But here you can buy real authentic korean snacks (tokkpoki and sundae...), while other food-streets sometimes try to adjust to the tourists. And also the building itself is not that huge. So that could be an advantage if you don't have that much time.SInce the place is very crowded, eating there (standing and sometimes there is a chair) is not really comfortable.There are a few ""restaurants"" with seats and tables, but the waiter or ahjummas there are not really friendly...(maybe i was just unlucky).By the way the whole market is roofed, so you can even go there on a rainy day (like me)."
Great night food market,Great food market nestled in the boughs of the market. Food really comes more to life. Easy enough to get to this place it's along the subway. Coming over from the other side of the city is easy too either subway or bus. Little bit of walking but easy enough to make it there. Once your there head out to surrounding stores there are lots of places with energy. 
Foodie paradise,"Cheap and tasty food everywhere. Simple food not the pretty dishes you fing in restaurants. For me, this was the must visit place in Seoul. So much delicious and strange foods to taste. Fantastic."
The foods are cheap and delicious,"Closed to metro station and a lot of native foods and fruits to buy. However, we didn't eat over there, it is extremely hot in Aug. The fruits are cheap and fresh. Nearby I would like to recommend a very traditional ginseng soup noodle, it is highly recommend to you guy if you visit Gwangjang and don't want eat inside."
Temps to hot to fully enjoy,We took a food tour with Janet and this is a wonderful market with such interesting history and the best mung bean pancakes ever. But with the temps near 100 degrees Fahrenheit and all the cooking going it took some of the fun out of it. I need to go here on a cold winter day!
 Gwang Jang market on Sunday,"We come here on Sunday morning for a breakfast. Most of.the shop is closed on Sunday. I think Korea is a very relaxing city, they don't mind to earn less money, but they mind to lose family life. If you come here on Sunday, you can find some food unpalatable and unpleasant price."
Gwangjang Market,"One of the most famous traditional markets in Seoul. It is quite an interesting experience to walk through the markets, lots of eateries in the open area selling deep fried green bean cake, kimbap, noodles and so on. Gwangjang Market is not far from Dongdaemun. If taking metro, get off at Jongro 5-ga station, Exit 8."
Genie's market!,"You can find almost everything whatever it's in this market, EVERYTHING.Food stalls are quite fancy place where you can experience and enjoy local delicacies."
Don't come early,"We came here around 11am and most of the vendors were still closed. Of the vendors that were open, most of them all sold the same type of food. If not food, then clothes and fabric. "
Loved it,"Toooooo many things to try out here, our tummies weren't big enough to fit them all. We tried the kimbap, rice cakes and jokbal, served with some fish cake soup on the side. So yummy! Also had a serve of bibim naengmyeon (spicy cold noodles), our first time trying this and we fell in love with this dish immediately. We will be back soon for the bindaetteok (mung bean pancake), boribap (mixed rice) and yukhoe (seasoned raw beef)!"
The foods were just overprice,"Great to walk around, stroll around the local stores for souvenirs and kimchis! They sell kimchi per kilos.Foods are okay, nothing special and a tad overprice."
Local market for food and souvenirs,"Most of the stalls sold the same food - pancakes, dumplings, jap chae. You can also get live octopus here. There are seats at each stall but you can also get take away. It can get pretty hot in here as it's covered but the ventilation isn't great. Definitely a great experience for first time Seoul visitors. "
"traditional, colorful and lively","Go there see real traditional market place, real local street food and maybe cheaper souvenirs. Its deserves a visit if you have time. Know that market is big so go to fabrics and food sectios"
Interesting,Lots of nice food with reasonable price.Most of the stall vendors able to converse in English or Mandarin.
Korean Silk,We went there just to buy Korean Silk. There are many food stalls and shops selling all sort of textile.
Lots of fooddddddddddd,"This market sells a lot of food such as sundae, bintaedokk, tteokbokki and more. It's a traditional market and there are people who also sell ctraditional clothes in there."
"Dirty and expensive food, WORST","Whole food is so dirty and overpriced. I live in Seoul for 28years but the food quality is the worst I have ever been. Disgusting smell in everywhere. I was momentarily under the illusion that I was in a North Korea or some uncivilized country. Cheap-looking Hanbok(Korean traditional cloth), slice the foods with hands that handled the money, rude and unpolite...etc Maybe it is funny to foreign tourists who want to experience uncivilized culture."
A great orientation to Korean food,"The bustling Gwangjang Market is perfect for foodies eager to sample a myriad of Korean food. This historical market is home to bindaetteok (mung bean pancakes), mayak kimbap (addictive rice rolls), and yukhoe (Korean-style beef tartare). It also has sections dedicated to hanbok and other stuff."
great market to wander around,This was more like the kind of market I was expecting to see.There was lots of variety from the old to the new. we finished our walk around 5.30 and joined the locals at one of the food stalls to eat fried chicken and drink beerIt was one the most memorable and best experiences of the visit 
"LOVED IT! Now, this is KOREA!","Very local yet very touristic, but we encountered no trouble and almost hassle free. One of the very few places we were truly pleased with!Very colorful and very diverse!Food is endless, but literally all the same lol"
Must visit for first-timers to Korea,"Many interesting sights, including food, textiles and kitchen ware. The main alley may be very touristy but walk a bit further in and venture, and you will find pockets of quiet eateries in this market. I like walking towards the textile sections to see Korean culture at its best without the touristy jazz."
Huge market,"Unfortunately I didn't make it to see the whole market. I just past my time there until the guided tour for Jongmyo Shrine started. They're very close, so it can be combined with a bit more time. I mainly walked the textile part and food court. There are tailors for hanboks but also traditional bed linen. The food seems authentic Korean to me too, lots of choices. Running Man 'run' thru this once which the store owners didn't hide either. "
THE place to go for Korean street food,"If you want Korean street food, this is the place you'll find it. Things are overpriced almost by mandate and usually served for two or more so feel free to haggle if you're in the mood, especially if you're buying half portions (i.e. for one) or multiple foods from one vendor. You can buy things to go or just sit down and eat right there. The other offshoots are also interesting to explore for some of the wares they sell."
really awesome,"real authentic Korean things to buy, such as tees or chains, or hanboks, or dresses. you can buy really good tea, from Jeju island as well. "
Good Place for Traditional Korean Street Food,"We visited the market at night for food, there are many food stalls manned by friendly aunties that sells various korean traditional street food like kimbap, japchae, sundae, eomuk, etc. and the stalls open until late so lots of people come here for supper and drinks as well. Definitely a nice experience to enjoy good food at a market setting."
good,"So many cloth and something culture of korean people ,The Gwangjing Market so big for local .I was travelling and buy some souvenir . "
"Not to miss, shop, eat, or people watch. ","This place is in essence an open market. I found it to be a great choice for souvenirs with decent prices. However, the real attraction is the food. Tons of street vendors with different food; which, depending where you are from, some of it might be considered exotic. You can do take out but I think is better to sit down and enjoy the place, just pick one since there are vendors everywhere. The most common food is the fried pancakes (bindaetteok). I found them to be very tasty and easy to share (they are big enough); if you are finicky this is probably a safe bet (just a notch below bibimbap). Next on the menu I would add the sausage (sundae), like any other sausage you probably don't want to know what's in it but intestines and blood are likely ingredients. A few places (those with a big line) offer something call yukhoe which is in essence raw beef with raw eggs. It was not my favorite, it tasted like very rare steak (it is literally raw) mixed it with pears and think of it as sushi. Finally after drinking some more soju perhaps try the sannakji. This is a small octopus that you can hold before being sliced. The tentacles are still 'active' and the suction cups might stick to your mouth and throat, a weird feeling. It was too chewy for me. You should try a different vendor for each plate; all plates should be shared. Bring cash since credit cards are not readily accepted. If you are visiting with a local, make sure you learn the custom into drinking soju or beer (like not pour for yourself). Also, while the alcohol content for the most popular brand of soju is below 17%, take your time as the sweetness might make you drink more than you expect. "
Must visit Market,"it's a massive Market sells lots of stuff, food is the most. the variety, taste, the colour, the ppl, you have to try it all. i only had few and was already full. dare to try the fresh octopus, if u like sashimi, then i bet u will like it."
Busy but Quiet,"Huge traditional Korean market. I'll go back to try and eat that live octopus, I got scared the first time. While this is a busy market, it is relatively quiet and clean."
Korean Street food Galore,"Gwangjang Market is a haven for those who love Korean streetfood, but don't want to have to jostle with the shoppers of Myeongdong or the club lined streets of Hongdae. It's an indoor space, comprised of multiple streets with food vendors, as well has some shops that sell Korean goods that you can purchase to eat or bring home as gifts. Here it's best to deal in won, as many of the vendors sell their food for cheap prices, and only certain ones may have cards. You can get your fill of gimbap, mandu and sundae, or you can opt to be more adventurous and try some infamous san-nakji *live squid* just remember to eat eat eat!"
"Weird, wonderful and interesting","Although this market has become very touristy and a little high-priced, it is still a great place to visit to see all the interesting foods that Korea has to offer. It will also make some squirm at the same time... not for the novice traveller!"
Mung Bean Pancakes and Rice Wine!,"The place to go for some amazing street-style food.Highly recommended: The mung bean pancaked. Sit yourself down at one of the tables in the center of the market. In no time you'll have one of the deep fried beauties in front of you. Best eaten with the vinegar and onion sauce for dipping and a delicious bowl of makgeolli, the korean rice wine! WARNING: The wine is quite sweet and masks the alcohol quite well, so pace yourself when drinking."
good experience but many mainland chinese,"I want there in the last few months and saw many chinese people on that street which was kind of noisy. The stuff they sold there was interesting but remember to bargain with the shop, you will get some surprise"
Interesting place to see and taste Korean food,"We went on a late Sunday morning so the food stalls were open but some stalls selling other stuff were not. Still there was plenty to see. Vendors selling their wares like souvenirs, fresh produce etc. The food stalls here sell more traditional food such as mung bean pancakes, octopus, dumplings, gimbap etc unlike those in Myeongdong. The food here is cheaper too. You order your food and sit right at the stalls to eat. The stalls at the junction seem to be more popular and crowded. It is quite warm. You can take pictures with the live octopus provided you pay for it and eat it. I would say you could spend 1 to 1.5 hrs wandering around. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience."
Local fare,We got a lot of local handmade goods were purchase as souvenirs. The prices were pretty resonable so we didn't do too much haggling.
Decent food,"To be fair, i visited during the lunar new year period, which was why so many stalls were closed. Did get to eat a couple of items i.e. noodle soup and mini kimbab"
Go to the middle,This is a four way market that meets in the middle intersection. It's easy to get tempted by the food stalls at the edge but it seemed that the most crowded and popular ones were in the middle. The mung bean pancake stall right in the centre seemed the most popular with queue of locals ten deep.Would advise watching what the locals eat then ordering as portion size of noodles is large. 
Great Traditional Market,"I went there for the greenbean pancake (bindetteok), rice cake, bibimbap and naengmyeon! I must recommend the naengmyeon in a air-conditioned stall at the corner of the long passage of the food stall, big portion and very nice elastic cold noodle!"
Great place to pick up a souvenir,"Bring Cash, and have fun. You can buy almost anything. I was a little suspicious of the designer items for sale everywhere. I don't know much about spotting fakes, so it's buy at your own risk. What I did buy was a traditional dress for my niece that is just beautiful. I also tried some of the street food. I couldn't tell you what I ate, but it was good."
Gwangjang Market,"we were there on a thursday early evening and so the place not very crowded. besides souvenirs, there are food stalls, shoe shops, dry goods stalls, even hanbok shop. its interesting to see such a variety of stuff in 1 market. prices here are reasonable."
Great market experience,"Fun to walk through and experience the sights, smells, and sounds of this market.There is also a whole floor of fabrics (?2nd floor) if you're into that sort of thing.Main level has an assortment of cooked food vendors, fresh seafood, clothing, assorted souvenirs. I walked through at lunch time and many locals seemed to be enjoying their lunch right there. Nice experience."
Must visit if you are interested in food,Go in the evening. Buzzy. No one speaks any English but everyone is super friendly. Ease yourself in with a mung bean pancake then stroll around and try something more adventurous. A lot of weird and wonderful things to eat here. 
Gwangjang Market,This is a very huge and famous day market of Seoul. You can get souvenirs here too. We love the food here.
Rows and rows of food stalls,"The market is a great place to explore. We walked there for dinner. Many of the merchants in the market had already closed for the day, but the food stalls were buzzing with activity. Interesting food stalls featuring Korean food... however if you do not like Korean food, this might not be the place to try for dinner. However the varieties of kimchi, seafood and traditional Korean foods make for a very photogenic market. We tried dotorimuk (acorn jelly) salad and bindaetteok (mung bean fried pancakes). Delicious!"
Interesting stop for Korean fare,This is more a stop for Korean bites than shopping. Try out the local snacks like the Korean Spicy Rice Cake which is a common fare in almost every stall. Casual sitting here so dress light in Summer. There are still plenty of shops selling your daily wares and sometimes Korean souvenirs.
What an experience ,I didn't buy anything from the market...But the small alleys close by were really cool. The market sells so many types of different items it's unbelievable. Definitely worth a see :)
Dont miss this place,"As we stay at Dongdaemum, we took a cab to Gwangjng market and it cost about 4000won which is ok as we have 4 pax, i think cheaper than subway as per person is $1250won.I would say ""tick"" off this place in your must visit place. This place is vibrant and full activities. i very much like the wet market section as we can see plenty of korean food. In the dry food section , most of the vendor are selling seaweed but different brand. Prices are competitive and some negotiation is possible. i also realised that the almond nuts are quite popular. There are also kitchenware and fabric section. I do notice that the things there are slightly cheaper than other places. Do try the pancake,noodle, porridge etc. Have Fun..."
Great Buckwheat Husk Pillows and Korean Blankets,"We make it a must to visit Gwangjang Market every trip to Seoul. We love the buckwheat husk pillows and Korean blankets and would cart off several every time we come to Seoul. There are so many small eateries/shops here that sell great food! My siblings aren't about to try the food from the stalls here, so we settle for the eateries/shops that sell food. How to find a good one? Look inside and see if there are many locals in there. Yup. These serve better food. Incidentally, my sibling bought a dozen sets of chopsticks, spoons and metal bowls from here. Cheapest, compared to Daiso, Insadong etc. I bought lots of souvenirs here. Cheaper than Insadong and Myeongdong. One drawback: avoid the toilets. "
korean food,"i had some nice korean food here, like the traditional pancake 8delicious) and some other weird stuff. cheap eats and lots of flavours!"
Packed and Great Fun,"Busy, busy, busy! Great atmosphere, hustle and bustle, people everywhere and of all ages and selling everything; very safe, great street food and loads of bars and restaurants all around."
Why not!,"Great market and no ones really pushy. Previous reviews are correct in saying you'll pass by 20 different vendors selling the exact same thing, so pick your poison, and then the next section comes up with totally different stuff. Not much touristy here just lots of food and fabrics. Nothing is priced so be prepared to barter.. If your not into that don't worry, it's all cheap. Best you can get is cheaper! Even if you're not hungry or shopping it's definitely worth wandering around, the sights and smells are phenomenal! But I encourage you to pull up to a bench, point at something and give it a go :) taxis, buses and metros close by once ya exit the market from basically any side. Have fun!"
One of the best street markets in Seoul,"This place is huge!!! And so clean to be a street market that it is not even real!. I have been in places like that in mainland China and there is nothing to compare, on that (and many others) regard.This is a world in itself, self contained, I would say it comprised many blocks, everything that you want to see is there. I find it reasonably priced, a magic universe of food, ingredients, sewing notions (amazing, it is the sewer paradise), electronics, people offering any kind of services, even the ones that are not longer offered in the west. We have seen a guy squatting on the floor repairing an old iron, for example. It is also Fabric Wonderland, every type of fabric is offered there, plus very good clothing, very well priced. Everybody is friendly and no one hassles you, type of Chinese style. A great place, totally worthy."
You have to have a strong stomach,"I live in China and I’m barely getting used to being able to stomach the foods there. I told my father in law I wanted to go to a very cultural market and eat and sample as many things as I could and not go broke. He said ok and he didn’t even have to think twice. We had already been to Myeongdong but then that is very touristy (still fun but the food catered to tourist flavors) and I wanted a place where locals ate. He brought us to Gwangjang Market. The place is alive and food is everywhere. It’s everything I wanted to sample. However, you can’t be squeamish and you have to just sample it. I didn’t like many things. In fact, I didn’t like more than half of the things I sampled but I did sample some foods that I really liked. My stomach wasn’t feeling too good after our trip lol but I did it, I live once, and I want to try it all. Come here and sample away courageously."
Last Day Fave,"On our last day in Seoul, we decided to visit Gwangjang Market and we were sorry we had to rush to catch our plane. There are so many stalls of interesting plates and bowls of food there. We tried the juk first. The seafood bowl was delicious especially with the kimchi mixed in. We also had the sweeter version which seemed like it was mixed in with either mung bean or corn. Next we moved on to the dumplings, rice cakes & soup. Yum!!! The kimchi dumpling was a different flavor we had never had before. We loved it and the other dumplings. The rice cakes were good, but we somewhat regretted not getting the fresh noodles.Then onto the daikkon rolls! These were freshly hand made. We had a bunch for 2500 won. Such a great deal!Finally we had to try the mung bean pancakes. We liked the pork filled better. They had more flavor. But the regular pancakes were delicious with a little sauce.We wanted to try the sweet version or some dessert, but did not have the time. What a great meal to finish our trip!"
Strange Fact: The CA amonds bought there were awesome!,Fun market in the fact that the almonds that we bought at the market were outstanding and seemed crunchy and really fresh (even though they were imported from CA)...? The upstairs Hanbok (traditional Korean dress) area had numerous stores (abt 100) to observe and take pics of.
Eat n shop,"There are a lot of shop n food there, my friend told me to buy some ginseng there n I found out is really cheap there buy more get more discounts "
Traditional Food,"It is relatively easy to reach from the Jongno 5(0)-ga subway. There is a stall at the centre of the market selling delicious pancakes. I bought some traditional snacks, dried goods and kimchi. Do compare the prices between stalls to find the best deal. "
Interesting Street food,The food is so good we came here twice. Once for dinner and once for lunch. The atmosphere is full of life as one see rows and rows of stalls selling food. Each stall owner will do their best to invite you to sample their food. I have never felt so welcomed in Seoul as here. One have to be aware that similar food is sold in each area. Hence there's lots of competition. Pancake and their traditional rice wine is a must. There's something so Korean about that as locals and foreigners dine together. We tried their local delicacy of live octopus. It took some time before we overcame our mental barrier to chew as the locals chew. Overall a very good experience. 
One of the oldest markets in korea,"Had been to the ones in busan and daegu, this one offers much less, especially comparing to the one in daegu. The only reason I would go again would be the food stalls (cut noodles with wontons are really good), otherwise I won't bother."
"Fabric, food, and vintage clothing ","A great place for a wander even if you're not looking for anything in particular. There are loads of fabric stalls, and the food street is great. I love the potato cakes and they are really cheap. There is a huge vintage clothing area upstairs with plenty of choice and sizes. I got some great bargains!"
One Stop Market for Korean Food,"You will find this kind of market is everywhere in Seoul. But Gwangjang Market is worth to go as here is one-stop marketplace for everything you can put into your mouth. From the wetmarket, you can buy the seafood and have the restaurant there to cook for you. There are plenty of food stalls selling all kind of Korean delicacies, from ginseng soup to kimchi dumplings, korean pancake, bibimbab, and even the rice barley drinks. I give a 10/10 for this spot from the assessment of one who craves for foods in Seoul. The prices are also very competitive!"
It's very commercial and competitive,"It's smaller than I have expected. The food stalls are all selling similar stuff, crammed together, so the market gets very hot."
Food market,"We came to this place as we were looking for fresh gingseng, I was not expect that we will find food vendor selling different variety of food, dumpling, noodle, pancake. We tried kimchi dumpling taste was really good and fresh noodle soup with good price. worth a visit."
Foodies heaven!,"If you're in Korea, you need to try authentic market food and Gwangjung markets is the biggest. This market is famous for it's Potato Jeon which is a must try along with a bottle of Makeolli. Other dishes are not particularly unique to this market however I would try the raw beef (Yukhwe) which is the korean version of steak tartare. A great way to experience Korean culture and cuisine in a market setting which is very different to the restaurants."
The Traditional Market with Lots of Food,"We went to the market to see more about traditional Korean food and I was confused a bit because they have so many stalls selling the same food at one of each alley. Too many vendors to be chosen and those ahjumas will keep calling you to eat at their place. This is one of the problem I see in South Korea that they really compete to each other with the same stuffs just to see which stall more popular by the crowd. We eat the traditional Bimbimbap, tteokbokki, hand cut noodles and dumpling and it was pretty good. They rarely speak English but they speak Chinese due to the growing of Chinese tourists to South Korea but most of them have English menu so you can just ask to see the price before you eat at their stall. The price range on every stall pretty much the same and eating at the market doesn't mean cheap price (KRW 5000-10,000) depends on what you eat. Anyway it always a good experience to see a traditional market in every country to feel more about the culture and their food and I feel that Korea has the best street food so far."
Foodie Street!,Lots of street food vendors and you can find a lot of seafood related dishes around if you like and is not allergic to seafood.
Varied pricing,A great place to visit for some souvenir items and various sized other shopping. Located right near the subway making it easy to dive into and out of shopping. Just give yourself some time to check around at pricing as the same things may be slightly cheaper 1min later in the markets. 
Authentic Korean Market,Lots of beautiful and colourful hanboks. The food were cheap and delicous as well. I really enjoyed the rice cake soup and pancakes. 
Nice cultural experience for a first-timer,"Despite having been to Seoul several times, I've never ventured beyond the Namdaemun traditional market. This place is not hard to find and it's pretty clean and sheltered. The most famous item in this market has to be the bintaettok (mung bean pancakes). Many people raved about them but I frankly did not enjoy them that much. It's an acquired taste, I think. There are many food stalls to sample local food and you can even buy banchan (small side dishes) back to your hotel to slowly savour them. I didn't see much for shopping though there are so many shops selling pretty hanboks. I'm glad I came for the experience but I'm not sure if I will be back a second time."
Huge market with lots of food Korean Hanbok,"Finally have the opportunity to visit this market. Conveniently located near to the subway. It is pretty easy to locate it. What made me really excited about it was the sheer size of it. Lots of food offerings. However, after a while you will realise the stores are more or less serving about the same type of food. Nevertheless, it is still fun to try some of the local food there. There are also a lot of Korean traditional costumes there. Too bad did not have the chance to check them out.Besides selling food and Korean traditional costume. It is also a market. With a lot of fresh food offerings. Seafood, assortment of kimchi and Korean traditional cakes. In fact I enjoyed this section more. More varied.Other than these, the market also sell household items. I probably won't return to this market again as there wasn't much differentiation in terms of offerings. But for those who had not been here before, it is still worth an experience visiting it. "
"왜 그렇게 유명한지 잘 모르겠다 There're lots of other traditional markets in Seoul, don't bother to stick to only this site. ","몇몇 음식점 특히 마약김밥 및 빈대떡, 순대 등이 유명하여 굳이 줄 서서 먹었으나 너무너무 실망했다. 마약 김밥 같은 경우는 비싸지 않지만 줄 서서 먹을 것도 아니고 이름 하나 잘 지어서 (""마약""이란 이름이 우리나라 사람에게 흥미로와서) 대박 난 듯...너무 상업화 되었고 교통이 편한 편도 아니니 굳이 갈 필요는 없을 듯. 차라리 망원 시장이나 경복궁역 근처의 통인 시장이 더 좋을 듯 하다.I queued long time to have those so called ""the must eat"" things among locals such as Mayak Kimbab (drug kimbab) ,Bin-dae-dduck (korean pan cake) and Squid Soon-dae (korean sort of black pudding or sausage) but they were all not that worthy. I recommend other markets like Mangone market or Tong-In market nearby Kyung Bok palace. "
Great market to see!,A large selection of food vendors throughout as well as non-food things on offer. We visited at sunset/evening on a Monday and it was bustling with energy.
Interesting place,"Look more like a market selling cooked food and street food. If you like these food, you will love this market. Vendors do not speak English. But most of the food is 1000 won or 2000 won. So they will gesture by showing 1 finger or 2 fingers."
food galore,"Love going to Gwangjang market for breakfast, you will be spoilt for choices. Pumpkin and red bean porridge, kimchi pancake, barley rice, spicy rice cake and so much more your tummy will be more than satisfied. Go to the alleys to look at the huge range of kimchi and other raw foods available for sale."
Souvenirs and food..,"A great place to buy souvenirs and taste local food. You'll see it will get crowded once local people have done working and eat at those local food vendors. Recommend to stop by at one of those food vendors. There's a roof over the market, so rain won't spoil the mood."
awsome,"very close to metro station!! Compared to many traditional markets, this market is surprisingly clean. You can find a lot famous and traditional food there. Good for breakfast or lunch.Lots of vendors can also speak Chinese, but take it easy, they are friendly, and body language works anytime!Besides, you can also find some small stuffs as gifts, such as Hanbok book marks and so on. 比想像中乾淨很多, 大多的攤飯也會說中文, 這裡你可以嘗到各種美食, 當成早餐或午餐都很棒, 此市場離地鐵站非常近! 在這裡不只食物, 還可以買到一些小紀念品或者伴手禮"
A must visit local market in Seoul,"Not a big scale market, but you will be amazed by the number of watering foods they served. Kimchi, seaweed, noodles, Korean pancake etc. Highly recommended place to visit if you're Korean food lover! They serve mainly traditional preserved Korean foods, if you're opting something like barbecue or fried chicken, this is not the place. "
Cheap traditional food and local goodies!,"For local goodies and food like seaweed, chocolates, almonds, ginseng, blood sausage, dumplings, fish cake, gimbap, tokkboki, etc. Gwangjang market is the place to visit. Food and goodies here are way cheaper compare to other market they range from 500-4000 won. You can also haggle with peddlers. Expect that the place is crowded with locals.A must place to visit :)"
A real cultural experience,"If you have a wild streak and you are very adventurous, you can try authentic Korean cuisine. There is dog meat and dog meat soups available as well as live octopus to enjoy if you can. The sights and the smells are equally worth experiencing."
A variety of local food!,"Had dumplings and awesome tasting toast!! Lots of local food ranging from raw, cooked, boiled items from sashimi to pancakes to fishcakes etc. can be quite an experience for foodie but don't expect much of the surrounding as it's a market."
Must Visit!,This is a very traditional market known for its variety of food. There are also different sections selling fabrics and other stuffs. But what stand out is the food section that sells all kind of Korean food. Come here for your meals and you won't be disappointed. They are cheap and good and a cultural experience too! 
the food!,"it can be a little difficult to find the place, but once you are there, you must eat there! try their barley bibimbap, mayak kimbap, mungbean pancake & red bean porridge. its really good! it is a traditional market, and they sell all sorts of things. seafood to hanbok. it's a must go!"
Gwangjang Market is a must visit!,"Gwangjang Market, previously Dongdaemun Market, is a traditional street market in Jongno-gu, Seoul. The market is one of the oldest and largest traditional markets in South Korea, with more than 5000 shops and 20,000 employees in an area of 42,000 square metres. Approximately 65,000 people visit the market each day. Get your ginseng here, get your breakfast here, various of home made food. The best place to be!"
Great,"Easy to go there and lots of delicious foods and traditional foods, you must go there for try it. And have too many stalls on the market."
A feast for the senses,"If you want to see the real Seoul, this is the place. The stalls are amazing, the variety immense, and the senses are overwhelmed by the sheer buzz of the place. Well worth a visit."
"Interesting place, wide variety of things","Whilst in Korea, I came to really like their traditional markets, it just reminds me so much of things when I was abit younger. And Gwangjang Market is no exception. It’s huge and you can find lots of things here that you typically wouldn’t find outside of a traditional market. So, fabrics, dried food produce etc. Fruit here is fresh and pretty affordable and there are also lots of food stalls in the center of the area. We tried Bindaetteok, which is a kind of pancake only found in that area of Seoul (that’s what I heard). However, it gets super crowded by 11am, so if you are looking to browse around at a more leisurely pace, do arrive earlier. A lot of the stalls open really early (earliest opening 830am)."
Good option for a cheap dinner,"Stayed in Seoul for a few days, and found this market so satisfying for healthy, cheap dinners. Our favourite was the handmade noodle stand near to one of the entrances - so fresh!! And the salad/rice bowls were at other stalls near by were also very nice. Meals worked out to be about $5 Aud from memory and were sooo filling....always finished off our night at the markets with a donut mmm!"
So much to eat,"I was told that Gwangjang Market is known for its food. All of its food. It looks like the market has sorted its eateries into types of food, so walk around to see all the different kinds of dishes served. Please be careful of hygiene. I ate at one store of spicy offal stew (I may have been too adventurous) and the old lady running the store dropped a whole sausage on the ground, picked it up, chopped it up and put it back into the stew pot. I did not feel so good after that. But, everything was tasty! Beware of crowds, and if you are Mandarin-speaking, you will find the store clerks very pushy in getting you to take a seat at their place. "
a lot of food in this market,"a lot of food variety, must come and try. also selling many other stuff but we did not look into as we can't speak korean"
Cheap and tasty Korean street food,"You don't even have to come to shop if you don't want to. What this place should be known for is the street food. Open early afternoon to late at night, there are always people here eating and shopping. Truly the best place in Seoul to get a taste of all of the street food under a roofed place. You'll be able to find local favorites such as mandoo, ramyun, pancakes, and sausages here all in one convenient place."
Be prepared to explore and try,"The market covers almost everything you would want to experience in one place in one day!There are rows of kim chi, preserved veg, dried fish etc etcThere are stalls selling bed linens table cloths etc etcThere are stalls selling clothes, souvenirs ""silk"" pouches bags etcmany sit down stalls for freshly ground mung-bean pancakes, stewed pork, intestines and offals, pumpkin/redbean/abalone congee.best of all, the dumplings and hand-made noodlesThe best time to try street/stall food is 11am to 2pm, just pick you little space, squeeze between other diners and sit on the heated wooden stools and enjoy! hot tea is usually self serviced at the stallWatch out for the little ladies who balance two or three trays of food (small dishes of kim chi included) on their heads to be delivered to a hungry stall owner who is stuck, sometimes alone, manning their little stalls making a living.This is what travelling is about! mix and eat with the locals side by side, elbow to elbow, and remember the experience, I still miss it."
Disappointing mostly textiles,"We arrived around 4pm, some ladies we setting up food stalls, so maybe this can be a different experience later in the day. However, the shops are really one dimensional, bolt after bolt of cloth and pre-made clothing. Worth a miss in my book."
Korean foddies,A great selection of foods here. Make sure to try their mung bean pancake and also the bibimbap. Price wise is reasonable
Great traditional market,great to experience a bit of the real seoul.Very busy market where locals and visitors meet.Gets crazy for lunchtime as there are many korean food stalls that are bustling wit customers
A true local experience,"While living in Seoul for a year I spent my time looking for the best places to eat. This place by far exceeded my expectations. Lots of little food stalls and ajummas and ajashis wandering around. Most of the time I'd head there by myself about mid day to sit and have a snack. I'd always end up sitting next to an old man eating japchae, sundae, and boribap with mini kimbap while sharing makgeolli and soju together while I'd throw the few random korean I knew into the mix and he'd just chat away. It was wonderful! There's something so wonderful about sharing food yet being lost in translation. Lived there 2011-2012"
Traditional Korean food,"This is a traditional market in Seoul. If you plan to go this place I recommend that you also can go to Dongdaemun, these two place are really close. You also can have breakfast in this market and get some tradition stuff, everything is very cheap. Anyway we had a great time in this market."
"Must Buy Korean Appetisers - Kimchi, Octopus....","This is the place to feast the local foods with the locals sitting on long bench around the stall holder. It is very crowded around meal times. Apart from the different kinds of local food stalls, you can also find deliciously tasty appetisers - different kind of kimchi, seasoned seafood, etc. Vacuumed pack products price ranges from 5,000-15,000 KRW. I bought a box of seasoned octopus tentacles for 15,000KRW. It was so tasty. I regretted not buying more including the kimchi. Those sold at the supermart are more expensive and certainly not as fresh or tasty. Beyond the food street are stalls selling clothings, bed sheets, cushion covers, pot & pans, souvenirs, etc. From there, you can take a slow 15 minutes walk to Dongdaemun.I will be back again to buy more of these appetisers."
Traditional Market,"I love this place!! It's bustling with people and food!!! Exotic food that I did not want to try ^^! The market are lined with souvenirs, clothes and bedding stores. They are cheaper here compared to all the other tourists places I have been to. There are aunts with their food ready to be cooked in the middle of the street and they are all so fresh and good!For adventurous, you can try the octopus sashimi and the sea squirt. For the non adventurous, like me, it's safe to try the pancake, oden, mandoo and kimbab."
Loved the place!,"We stayed in Dongdaemun. The first time, we walked to the market. It took us about 45 minutes but then we stopped at various stalls/shops along the way. The second time, we took the metro and the market was less than a 5 minute walk from the station.We loved the mung bean pancakes and the mayak kimbap. We could have eaten them everyday..."
"If you want to see Korean markets and foods, this is a must!",Bindaeduk is the main food attraction but there is so much more. The best kimbap stall is also here - tiny rolls.You should not miss this place.
What an Experience!,Walking through this market is a treat for the eyes. Sitting at the tables and eating with the locals is a treat for your stomach and your mind. Everyone is friendly and will help you get what you want. Wonderful food. Never a bad dish.
Best Place to Try Authentic Korean Street Food,LOVE LOVE LOVE! Being Korean and returning to my home country- a visit to this place fills my soul in a way that is beyond words. The dduk-bbok-ggi! The soon-dae! The o-deng! Everything there screams KOREA to me. Not to be missed.
Worth a visit,"Easily accessible as it's not far from the Seoul Canal walk, you can pop up from approx 1/3rd the way along and visit.Tons of stalls selling a variety of typical korean street food and even if not planning to buy anything worth going just for the atmosphere. Truly only described as bustling."
Fun little market,"We went for the food reviews online. It was Sunday and a lot of the shops were closed, but the food was definitely an adventure. It was very crowded, and if you have picky eaters they will not enjoy this! "
Back for a second visit,"This is located near Insadong and both places can be visited on the same morning. Stopped by here to have some kimchi pancakes as well as steamed crab. Food stalls abound on the ground floor, as well as bed linens, bolsters and Korean souvenirs.In the huge covered area, on the second floor, you can find lots of clothes stalls, with apparel that are mostly made in China. It's more expensive than what I have seen for the same stuff in Shanghai, but there is great variety here, from jeans to blouses and jackets. Some of the staircases can be steep and slippery, especially if they are wet, so be careful.The third floor is devoted to hanbuk shops, selling the traditional Korean dress, for both children and adults. Do haggle though if you are interested in getting one.Also bought a box of lovely strawberries from an eldery lady on the ground floor. Do also check out the toy store in one corner - it was selling a light sabre for S$55 and stormtroppers for S$150 - as well as the gardening and fish stalls near the outside. There are also a row of pharmacies at the far end."
Get your traditional food fix,"The food market is a must do. The layout is like an octopus with little streets extending out of a centre point all under one roof. It feels like each little street specializes in certain kinds of food, too many to mention, look out for the suggestions in the various Seoul must eat lists online."
Lot and Lots of Stuff,"This place was huge, only downfall it seemed most of the vendors had the exact same stuff in each store. Its definitely an experience though! "
This is the place to visit to experience the crazy shopping and eating that Seoul is famous for.,"My wife and I had seen a video walk-through of this market on YouTube (thanks, Cory May) and really wanted to experience it since it looked so crazy and seemed to go on forever. Boy, we weren't disappointed. It's a covered shopping mall (though nearly as cold inside as out) with intersecting spokes that make it a maze to negotiate. Entering from the south, by Cheonggyecheon Stream, you'll encounter the food stalls situated in the middle of the mall walkway. You walk on either side of the food stalls (which have limited sit-down) dining. But, watch out for the ever-present motor scooter delivery guys who drive up and down the same walking areas. If you can imagine a scooter driving up and down the aisles in a department store, it's kind of like that. The assortment of food that is available is pretty amazing, and the odors are of a hundred restaurants exhausting their kitchens into one area (but not overpowering or suffocating, just a mishmash of smells). Off to either side of the walkways are the vendors, everything you can imagine from fish to bolts of cloth. You almost cannot take it all in there are so many colors and so much stuff jammed into these corridors. Then there are the side corridors where there's no food but more stuff piled high in the middle of the walking area where the food stalls were in another corridor. My wife went into this place saying she was going to buy nothing, nothing. I had to go out to a money changer before we got halfway through our visit. You have to see this place to understand it. That's my best description."
A paradise for foodies,"This is a place I wanted to go so bad, after watching a video blog from Mark Wiens on YouTube, and it did not disappoint. I had kimbap, korean pancakes and dumpling soup there spending around 10000 KRW (10 USD) in total, which was great for a lunch.Lots of food stalls where you can find a variety of Korean food, as you may be able to find some Korean souvenirs to buy.Conveniently located near the metro station, which is a plus.If you would like to experience a traditional Korea shopping and food experience, definitely go here!"
Full of Foods Market,"This place near Dongdaemun area, which is many grocery for stationery, fashion, shoes, etc. I take lunch here for some Korean ""snack"" but it is quite cheap and make me full. But many others stall selling foods like noodle seafood, etc"
Beautiful market!,"This market is just lovely it's so very bright and beautiful, and there is quite a variety of souvenirs to look through. I recommend visiting!"
This was my favorite hangout when in Seoul,"There is nothing not to like here! This Korean grand marche is simply mesmerizing to me. From the freshly made food to the heated seating in the middle of the winter, to the abundant produce, seafood on display, the alleys filled with Korean traditional apparels, and so much more, Gwangjang holds a special appeal to me on this and many more trips to Seoul. Love it there!"
Traditional market ,"It is good to walk around the market and look at their culture. You can buy some food to try as well, but it is a little over priced to me, overall is okay, the market is very clean. "
LOVE!,"i love love the food here. been here twice for the lunch/dinner just cause i couldn't get enough of the mayak kimbap! this place is pretty big they have food section, clothes, accessories etc. totally worth a visit"
Love this place. Full of local food!,Nice for a local experience. Lotsa traditional local food to try. Also can find traditional Korean clothing here. Best for travelers who would like to try the local food! Go with empty tummy!
please eat here,what i really love about this place is their food. you will be able to eat different types of authentic Korean food.Live Octopus? you can eat them here. I haven't tried i am not that adventurous yet. but they said it's good with beer 
Worth the visit when you are in Seoul,"The market is full of eateries, stalks, small restaurants, grocery shops, clothes shops and many more. Prepare to spend half a day there to experience the local delicacies. Gwangjang Market is very popular among locals and foreigners."
"This place is not for tourism, so don't sweat if you didn't make it.",This place is just a huge old market in Seoul. Street food here isn't great and things aren't hygiene. Honestly there isn't much to look at or to do. I only go if I want to look for vintage/ old/ cheap clothes on the second floor. Anyway I don't recommend this place for tourists! 
Tasting Korea,"Nothing beats the authentic street foods of Gwangjang market. You'll see that a lot of people visit the market and indulge themselves to the savory street foods South Korea is known for. You'll discover a wide variety of flavours and mouthwatering stuffs that will satisfy your taste buds. If you will visit Seoul, make sure to take a stop at Gwangjang market. It might just be a little pricey compared to the other vendors you'd encounter at the sidewalks, but when you get there and see that a lot of people are eating, you can't definitely say no to the smell and the ambiance of the busy market."
a very crowded market,"we are a little dissappointed with the food stalls in this market. not that sanitary and delicious and very very crowded. however, there are lots of dried goods and clothing for sale."
Food lover ,"This place is a superb food area for food lovers. I had to go 2x times to eat and try out some of the food stalls as I can't eat everything at the same time. As it was also near to Seollal, both tourists and local people came to this place and packed with people. This is also the place to get fabric or hanbok here. "
Fun place to get dinner,We got recommendations at our hotel written so the locals would understand what we were looking for. Everyone helped us find the 2 places we wanted to eat at the customers inside by pointing showed us what to eat because only a little of the menu was in English
Excellent place for street food! :D,My friends and I decided to go to this market for dinner since its known for the food stalls and it didn't disappoint! the place is pack with locals and tourist. You will never ran out of option on where to eat since there is a lot of food stalls that offers different kind of Korean food! This place is surely not to be missed!
"Very delicious food, must try!",We tried the fried green bean cake as well as raw beef with egg yolk. Both of them are extremely delicious. Packaged kimchi and other preserved food could also be found there and sealed packaging is available upon request in some stores.
Gwangjang Market,"great place to buy your souvenirs for cheap.But some merchandise repeats itselfyou also can find there great traditional korean street food,my favorite market in korea"
Unique experience,Visit this place at night to taste the local famous bindaetteok (Pan cake made of mung beans) and Makgeolli (Fermented rice wine) few more exotic food options!
"Exotic food, nice people, something really unusual if you are from Europe or USA","The market is in a big building, but there is no heating. I was there on a cold day, and it was still cold, but not as much as outside. The area is huge. You can see live octopuses in aquariums, fried silkworms, various kinds of seaweed, a lot of stuff you won't find in the West. Of course you can also try everything.There are different parts of the market, and food is only one of them (the most interesting IMHO). Another one is e.g. textiles, where you can buy clothes, linen etc."
Ancient market,"This market is not as I expected since the food section is only for a small section in the market (from Exit 2 of Subway). The rest is for hanbok tailors or fabrics.The food section is quite crowded with some similar cuisine.However, for travelers, it is a good place to explore Korean culture through cuisine. The price (for sure) is for tourists. Haha."
Traditional market.. Best for souvenir,If you looking for souvenir this is the right place.. very cheap compare to other place.I went there because of Running man haha.. Crowded because you may see the local food there
Try the mung bean pancake,"Still a bustling local market, this is a great place to try street food (if you can find a seat among the locals and if you can figure out how to order!). Food prices are cheap and it’s a great place to soak in local culture. One tip: remember what gate/door you entered by (esp if you’re meeting a group or guide later). It’s easy to lose your orientation. Also, try the bindaetteok (mung bean pancake), it was our fav and we wish we had got more instead of sharing one."
Delicious street food!,"We came here twice during our 5 day trip to Seoul and loved it. The atmosphere is great ! It's always super busy and you can barely move but it just adds to the experience. I recommend come on an empty stomach and try lots from the different stalls. We tried the bindaetteok (fried mung bean pancake), ddeokbokki, kimbap, kimchi mandu and a selection of jeon. Everything was great, but I would mention that if you're not a huge meat eater, the smell of the blood sausage and pig trotters can be very strong. Highly recommend to come here, especially if you're on a budget."
Traditional market,"Visited this place cause lots of variety show goes to their traditional market. Lots of eatery,counted as big compare to other market. Easily located outside the metro exit. "
Local foods,Came across a few friendly seller & love the foods there. Very near to subway station. It's a local morning market with all kind of foods 
colourful and buzzing,"The market is buzzing with activity, very colourful shops and stalls and had some great street food. lots of locals at the market - so you have a great vibe, not just a tourist site"
Local Streetfood,"Lots of local street food and dried food. There are store that sell live octopus. If you order, they will take the octopus from aquarium, cut it alive and serve it to you. You are going to experience the octopus tentacle moving around inside your mouth when you take your first bite. ;p"
Best Raw Beef & Life Octopus,"This is the 2nd time we returned to Gwangjang area to salivate our family favourite Raw Beef with raw egg yolk on top. And we attempted raw octopus as well this round, which is yummilicious!!!Many friends said how do you eat such yucky raw meat? Actually, it is really tasty & crunchy. Coupled with their 6% alcohol Makgeolli, which is sweet to the taste bud. Heaven!Both time, we were the only foreigners amongst the local Korean.There are many stalls there. But we choose the one facing the T junction in the market, with an elderly mending the cashier counter (probably the owner).Tips to get there :- Train to Jongno-5ga, Line 1 , exit 10- On the left side of exit, walk into the lane between two pharmacies; Gukje Yakguk (국제약국) and Ujeong Yakguk (우정약국).- Turn right and you will hit a T junction. There are a few similar restaurant there."
Cheap and yummy food at the food street,"The stretch from the subway station to the Gwangjang market 광장시장, is lined with stores such as hanbok tailors (not the typical shopping stretch for tourists). The market has the grocery part as well as the food street part. there is a nice Samgyetang shop which I didn't try - I shall try the next time I go to Korea. I took away 김밥 kimbap for dinner, and it was surprisingly very oily.. it cost only SGD 3 for 2 rolls. "
nice place to shop,"Gwangjang market is a fun place to shop and eat. Though we reached there and the stores we closing, we found really pretty hanbok accessories and souvenirs and loved them so much. It is a popular place to make hanbok and every piece looked so pretty! The food section closes much later and you can basically find everything. The kimbap was addictive and tastes different from the ones sold outside. The seaweed that wraps the kimbap was more crispy and tasty. I would go back again. Oh the underground mall at the subway station has more hanbok accessories and I found them a bit cheaper there. Walk around first!"
"""Hanbok and Food """," Gwangjang Market was really fun. There were a lot of street food, and quite a lot of people there so it was really lively! If you want to get some good Korean food, this is the place to come. The food stalls sell bindaetteok (Apparently, a store called Soon E Nae , 순이네 is popular among the locals), mayak kimbab (Translation: drug Kimbab, because it's addicting), sannakji (cut octopus legs that is still 'alive' while you eat them. My mom and I ate all of them, but the 3 people from China sitting beside us, didn't even eat one, they just kept looking in wonder), Ddeokbokki and more! They also sell banchan, (Korean dishes eaten with rice) so if you want to eat something that Koreans would usually eat, you could buy some, cook or buy some rice and eat it where you're staying at. And last but not least, I got to see some amazing hanbok here. I'm a fan of Hanbok, so it was really nice seeing all the hanbok stores.  "
Variety Stuffs in One Place,This market is great for shopping and dining. Many traditional food stalls around the area. You also can buy fresh vegetable & fruits here. Don't forget to check the Hanbok & souvenir shops.
Used to love this place,"Used to love this place when I visited in 2012. Then, it was less crowded and had more locals shopping around. It was more spacious and unexpensive.Back here in 2015, and the market is packed to the brim with tourists and Koreans (60-40), pushing each other to get around the food section of the market. And somehow the food has become so expensive too, 3000w for 1 odeng, which is ridiculous since elsewhere it is possible to get an odeng for 500w. Only come here to experience the market feel, and try some food if you want. But bear in mind it's a tourist rate :("
Come here on an empty stomach...,"As all Korean markets, the centre of this market is also covered in food stalls. Beckoning store owners fighting for your business show case all sorts of traditional Korean pancakes, ricecakes, fish sticks, fried foods and...this is also the place to try Korea's famous raw beef - Ukhye/Yukhoe/Yukke (however it is romanised).Secretly tucked away are a couple of small stores that sell souvenirs here as well and this is where I always come to buy my souvenirs as they're slightly cheaper than Insadong. Don't expect to find everything you want here though due to its smallness."
So much food to taste!!!,"I prefer traditional market as there is so much to see, eat and buy!! of course there is difficulty as some speak very little English but still it was a pleasant experience. "
"Shopping, and where Locals do their shopping","For shopping hit here, you can get the best deals, and they have certain nice tissus, traditional Clothes, and products , near by the Metro station "
Best of the markets,"Whilst everyone flocks to Namdaemun, I steer my visitors to Gwangjang. It's a more manageable size and can easily be accessed by a stroll along the Chonggyecheon Stream.The second floor is THE place to buy and get hanbok (traditional Korean dress). Seoulites of a certain caliber come here just for this. It is a photographers dream up there and a foodies paradise in the central circus of the covered market."
Be a local at this Korean market,Loved experiencing the food and people at this market. Be a local and try the food at one of the stalls. We indulged in some scallion pancakes and ddukbokgi (spicy rice cake). Many of the bigger spots also have English menus!
Very Traditional Korean Market,"Lots of hot food, great for a cold day, just sit down on a warm bench seat and tell them what you want. This market is used a lot by locals and has fresh produce such as Meats Fish Fruit and Vegetables as well as clothing and fabrics"
A Bit Overrated,"I saw reviews about how good the foods here are, but actually when I came here there are nothing that's my tongue gonna missed I came here and tried its bindatteok (mung bean pancake) because I watched Running Man and it seemed like they enjoyed the food like sooo much... But when I tried the food, it's basically a fritters with some vegetables. Some nice ahjussi offered me another kind of bindatteok (they claimed it was much more delish than the one that I tried) but when I asked them, it was another kind of bindatteok with pork (I am a Moslem, so I dont eat pork).Another thing that I tried was their mayak kimbap (drug kimbap) which famous for being so addictive, but it's just an ordinary kimbap with smaller size. The odeng was also not as good as the one I tried in another street vendor. But for the experience, you might visit this place for sightseeing and seeing locals since there are many locals spending their time in this touristy market."
A good market for eateries & shopping,"I like this market for its diversified products from expensive to low range prices. The local foods are alike their countryside dishes so good, so moderate prices. Souvenirs are the best, bargain for wholesale price. Cameras, scarves, clothings you name it. Stop by a Starbuck for beverages, sweets same as home. You can spend 3-4 hours wandering from shopping to window shopping is an enjoyable time.I love this market."
Awesome,"Try everything, from the sashimi foodstalls to the off the aisle korean hot pot diners frequented by locals."
Great Local Seoul Market,"On my last day, my local friend and I spent the day wandering around various markets.One of the most well-known is Gwangjang Market in Jongno-gu.The market is covered and is packed to the rooftops with stalls selling everything you can imagine.The highlight are the food stalls, with amazing smells overwhelming the senses.We stopped at a family stall and planted our bums on wonderfully heated seats.We were treated to simply delicious pancakes, vegetable and meat with a pickle of diced white onions in soy sauce to cut through the pancakes - heavenly!"
Experience what the locals eat and do,"Its a good idea to visit this place early in the morning. Then you can see and experience the locals shopping for groceries and having breakfast. There are loads of stores selling vegetables, meat, seafood and of course, kimchi. Also there were stores selling clothing, textiles, housewares, etc.We ate the pancakes and also tried a dumpling noodles soup for breakfast. It was decent and filling."
Local Feel,"We went there around 11am and were stucked by the continuous people flow. Tried with patience to follow the flow to see all the food stalls inside the markets. All the traditional Korean food such as green bean cakes, cakes with pork, knife slicing noodles, dumpling, seafood, sausages and pigs knuckles are available at good price. Again, eat and go. Don't expect comfortable environment. Apart from food, the shops on 2 sides of the walkway are selling dried seafood and other local household items. A good local feel and experience."
Be a local,"This market is near to Jongno 5-ga station and Euljjiro 4-ga station. The place is for locals so it becomes noisy after 9+am. We headed to the food sections for breakfast. We sat down on the bench and tried the bindaettok (pancake), just like the locals would."
Interesting market with local fois,"The market is popular for the locals coz there are many food stalls selling local Korean food including dumplings, fried fishes, deep fried pancake, Korean sausages, seafood etc. at reasonable prices. The market is very lively at night and crowds gathered there for food and drink. There are also fresh food stores as well as groceries. Suitable for people looking for local Korean taste."
Experience all aspects of traditional and local Korean culture,"We visited Gwagjang Market (also named 'Kwangjang Market' on some maps/street signs) during midday until lunchtime. There are heaps of food stalls, selling all different types of foods - fruits and vegetables, savory pancakes, seafood (the all-famous live octopus), kimchi dumplings, noodles, miniature gimbap (Korean sushi rolls), meat dishes like pig hands and ""sausages"" etc.The next streets are dedicated to different things such as Korea's traditional dresses - hanbok, duvets etc. What's also convenient is that Dongdaemun Market is also nearby, which we took by subway."
Traditional Market Selling Local Food and Products,"We arrived at Gwangjang Market late evening; our main purpose is to try some of the popular local food (bibimbap, pancake, gimbak, etc). The place was crowded with diners sitting in front of the many stalls. Some of the popular stalls had long queues, probably the food taste better. We did not have much time therefore we scout around for those stalls that we are comfortable. The pancake and gimbak was ok and reasonable priced.I would recommend this place only to food lovers who like to explore the locals way of life and try the varieties of local food. You will also need to close an eye on the hygiene here, which is not of the highest standard."
Experience a local market in Seoul,"For those who look for a different experience other than shopping for cosmetics and fashion items in Seoul, drop by at Grmwangjang Market! Have a taste of a famous mung bean pancake and many other delicacies in very reasonabke prices."
Night visit to the market,Visited in the evening. This is more of a local night market and mostly food stalls available in the night. The fresh produce stalls were mostly closed for business. 
local food and products,This place is always busy. There's lots of local food to share with others. Lots of cute cultural gifts and hanboks. I really wish I bought a hanbok here (because it's custom made and ready to buy) but I didn't have enough time.Recommend to go here to try local snacks with friends.
Bustling marketplace,This is one of the great places to explore and experience the locals' way of life. There is a whole section selling cooked food that is cheap and delicious. Try the famous mung bean pancakes!
Food food food,"A very interesting place. I came on a public holiday (wrong day!!), it was super duper crowded. so definitely avoid public holidays. It was recommended by my Korean teacher because I said I want to eat traditional Korean food. No pasta, no bread, no pizza please. So she recommended this Gwangjang Sijang. Easy to access by public transport. I took a subway from Gwanghwamun. I think it was about a few stops away. I was going to eat sundaegukbap but I just remember that it's pork and my friends were Muslim. So we settled for some jeons (pancake). Most food are pork-based, or soups, very very traditional and a few look homemade to me. Love them to death. Bring a Korean friend! I spoke functional Korean languange for the purpose of the trip. But ahjumma and ahjussi (aunties and uncles) there can be hard to understand and they do not speak English, and you might want to know what's in what food. "
Not worth the trip,If you are looking for food. Then please do not go there. The hygiene and eateries and food are below standard. A very local place for the locals.if you are looking for a nice photography place where you can capture the local daily scene. Yes this is one of the place as the market has a long history.But remember which entrance you come from and which you are leaving towards. It is quite a big place and each way looks the same and you may get lost.
Getting touristy,"Its a bustling market with plenty of food stalls selling almost the same stuff - pancake pan fried. I like the late afternoons when there are very friendly elderly locals drinking and eating and if you dare and care, you could join in, buy a bottle of soju, order some food and sit on the communal long bench."
Family vacation,Love this market. To know the culture of the country. Many local stuff sold at this market. A lot of local food stores that you can just seat down and eat. The price is reasonable. 
Tourists beware of the prices in this Market!!!!,"I would urge all the tourists to pay close attention to the prices they are charging in the markets. I have attached a photo of the store I went to and they charged me 2-3 times as much for dinner in comparison to someone who is a local. I went to this store because of a lot of locals to begin with, besides the food seem interesting. Also, there was another food stand that charged me 3,000 KRW for rice wine that should be about 1,500 KRW. Overall you can get good food in the market, however please be aware of the prices beforehand."
The food alleys are a MUST SEE,"Personally I am not too interested in all of the fabrics and hanboks that are for sale here but once I reached the food alley I was in heaven! Never experienced anything like this - old Korean ladies in their small stalls cooking ddeokbokki, jeon etc, always having about 4 sitting spaces crammed around their little 'station'... we went for a jeon selection and it was a great experience! "
Old traditional market,"This traditional market is know for food and tradition costume call Hanbok. I heard the price used to be cheaper but since it got famous and became one of tourist attraction site, price went up. But it is still cheaper than U.S. so I did not mind."
So much to see and eat,"This is a very big indoor market with many, many stalls selling the same or very similar items. We sampled some interesting and delicious seafood."
Wide selection of tasty local delights,"Gwangjang Market offers more than 200 food stalls selling abundant variety of snacks from Korean rice cakes, bibimbap, noodles to soju. The street food stalls gets busy during meal time as customers formed queue to wait for seats to sit down to order and have their food. The food at Gwangjang Market is cheap and authentic.You can find traditional clothes and shoes, household items in Gwangjang Market too. You can spend many hours browsing through the wide selection of linen bed sheets, comforters, silk, shoes, souvenirs & apparel."
Many kind of hanbook and cotton fabric,"This traditional market sold many kind of hanbook (traditional costume of korean). If you also looking for korean cotton , you can find them here a lot. The fabric motif are beautiful.Some shops also sold souvenirs. The price can be reduce by bargain but do not go too low price when bargaining.Don't forget to try many delicious food here (korean food).Only walking 1 minutes after get off from MRT station."
Wanna experience real local korean market?,"You will see real local atmosphere in this market. Sadly the price nowadays became rather stiff since there are a lot of tourists nowadays after it got famous, But still they provide us with delicious local foods at reasonable..? price. You must eat alive octopus, raw-beef, drug kimbap and... you will see!"
Authentic Korean Market,"Such an interesting place just to wander around, even if the goods aren't what you'd want to buy. You can see all the traditional Korean clothes, fabrics and sundry clothing, household goods, some souvenirs and lots of street foods. There is a whole aisle of small restaurants and many even have an english menu. They looked pretty clean and I sat down at a place with huge stack of mandu (dumplings) and had a delicious warming dumpling soup, Even the bench was heated that I sat on and you got free tea that you helped yourself from a bottle, with your meal-all for W5500. A fun experience. The market is a short walk along Chongycheon stream from Dongdaemun."
Excellent Korean Market,"I went there to have breakfast and shopping.Local street food available in Gwangjang Market. All of the food here consolidated.Aside to that, you can buy literally everything here. From traditional Korean wear, Hanbok. To Kimchi, Ginseng, Seaweed, and even Korea food cutlery.Kind of regret going first thing in the morning because we end up with alot of shopping items to carry around.All of their things there are reasonably priced. Love that."
S.Korea's daily life happens here at this market,"For me, it was a very enjoying experience to be in this market, eating local dishes from different establishments, smelled that fresh seafood and see some souvenir shops here. Beautiful Korean dresses are a must to see. Totally recommended if you visit Seoul."
Great Korean Market,"Going here: take Line 1 to Jongno 5-ga station then take exit 7.Everything is here. From food, accessories, clothes, souvenirs and etc.We tried a lot of korean street food from spicy rice cake, fried squid, fish cake, blood sausage to mung bean pancake for very cheap price. Highly recommended for Korean market experience."
Food Heaven,Do try their man yak gimbab. The best in town. You can find variety of foods here. You can also buy fresh kimchi and seaweed here. A must visit
sound like scamming for some stalls,"we had lot food here.mostly were pleasant experience.but normally they expected customer to order more.went there mainly because we want to try mug bean Pancake,but they kinda like force us take a set of everything.that time i were really full and my friend cant help me finish it.we decided too choose own pancake variety,but the vendor ask us take away,not allow to eat there.some are very nice,they even feed us with food"
Probably all under one roof,"When in Seoul, this is one place that you should visit. From traditional clothing, souvenirs and certainly the various types of Korean food to try. Many humble street food stalls over here and they run till late. There's a lane for seafood where you can find ganjang gejang (raw crabs) to haemultang (assorted seafood stew), a lane for Korean pancakes, a lane for raw beef, a lane for dumplings and many many more. Gwangjang market is certainly not to be missed while in Seoul."
Just go!,"The hustle and bustle, sights, sounds and smells of Gwangjang Market are not to be missed. Definitely sample some of the food offered and the many stalls. Korean mung bean pancakes, dumplings, unknown dishes and more all at very affordable prices. Clothing, souvenirs, whatever! Just go!"
Great Experience!,"I took my husband here during our recent trip to Seoul. As a foodie, he really loved and appreciated this market. It was a great way to show him the various Korean dishes but in an environment with tons of energy. The food was inexpensive which allowed us try to various dishes. Also, the vendors were all very friendly and welcoming especially to my husband who is an American. Finally, it's great that this market is covered so a rainy day won't keep you away. I would definitely recommend stopping by here for lunch and walk around to check out the various food stands!"
A place for anything you want,"The market have many things that tourist as well as local looking for. From food to souvenir and clothing can be find here. Its good to see how local come to lunch here.For Muslim, beware that this eateries may serve pork eventhough they claimed that they just sell seafood."
Giant Indoor and Outdoor Market - Amazing,"This was my only trip to Korea (thus far), and we went to this Kwang Jang market (which I have seen spelled several different ways in English). It is HUGE - you can find just about anything here ... miles of clothes ... hundreds of street vendors cooking all kinds of Korea dishes. Be ready to walk a ton of miles because this place is HUGE. You will see some very odd items in the outdoor food area - like pig's heads, dried fish, etc. Some of it you won't recognize - but that is the whole point ... great to check oneself out of western civilization, and go experience this!I did try one of the Mung Bean Pancakes ... which are fried. It was pretty good - although my colleague was scared to eat it. ha ha"
Taste of local delights,"If you have a type of street-food that is on your must-eat list while in Seoul, you will most probably be able to find it here. Ddeokbokki, bibimbap, mandu, hotteok, odeng, bindaetteok, Korean mochi, etc. They have it all and taste great too!"
"To get a Korean food delight, come hungry!","By far, my favorite street treat is the Korean Pancake! For a 1000 wons, no better treat...The energy is fast and busy. Like a swap meet almost."
Variety of Food,"Variety of food and snacks. Selling ready to eat food, like kimbap, pancake. There is another section whereby they are selling raw marinated seafood. Ginseng can be found here too. Lot of local and tourists"
"KOREAN FOOD PARADISE, try it.. but please be carrefull with your bellonging",Korean Food Paradise... ^^ You can try many korean food in here. But carefull with your bellongings because this crowd place to just hang out.. 
Good choise for foodies!,"I guess its one of the best place to eat your hearts out in seoul with a decent price. Inside the market at night there are lines of food stalls fills with people. Dukpokki, dumplings, pancakes, raw squids, etc... you name it. recommended for foodies traveller. you can get to here from Jungno-3-ga St or Jungno-5-ga st. "
Awesome place!,"We've arrived this place a bit late, most of the shops are closed. But we have dinner at the stall in the market. Varieties of foods. Definitely will come here again when i visit seoul"
Good food place,Lots of food stall selling similar food.Therefore you have a lot of choice which stall you want to eat from.If you want to get hanbok it's available as well. There are also some marinated stuff which provided free tasting 
Soulful place,"If your into fabrics you'll love it! If your a street food fan you'll love it. It's a old time traditional market so it spoke to me in a profound level. It is warm, charming and ever so alive. I didn't encounter tourist hoard so if the local is your thing you'll love it. It's where the local elderly go to shop. Where if your staying for longer than a week Seoul, you can get hanbok made for cheap. It's an easy walk to Dongdaemun as well. "
Traditional Korean Market,"This place is exactly what I expected of a Korean market! It is filled with stores and stalls selling all kinds of things. You can buy chopsticks- ranging from cheap to beautifully carved and expensive, raw fish, fabric, souvenirs, etc. There are a ton of food stalls and stands selling some really delicious looking food. I had some bimbimbap made right in front of me. A word of caution though- very few people here speak English. If you have a food restriction (like you're a vegetarian) have the concierge write it out in Korean for you. Also you can barter for the things you want to buy. The woman I was with just typed the number she wanted to pay on the merchant's calculator."
A local market,"It is nice to drop by this place if you have some extra time to spare. A morning visit to this place allows you to see the local way of life. The place is segregated according to different streets selling the same stuff. Thus, one sector will have a whole row of shops selling traditional costume, one on food, one on souvenir and etc. It is a good experience to sit at one of the food store to have the stomach filled as well. This market is about one stop away from Dongdaemun and it's easily accessible. "
Nice to try local food,"Many Local food that you can try, the food that you can see in K-series included. also have many local goods. good quality seaweed.nuts."
Authentic experience ,Came here in the evening to have dinner and it can feel overwhelming at first. There are plenty of food stalls selling similar items. I plonked myself at one of the stalls selling Bibimbap and it was so delicious! Recommended if you want an authentic food experience! 
Unique experience ,Very unique experience. Come hungry and just sit on a bench and try something. Very crowded but worth it. One of the best things to do in Seoul 
Feel The Local Pulses Here!,"Yes, this is the market place crowded with locals and tourists. If you're afraid of language bearer, not to worry, most of the stalls do have helpers that speak Mandarin or simple English. You may not want to miss the various hot-pot offering in the tiny restaurants too.I prefer to go there near noon when the shops there are opened and you will get a lot of stuff there at good price. The kimchi stores there also offer air-tight packing for your shipment too."
Great Visit!,Went to the market based upon Parts Unknown Season 5 episode from Anthony Bourdain. Had the vegetable pancakes and Yaki Mandu dumplings. Very unique place-- haven't seen anything like it in the world. Must see. 
Oldest Traditional market in Seoul - Gwangjang Market,"Every time when I visit Seoul, I will definitely go to Gwangjang Market. The market is at Jongno 5 (o)-ga Station, exit 9 & 10. This traditional market has 3 sections, dining, raw food and products. Eating at Gwangjang Market is a MUST. We tried the Bindaetteok (Deep fried pancake) ₩4,000, Yukhoe (Raw seasoned ground beef with sesame and raw egg) ₩12,000, Boribap (barley with a selection of veggies) ₩5,000 and Steam dumpling ₩5,000. There were so many stalls selling the same foods and same prices, so my tip is to choose the stall with longest queue."
Cheap Local Food,"This market is selling authentic local food by the locals. You sit right in front of the stalls to consume your purchases. Great experience.There are also stores that sell clothes, kitchen needs, raw food, snacks etc."
Oldest continually operating market in Seoul and one of the best!,"LOVED the markets in Seoul, which operate nearly 24 hours a day and are equally busy at all hours. We spent much of our time in the food area, observing and eating. Took some courage, but on a recommendation we ate and loved the mung bean pancakes being fried fresh at many stalls, and drank local beer along with the super hot cakes. Ate fresh dates and explored the many stalls selling everything from traditionally embroidered clothing to sundries and souvenirs. This is clearly a place the locals use.We were super impressed by how friendly and open people were. They were very happy to share their country (and their table) with foreigners and seemed amused by our photo taking and deer in the headlights look!"
A food haven!,"This is the place to be for authentic and local korean food. It's a food haven where you can find your favourite korean food, street food, and local snacks. Love the gimbap and patbingsu here! Bought my seaweed and rice crackers from here too! There are also sections selling clothes, shoes, hanboks,cloth, souvenirs and all the little knick knacks! A must go place if you are in Seoul!"
Eat dumpling soup with the locals,"Amazing shopping, so many stalls of everything. Good souvenir place. Eat dumpling soup next to all the locals in between the stalls of clothes etc. It was a huge, giant, bowl of noodle and dumpling soup for 5000w. Noodles are made right in front of you! Delicious, extremely authentic experience. "
A traditional market with lots to offer,"Save your stomach and grab your breakfast at Gwangjang Market! There's plenty of food options and many people go there to buy kimchi, seasoned octopus & other seafood. We walked through a whole street of cloth and textile, shops offering customized hanbok and clothes. Very interesting experience to sit among the locals at a little stall while enjoying the food. I'm amazed at the Koreans' love for alcohol, it was not yet noon and many patrons had a bottle of soju or makkoli with their mung bean pancake. Oh, if you want to try the live octopus, it's available in Gwangjang Market as well!"
Food everywhere,"Well,all I can say is that food everywhere.from tteokpokki,bingsoo,bindaetteok,pajeon,naengmyeon,etc etc.it's not as crowded as namdaemun market.i prefer gwangjang market for sure.."
A fun place to take pictures,Many wonderful smells surrounding the food booths. Too bad we just had lunch. The streets were packed and everyone enjoyed their fast and inexpensive food.
My favorite Place in Korea,"The atmosphere of this local market was awesome. The food were very tasty and affordable. We ate Kimbaps, Jap chae, red bean/pumpkin porridges, sashimi, and topokki in there. We just couldn't stop eating in this place. There were so many foods that we still wanted to eat, but we didn't have enough room in our stomachs to the food. We bought some marinated crabs and octopus in Gwangjang market. Those Ajummas who sold the marinated food were so funny and nice. They even gave us a bag of other marinated seafoods for free b/c they knew that we haven't tried those marinated seafoods before. (In Gwangjang, those Ajummas will give you try the food before you buy. They will also give you free hot tea and yogurt drinks while you are picking the food --> awesome customer service)Besides food, we also found Korean traditional clothing, bedding stuffs and accessories in the market. It was so easy to find some good traditional stuffs for souvenirs. My friends and I love Gwangjang Market so much! We definitely will go there again! :)"
Silk and Macam Pasar Maran Pahang,"Anneyonghaseyo..hi. 1st time here. Walking through the shops on the streets. Lots of clothing shops and food stalls. My wife bought some silk scarf (10 pieces) as souvenirs for her friends the price are 5000 krw per pieces and got 2 pieces free from the seller. Thanks! Talking about the pasar Maran. Maybe only readers from Pahang Malaysia can understand of what I'm referring to. Kind of unbelievable on some area I can see the pasar maran here. Old folks are sitting on the ground, selling their agro stuffs like vegetables, herbs and beans etc. Reminding me at home."
Feel like you are on a travel show,This is a wonderful place to go IF- you are adventurous-you are with someone who speaks Korean or knows Korean foodOTHERWISE this will be overwhelming. However it is worth it!!!There is tons of shopping but I would good for all the little stalls of food. There are tons.Find a seat at a table that looks good and order or just point to what you want. This is the perfect way to try tons and tons of different Korean foods from dumplings to pancakes to seafood to pigs feet.If you love Bizarre Foods or Anthony Bourdain....this is your kind of place.
Like a wholesale market!!,This market was suggested by our hotel reception desk as we wanted to see some traditional shopping… this place is good for people who are looking to shop in bulk for business… mind blowing variety and stuff… you also tantalize your taste buds with local delicacy.If you have time do visit!
Nice eats,"We went there mainly for dinner and enjoyed it tremendously.We had mung bean pancake, pork pancake, fish cake, sundae (AWESOME! -aka blood sausage but subject to individual taste)rice cake (ok, the market's one was a bit too chunky for our liking.Gimbap (found it so so -, not too sure what the hype is about on people's blogs though)It was nice seating at the stalls and experiencing the market ambiance. "
Korejská tradice,"First visit was little bit confused, but the second one with Korean frind was amazing. He took us for some Korean food. We ate a lot. We loved topoki with meat. It is relatively cheap for such a big portions. Lots of Koreans go there even with whole families. You just sit there on a banch and eatiing a food. Very different experience than restaurants."
Frenetic Mainly Food Market,"Table after table after table of people sitting around big woks of cooking, some recognizable some not, food. Food being dished out and money being exchanged depending on the dish served. Seas of people coming and going. All very interesting and entertaining. At the other end are clothing shops. This is different than other markets. Authentic. Go!"
You'll feel like a bee in a hive,"For some reason, the name of this market (along with a couple of other sights) is alternately spelled with a G or a K. On my map it was spelled with a K and the sign over the market itself was spelled “Kwang Jang Market”. It caused me a little confusion, so I thought I’d just pass that info on.The market itself is magical. I’ve been to a lot of food markets over the years and this one is definitely up there in terms of intensity as far as your senses are concerned.Assuming you’re traveling during the shoulder seasons (Spring, Fall), the time to catch this market at its peak is just after the sun sets and the store/street lights begin to come on. Just walk right in and get sucked into the swarm of humanity. It’s a complete sensory overload and as you approach the nexus of the rows of food stalls, you’ll find it difficult to remain stationary. The human tides pulsing all around you will push you in one direction after another. No photograph could possibly do it justice; I ended up having to video-tape it in order to best capture it.This is one of a few instances where you will genuinely lament that you don’t have a Korean friend or travel mate who knows how to grab a seat, knows what the food is and how to order it (unless you know Korean, you’ll be reduced to pointing and praying for the most part), what sauce you should dip what food into, figuring out the cost, etc.I’ve rated it excellent because not only will you get a good, genuine Korean meal sitting alongside them, you’ll also get a sensory rush that will stay with you long after you’ve come home, but most importantly, you’ll get a glimpse into the very essence of Koreans and their relationship with food. Outside of being invited into the home of someone hosting a family get together, this is the closest you’ll ever get to a candid portrait of Koreans as their omnivorous selves.There are assorted shops selling various items along the periphery, but they’ll be little more than background scenery if you come at the right time."
Crispy bindaetteok pancakes and beef tartare,"Came here for late night eats with my friends. We had the crispy bindaetteok pancakes, soju and makkoli. They also sold bite sized gimbap and beef tartare. "
Korean food heaven,"A must see and do attraction in Seoul. A traditional market and a food heaven for the foodies. Also, the best place to find hanbok or souvenirs that may be different from the ones you find in Insadong. Tips:Make sure to come in an empty stomach. Plenty of delicious food, and very authentic. Don't forget to try bindaettoek, the specialtyIt's probably better to bring a korean friend that can explain the different food"
Best place to sit among locals and try local food,"You can a good variety of local food and snacks in this very well organised market. Stalls selling similar type of food would be clustered together, but the hawkers were very well mannered and we didn't experience any touting or hustling. We stall-hopped to try different food and were very curious, sometimes at a lost to how or what to order. But the owners or local patrons would gladly come to our help, and even taught us how to best enjoy the sashimi that we ordered. Walk around to find some souvenir before going home. A very enjoyable experience on the whole but read up on the opening hours/days before going!"
Cheap and tasty,"The place is chaotic, small, and it is difficult to find someone who speaks the language, but it is coolcoolcoolcoolcoolcoolcoolcoolcopiculturecult"
A great local market to visit in Seoul,"I gave this an excellent review because of the convenient location and I enjoyed the food but its not for people who dislike smelly local markets and unhygienic conditions. I love the vibe of the place as the place is abuzz with activity and colorful. You are spoilt for choice of dumplings, korean pancakes and seaweed rolls, but always ask the price and contents of these foods before buying because the fillings vary slightly from stall to stall. Look out for those that have proudly put up photos of their food/stalls being covered in local variety/TV shows as they are likely to be better than others, if you cannot decide which ones to buy from. The seasoned seaweed/laver/kelp snacks that come in packs of up to 16 individual packets are reasonably good here: you can bargain for lower price if you buy in bulk (e.g. between 5,000 to 8,000 won instead of 6,000 to 10,000 won). "
Experience real local food!!,This market is only about 15 mins walk from the place I stayed. I went there twice during my stay in Korea and it can be one of my favorite places in Korea! There are plenty of food vendors you can choose from. It's definitely a great spot to try local food!! You can also check those cute stores that sell many traditional bags and purses. A must go on the list!!
Nice local Korean food,Visited this market at night time. Plenty of foods and with mostly all the same food on most stalls. There are quite a few shops selling dried seaweed snacks and price can bargain....
Great Food and Great Shopping,"This market is so big, it could take a whole day to see everything. There's clothing, beautiful local Korean apparel for children and adults, shoes, fabric,etc. and best of all, FOOD! This is were you can taste everything Korean, from dumplings, seafood, noodles, all kinds of Korean delicacies. There are stalls with stools where you can sit and order whatever food the stall is selling. Lots of locals and tourists come here to shop and eat. This place is a ""must see""."
"An array of sights, sounds, smells and tastes","This is a must see for a visit to Seoul. There is so much to see and taste! Be it food, buttons, clothing, fabric...it is all here...in spades!!! A stunning place to wander and soak it all in!"
Market Tour,Good place to experience the local delicacies and shopping for Korean traditional product. A little bit crowded place with Korean people. Language could be a problem as no clear sign or english speaking hawker. Interesting place to visit to see the daily life of Korean people. 
OMG,OMG be prepared.....This market is unbelievable we stopped by several stalls to experience the local eats..DELICIOUS!!.. Be prepared for crowds and heat and take in the local vibe. A must see.
See Korea's Old Crusty Side!,"Fight your way through the sea of human trout rushing every which way as you jostle, bump and wander your way around this timeless market. Go here on a cold and or rainy morning and plop down at a booth to enjoy steaming hot, deep fried beandeduk pancakes dipped in sugar sweetened soy sauce and vinegar. Mmm. Wash it down with an ice cold makeoli. You can find all sorts of foods to stare at and eat here. And there are plenty of traditional Korean hanbok makers, cloth sellers and the like to visit or admire. Great place to people watch. Just keep an eye out for the motorbikes which for some strange reason are also picking their way through the jam-packed crowds."
Gwanjang Market,"Excellent, inexpensive street food that goes very well with beer! Could be improved with more variety. "
Traditional market,"This is the market that is always pictured for the traditional food- and there are lots of them. It doesn't really matter where you sit since they all taste the same to me. If you need to get your hanboks and textiles , this is the place for you. The clothes offered are more for the bigger and older clients I think."
Hot during summer,"Very very hot inside during summer.Food are very cheap, but not as tasty as other reviews or bloggers said."
Great experience,"Even if you don't buy anything, it's such a fun & huge place to walk around just looking at all the fabrics, lacquerware & food. I've been to lots of markets throughout Asia & this was probably the cleanest well laid out one. They often feel a little unsafe & cramped but Gwangjang Market is terrific. Prices were good too & they have people in red shirts on that help you with information about the market if you get overwhelmed with options."
Smell and taste the local foods in here,You can smell and taste the local foods in here. The vendor in this market are friendly and nice to talk to
Love this market,"This market has more of a local feel than some of the other bigger names. There is a phenomenal array of street food available. Even if you aren't ready to take the plunge and try some of the offerings it's worth a visit to take in the spectacle with your other senses. There are also quite a few shops with embroidery, traditional clothing, foods, and textiles. It is easy walking distance from Daedongmun (another fun area) and is accessible by public transit or the city for bus. The market doesn't really get going until lunch time on Sunday, I'm not sure how early it begins on week days. Definitely worth a visit."
A good place for eating,"If you like street food, you should definitely come to this market. you can even eat raw octopus there. "
Nice market to visit,Nice market to look at all the Korea items for sale -- Enjoyed the shopping and never felt threatened or pushed to purchase item - Nice market
Shop shop,"So many stuff here , decent price, go there after city hall. Some wholesale hair stuff here, such as traditional Korean dress, korean interesting food."
lots of interesting food options but just ok market overall,"if you want a WIDE variety of street food type options and want to eat local then this place is for you, but if you are looking for tourist style souvenirs then you are better off at namadaemun. gwangjang is not a 'must do' in my opinion but if you have time and are willing to experiment with food then check it out. it's a massive complex so you'll need to spend some time here"
Anthony Bourdain made me do it!,"I was just gonna go here to see what I can buy. But Parts Unknown season 5 premiered on the same night I arrived in Korea and Anthony Bourdain enjoyed his food here. So I decided to come here just for the food. It was heaven...but it might have been more of a hellish temperature. lol...with all the food being made right in front of everyone, this place gets really hot.I had soondae, kimbap, various kinds of pancakes and other fried stuff that to this day I don't know the name of. They were all good."
Paradise for foodie lover!,"This is definitely a paradise for Korean food lover! This market is huge and you can find everything here. The hawkers are friendly and able to converse in simple English. Lastly, strongly recommend to try bindaetteok! Don't miss it when you visit Seoul."
The best market in Seoul,"This market is huge and you can find everything. It transforms during lunch and dinner time into a huge food market. I came here multiple times to eat. The price is great, but you'll have to do a lot of pointing with your hands because very little English is spoken. Don't worry, the food is still amazing and you won't get hassled. Otherwise you can easily spend a few hours walking through the maze of shops."
The Largest Market in Seoul,"You will literally find anything here. From pins and magnets to tailors and cloth shops to pig heads and butcher shops. This place is a fun visit if you are into discovering places. Perhaps not suited with little children. If you are good at making deals you can buy stuff, but make sure to turn the price to your advantage^^ TIP: Once done here you can take a stroll along Cheonggyecheon stream."
Food market,There are a lot of korean traditional foods in gwangjang market and it's cheaper.. Must came with an empty stomach.. I love the bindaeteok so much.. Masisoyoo..
Amazing collection of shops!,"Must be the longest linear set of markets imaginable, at least 300-400m long. Atmosphere is great and lots of interesting clothing options. Not really clothes strictly for tourists but rather more local markets. That makes them cool. Our teenage kids loved this area. "
Another foodie heaven in Seoul,"This market is filled with food stalls, restaurants, fabric stores, some seafood stalls, etc. The main attraction for me is the abundance of local dishes. Stalls are set up at the same area usually will sell very similar dishes-which makes it hard to decide which one to go for. You will be spoilt for choice-kimbap, pigs trotter, soybean pancake (must try), raw beef, dumplings, bibimbap, glass noodle and many more. There are at least two hundred food joints. If only i have more space in my stomach to savour the yummy food. The market is pretty clean and easy to get to via subway. "
Find fresh ginseng & local cooking utensils ,"Find local food, fresh ginsengs, panchangs (side dishes), boiled fish cakes on a stick, and stores that sell local brass pots (1pkt of ramen size), and silver chopsticks, spoons, rice bowls (with cover) ... I'm crazy about Korean drama hence bought a set of everything (rice bowls, ramen pots, chopsticks & spoons). Price is reasonable too.My mom loves the fresh ginsengs here coz it's much bigger than those in Emart. Bigger ginsengs tends be somewhat sweeter in taste."
Excellent place for Korean food,"Excellent place to go eating ""local style"". Try the bindaettok (mung-bean patty), mandu (dumplings) or jeon (different pancakes). Go to the yukhwe-street for the raw beef sashimi, it is excellent! During weekends quite crowded, but still worth to try. Very Korean experience."
Fun and lively,"This is a great place to view all the great food that Seoul has to offer. It is usually really busy and you can find fresh food, prepared food, clothes and souveniors under the roof. Haven't had a bad meal there yet."
Traditional Korean styke utems plus,"This market is one of the oldest markets in Seoul. I purchased traditional Korean style items with saekdong design (rainbow style) items and cake baking & chocolate making mould, which can be used for soap mould. Very cute! A lot of colourful fabric items as well!"
The ultimate Korean traditional market experience,"This is a large market where one could easily get spend the whole morning/afternoon at. Every time I am in Seoul, I find myself visiting it at least twice during my trip. Love just walking around to look at the beautiful hanbok and accessories on sale. You can also find every day kitchenware, like ramen pots. Of course, one should not forget the famous food streets, where locals and tourists rub shoulders as they sit on simple wooden benches while dining. Some halal-friendly food options include ""mayak"" kimbap, pumpkin soup, raw mixed seafood platter and barley bimbimbap."
Food was overpriced and nothing special,"I went with some friends on Friday night, specifically for dinner. We arrived about 10:30 p.m. and only a few food stalls were open. The women who worked at the stall were friendly and not too pushy. We ate mixed jeon, sundae, jokbal (pig's feet) and dalkbal (chicken feet). The prices were a lot more than you would normally pay for this type of food- 10,000 each for the jeon and chicken feet, 8,000 for the jokbal and 7,000 for the sundae. Big bottles of Cass were 5,000 each. There were no prices displayed.I live in Korea so I've tried these dishes before. I was disappointed with the quality of the food, especially for the price. Street food is normally cheap and tasty with prices displayed clearly. It's possible that we were unlucky with the stall we chose, but in a city where there is so much delicious, good value food available, I wouldn't bother giving Gwangjang Market another chance."
"Gwangjang market for ""tourists only"".","My family holiday trip to Seoul on May 29-June 04 2015. One day we went to Gwangjang Market after visited Dongdaemun history and culture center, we walked about 25mins along Gwangjang riverside from Dongdaemun to get there. It was not as big as I read from some reviewers before, the whole build up of the market nowaday, is more likely for tourists visit spot not so much for local people daily market buy and sell activities. The stall keepers are more likely to push their foods and stuffs to tourists and be aware that the price of those food stuffs are very much higher than you pay for in any other place like Myeongdong. We got 2 adults & 2 younger kids went to a small stall and sit down before you are ready to order the stall keeper already come out with big plates of varieties snacks foods you didn't odered and before you say NO they just bill you total cost KWN50000.Overall Gwangjang market sell similar things you can find in many other Korean street markets, if just to explore and experience I would say no problem with it."
Cultural Fun and Eats,We checked this place out on our second last day of our trip which was raining. The more cultural stores that sell the traditional Korean merchandise closed around 6-7pm but the food market was amazing. It was so happening and vibrant and the food looked amazing from all the stands. A great way to eat with the locals and at the same time take in the sights and sounds Seoul has to offer without breaking the bank. There was lots of selection of traditional Korean dishes. Pick and choose what you love and follow your nose. 
Tourist Trap!!! Not Worth Visiting,Um..what the heck is everyone talking about in this reviews??? This was the most bizarre market I've been to in Asia. There were basically 4 sections of the EXACT SAME FOODS for all the stalls. 1 section dedicated to animal intestines. 1 section for pancakes. 1 for misc. etc. It was so bizarre. There was no variety. Crowds packed inside. This is a definite TOURIST TRAP. They bring all the Chinese tourist in here to pack it up. Not worth visiting.
Great for Seafood Pancakes!,"This place has the biggest selection of seafood pancakes I've ever seen. I'd never had one before this, but they were soooo good!! There was also a ton of other local food there being sold by street vendors, and a lot of it looked amazing (except maybe the pig snouts).I didn't find much else here. It seems to be a local textile market, so if you know anyone that likes to sew or collects buttons, then this is a great place to go!"
"Great experience, especially in the winter","I lived in Seoul for two years, and every single time I had a person visit me, I would bring them to Gwangjang Shijang. This market is great for three reasons: the delicious bindaeduk, the great atmosphere, and the massive thrift shop on the second floor.Bindaeduk:Bindaeduk is a Korean ""pancake"", but it's not sweet at all. In fact, it's kind of salty and you dip it in soy sauce. Trust me, you HAVE to try it, and after living in Seoul for two years, I'm convinced that you HAVE to try it at Gwangjang Shijang. Sharing some Bindaeduk with Makoli - sweet and thick rice wine - is a match made in heaven. Atmoshpere:The market it set up so that there are dozens of vendors who all have their own small booths with heated benches. The market is technically inside, but there are huge entrances without any doors so it's cold in there. I like to drink makoli in the winter time because it does a great job of warming you up. Sitting on a heated seat, drinking makoli, and eating bindaeduk is so delicious and cozy; it's an absolute must do. Thrift Shop:The thrift shop has tons of clothing from easily one hundred vendors. I have bought a bunch of clothing from there that I still wear years later. As an American who lived in Korea for two years and LOVES Korean food, I would have to say that 80% of the food in this place is not the best. The other twenty percent consists of bindaeduk and the various porridges offered, which are fantastic. In conclusion, this place is great and I think that it should be a top five attraction if you're visiting, especially in the winter. To be able to sit down with friends on heated seats, drink makoli, and eat delicious bindaeduk is one of the coziest and most enjoyable things that you can do in Seoul."
Food heaven,"You can find all kinds of local food here in this market. people can sit in front of the stalls, pick and order their food. pay after food. I tried the 호박죽 (pumpkin porridge) and 떡복이 (Tteokbokki). The price is still reasonable. However, when i walked around the market, i found that some of the food are not cheap either. They are more expensive than other places (same food but different price). They even sell food that you may not even think of trying. (just saying). Overall, nice food."
Gwangjang Market: more than just a market.,"When it comes to the word ""market"", most people would think it's the place to do grocery shopping (i.e: buying vegetable goods to cook for next meal)Gwangjang Market has more than that. If you're looking for traditional hanbok (for grownups and children, ready made or custom tailored ones), this is the place. Also, one of many places to have traditional food like the bibimbap, tteokbokki, patbingsu and bindatteok."
Great for hanbok hunting and kimbap cravings!,"This is the best place if you wanna shop for authentic and beautiful hanboks plus everything else that goes with it from hair accessories to shoes! Go around and you'll find more Korean handicrafts like wood sculptures, even dolls or wonderful bags for great souvenirs! This is also the place to dig into what they call the ""drug kimbap"" or gimbap! We had it for breakfast along with fish soup and it was yummy! Choose from many ahjummas selling wonderful eats at the center of the market and you'll have a memorable meal. Pass by here, it's definitely worth it! "
Delicious Street Food. Souvenirs. Worth a Visit.,"Anyone who plans to go to Gwangjang Market must come with an empty stomach, empty backpack and a few thousand KRW. Get ready to try all sorts of street food. Souvenirs are very cheap here compared to other places. Dresses, shirts, bags, shorts, caps - you can find anything you want here at a good price.Two things about the market that impressed me the most. The market is really clean, no rubbish, no foul smell at all. And the market was very well managed, the stalls/shops were organized well. Most food stalls had a number, making it easy for everyone to know which one to go to.It's where Seoulites dine and socialize too. This is one of the best places to experience life in Seoul."
Amusing market with yummy pancakes,"Always amusing to visit this market for the pancakes and rice beer. The raw beef dishes are good too. Always busy and noisy, but fun to watch people eat various strange foods, and the strange goods for sale."
"Local Market, traditional foods","lots of local foods, tradition souvenir shop.most famous market in seoul, must visit place.food is awesome."
Place to fill your stomach,"It is a wholesale market where one can buy fabrics, hanboks, beddings, shoes, bags and dried food. Do visit the Eatery Alley where one can savor generous portions of reasonably priced street foods like jeon ( pancake) , yangnyeom chicken, kall-guksu ( noodle soup), bulgogi ( grilled beef slices), bibimbap ( mixed rice of vegetables, stir fried beef and egg) ."
Traditional foods galore!,"Gwangjang Market is located near a subway station and you need around an hour to explore all the stalls. There is a place that sells Korean hanbok, it consists of many stores located in one place. I also heard there's this secondhand clothes market but unfortunately I didn't go there. I tried the famous bindaetteok and Korean pancake (with veggies and meat). A Korean natives who guided me said that the place where I had my pancake is the place where the American director Tim Burton ate the same meal. I can't remember the name but the place is quite small and you have to queue to get inside. Also, you will be asked to leave when you are done eating because the queue is extremely long!"
Hanbok heaven and great food ,"I purchased several childrens hanboks here. There is one stall selling kids hanboks in the upper level hanbok market, and several stalls on the ground level. Kids hanboks are $60 and up. The food market portion is fantastic! Try the fresh and piping hot bindaetteok. "
korean food heaven,"great variety of food but some might be just soso. So, the best way to try out is to go with few friends. u can go from stall to stall ( hop stall). share the food and the cost! eat all u can!"
Quite an experience.,"It's quite a large place, so I suggest that, when it comes to food, you walk through the whole place at least once, before deciding what you want to eat. Basically, you have 5-6 main sections/areas, determined by what food the stalls are selling (in a specific area, all the stalls would be selling the same things, such as the stalls selling fried pancakes will be located next to each other, while the stalls serving live octopus and fresh seafood sashimi are located together etc).Eventhough most of the stall owners don't speak English, they'll serve you with great enthusiasm. The seafood served here is very fresh - and if you're not squirmish about swallowing a still-wriggling tentacle of a baby octopus, it really doesn't get any fresher than that! And of course, they are well-known for their famous fried pancakes. These come in various varieties, such as the ones made with only mung beans, another made with mung beans and pork and yet another from mung beans and seafood. Served freshly fried and piping hot, with sliced onions in a dark vinergary dipping sauce, this is a tasty snack that will fill you up quite a bit. And then of course, for pork lovers, you'll find lots of that here for you to tuck into, everything from 1 end of the pig to another, both as hot and cold dishes.Besides the food stalls, you'll find many other stalls and shops at Gwang Jang Market selling a plethora of things, from all sorts of kimchi, other pickled items, dried fish and seafood, to handmade bags and shoes; from fresh vegetables, fruits and fish, to ginseng, seaweed, cookies and traditional hangboks. It's an enjoyable experience while visiting Seoul - especially for trigger-happy photography enthusiasts!But take note that it can get very crowded, so it's always a good idea to watch you belongings at all times. Always better to be safe than sorry."
Good Food but Pick Carefully,"Went there on a busy Tuesday evening for dinner.We didn't check out all the stalls available coz it's quite big & we were hungry. We only walked thru the right lane to check out the food stalls. After noticing the food were similar, we settled at a stall with many customers thinking that it may be a good deal.We had the famous pancake, the stir fried glass noodle (japchae) & the braised pork knuckle. The pancake was really delicious while the japchae was a bit over seasoned with pepper. The pork knuckle should be tasty if it's not served cold but I guess it's the way they eat it here. Total costs 15k krw.Be careful when you are not speaking Korean, they might mistaken that you wanna order although you only wanna ask wat the dish they are selling.After dinner we walked the other aisle only to find out that there are many other variety of food there.Tips: check out all the stalls to decide what you wanna eat. Be careful with your belongings coz you are not in a restaurant & there are always people passing by/behind you while you eat."
Lots of delicious food!,"Saw this place on Runningman. The food selection there was amazing! Pancakes were delicious and so were the noodles. I was too stuffed to eat anything else. However, the beautiful colours of all the food being sold will make you salivate. A visual feast! A treat for the avid food photographer!Do not go on a Sunday if you wish to see more than just food as most of the other shops are closed (only food stalls remain open). If you are only going for the food, well then, sundays are okay. :)"
Amazing food,"Our host recommended this as a traditional Korean market and I am glad we took her advice. So much food, we wanted to try everything. The pork chops and the fried veggies were the best. Also very cheap."
Pancakes and Sake,We arrrived reasonably late so many of the stalls were closed; however the primary reason for going was to sample the pancakes with the fizzy unfiltered sake drink. Amazing! Two options - meat and vegetarian (I am a meat eater but have to say the vegetarian ones were much much better).
go for the food,The food section of the market is extensive - and very interesting. Just go around and try what you like
"Good food, worth a try","We came to this market twice, first time we just stumbled upon it without realising how famous this market was. Our initial visit was after we came up after a stroll by the stream. It was late in the evening, bustling with people and food stalls which was really exciting. We had already eaten so didn't eat anything that time. Second time we visited to eat (also after being recommended this place by a friend and on tripadvisor). We had the moong bean pancake, yellow coloured pancakes (bin-dae-dduk) at one stall which had seating inside and upstairs. Due to communication issues we didn't realise that the pancake wasn't vegetarian although since it was chicken and bacon (and no beef) I was fine with that - it was very tasty! It was 8000 won for one pancake with meat which we shared, which I think is great value especially as we were also seated inside in a restaurant like place, inside a market - quite cool! If you're vegetarian find a way to say only vegetarian pancake in Korean, no one seemed to speak in English or at least can get confusing.We also found a bbq stall, here they were making pork burgers and chicken barbecue as well as these fried chicken things (breaded chicken in little cups). One pork burger (just the inside bit) was 3000 won served with ketchup. And same cost for a cup-size of breaded fried chicken pieces - these were tasty too, the breaded coat had a nice flavour of spices. They were both tasty! We visited the second time on a Sunday afternoon, some of the shops were closed, and it was much less busy - which was a good thing as we could find a place to eat easily. We also went there when it was crowded on a Friday evening so we knew what the actual vibe was like, which was fun too! "
I was robbed here - my bag was stolen!,"I might be biased while doing this review, but I got robbed here. My bag was stolen with IDs, creditcards, mobile phone, glasses, etc. It was late around 9-10 pm. there were nor many people around, however some few stalls were open. We had dinner there, and it was a nice atmosphere and food. Everything seemed to be friendly until the bag disappeared . I put the bag just next to me, in a moment I turned over to talk to someone sitting on the opposite side my bag was stolen . We managed to see the guy run after but with no success. We believe he we watched for some time before he decided to robbed me . It was my fault, i should have been more careful, and keep it tight on my body but I had the impression it was a safe country and a safe place. However, it doesn't seem to be the case. If you go there take a lot care of your belonging , especially if you eat and drink soju. It was a bad experience for me, spent hours at the police station (till 3 am) who could not understand well English. I regret a lot having gone there. I wish I wouldn't. Instead I would have gone to another market."
A market for local food at reasonable prices,"This market has a wide mix of local food stalls and shops selling anything from food, clothes,kimchi, preserved Korean delicacies, kitchen utensils etc.But food was obviously the main attraction here particularly the pancakes. There are other local food that should be tried as well.We tried bimbimbap at one of the stalls. A huge bowl for only 5000W. Very good value & very 'local.' Also tried some of the strret food type food at other stalls."
Interesting market more for Korean food rather than shopping,Try the Jeon (Mung Bean Pancakes) and its interesting to look around the preserved seafood and vegetables stalls. A stop more to try out local snacks in a local market rather than shopping...
Pig out place!,"Went here mainly because of the food court! It was one of the best places in Seoul to experience authentic Korean food. I really enjoyed our lunch here! Was able to find and try out some KBS approved food stalls. Oh and if you love pickled vegetables, this is the place to be! Pickled radish, pickled cucumber, kimchi, you name it, this market's got it!"
Love the food court there but very touristy.,"It’s an indoor market. We went on a Sunday and some shops are closed so we headed straight to the food court. The food section were huge and busy with tons of tourists. There were many vendors selling the same food so walk around before you decide to sit down. We had many quick stops - Korean fried chicken, bibibap, fried green beans cake, fried pork cake, grilled red bean cake, bamboo-like juice, fried donut…etc… If you dare to try, vendors are selling live octopus (not sashimi, they eat them live). We also found a store near the food court selling cheaper ginseng tea and candies (with bargain of course)."
"Food, Glorious Food!","Wet market, probably not for the faint-hearted. Good place to find authentic Korean street foods sold by ahjummas. Just sit at the stall and ask away. A little Korean might come in handy to avoid irritating the ahjumma sellers; words like ""juseyo"", ""mekju"", ""eolmaeyo"" and your Native Korean numbers (hana, dul, set etc). Definitely the place to get the real local experience!P.S: Hanboks here are cheaper too! There are some hanbok tailor shops there. Unless you're a fluent Korean speaker, it is best to get a translator. I was lucky I brought along some Korean friends when I wanted to get my hanbok there."
Fun spot for an afternoon,"You can take a lovely walk along cheongyecheon stream and then end up at this market for lunch/tea.Terribly busy and crowded...so expect lots of jostling but a good place to try different Korean specialties, pick up sundries and even hanboks.Expect to spend a couple of hours at least!Definitely worth a visit.On the opposite side of the stream is another market which is haven for baking enthusiasts with cookie cutters and chocolate moulds."
Good market with a lot of cooked food,"This market is very good for vegetables and other edibles. It is mainly a clothing market and has little to attract tourists from a souvenir perspective, but the cooked food area has a lot of pancakes and fried goodies, along with lots of meat and seafood. Definitely a good choice for cheap eats."
Bustling crowded and one gets a good feel for the city/culture when you visit local markets,"Lots of food and clothes vendors. Interesting to see the different foods that are being sold. I love the onion pancakes. Shoes , clothes umbrellas are all very cheap. Just walk around and sample the local food/drinks. If you enjoy bargaining then you will get a chance to brush up your skills when buying non food items"
Gwangjang Market traditional tourist market,"It's a large touristy market similar to many markets around Seoul. The subway drops you pretty much in front.If you're visiting Seoul for a short while it's a nice distraction for a couple of hours with typical but tasty Korean street food. I stay away from any of the raw seafood due to a previous bad experience. BTW, the public toilet in the market is filthy so use the one in the subway before or after your visit. Do try the bindaeddeok (savory pancake). It's quite tasty there.People make a big deal of the mayak gimbap (rice and seaweed rolls) - meh. It's not worth the money.Soondae. You have to like bloodsausage. These taste funkier than European style but not bad. Jokkbal or pigsfeet. greasy but good.I wouldn't say don't try any of the food. You should. Just understand what you're going to eat.Lots of souvenirs and very Korean products like hanboks and local kitchen goods.Not a bad place to get tailored good. The fresh food and kimchi section is pretty cool. Lots of different types of kimchi to check out. Beware of the smell."
local market - go for lunch,This is a market for the people of Seoul - there are not many tourist shops and the vendors don't speak english. But a smile a bit of pointing and some tourist know how will get you by just fine. The many food stalls are very good - look where the locals are eating and what they are eating and dive in. You may not know what you are eating but I assure you it is delicious.
Traditional Korean market,"This is a great traditional busy market and well worth visiting if you want to see some of the more interesting Korean style foods. Some parts of the market are more specialised for food stuffs, while other parts focus on clothing (with an extensive Hanbok and linen market on the first floor above the market). I would recommend trying the Bindaetteok (Mung bean pancake) as well as Yakgwa (small honey cakes). A great place to experience some Korean culture."
Amazing food and Hanbok Tailors,Very impressive food section of the market along with an entire 2nd level dedicated to the tailoring of traditional Korean costumes / Hanbok.
"Great for sightseeing, be aware of rip offs","I usually think twice when I post negative reviews. I gotta say, since most of the reviewers seem pretty happy about the market I should make a reivew on different perspectives to let you decide if it's worth speding your money on.It's a huge market, the whole marketplace preserves the 70-80's sentimental atmosphere. Great to watch street food sizzling on the pan right in front of you. They will cut the food right in front of you. It's crowded and lively. Just be aware of rip offs at the food stalls(the rice cake and blood sausage kinds), when you order food in English. You probably wouldn't notice the rip offs if you can't read or speak Korean. They also rip off on Korean tourists as well. Common example 1: They will give different, way higher price for non-Korean customers. Common example 2: If you speak Korean, they will ask if you want to ""taste"" ""just a bit of"" something that you didn't order. It sounds like they are being generous and giving you some samples of it, it may sound like asking you to purchase a mini-sample of it. They will actually give you a generous sample portion. And you will get charged for full extra dish. The general set price (for Korean speaking locals) are expensive to begin with. The quality don't match the price. You will end up paying full-service restaurant food without knowing it ahead. Sanitation I have no clue."
Came here for the food!,"I saw this place on an episode of Running Man, and came here specifically to try everything that I saw! My sister and I walked around for a while, looked at the shops. We saw so many different food that we wanted to try, but we settled on one stand. We got 5 different dishes, maybe a few too many, we couldn't finish everything, and the ahjumma put everything in plastic bags for us to take back to our apartment. A great place to come for lunch if you're looking for some traditional Korean food, not from a chain restaurant!"
Great traditional Korean food!,Many fascinating things to look it! From souvenirs to traditional Korean food. Full of colours and many locals! Great place to go if you're looking for a great selections of cheap Korean food! To get there take line 1 to Jongno 5(o)-ga and take exit 9 and it's literally on your right as you go up the steps. Enjoy! 
Food and souvenirs!,"We went here with a Korean friend so it was not difficult to buy Korean Pancakes and Magkeolli wine. We ate with the other Koreans, and of course, it was privileged to experience eat in an open resto inside the market.YOu can see lots of food and souvenirs! We were not able to buy souvenirs as it was already late and we still have some places to go!"
Interesting place to say the least,"We came here because we had an overnight stopover in Seoul and were hungry at midnight. We didnt really expect much in terms of quality of food but I have to mention that this place is where I tasted the best bim bim bap ever. Period. I love Korean food and eat it frequently so it only made sense that the best bim bim bap you can ever have is in Seoul. Take the trip, its worth it. There are many stalls and food carts and I can' tell you which one is better than the others. All I can say is when we went there and ventured to eat, it was something that I did not regret and wish that I could back frequently just to have bim bim bap again."
Great foods~,"The foods are really good but can get quite a bit pricey. We didn't sit there and eat , had our foods take out. And most of them can speak Chinese which is really convenient. Actually there isn't a big variety of foods , you can see them selling the same thing stalls after stalls~"
Great place for dinner,"If you arrive late in Seoul, you can make a trip to this market for food. Many stalls selling the same kind of food, so it makes no difference. There are plenty of shops too, but I reckon they only open late at night."
Great Tourist Location in Seoul,"I would put Gwangjang Market in the top 5 must do places when visiting Seoul. There is a myriad of traditional food options in the market and almost all of them are extremely delicious. Whenever someone from home comes to visit me in Seoul, I always make sure they spend at least one meal at Gwangjang Market. Whether it is bindaeduk, ddeokbokki, mondu, kimbap, noodles, or whatever, you will be sure to find it here. Besides food, there are plenty of other shops for you to enjoy. Just go check it out. It's one of the best places in Seoul!"
"Enjoy a slice of local lifestyle and food, economically","It was my aimless walking that I stumbled upon this market. It was late afternoon like 5pm. A huge market with many sections, which includes separate lanes focused on selling textiles, crockery, etc etc etc.. But what surprised me was a FRESH seafood market too where you see all sorts of fish and shellfish laid on their tables. Also, they have multitude of preserved foods (like the condiments we get on the table when you order authentic Korean foods). A further surprise is that at the various junctions when the lanes collide, there are many mini-stalls selling food cooked in front of your eyes. Popular ones include seafood pancakes, toeppokki, pork head ears, etc... blood sausages, and many more.Great experience to sit and eat here with a glass of Soju to soak up the local culture and lifestyles"
Go for experience,"Massive market with many food stalls selling basically the same things, the spicy rice cakes, the rice rolls, mungbean pancakes, pig innards, kimchi dumplings. Nothing special for us but the atmosphere is good, I recommend to go to experience the vibe. We walked further into the market, past the food stalls and found a local restaurant selling fish hotpot. It was GOOD! Cant remember the name as it's in korean."
Try typical food here!!!!!,If you want to eat something authentic than you should try this market. Everything is fresh and prepared in front of you. With one or two bottles of rice wine ( Makgeolli) and a seafood Bindaetteok you start and after that you change to a different booth. There are sure 100 places where you can sit down and enjoy their cooking. And it's not expensive at all.
Massive,"It was massive, and probably not a destination if you have something specific in mind. Maybe good for a long-term traveller to explore, but not so good for a family on vacation."
The Original Open Market in Seoul.,"Gwangjang Market is the oldest open market in Seoul and may possibly one of the largest. There are miles and miles of vendors selling just about everything. The bean pancakes are the food items they are best known for, but there are many other dishes such as drug kimbap and pig's feet, Many of the vendors also sell dozens of buckets of side dishes and of course you can take a taste test before committing. It is definitely worth your time because you'll trip on just about everything there."
Nice food market atmosphere!,I really liked this food market atmosphere enjoying tasty Korean food and buying other food for to go! However this place is narrow and crowded! So ambiance is very hectic and somehow just OK!
Kimchee dumplings,Gwangjang Market was bustling with great Korean food stalls. The kimchi dumplings are great as are the mung bean pancakes.
"Another must see for the ""authentic"" markets of Seoul","This is a must see for the authentic markets and culture of Seoul. You don't have to eat anything (I would and did), but you must go see the food vendors selling bindaeduk (mung bean pancakes - delicious), wang sundae (large sized blood sausage), fresh seafood, pumpkin and red bean porridge, mini-rice rolls, and pan fried pork skin. Besides all of this, there is a large section selling traditional Korean hanboks (dresses) that must be seen to be believed. Over 4 years I took 8 plus groups of Americans there and everyone said it was the highlight of their trip. "
A hidden gem far away from tourists,"One of my korean friends took me here and the first thing to overwhelm me was the many delicious sights and scents of the various food options. Get a giant latke (i know it's not called that but for purposes of this review it's a pretty good comparison) with soy/vinegar sauce and some beef sashimi with rice wine. Lots of good food to be had at reasonable prices, and there are endless shopping options whether you're looking for tailored suits, traditional clothing, or just a pair of socks. I loved it so much I ate here twice."
Amazing Market,Loved this market and all the food displays. Great food and nice to see all of it displayed. They have clothes there but did not buy anything
Daebak!!,Taste of korean...great food...nice place.. The retailers here are friendly... The prices are cheap...keep it ip... 
Beware of tourist traps,"We arrived at this market in the evening and was eager to get some dinner. My friend wanted to try the Mandu, hence we approached one of the stalls serving this cuisine. We were approached by a Chinese speaking lady, in which she usurer us to the seats. We ordered 2 bowls for sharing (as we wanted to eat something else after this), but the lady insisted that we must order 1 bowl for each person. She claimed it is a rule here and everyone does the same. We complied. A while later, we saw a local couple just bought 1 small plate of mandu for sharing. They even brought food elsewhere to the shop to eat. We then confronted the lady and she gave lots of excuses on why others were exempted from this rule. But then, we had already finished all the food and paid here the money at the start. Hence, we are left with a full (but unhappy) stomach. Too full to try other food in the place "
Must see midnight Korean drunken business men madness,"Damn I loved that placeHighlight of my tripA vast neve ending market with a spectacular and crazy food section, insance variety of weirdarsed korean food, mot of it super yummy but most of it also super strange Blood sausages stuffed with glass noodles, kimchee filled dumplings, pigs ears and snout, Sea Squirts and some weird grub that I cant remember the name of, but in amongst that cool yoing couples, drunk old business men, yummy potato and seafood pancakes, Korean Sashimi to die for etc etc etcbest drunk at midnight for surebut fascinating sober at 9amdont miss it ! you will leave knowing more about Seoul and Korea than any museum could ever teach you"
Underwhelming,"I went here primarily to try the street food, but found the variety of food sold rather limited. We had pancakes, spicy rice cake, and kimbap. Other stuff we found as we walked along were mainly soup dishes or stuffed intestines. Every shop was selling the same usual things, and there were some restaurants. Unless you are looking to buy traditional Korean clothes, all the shops selling gifts were pretty much similar.The stretch of Myeongdong and all its street food had more variety than this place, although they were different food."
Great way to end a day.,"Easily accessible through Jongno 5-ga or Euljiro 4-ga station, Gwangjang Market is a fantastic place to grab a small bite to eat or a proper meal. The place tends to be crowded much of the time but that is also what gives it its character. Eating at one of the outdoor stalls, sitting next to the locals gives you a true experience of what its like to be a Korean and the food is truly authentic in flavour. It might be tough to get a seat at one of these stalls its definately worth the effort to do so. Overall, I feel that it is one of the best markets and it is definitely on my to-go list if I were to visit Seoul again."
Fresh Makgoli,"The vendors don't really speak English, so be sure to find a stall with other tourists sitting there, and ask them which dishes taste better! This is where you can get freshly bottled Makgoli, which you can't usually find in the convenience stores. Request for the brand that has a thumbs up logo on it."
The food wasn't that attractive to me...,Just a market like all the others... Not as great as it is hyped up to be... There is better value/interestingness elsewhere ... Personally I orefer insadong area...
Must see!,"It's an amazing place to go when you are in Seoul, you can shop for souvenirs for cheap price,And eat an amazing food. Try the bibimbap, kimbab and the bin dae dduck. "
Great place for eating.,It is a great place mainly for eating. The place is jam-packed with food stalls serving tasty treats at reasonable prices. However majority of the food is of the oily kind. It is not really a shopping place for tourists. The shopping caters more to the locals for the raw ingredients and traditional clothes and medicines. But it is an eye opener. It situates right next to Dongdaemun which is definitely a tourist shopping haven with shops in Migliore open till late like 4am.
"Shopping, food.",Enjoyed some tasty deep fried food. It was way too busy here for me. Narrow entries filled with tables. There is a major camera and accessory sales area here too... Take your pick!
"Awesome for food, clothes, textiles, and souvenirs","Was excited to visit this because of the reviews re Gwangjang being a foodie place, if you like cheap and varied street food. And I do, very much. I went on a weekday morning, so it wasn't as busy as it can be at night. From the entrance to the center aisle, there were so many stalls selling clothes, packed food, and little Korean souvenirs. Prices were much cheaper than in Myeongdong market or in the malls, of course, so if you're looking to bring home some stuff for family and friends at home, I would highly suggest this place.When I got to the center portion, I saw all the food stalls who were only just preparing to open for the day. This was around 10:30AM. Again, if you like cheap and good street food, this is the place to be. Stalls and stalls of traditional Korean fare. I chose a stall that sold noodle soup. As a bonus, they had an English menu. For 5000 Won (roughly $5), I got their specialty noodle dumpling soup. The noodles and the dumpling were handmade. They even cut and cooked my noodles before my eyes. Everything was served hot and fresh. It also came with two sides: kimchi and another vegetable dish. And the taste was fantastic! Felt bad that I couldn't stay longer, as I wanted to sample as many of the stalls as I could.I would highly recommend Gwangjang to budget travellers or people who like checking out markets and sampling street fare."
Interesting,Nice place with great food. I had Topoki and sushi. I think it is a good thing to have on your Seoul todo list.
Accidental find,"We were searching for one of the gates and came across this market. So packed and sooo lively. It was a good experience, but didnt get anything. It was soooo hot that day"
Crazy busy at night,"We only visited at night to try the food eats. Very fun atmosphere, great mung bean pancakes. I imagine it would be fun to explore during the day."
"a variety of products of clothes, fabrics, kitchen appliances, food and more","I went to Gwangjang Market for research. So I looked around carefully. You can get a variety of clothes including Hanbok(traditional Korean costume) in a cheap and reasonable price, fabrics, kitchen appliances and more. Another reason tourists visit is the food; Mayak Gimbab, Jeon(Koraen-style pancake), Sundae(pork roll), Jokbal(pork hocks), Tteokbokki(seasoned rice cake) and many more. Why don't you traditional Korean market food in busy and festive street?"
Great place to try Street Food,"When in Gwangjang market, we highly recommend the mung beans pancake. Go to the stall with a long queue. The pancakes were light and tasty. The price was reasonable. Its a great place to try out their street food. We could not try out all the food but at least feast with our eyes. Gwangjang market was a good place to mingle with the locals and experience their cultures. The market was crowded so we were assured that food should be fresh.Should we be in Seoul, we will go back to try out more more food."
perfect place,"Perfect place to taste authentic Korean food from vendors specializing in particular menus. You can eat, drink (soju or Makgeolli) and relax watching crowd going by. You can feel Korea there.I tried kal-mandukuk in vendor No 13 and mandu in vendor No 70. Both just great."
"Food, food, and food!","You will only see only stall that sell street foods. Not only Seoul foods but also another place's food you can find here, such as bibimbap from Jeonju and hotteok from Busan.If you are a food lover, this place is worth to visit!"
Korean Traditional Market,A great place to experience Korean local food where a lot of Koreans actually come here to have their dinner after work. Most of the food stalls here are manned by ahjumas (middle-aged women) and they couldn't really understand English. Food being ordered using hand and sign languages. A perfect place to enjoy cheap local food and experience the local culture. The mungbean pancake is one of the must try here.
Good food and atmosphere!,"Decided to come here as part of our itinerary after seeing it on Running Man.This is the place to go to try out and eat their local food. (Go to the food section, exit 9 is the nearest once you alight from the subway)Food is really good, you'll see locals/couples coming here to eat also.There are other sections in the market but we only explored the clothing area where there was a lot of Hanbok being sold (especially children one, good place to buy if you're getting it as a souvenir or gift) and camping outfits."
Interesting Market!,"From fruits, vegetables, apparel, household items, hanboks, wedding items and yummy food... it's a market you can't miss when you're in Seoul.Try bindaetteok (mung bean pancake), eomuk (fish cake), pumpkin porridge, mayak kimbap, boribap and so much more."
daebak!,"fave traditional market in Seoul as its located strategically between City Hall and Jongno area, and it has a lot of food that you can try on . i especially love the mung bean pancake and the fresh bibimbap where I feel its very local. You will see many shops will have some photos with Korean star as Running Man show actually was filmed in there last year ."
Foodies Dream,"Loads of stalls selling street food, kimchi and other delicacies. You can just sit at one of the tables have eat whatever they are selling for a really cheap price!Only downside is it looked a little grubby and the meat looked like it had been sitting out for a while which no refrigeration. Well worth the visit to have a look round!"
prepare your tummy for tasty food,"very crowd market, especially in food area. I tried gimbap, odeng, tteoboki & mug bean pancake here. its so delicious. most stall seller was ahjumma (old lady), and they can't speak english, so we can only use body language here."
GREAT street FOOD!,"NICE, culturally different, and hard to navigate, but its not a bad place to experience. Plus, the food there is not that bad. Its cheap and affordable if you are into Korean street foods. "
best place to buy korean food,"lots of shop in here and it's very famous because of some TV station broadcast about this place.well known as traditional market which sell various things and cheap, such us sandals, fruits, food,cooking ingredientsi visited this market because i wanted to try cheap and delicious food and snack.the shop seller will call you friendly. they will know you tourist vibe then communicate using broken English.. hahaha.. but, it's ok, we still understood and fortunately one of my friend can speak Korean a little bit. i picked the shop randomly because for me all looks the same. we bought a set of tteokbokki, kimbab, omuk, japchae and we payed around 10.000 won. i also tried patbingsoo and payed 4000 won. for me, all are delicious.."
Excellent place where to enjoy Korean traditional market. ,"Excellent place where to enjoy Korean traditional market. This the first (Oldest) daily market in Korea. You can enjoy market and market food. Bindae Ddeok, Beef tartare, Pork, Ddeokbokgi, etc. Another thing to enjoy is Hanbok. This market started with costume (tailer made) in the beginning. Here you can make your own Hanbok. * Hanbok is Korean traditional dress and jacket. "
A Feel of Authenticity!!,"If you want to have that authenticity feel of letting yourself get bedazzled on how it is to live like a Korean even just for the aspect of getting a snack (maybe after work, school, or for whatever reason) at a local market, then this is a MUST. Delicious foods are lined up which is a feast for your eyes due to their vibrant color, nose due to the enticing aromatic scent of the street foods, and ears due to the noisy but comforting calling of the food stall owners (even if you don't speak Korean).After scouting the whole place, we settled around the middle of the market wherein one of the food stall had many guests lined up. Yup, it's up to our instincts! (though there were posts or pictures wherein they were featured in SBS or KBS ~ I think, if my memory serves me well). Nonetheless, we were happy with our choice. As soon as we got seated, one of the lady servers asked us on what we would want to eat (IN KOREAN or CHINESE I think), one my friends tried to converse w/ her in Chinese but her Chinese was well quite rusty, hahaha! then the couple sitting beside us in the long table helped us, they spoke to us in English and then translated back in Korean to the lady server, they even offered us their wine, Chamisul. It tasted really good!As soon as the food arrived, yep, we were in authenticity heaven! :)) the food was really great and the feel of the local market made it even more savory for me and my friends. Awesome experience! a must visit place! :)"
Great experience of a local market,Gwangjang market was a great first-time experience of local Korean markets but appears to cater more to tourists with the many souvenir shops there. 
Good Food! Recommended!,"I told my tour guide that I love to watch running man and he brought us here for the food. It was really delicious! I tried the famous gimbap and the really tasty pancake! I did also tried the vege-bibimbap there. It serves with fermented soy soup (i guess) i love it soo much! Even my 4 year old daugther kept on sipping the soup! The people around were extremely friendly (eventhough they were all talking in koreans) but im sure they're bieng nice as some of them handed coins and chocolate milk to my daughter! But it was a bit smelly though...mybe because it is a market place. Overall, the food is really nice!!!"
Awesome kimbap place,"There was a pancake alley, a kimbap and soup alley n a bimbibap alley. The kimbap is delicious. We tried the stall with the kbs sign and it did not disappoint. It's somewhere in the middle of the alley. We weren't charged for the rice drink we had at her stall too. Wasn't sure whether the aunty was being nice or that the drink was free. Either way, it was undoubtly one of the cheapest and best food i had in seoul."
Just okay ,"If you want to try local food, you should visit this place. For me, I just walked around for 5 minutes only. A bit overrated. "
A must go place,"This market is a must go place & you can try local food such as pancake, deokbbokki, kimchi..etc..you can eat like a king here. You can also buy colorful Hanbok here for those who likes Korean costume."
MUST eat local food here!,"Make the effort to go and see this market, find a stall and sit down and eat some dukbokki (rice rolls in chilli paste sauce) and watch the locals chowing down on food, its really an eye opener here and some of the food they are selling is interesting and so much colour, smell and flavour everywhere!I recommend taking the time to find this market - well worth it"
Excellent because it's typical.,"This market is a must...bindaeduk is the pancake of Seoul...delicious and fresh...they grind the beans, mix with various vegetables or meats and fry...crispy, tasty goodness. The market also has a costume store...you can look like a Queen, King, Scholar...bride, musician...wear one of those huge braided wigs etc. Lots of fun to go thru this tiny shop at one end of the main market. There is raw meat alley....Koreans have their own version of steak tartare and it is delicious. You can see foods for memorial services, crabs pickled in soyu, herbs, etc. all in one market filled with more locals than tourists."
I love this place.,"This market is full of local food. It is very lively and got a large variety of things for sales. There are a large number of kimchi shops, offering many different kinds of kimchi. The foods are relatively cheap. If you wanted to eat here, there aren’t much English signs, you would rely on body language and just have to guess what they are and accept the price they asked (but usually are not expensive)"
Best market for local food!,"LOVED the vendors - great food options, clean, and felt safe there as well. The textile vendors are on the outside and the inside is a hub bub of activity and food vendors. If you sit down on a bench, be prepared to be served food, try it and pay for it! So much fun. "
Must try the mung bean pancake!!,"The market is large, and there are a lot to see, like hanbok (Korean traditional clothes), souvenirs, the main thing is of course food. There are a lot of small restaurants and stalls serving Korean hotpot, raw fish, snacks, etc at cheap price. There are a lot of stalls selling mung bean pancakes. Try to find those that are making and frying the pancakes freshly. (And even better, look for the crowded stalls). My friend and I ordered a mung bean pancake, really cheap (1 pancake costed around US$4) and really good and big (we were quite full after sharing 1 pancake)."
Eat with the locals,"Gwangjang Market is simply a food heaven!! I went during dinner time and most shops were closed and that's when the food trucks/stalls comes up. Many locals dine there too, mainly because the food was really good and it's relatively affordable. All the authentic Korean food can be found there! Do note that the area is cramp and with limited seating space, so it can be quite rushing if it gets crowded.To look at what I had, visit http://nkikichua.blogspot.sg/2014/03/wanderlust-seoul-korea-day-2.html"
Feast like a local!,"You have to check out Gwangjang Market for some amazing Korean foods. I only go here for the food market so I can't say much for shopping or anything else. It's a huge market so if you're a first timer, the size and the crowd can be a little intimidating. But no worries, most food vendors are used to tourists and several will try to sway you to eat at their stall. There are tons and tons of food stalls where you can get your grub on and I would say figure out what exactly are you craving for and just go for the stall that has an empty spot for you. If there's more than 3 of you, this can get pretty difficult especially if you come at a time when there's so many people. Not a lot of the vendors speak English but body language and pointing is enough to get you what you want. So once you point to what you want, just sit down and attack just like all the locals around you. Water (or barley tea) is free so you can just ask the food vendor (usually an ahjumma). It's definitely an experience especially if you feel like being adventurous with your cuisine. So have at it, they got bindaeddeok (sorry if it's misspelled but this is a grainier, thicker cousin of the pajeon, a Korean pancake), soondae (pork blood sausage, I loooove the soondae here!), pig trotters, sashimi, fried fish, fried everything else, meat skewers, made-to-order bibimbap (which I will try next time before I've stuffed myself silly with everything else), etc. Maybe get a bottle of makkeolli or soju to wash all the good stuff down. I just made myself extremely hungry now."
pretty cool market,"i have this peculiar interest about markets. i love watching people shop and make interaction in market, and you can see the ""real"" people of a city in the market. gwangjang is a very huge market, i got lost again and again (that i enjoyed!). the food market were awesome, so many people and delicious traditional food. i stepped to 2nd floor,where they sold beautiful fabrics for handbok. and finally i found the place i really wanted to visit: the section of 2nd hand clothes! i didn't buy anything, but i really enjoyed the view of great, vintage clothes and shoes (mostly leather and fur, since it was autumn), and the young people with trendy styles, bargain for the cool stuffs. if i were seoul citizen, surely i'd buy my clothes in this place. you can reach this section from the east gate."
Eat like a local,"We had dinner here on our first night. The locals eat here. I don't think none of the vendors speak English, so you just point to the food that looks good and be bold to try. Better yet, see where the locals line up and if you have time, go to the end of the line. We ate a delicious sweet pancake called hoddeok."
Fun shopping,"I bought clothing, purses, and had lunch all in one location. Everything was inexpensive and plentiful. It is crowded but most of korea is crowded. I shopped for hours and then had a cup of tea and a green tea cake. Great day!"
Local street food,"I went Seoul as a honeymoon trip. I went gwangjang market to look for souvenirs. The souvenirs are cheaper those sold in Namsangol village. They sell lots of hanbok too, we were thinking to buy hanbok for toddler but because the cheapest price was 80k won for such a small piece, we didn't buy. There were lots of local Koreans eating street food, so we thought the food served here must be closest to local's taste buds. So we tried sundae (pig intestines stuffed with glass noodles), fried jelly fish, pancakes, and pork knuckles. We were not used to the strong internal organ taste of sundae, but the rest are ok."
Embrace the Korean Market culture and Bindaetteok,"For more food photo and info, feel free to visit:http://chinchaijiak.wordpress.com/2013/12/26/gwangjang-market-embrace-the-korean-market-culture-and-bindaetteok/Gwangjang market was established in 1905, one of the oldest markets in not only Seoul, but the whole of South Korea. This multi-level market has about 5,000 shops and it’s a market that you can find everything, from snacks, traditional Korean food, bags, shoes, Kimchi, exotic seafood to the high-end silk, linen and the legendary Hanbok.Right at the heart of this market lies the food section that is bursting with activity and loud noise. The steam-filled alley contains countless number of food stalls that offers a vast selections of Korean food like Japchae (당면 sesame oil noodle), Gimbap (김밥 rice roll), Sundae (순대 blood sausage roll), Jokbal (족발 braised pig trotter), Patjuk (팥죽 red bean porridge), and the very well known item in Gwangjang market – Bindaetteok (빈대떡 Mung bean pancake).Among the food stalls, the one that stood out was those that are selling Bindaetteok, with stacks of towering golden-brown crispy pancakes that are freshly fried and served piping hot.I ordered the veggie version and the meat version, and both are reasonably priced at W$3,000 each."
Okay visit,"As a solo male traveller, I only found this place mildly interesting. I was not buying a Hanbuk or any other clothes or souvenirs, but it was interesting to walk along the side streets and see glimpses of local life.Truth be told, most of the souvenirs etc can easily be found at other areas in Seoul. The same can be said for the street snacks, though there seems to be more pancake stalls congregated here. Good to pass a couple of hours, especially as it it also near Dongdaemun retail markets."
For the food and Hanbuk!,"My intention was to get a Hanbuk. If you're thinking of getting one too, do bring a local with you. Easier for you to bargain and ask for the right design.The shop I went, the HanBuk on average cost around 120k won but it is out of my budget . After telling her my budget, she took out a few design which cost around 70k. In the end, i paid 60k won and she said that's the lowest price in town.Apart from the traditional clothes, there were queues everywhere. It was a Sunday , so I guess it is normal to be crowded. For those who can't handle spicy food , you may think twice before trying the pancakes , others like the pork intestines or kimbab are fine. "
"good price, interesting items","This is my first time visiting Gwangjang Market in Seoul. Surprisingly, so many traditional shops there, like Korean clothese (Hanbuk), Korean snacks, fruits, and cooking utensils, ...etc.Amazingly you can find lots of snacks/food stalls, you can try Korean dumplings or 'blood intestine', or noodles, or Korean pizza...etc.All price are very reasonable and good experience.I bought some Korean bowls, chopsticks, instant noodles cooking pot, some clothes for mother, some Korean snacks for dad, and dried persimmons (yummy). ^o^Must go again next time."
did not leave a good taste unfortunately,"We were lured by the mungbean pancakes to Gwangjang Market. Yes there are a ton of pancake shops, but they do not come cheap (the market seems overloaded by pancake shops). A couple of pancakes racked up a bill over 20000 won, which at other street food places we had never paid more than 10000 won.Good atmosphere of the local ahjummas pushing you around while they try to get from A to B and also some selection of kimchi and seafood (there's a lot more in Busan)Also, a warning about pig's trotters and sausages (these are pig blood with rice wrapped in intestines)... only for the adventurous, and it also costs significantly more than normal street food."
Good traditional food,"There are many cooked food stalls in the market. And also many raw food materials, kimchi, clothings, etc. Interesting place "
Traditional Korean Food,"If you want an authentic Korean meal, visit this market at night. The market is filled with blocks of food vendors. Tteokbokki and Gimbap were some of the traditional dishes we tried. Sit down at one of the stalls and they will serve you up a dish. Where ever we sat they were fascinated with us being there. I don't think we saw another westerner in the market."
A Great Taste of South Korea,"While some other visitors to Seoul may prefer a more dressed up experience, I personally loved Gwangjang Market. It is a perfect mix of South Korean soul, shopping, and culture. With dozens of outdoor vendors mixed in with many major department stores, any visitor to Gwangjang is sure to find what they're looking for. And even if you don't plan on bringing home any souvenirs, just a walk around is a worthwhile experience.Plus, no knowledge of Korean is required to navigate around. And so if you're spending any time at all in South Korea, Gwanjang Market is a must-see."
So much larger than expected,"If you want cloth, this is the place to be. Plus the surrounding area has half a dozen other types of markets which are fun to explore. The street foods available here were not that exotic or unique, but we did have some great ground kimchi dumplings and some decent breakfast noodles. If you wanted to get a Honbok (spelling?) made in Korea, this would be a phenomenal place to go. There is such a huge selection, however, that I would highly recommend bringing someone local who can bargain or explain what you want. "
A Real Seoul Market,"With it's rich history, Gwangjang market is a veritable Seoul experience without the glam and glitter of the food courts of the major department stores in Seoul. You will experience a slice of the scent of fresh fish being sold , the muggy smell of the fabric section, the various colors of the food imitations for display, but you will be rewarded with the sound and smell of the delectable food being prepared by the Ajummas of Gwangjang Market. The food is superb , the ambiance raw and rustic. A must visit in Seoul !"
Authentic Korean food and fabrics,Must visit for Authentic Korean food and fabrics!Bought all my marinated stuff here- though we did not speak Korean! Friendly Ajuma gave us hot coffe as it was really cold! Mouth watering local dishes here to try!
a different experience,"If you are the type who likes adventure in your food and does not mind eating in a market this is a must place to try the local specialties like gimbap (rice roll), sundaes (blood sausage) pajeons (vegetable and seafood pancakes), noodles and many more. Yummy and cheap! The merchants are all very friendly and generous in their servings. Unlimited refills on some stalls I had mine for my noodles. "
Taste of Korean breakfast!,"This place is full of stalls selling food, fabric etc! Loved the tteokbukki, kimbap, odeng, bindaetteok! Wished that the stomach can hold more food like the Patju (Red bean porridge)! Didn't dare to try the blood sausage though. There's this bindaetteok place with seats inside that's rather famous. Do make sure to try the one with the meat as well. :)"
Korean Silk,"If you are interested to find Korean silk or other fabric, you should visit this market. There are also shops selling nice looking laces and other sewing materials..."
Perfect place for authentic Korean food and fabrics,"You will spend so much time eating and eating and eating all the different types of food here. So many vendors are selling sundae (soon-dae). It less crowded on week days, but on the weekend and holidays expect a lot of locals dining out."
Known for its food more than being anything else,"It is a must try to eat here. It's a clean market and very affordable. Gwangjang Market is famous for its food more than anything else. You can find Gimbap, tteokbukki, bindaetteok and pork blood sausage. OMG, I love this place!"
Authentic Korean food,I passed by here when I decided to walk around during my first day in Seoul. There are a lot of interesting things to see and a lot of places to eat though I didn't really try any.
Highlight of my culinary tour of Seoul,"After a redeye flight from Tashkent, I came here. I had not eaten dinner beyond a couple bottles of Budvar in the airport and some airplane peanuts. Went directly to Gwangjang Market and arrived at a personal Shangri-La, with so many different types of food, cooked fresh and available to eat right then and there, which is exactly what I did, in large quantities and with much gusto.Come here for dumplings, bean curd dipped in broth (no idea what this was called in Korean), okonomiyaki style pancakes (ohh yes), kimchis of all shapes and sizes, yukhoe (by exit 2 of the market, turn left and go down the alley between two pharmacies to get this awesome beef tartare dish with asian pear), gimbap, and much more. I would love to go here every day for the rest of my life.They also sell other stuff that isn't edible but I wasn't interested in that."
Best place to buy korean silk,"There is only 1 shop sell 100% korean silk. Price is cheap.other than silk,this place also offer other fabric materials with a reasonable price."
Good local food but no shopping!,"Great insight into the local street food in korea. I went to the market around dinner time - it's the busiest time of the day and the wet market section is also open to serve the hotpots! The highlights include Korean pancake, dumpling noodles, pig (all parts!intestine, trotters, snout etc.), glass noodles, hotpot. I recommend that firstimers should eat at the outdoor benches with the locals. I went to a stall which was less crowded and had seats inside and I was charged more.This market is a definite must-go if you want to experience local street food. Don't expect to do any shopping. Best to visit at night!"
Its all about the food,"What an amazing place! loads of mouth watering local dishes here, with a buzzing atmosphere. Pancakes were the best, and lots of different Kimchi options up and down the market. Very reasonably priced and everybody just sits together at shared tables. Try the Korean wine in the small green bottles. It looks like milk, is fizzy, but delicious, and goes great with the food."
"Look for food, not clothes!","I found much better places for shopping than Gwangjang Market, so initially I wasn't impressed. Until, that is, I realized what a gold mine this place is for street food! I'm dreaming about the delicious types of jeon that I tried there. "
A spread of local korean food!,"Had our first dinner at Gwangjang Market in Seoul before heading for midnight shopping at Dongdaemun. It's a great local experience as we sat together with the local Koreans to have our meals. We were spoilt from choices as they've a huge selection of authentic Korean food. We had rice cakes (tteokbooki), potato pancake, Japchae (Stir-fried Vermicelli) & a bowl of hot kimchi dumping noodles in the cold weather. It's just awesome!The price are reasonable and you get to experience the local dining culture. Everyone should go at least once! You can read more on my trip & my dining experience at Gwangjang Market here, http://jacqsowhat.blogspot.sg/2013/06/seoul-korea-day-2.htmlThanks! Have fun xx."
The good and the bad,"I went the for mayak kimbap. Store 12's owner was such a sweet lady and she has prices placed at the stores so you will not be worried about getting ripped off. However, this visit, I was early and she was not opened, so we decided to try something else. BAD. CHOICE. We went to the store facing the famous bindaeddeok street cart (not the shop) (you will see a long queue at the cart). That store was quite long compared to those single-manned carts/stores with 3 ajuma-s working inside. They sold sundae and jokbal and kimbap and tteokbogi. No price was named. First mistake. Second mistake was to not confirm the portion size. I ordered one portion of a few things. From previous experience, the bill should not go above 15,000won. However, the lady charged us 22,000won and chased us away when we asked her about it! Third mistake. Never go to stores that taut. Means they are no good and there to rip you off!! The bindaddeok from the famous stall was great. there was a long queue but it was efficient and we didn't wait long before the pipping hot goodness was in out mouths!! Also, try the raw beef in the yukhoe alley there! It is really fresh and delicious! You'll see tables of ajuma frantically slicing the fresh beef on the spot. No frozen meat!"
Great place for authentic Korean food,"Mung bean pancakes, bibimbap, knife-cut noodles, cold noodles (nangmyeon), dumplings, rice cakes (tteokbokki) and so much more could be found at this great market.I only went there for the food even though there are shops selling all kinds of things. So this review will be only about the food area of the market. There is plenty to choose from and I went there often as my hotel was very nearby. The food is authentic. Language barrier is not a problem as they are very used to tourists.To get there, take the Subway Line 1 to Jongno 5-ga station and go out using Exit 9. Alternatively, take Subway Line 2 or Line 5 to Euljiro 4-ga station and go out using Exit 4. The second option requires a slightly longer walk - go straight on from the exit, straight across the highway at the traffic light intersection and the market building will be directly in front of you once you have cleared the intersection."
A great local experience,"Have been to many popular markets like Namdaemun and Noryangin and hence decided to try out Gwangjang market this time round.Took a cab from Gwanghwamum to Gwangjang market and it cost less than 5,000won. It is more worth it to cab considering the fact that subway costs you around 1,100won per person without T Money. However we took the subway back just to test out the public transport accessibility. Rather convenient as well but we would rather skip the walking in the hot sun.There are apparently 5,000 stalls mainly selling hanbok (korean tranditional clothes), bed linens, clothes for ajuma (middle aged women) and street food. The market is divided into east and west with 2 storeys. Don't worry about getting lost here as it is quite neat and hence you will have no problem finding your way area.I love the atmosphere here! Here you can witness how the real Koreans live - having a makgolli with fried soybean cakes (bindindaek? pardon my spelling). You can see them frying these savory pancakes everywhere! Visit one that makes it on the spot! it cost us 4,000 won for a serving so huge to be shared by 2 for lunch. It was simply delicious paired with the onion sauce and kimchi. There are other items like sundubu (blood sausage stuffed with glass noodles), tteokbokki (spicy rice cakes), namgmyeun (cold noodles in beef broth), gimbap (Korean rice wrapped in seaweed with sesame seeds and radish) and other local food. We came here around 3pm and it was rather empty but it didn't stop us from being called out by the female hawkers to try their food. Loved their enthusiasm in their work!Mum bought some ladies wear and they are at least 50% cheaper than those sold in Cityhall and Myeongdong - exactly the same design and material.If you like to find good local souvenirs and hanbok for children, Gwangjang market's prices are at least 30% cheaper than Dongdaemum and Insadong.Is a great experience without being touristy unlike Insadong."
Excellent experience of local food,"We visited in the morning so the crowds had yet to descend. We had tteokbokki (spicy rice cake) , glass noodles and fish roll soup for breakfast. The humble food was so good and satisfying! Locals and tourists rubbed shoulders seated side by side by the hot stoves. You can order just by pointing at the food.The ground floor of the market sells a mix of stuff like seafood, (lots of) fabric, sundry items like umbrellas. The upper floor of the market, mainly visited by locals, is air-conditioned and sells mainly Korean household items and traditional garb and trinkets."
Excellent food and a fun experience,"We went to Gwangjang Market to have a ""street food"" experience in Seoul, and it did not disappoint. The hand-cut noodles we got were incredible, and the woman who served us could not have been nicer (although she spoke no English). This should be a must-do stop on any trip to Seoul."
Great food venue at night,We did not get here until 9pmso most shops/stalls closed but street food sellers / restaurants a plenty still open for business! We ended up eating 3 times as could not resist the amazing food! We enjoyed spicy pancakes with rice wine - delicious even my 7 year old enjoyed them! Next restaurant we had a pork BBQ which was fantastic and we finished up with some sweet snacks at a small fruit / ice place! Well it was the last night of our trip! A busy place which was fun! Easy to get to on subways/ bus we went one way on each! I regret not going earlier in the day to experience the full market it must be amazing Enjpy
Very interesting,"If you want to see a typical Korean market, this is the correct place. Basically devoted to clothes, you will also find a lot of traditional food and goods. You can taste and smell all kind of Korean street food. Do not go if you have a delicate stomach. You will take for sure a lot of beautiful photos."
where the locals grab a bite...,"MUST eat Bindaedeok (Mung bean pancake) ... spicy chicken feet is awesome too.Walk along the stretch of food stalls and u'll see a shop selling seaweed, drinks and snacks. This Ahjumma sells even cheaper then Namdaemuen.there's a vintage clothes section on the 2nd flr but its a little messy...Things you can find there::- Traditional Korean Wedding Stuff (no trying thou)- Hanboks- Fresh Seafood- Textile/ Cloth- Vintage clothes- Loads of local food"
The best place to find Korean Silks & Brooches,Don't miss this place if u want to find Korean silks and brooches. The prices is not expensive.. will be coming back.. So much to see hear...
The most interesting of Seoul's big markets,"While some of the ground-floor hambok and clothing is quite low quality and aimed at tourists (although the bolts of linen and cotton, and monk's clothes and suits on the ground floor are a bit better), the upstairs has much higher-quality hambok, silks, and many dozens - maybe hundreds - of vendors of much more interesting and contemporary mens and womens clothing.The food on the ground floor is very good, with fried mung bean pancakes (bindaetuk - you can even tell taxi drivers that you want the bindaetuk market and they'll know what you mean), great fresh pork dumplings (mandu) and lots and lots of decent-to-very-good rice/veggie/meat rolls (kimbap - literally, seaweed rice ... the vegetarian version with wasabi, miyak kimbap, is also popular here). Not sure I'd trust the fresh fish vendors here but the meat looks decently regrigerated, at least ... nothing really beats Noryangjin for fish.This is a fun way to spend an afternoon, and far easier than Dongdaemun by far. The food is much more limited than Namdangmun, but not bad at all. Clothing prices are terrific, and it's a good place to get kids shoes and clothing and, upstairs, clothing for adults. Also, if you're looking for a really nice hambok, for a wedding or special event, you can't beat the silks and other vendors here."
Hard to shop on raining season,"This is the number one of the place which I wanted to visit in Korea. I always see this place being introduced in TV shows. Finally got to taste the fried mung bean pancake. It taste good but not great. The place look clean, but I do see some flies around .. So I didn't let my 2 years old son try it. Almost half of the place are filled with textile shops. So I only spent 30 minutes at this place. "
Must see,"Don't miss this market during your visit to Seoul. The fried mung bean pancakes are awesome and a specialty here. Read the wiki page for a little history. I had one with pork inside, mmmm tasty. Definately a highlight. "
Old shopping mall turned into a super food court.,"Popular for their fried mung bean pancakes and maekuli (Korean rice wine). Mi-yak kimbab is also very popular, a vegetarian kimbab with a wasabi mixed sauce that you sprinkle on. Right across diagonally across is the most famous mung bean pancake restaurant. They also have huge blood sausages. Nice to watch and have a drink with friends."
Lively and traditional market in Seoul,"Gwangjang Market is one lively place to come to. I was not sure in the first place what to expect but when I arrived, I was taken away by how lively it was. I came in the evening around 6-ish. The place was huge. They have stores selling fresh kimchi, marinated crabs, and stuff. But the real deal was the food stores that were selling food. It was awesome! There were so many food stores and so much variety of food that it was so difficult to settle down to one store to eat. But one thing you must try is the ""mung bean pancake"". Most, if not all the stores have this stone grinding machine that grinds the mung bean and they mix the paste with some vegetables and fry it into a pancake. The pancake costs KRW4,000 in the Gwangjang Market (while the same thing costs KRW8,000 in Namdaemun Market). They also have pig blood intestine glutinous rice. I thought it was a very interesting food to try. They cut it into pieces and you dip it into some ""chilli salt"" and once you eat it, you will feel very satisfied with the taste. It was not yucky or anything. It was chewy and a little salty (due to dipping it into the salt). Overall it tastes really good. I would recommend Gwangjang Market at least once in your trip to Seoul. Obviously, I came back here twice!"
Food Heaven,"Gwangjang Shijang is awesome! Now this is the type of experience I was hoping for—tons of vendors selling a variety of interesting and tasty food. We went at night, so the non-food portion of the market was closing down. But we were there to eat. And eat we did!A popular thing to get is the Mayak Gimbap. It literally means Drug Gimbap. It really is like crack! Not that I've ever had crack. The rolls are smaller than the Gimbap I've had in the past. They are bite size and oh so delicious.We also tried a popular place that makes Jeon (egg pancakes). They had a line out the door. Even Tim Burton ate there and shouted his praises. I enjoyed it, but the oiliness makes it something you can't eat too much of.From Soondae to fresh seafood, if you're an adventurous foodie, you'll find plenty to love at Gwangjang."
Set aside a little bit of time to come by!,"Feel the nearest vibes to how a traditional market is and coming here allows us to have a better understanding of their normal daily lives...The area is huge which ranges from stores offering their local snacks, seafoods to shops selling hanbok,blankets, pots and lots of stores selling cloths... etc...if u're not in a rush for time, just choose a store and have your lunch here :-)it's affordable and a different kind of experience too We like it here and recommend to anyone who's in Seoul!"
Worth Visit,"It's good to come here to experience seoul's morning market. It's a really big market which was sectioned accordingly, food, textile, clothes, kitchenware, etc....You can try out all sort of korean snacks over here at a reasonable price. In addition, we manage to find a souvenir shop which is selling cheaper than namdaemun.So, highly recommended!!!"
Korean street food,"there are so many street food restaurant. really exciting place to enjoy Korea life. whenever my foreign friends come to Seoul, i always invite them to there. Foreigner can understand Korean and Korean food culture by the market. "
Worth the experience,If you like to get a little outside of the tourist comfort zone box this is a good spot. It is a market with a variety of goods to buy (raw materials as well as clothing etc). There are also street food vendors that serve up tasty treats! (caution if you have food allergies - menus will not have much is any English description; we did the point and nod to get ours). You might not come away with many purchases for things to take home but the experience is very worth it.
Traditinal Market,"I wanted to try the local food in this particular market , and boy was I not disappointed. The market is typical , but the atmosphere is authentic ! The food superb ! The ajumas are very nice to me as I had too many questions regarding the interesting looking spread of food they have for tasting ! A must visit , mashita !"
Interesting and great variety but ripoff,"Wide selections of street food and cloth related item. However the prices are astronomical, 3000 for fish cake that is like 3 times more expensive as compared to others.However, it is a very great experience. i guess it's a place where locals frequent too"
A 'must do' if you like sewing,"We went here solely because our teenage daughter loves sewing. Once she read that this is supposed to have the best selection of dress fabrics there was no stopping her. To get there, we walked from Insadong down to the Cheong-gye-cheon river and then along that for 15 minutes. Getting back up from the stream, the area looked a bit more run down but once inside the market you don't really notice it.This place is packed with dress fabric of all sort ranging from heavy woollen suit material to light jerseys and polyester / silk with anything inbetween as well.You will need to have a fair idea of what you want to buy since the choice might well overwhelm you otherwise. We ended up with two lots of stretchy fabrics with lovely pints on them. Both came out at around 5,000 won per metre and with a bit of hand signing if was possible to communicate to the traders how much we wanted. There was also not too much heavy selling going on, i.e. you could look at stuff without immediately being pressured by the stall holder.If you like your sewing and want a souvenir of your trip I would recommend this place.We got here at 10.30 and it felt reasonably empty. The downside of course was that none of us was hungry enough to try any of the food. Maybe another time!"
I wish I had 3 stomachs.,"Super tasty and various food there. No matter you are looking for snacks. lunch or breakfast .It's really a great place to go. I enjoyed the meal very much .Also , You can buy some traditional daily dish like ""soy sauce crab"" etc.Of course there are traditional Korea clothing and convenience goods stores located in the market , To experience the local lifestyle that's a good place to visitThe vendors there only have few seats so..there's a sub-rule like you cannot just ordered 1 dish to share..you'll be expected to order at least 2 dishes if you are more than 3 .some photos to share in my blog: http://mermaid-avenue.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/kwangjang-market.html"
Nice food!,"I really enjoyed our tour of the market. It's so huge. They have all sorts of items to buy from clothes, shoes, dried foods, etc. What I enjoyed most is the yummy food that can be eaten there! Even if it's winter, the seats are warm with heating system so we can still eat leisurely. But it is best if you go there with someone who can speak Korean because the sellers only communicate in their language."
A real taste of Korea,"Kwang Jang is a vast indoor market at the junction of two main thoroughfares in central Seoul. It is home to bewildering number of food stalls selling Korean delicacies at affordable prices, and also an array of clothes vendors. If you are looking to buy an embroidered traditional Korean gown, this is the place to visit. You can easily spend a couple of hours browsing in Kwang Jang, enjoyed the colours and the vibrancy."
"Friendly ajuhmas, delicious food and vintage clothes paradise.","One of my favourite places in Seoul. The pajeons are so delicious and there is so much variety of authentic Korean food at the market at really affordable price .Also the vintage clothes area at a corner on level 2 is truly vintage paradise. Bought so many bnwt vintage dresses, tees, skirts etc back. "
Highly recommend for foreign visitor.,"It is unique place you can taste something Korean. Pa-Jun, Sun-Dae, O-Deng,.. many unique Asian food with very cheap price available all around in the market. You drop by station line #1 Jong-Lo-5Ga gate 8, few step from the gate straight and turn left. Whenever I have my visitor in Seoul, I bring them here and have Korean tradition alcohol Mak-Gul-Li with Pa-Jun together. None of them dis-like this lovely place."
market food!,"Traditional Korean food on offer, albeit it is all market style.You may have to sit outdoors, on wooden planks, but it's still all a part of the experience. Gotta go atleast once. That may be enough though. haha"
History of Seoul since 1904,"Gwangjang Market located in central Seoul, next to Chungae stream.It's really crowded and busy place except on Sunday. You can buy Korean traditional dresses, shoes, clothes etc..and enjoy yummy food! To buy Hanbok, traditional Korean dress, Go upstairs where wholesalers located!you can buy Tailored Korean silk dress set by 1/2 price to Gangnam area. (it took for 3-5 days for express, normally 7-10 days)"
Fascinating Traditional Market,"We visited this market as part of a tour we recently did and quite enjoyed our brief visit. We visited on a Sunday, so some of the vendors were closed, but the place was still a hive of activity. This market has a bit of everything from shoes to clothes to food to traditional wedding gifts. It's clearly a hot spot for local dining with the seats at all the food stalls packed with hungry people.Go to check out the local scene. It's not touristy at all (save for all the tourists checking it out). You can get a good feel for it in 30 minutes or so, but it is quite large and you could easily lose track of time taking in all the sights."
Energized Food Bazaar,"Owing to protective trade policy, Korea has the highest food price in all OECD countries. Some fancy restaurants, of western or Korean cuisine alike, serve amature overpriced dishes. Thus you start developing hunger for hearty food. As one can read in the restaurant reviews at Tripadvisor, some good restaurants in Seoul cater to economically minded cosmopolitans. There are well priced Korean restaurants hidden in back alleys. Neither of these two are really easily accessible to short-term travelers. Here is a good exception: Gwanjang Market. It used to be for poor people and be not so hygienic. However, with economic development and the consequent elevation of public health, it is loved by all classes of Koreans. It is close to a subway station Jongro 5 Ga, and, literally, is widely open to everybody. It has a long history, and a good reputation. Many food stalls have been there for a very long time. A great fun place to look around and to see what kind of snacks Koreans love to eat: Duk-bok-gi, Soon-dae, Hue or sashimi, Noodles, etc. There are many to try. A first-time and thus timid traveller can start with the ""Soon Hee Ne""(a common name of a Korean girl; meaning a friendly sister) Bin-dae-duk (meaning pancake). Order Bindaeduk ($4) and Gogi Wanja(flattened meat balls; $5) along with Mag-gol-ri or rice wine. It will make you forget about all your hunger for hearty food since your arrival in Seoul. Do not be confused between market food, like this, and street stall food elsewhere, which would not give any warrantee for hygiene."
Worth going to see,"We wanted a traditional market experience which is what we got at Gwangjang. In the evening after work people stream there to buy things for their households or for dinner or for gifts for weddings or birthdays. Thus you see all kinds of goods in one place. We didn't have much to buy since we got all our souvenirs in Insadong. Instead we wanted to sit at a food stall and snack. There are so many to choose from that your best strategy is to find a stall that has on display what you want to eat and hope the quality and prices are comparable. We had pig trotters, mung bean pancake and jap chae, not any better than elsewhere, nor cheaper either.But the experience of sitting crunched between tired out working guys and giddy gals headed to a party (judging by the fancy cake box they carried) while being served by a no-nonsense ladyworking behind a shelf full of pig parts was really the closest we ever got to a genuine Korean experience all trip. Worth going to see, even if you choose not to eat"
Come here for food....,"Was surprised by the size of the market initially. Cannot do a full review as I came on a Sunday and many of the stores were CLOSED! =( But was still happy to know that the food stores were open. Many traditional looking Korea food here, and all inexpensive. Will definitely want to come back again."
Nothing to write home about,It was not quite good specially the restaurant and the menu.
traditional foodie market paradise,"As a traditional market that you would go to in order to buy stuff, this particular market specializes in clothing, whole cloth, traditional Korean clothing, tailors, shoes, blankets and bedding, etc. We saw a whole lot of stuff like that, in any event. But the real reason any tourist or foreigner would want to go there is for the food experience. The market is famous for their mung bean pancakes, but the various food vendors there sell all the different savory and sweet pancakes famous in Korean street food, as well as bibimbap and various fish and pork stews and sausages and things like that.It's basically a foodie paradise if you're looking for the traditional korean experience of eating street food and common Korean food in public with real Korean people. There aren't as many tourists at this market as some of the more famous ones like Dongdaemun or Namdaemun, and if you go early in the day, like around noon or before, it's not crowded and you can take the time to enjoy a relaxing meal sitting on a bench at one of the many little food places that are crammed into this place. They also have clearly marked street signs throughout the place directing you to the various exits and subway stations and local landmarks and the food court area, as well as conveniently located bathrooms, although I can't vouch for cleanliness exactly. All I can say is they weren't the worst I've seen and they seemed to be easier to find and use than some of the other markets. I went there with a friend and we stopped at the first place we found that had mung bean pancakes and ended up talking with an older Korean gentleman that was so friendly and liked us so much that he bought our meal after feeding us some of his soju and offering us his cigarettes. I will be going back so that if I see him again I can buy his meal the next time, as we agreed."
Know your cloth before you buy,"I was looking for korean silk, korean cotton and korean linen - having read about them, supposedly cheaper than back home. There were many sorts of materials here but you'd better know how silk, cotton, or linen look and feel like before you make your purchase. The sellers said yes to any that you asked, ""is this silk?"" was my most common question since I know my cotton and linen pretty well. Fortunately, I came across some countrywomen who happened to shop for silk in a particular store which really had his walls lines up with korean silk - price wise I'm not sure cheaper than those back home, but you would be spoiled for choice. Glad I bought some. If you have a few hours to spare for shopping here, you could get some good bargains on cotton, which I did."
>> Eat with the locals <<,"The Gwangjang market is a mini-food paradise. Try the bin dae ddok (Korean style pancake made from ground mung beans ** highly recommended **), pigs trotters (my mum was a little disappointed that the trotters felt a little cold), seafood sashimi, and many more yummy local food. If you are in Seoul, make sure you do not give this a miss."
Interesting and flavourful experience,"Interesting local market. Sat down at one of the stalls and ordered everything on offer from the cold sliced meats, noodles, and Korean rice rolls. Enjoyed all of it and for a good price."
Worthy a visit for a simple lunch in a informal setting,"This is a market, make no mistake about it. The place offers you a view into the Korea market, and also provide an opportunity to taste some of the traditional foods that even the local eat. So walk around, find a food you are interested, sit down, point at it, order it and try it!After eating, stroll around the clothes/hanbok section to see if you fancy making a hanbok for yourself, or pick up a packet of korean ginseng sweets. After that, you can drop by the Cheonggyecheon, an eco-friendly drain/canal development, which is just beside near where the market is located."
What a bustling market,"Super awesome. Good for lunch, dinner or just for a stroll. Sit on the benches of the hawker stalls & become a local."
Amazing foods,"Especially at night, after many of markets closed,You can eat very yummy Korean food with reasonable price.Try 'raw beef', and 'Nokdu-jun(green gram pancake)'with traditional drink 'Makgoelli'It's amazing."
Traditional Market - incredible traditional food court!,"We went to this market to look for the traditional Korean Hanbok, as this market was recommended. Most of the stores are tailors who make outfits to order, with a few who sell ready made outfits in different sizes. You can only choose from the styles that are in your size in the ready made stores. We were delighted when we saw the hive of excitement and activity that went on in the traditional food court area of this market. The atmosphere was amazing and it was so interesting to walk around the food stalls and see the various local dishes on offer. It was lunchtime, so the place was alive with activity. What a bonus to our trip to the market! If you enjoy soaking up the local atmosphere, you have to go! Have fun!"
A traditional market,"I went there with 2 others on a heavy rainy day, the place is not crowded. We were looking for soba pillow (pillow filled with buckwheat husk) and was glad to be able to find it in one of the store. This place sell a variety of traditional things. There are many store selling mung bean and kimchee pancakes. You will also gets to sample kimchee and marinated squid. I hope next time I can have time to sit down and enjoy some korean snack there."
Crowded yet Awesome,"Visit this market not just for shopping, but to see the wares and to eat delicious street food. If you come late enough at night, you can see businessmen relaxing with a bottle of makgeolli and eating spicy treats."
foods! foods! and hanbok :),"What can you find here? traditional foods, various produce from all over Korea, and also this place is famous as a center for selling hanbok, Korean traditional clothes."
Good for a Rainy Day,"When it rains, Koreans crave pajeon or bindeaddok and makgeolli. On a rainy day you can have a look around the market and then see what all the fuss is about by tucking into this traditional fare which is served at a number of outlets in the market."
Experience the locals.,"Though it is considered the older generation's ""department store and supermarket"" this is where you can see how the locals shop and eat. You can shop from grocery, fresh seafood, kimchee galore to blanket, tableware, clothing, mountains of shoes, etc. For the very least, this is a place for the photographers! Try out the local snacks. See the transport motorcycles. You will be amazed to see how the ladies made artwork by cutting the dried squids. "
Visit during non-peak hour,"The market is located near Subway line 1 Jongno-5 Ga Station. Going straight off Exit 8, you'll see the market on your left. Gwangjang Market is not huge, so this is a very relaxing attraction where one can spend an hour checking out different kind of stores, and have a few snacks. The whole market is one story, so it's an easy walk for anyone.To avoid the crowd, try to go after meal time at Gwangjang Market. I went on a Monday afternoon after the lunch crowd. So the atmosphere is very relaxing. All the ajima, agasi, even grandma and grandpa manning the eatery stools and stores are very friendly. And seats available everywhere. I also checked out the side streets. Again, almost all the store people are extremely friendly. I am crafty and a sewer, so I had an eye feast on all the beautiful fabric display. I inquired some prices for dried seaweed and found the price to be good. A grandma even showed me how to tell the grade of gingsing. I tried to get some silverware from this one kitchen supply store. The young man at the store speaks perfect English. After inquiring the price, I knew his price is more expensive than the supermarket. But being polite, I still bought some to support local business. I am from California where everyone including foreigners and US president pay the same price. Guess Seoul is nothing like California. I'm not sure why Koreans are afraid of ajima. I find all the middle aged and older Korean here at Gwangjang Market are very honest and friendly. Would definitely be back for those seaweed before leaving Korea."
"Starting here, Gwangjang Sijang","I enjoy my bindaetteok and makgeolli right here but you can find the way Seoul ppl live their life from this market. This market is good for foodies, Bibimbap with a selection of vegetables and bori rice. I do love it, very chewy and tasty. "
Interesting for Korea First Timers,"The market is a decidedly a traditional one that in itself is nothing exceptional by Korean standards, other than it being conveniently located along many tourists explorations of Seoul. There are bigger markets in Seoul, but his one is relatively compact and under roofing that makes it preferred during rain and exceptionally hot weather.The place offers a mesh-mash of tacky silks and polyester fabrics and products along side fresh fish, meat and vegetables, being sold in traditional market fashion. There are even some black market booths sporting American food and health care products of questionable procurement.Probably the biggest attraction for tourists and the locals may be the food stalls and stands where one can elbow in a space on a bench to taste local, traditional fast food and alcoholic beverages. Foreigners are welcome here and there is probably no better chance for the uninitiated to have a real cheek-by-jowl encounter with typical, usually blue collar Koreans."
unique place.,"Very unique place. Food are cheap and tasty.Don't expect too much for the place, but just stroll around and grab a lunch. Try bindaedeok (korean pancake) and bibimbob. They give out tons of samples."
Experience real Korean traditional eating market,One can experience a very unique atmosphere where you can select from a wide variety of exotic Korean local dishes not usually found in normal restaurants. Must try for adventurous foreigners!
"Great experience. And nice soya pancake, I am missing it already.","Ttry the soya pancake, it's really worth sitting by the store and dipping it into the delicious sauce. "
Lost at first but it's the place for shopping korean silk,The good quality silk is a bit pricey and you must know how to bargain. Some of the shop owner can even speak little Malay.
Hunting for korean traditional foods and silk,"So many stall to choose that selling bibimbap, ramen, toboki, pancake, sashimi and any other korean traditional foods. For muslim, you can try bibimbap or pancake stall that only sell vegi and seafoods. The market separate to wet market, and dry market that sell so many choices of silk, textile and hanbok (korean traditional clothe). To get here, you can walk along cheongyecheon until majeongyo bridge and go upstairs or take subway to jongno5(o)-ga station. try it and you will love it..."
Fun to wander around,"Lanes lined with stalls selling a variety of items and worth visiting for the atmosphere, even if you do not want to buy anything."
Visit at night to see how Seoulites socialized,"Visited in night as part of O'ngo Night Dining Tour. Interesting to see one section of the market being transformed into a center of night dining places for Seoul people to eat, chat and socialized. A must to visit. And try to eat and mingle with them if you dare :) "
Heaven for fabrics and mungbean flat cakes,"I love sewing bags as a hobby, and this was a great place to look for fabrics. There are plenty of shops selling fabrics, but many of them are for quilts and Korean wedding costumes. I would recommend you go to Dongdaemun Shopping Town for fabrics and hobby crafts! Nevertheless this place is GREAT for mungbean flat cakes!! I think the local name is bindaeduk. I had a big one which seemed to be just vegetables, and a smaller one which seemed to have meat in it. Cost me 6,000won in total and I inhaled every bit of it. 2 thumbs up. I couldn't speak a word of Korean but nothing will keep me away from these delicious yummies!! I propose going to those shops you see at the side, rather than eat at those open space type counters. Seems just a tad more hygienic. "
Awesome Asian Market Atmosphere,"Noisy, crowded, pungent. Full of junk and cheap, delicious food. The perfect escape from Seoul's brand name fashion carnivals."
So interesting!,The market is so full of life and everything must be available here because there are so much stuff to look at! And the food stalls!! They left me craving for all the tantalising fares and undecided of when to stop pigging out...
Seoul's prime stop for Street food lovers,"This is one of those food markets that has not been altered or cleaned up for tourists. For this reason, it remains for me, one of the absolute best places to eat in Seoul. You can see local families, friends, and groups of suited businessmen all grabbing something to eat and drink. There are food stalls as far as the eye can see, selling all manner of items. Seating is scarce, but stalls selling the same thing are lumped in the same area, so you can find somewhere to sit at any one of them. The fried yellow bean cakes and the pork and kimchi duplings are to die for. You often get soup and side dishes even at these tiny stalls! Vendors all have coolers full of booze and you can have a cold beer or makgeoli while you eat. Because this market is primarily for locals, the prices remain incredibly low. If you travel to eat, as we do, this is an essential stop."
