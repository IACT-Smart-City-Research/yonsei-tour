Museum ,"Great day, some of the items were closed but it was still worth the visit. It's free! Lots to see. Very large spread area."
"Fantastic memorial, worth it for everyone","Definitely must make a trip to this memorial--my seven year old son loved looking around all of the exhibits, and we easily spent 2.5 hours here. A lot of rich history to be learned, and there are loads of translations in English, Chinese, and Japanese. Easy to get to, about a 5min walk from Samjaki Line 6 station. Every detail of this memorial has been thought out so well, and there are so many amazing places to see here. Free entry as well."
Amazing memorial,"A beautiful memorial to honor those who served in the Korean War. It gives awesome insight to what was happening in Korea as well as the world. This beautiful place honors those who deserve honor. Korea is a beautiful place with a sad history. We had a tour guide that said, ""We can't change our history, but we can change our future."" I was thankful for the opportunity to learn more about that history."
Interesting exhibition,"Interesting exhibition with a lot of detail in an imposing building. The 4D films are a bit contrived and cartoonish as are some of the rooms, but overall an interesting way to learn about the Korean War."
Well worth a visit,"This is a great place to understand the history of Korea, dating right back to 900BC! Entry is free. You can get here via Samjaki station and you enter on the South side.One full days itinerary could be:1. Was memorial2. National Museum of Korea3. Ichon Hangang riverside park4. Seoul national cemetery"
Incredible for Korean and 20th Century History Buffs,"My visit to The War Memorial of Korea was very insightful, as I was able to take in a lot of history of South Korea and the 20th century. It was an incredible overall experience."
Excellent museum with plenty in English.,"And it is free. Outside are plenty of airplanes, tanks, boats including one recently shot up by North Korea. But be sure to go inside to see the exhibits of not just the Korean war, but ancient warriors and ROK's participation in Vietnam."
Incredibly informative,This is a 3F museum with history inside and outside with the inside including history from the dawn of the korean people to the current day practically after the separation of the two Koreas. There is so much information I didnt see it all. Outside there are flags for each country that helped South Korea in the war against the communists and inside includes info on the communist allies China and Russia under stalin. The outdoor exhibits include old war vehicles and giant statues and reliefs of people / soldiers. I can't express what's really inside except that it is a really informative memorial/museum. Entry is free. Lockers provided and a cafe inside. 
Well Presented,"I have visited the War Memorial of Korea over the past several years and it seems to improve with each visit. The information is well presented and honors Soldiers from all nations that contributed to the war efforts. There are many floors/exhibitions to visit and it can be a bit much for just one visit - thankfully the museum is easily access from the metro (just off Samgaki Station - line 4 or 6, exit 10/12 or Namyeong Station - line 1, exit 1) and general admission is free. There is an outdoor exhibit for children and the interior is appropriate for all ages, may appeal more to older children. I would highly recommend a visit to put things in perspective during your visit to Korea."
Impressive!!! ,"Seoul has many state funded museums and forms the ones I've visited or know of, all are well presented. It seems little is spared to put on a hood, high quality show. The National War Museum is no different. It showcases her military history from the earliest period up to the Korean War. You'd be surprised that Korea is not the doormat people perceive. But a proud and sophicated nation. There are things on display that you would not expect and not mentioned in books elsewhere. I've seen pictures of the turtle boat, but to sea in person is a nice experience. Yes is a scaled replica, but it's still impressive. There is also the large outdoor display. With a number of Korean War period planes and tanks. Also other retired items of hardware. You'd have to pay good money to see this elsewhere, but all free in Seoul. There is a B52 bomber, which is smaller than I thought. At the time of my visit, done halls and the outdoor display was closed off for maintenance. There are plenty of toilets, most displays have English and I suppose the only let down is that the giftshop. You can spend a fair few hours here. "
Nice visit,"If you like war museums, this is the place for you. I learned a lot and was quite impressed with the gratitude expressed to the 21 nations that contributed troops or support. "
A Gem for History and Military Buffs,"Last fall, I timed my visit here to coincide with a free Honor Guard Ceremony that took place at 2 p.m. on Fridays between mid-October and the end of November. I found it fascinating to watch the military band, marchers in colorful attire and displays of military precision on the massive space in front of the memorial’s entrance. But I was even more absorbed later by the museum’s displays, both inside and outside .Focused mainly on the Korean War (1950-53), the three floors of rooms also include a look at Korea’s history of resisting foreign aggression, such as the defeat of a large Khitan army in 1019. The Korean War rooms take visitors from what led to the Southward invasion by North Korea to the Armistice and the role of the United Nations. Nicely curated, the rooms present the nation’s War history through objects, films and information boards, which have many details in English.The outside exhibits display memorials and statues, such as “The Brothers,” which is the symbol of the Korean War and symbolizes reconciliation, love and forgiveness. The big bronze depicts a true story of two brothers, one from the South and the other from the North, embracing after meeting on the battlefield. I found this piece to be extremely moving.On the East side of the complex, I was amazed by the overwhelming number of big items displayed, related to the Korean War. These include aircraft. such as a bomber and a helicopter, and armored vehicles. Visitors are invited to explore the artifacts, and I saw many taking advantage of the opportunity. The War Memorial is open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Tuesday through Sunday, and offers free admission. Subway lines 4 and 6 have a stop (Samgakji) nearby. Take Exit 12. If coming here in the spring or fall, when the Honor Guard Ceremony is held, consider checking on its schedule to include It in your visit."
A must see!,This museum is simply amazing. I could try and describe it but I simply won’t do it any justice. This is a must see for anyone visiting Korea. You won’t be disappointed!
Worth spending time,"A large number of war exhibits. Both modern and ancient ones. Loved the 4D experience. Such detailed explanations about the history of the Korean war and the course of the war. Makes us gain great respect for the Korean community. ""Freedom is not free"" for sure!"
Must see before DMZ visit,"Carefully architected with a beautiful garden. But most of all, it is an entertaining way to get a better understanding of the North/South Korea cease fire that continues from 1950 up until today.If you have no historical background or if you already know a lot, the setup and displays are intelligently crafted to cater for all type of audiences."
"Beautiful, touching, a must see","From the moment you walk into the building, you can feel the solemnity of the environment. The combination of minimalistic decorations sometimes contrasts with the sheer size of some of the exhibits; giving me always that feeling that peace is easy and simple, but only if we really make that great decision to make it our goal, instead of the side effect of overtaking others by force.I fell in love with South Korea, and this place had a good part in that."
Freedom is not free,"That’s the poignant catch phrase that sums up the general feel of the War memorial.There are indoor and outdoor exhibits that makes this old school museum a sight to behold. The exhibits are grouped into 2 main rooms - one from the north’s and one from the south’s perspectives. There are complimentary tours with a volunteer doyenne and I barely made it to the 2pm session with Chang (there’s one more at 10am) although there is plenty of English explanation and if you use the guided audio, you’d be in good stead! Chang brought life to our walk, particularly when he provided a glimpse to his life as a Korean War survivor (he was barely 3 then) and how his ancestral home was South according to the 38 Parallel but because of the DMZ, now belonged to the North, and he’s rendered homeless. If you know how much the Koreans repeat nay treasure their ancestral hometowns, you can almost hear his angst through his thick accented English.Yet his gratitude and humility shone through.All in all an educational tour. And a must see. Set aside 3-4 hours to go through the exhibits thoroughly! "
Engaging and honoring,"Large museum with engaging presentation of historical facts. Outdoor area has real military equipment, including planes, tanks and boats, some of which can be climbed on or in. Indoor area has multiple video displays or 4d movies, as well as standard plaques.A couple floors dedicated to the Korean war, while another floor has ancient war history, including a very cool scale replica of a turtle ship.Very tasteful and honoring memorial to fallen soldiers and overall great presentation of historical facts on the Korean war. I plan to come to this museum whenever I visit Seoul."
One of the best war museum ,This is the place where you will understand everything about the Korean war! Good English speaking guide! 
Not to be missed!,"We visited this with a South Korean friend, but missed the English tour - nevertheless, it's an absolute must-see for you to understand the recent history and current climate of this land. We would love to return and join the English tour, but lots of the signs and videos are in English, so I'm guessing we probably didn't miss too much information. Such a poignantly expressed display, we were deeply moved and touched by the depth of emotion behind the presentations. No spoilers, just make it a point to go and spend a few hours there - well worth your time!"
"A Distant Obligation, honourably discharged","Moving, sad and fascinating. Worth a half day visit if you're in Seoul. Closed on Monday's (we made that mistake first time)."
A Must Visit,This is a poignant reminder of what happened during the korean war. It is very big so allot some time to be able to appreciate this museum. At the back are old planes that were used and a boat where you can go up and take pictures. At the entrance of the museum are the flags of all the countries that helped them during the war and a short message of what their contribution is to the koreans. I like it that they write each message in English and in the native language of each country. A must see in when you visit Korea
Memorial Visit,If you have time to visit this museum you will learn so much about the history of the Wars in Korea. One of the best museums we have ever visited and well worth seeing. Allow at least a half a day or more to make sure you get to see all that the museum has on show.
History of the now Korea,This museum will teach you all you need to know about the war in Korea and the story behind North and south Korea. You should check it out if you have time for it. 
Much Cooler than you Imagined,"The history of the war is particularly interesting for a visitor from the US. Go, even if you think you won't enjoy it. It's a good experience and you'll know where you are in a more real way."
A Must See,"We got here late so we had very little time to peruse the grounds, but we did have time to see the memorial and find the names of our relatives. It is an amazing place and allows one to realize the full cost of the Korean War to all the countries that participated. I had no idea so many countries were involved. Note of caution: If you take the Hop On, Hop Off bus, they drop you have quite a distance from the entrance. That is why we were late. It's a long walk."
Tremendous,"The best military museum I’ve ever seen. Korea’s War Memorial has about 650,000 square-feet under roof, and more than 60 fixed-wing aircraft, choppers, tanks, artillery pieces, missiles, and naval vessels outside in the rain. You get a crash course in the history of Korean warfare from neolithic spear-fights to modern times: civil wars between ancient ethnic groups, invasions by the Chinese, Japanese, Mongols, Manchus and so on; the centuries-long Japanese pirate fleet threat; the 19th century attacks by various Western powers; all the way up to the Vietnam War, when more than a third of a million ROK troops supported Saigon.Most of these wars, battles, sieges, victories and defeats will be terra incognita to foreign visitors. But it’s all interesting and well-presented. Curatorship is outstanding. 21st century technology helps: if you see locals watching any animation on pirate fleets, city-wall sieges, et cetera, stop and watch the spectacle with them.Most military museums focus on generals and admirals, soldiers and sailors, strategy, tactics, and the various regiments or battleships involved in the fighting. The War Memorial goes beyond the fighting forces to also provide information about non-combatants. This is underscored before you even walk into the museum, in monumental statues of both soldiers and the victims of war (see The Warriors and The Victims photos). Not surprisingly, half the indoor area is focused on the 1950s Korean War. I walked in with a fair grasp of the military changes of fortune in that war: such as the North’s surprise attack, which captured Seoul within 48 hours. What I’d never known before was that not only did the Northerners carefully plan exactly how and when they’d attack, but they also carefully planned the sweeping atrocities they would inflict on the civilian population of Seoul as soon as they captured the city. If you were on their list, you and your family disappeared within 48 hours of takeover; thousands were on their list.The museum’s information on the war is sweeping. The commitments made to the North by Stalin and Mao prior to the attack, Douglas MacArthur’s determination to turn the tide with the Inchon landings against the opinion of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the massive winter counter-attack of Chinese forces, are all presented clearly and cogently. The Korean War is also unusual because of the ROK’s powerful ally: the United Nations fought on their side. There have been UN peace-keeping missions since, to the Balkans and other areas, but never again anything like this. Two dozen nations from Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia and both North and South America fought under the UN flag, to save the people and legitimate government of Korea. Several rooms of the museum focus on the UN decision, and the UN leadership of Trygve Lie. The museum notes that immediately upon hearing of the attack on the ROK, Lie called an emergency meeting of the Security Council for the next day, and the UN support for the ROK was proposed, argued, revised and passed the same day. The museum names the countries which supported the UN resolution, the one who abstained (Tito’s Yugoslavia), and the member state which was absent: the USSR. (It doesn’t mention one interesting bit: the USSR’s delegate was refusing to attend UN meetings over a totally different issue—the seating of the PRC—another partner in the attack. But had he attended, I believe the USSR could simply have vetoed the resolution, in which case the ROK wouldn’t have been defended under the UN banner, and the UN in all likelihood would have gone down the drain like the League of Nations.) At any rate, you get to see a diorama of Douglas MacArthur receiving the UN flag that they’d all be fighting under (see UN Flag photo). A large area of one floor provides information on every nation that sent military personnel to Korea, as well as every nation that sent medical personnel (some of India’s and Denmark’s noncombatant personnel also died in Korea). Each of these countries has a special area in the museum, where you can learn how they contributed, how long they were in Korea, where they fought, and how many died (see Thailand Display photo). The information for each country is in Korean, English, and that country’s national language: Greece’s in Greek; Colombia’s in Spanish, and so on. Since Belgium is bilingual, you can read or hear about Belgian forces in Korean, English, French or Nederlands. This United Nations aspect of the war is symbolized before you even enter the museum, by the national flags of the contributing states flying in a semi-circle around of the facade (see International Flags photo). Each of the national stories is interesting. Luxembourg’s infantrymen were integrated for the duration with the Belgians, and although the headcount of Luxembourg fighting forces was small, as a percentage of total national population, it was one of the highest of any of the countries. Turkey sent a brigade-size integrated unit of artillery, ordinance, engineering and transport, which inflicted ten times more enemy casualties that it received.In 1950, there were only three independent counties in sub-Saharan Africa; all three contributed. South Africa sent pilots. Liberia supported civilian relief. I thought Ethiopia’s story was the most amazing of all. Haile Selassie was a strong proponent of collective security; he’d appealed for support from the League of Nations when Mussolini invaded Ethiopia, and hadn’t gotten it. So he wanted Ethiopia to help Korea, another innocent country, but Ethiopia had no army. Solution: the Emperor sent his Palace Guards! The guardsmen weren’t trained for combat, so US instructors gave them a three-month crash course, and attached them to the US 7th Infantry Division. The Imperial Guard did just fine: the museum has videos of them marching upcountry where, among other battles, they fought at Pork Chop Hill. The museum also addresses the impact of the war on individual men and women of the allied nations. For example, an Aussie who left his pregnant wife to go to Korea, died there; his wife never remarried; more than half a century later her ashes were buried in the Korean grave of the husband she lost in her youth (see Mrs Shepherd photo). Another Australian widow, Nancy Hummerston, was buried at Korea’s UN Memorial Cemetery even more recently, in 2010, sixty years after Captain Hummerston died defending the ROK.I spent the best part of a day here, and could have spent longer had they not been closing. Among my favorite sights were:* A replica of an 500-year old dragon-bowed Korean battleship, reduced to frigate size so it would fit in the central courtyard, but still impressive (Battleship photo).* A grand gallery of military paintings around the walls of that courtyard, including Korea’s crushing defeat of a French invasion force sent by Napoleon III in 1866 (Kapkot-Jin photo; that same year Napoleon III’s army was also beaten by the Mexicans; figuring the odds of losing three in a row were negligible, the III-time loser then declared war on Prussia). * Korean “knights” using trident-spears rather than the lances of their European counterparts (see Trident Knight photo)* An ingenious ancient Korean contraption for rapid fire of multiple arrows (see Gatling Bow photo).* Something for the children, a miniature Korean castle they can climb onto to man the bastions (Hawseong Fortress photo)* A huge drum commemorating the 60th anniversary of the founding of the ROK armed forces (Mother of All War-Drums photo). * A modest little inflatable Aircat airboat used by the ROK for river and marsh reconnaisance in Vietnam, and equipped with A60 machine-guns. This beaut is outdoors with the other military hardware: big impressive fighters, bombers, heavy artillery and tanks, so the little fellow goes virtually unnoticed. But back home in south Louisiana, “Cajuns” down on the bayous use airboats to get around in the swamps, where they hunt alligators for gumbo. You could hunt any number and size of ‘gators you liked, if you had an A60 machine-gun on board! (ROK Aircat photo).* Also outdoors but much nearer the street, a 20-year-old exact replica of the tallest of all Korean monuments, a four-sided monster 6.39 meters high, inscribed with 1,770 Chinese calligraphs. The original still exists, but was carted off to China long ago, and isn’t likely to be returned anytime soon. An impressive placard informs us that “The monument of King Gwanggaeto the Great (391-413) was built by his son, King Jangsu (413-491) in 414 BC in Gungnaeseong, the capital city of Goguryeo,” to honor his father’s conquests and the founding of the kingdom. And in small print, we’re also advised that “The translation of the inscription was advised by experts in the relevant fields in 2005.” Apparently chronology wasn’t one of the “relevant fields” that anybody was an expert in, since 414 BC precedes 391-413 BC, rather than following it. Still, it’s an impressive replica of Korea’s grandest ancient monument. (Monumental Error photo)."
An Army Museum,It is in fact an army weapons and history museum. Very large and large rooms sometimes complicate to navigate. English. Interesting mini video shows. Nice courtyard.
Heroes,"We are Turks and we are proud of heroes that live with us forever. All the nations that are included in the war are seen with their names, flags and clothes. "
Impressive,"Visited here for two hours and I wish I’d been able to spend more time. Very impressive memorial with lots of displays covering centuries of conflict on the Korean Peninsula. Goes well back in time, not just focusing on the Korean War. Great displays everywhere. "
Highly Recommend,"I visited the War Museum of Korea with 3 teenagers in August 2019. They are not big fans of any museums or history related places, but they really spent good time there. It was not boring at all. The architecture of the War Museum itself is amazing and the display was quite excellent. There are plenty of videos, 3D participation, and good explanation in English. I highly recommend War Museum of Korea to anyone who visit Korea. "
Great museum and lots to see and learn,I learned a lot just this museum visit. Very well laid out and there is a great deal of information presented. Spent about 2.5 hours there and could have spent a few more.Very well designed museum and worth a visit if you're into history or just want to understand more about the evolution of Korea as a country in the past decade.
Impressive and interesting,"A beautiful, sad museum, which summarizes Korea's history of wars through the ages, including airplanes, tanks and weapons from the war of the Korea's in 1950. There are signs in English, a clear sense of order, and the place is very respectful of the sacrifices made."
Amazing museum but racist worker,"Very interesting museum but the wonderful visit were wasted by some racist worker. As we were waiting for the line for an animated room (incheon landing 4D simulation) with a 15 people capacity and 30minutes long waiting line between the sessions, the staff member who were in charge of the line had the audacity to put first 4 korean girls who came after us. Indeed, she went to talk to them then one of them started to give us some weird glances. Then when it was the time to enter the room the 4 Korean girls quickly took the 3D glaces and run in the entry. We were 3 and she came to us at the end to give us the glaces but only 2 remained...when we told her that we were there before and we were going in together she went to give the glaces to the people behind us. We tried to complain but she brushed us off and completely ignored us. Even though we stayed very polite we were really disappointed by this unfair experience."
The memorial complex and the military Museum are very interesting!,"It will be interesting for those who are interested in the history of Korea. Very informative! Many rooms with exhibits, there is a real combat equipment Equipped area for watching documentaries about the war in Korea."
Visit to Seoul ,War memorial is perfect place to closely learn about history and sacrifice of Korean people It also shows countries who stood by and against Korea Very nice building and perfect place must visit 
Amazing Modern Museum,"This museum was included in our Seoul City Tour company's tour of N Seoul Tower, Hanok Village and Korean War Memorial. This museum is a Traveler's Choice Award museum and it does deserve this. This is a huge modern multi media museum that was free to go into.I concentrated on the section that covered the Korean War. I did not understand this war before going to this museum but I do understand why it happened now. I wish that I would have had more time to spend on this museum because they had other indoor displays and lots of outdoor sights as well. 1 1/2 hours was just not enough time."
Thing you have to see!,Very educational.on work day wasn’t crowded.loved everything especially outside!lots of pics and fun!
Educational museum,"On a rainy day museum was crowded, noisy kids running around. Worth to visit still, I learned a lot of Korean war history and felt nice how they remembered for example all UN partners in Korean war. Intresting how they linked modern technology with paintings and sculptures."
A must see if you are visiting Seoul.,This is a must-see if you are visiting Seoul. Especially if you are interested in military history. It takes you through all the military conflicts involving South Korea.
The war memorial of Korea.,"A huge memorial location with many exhibits to view.Easily a half day tour. Food in the attached restaurant was good and reasonably priced,Well worth a visit."
Exceptional Museum! ,"Honestly one of the best Museums I have been too! Well spaced out, clean and taken care of. You can feel the respect for their history in the information and atmosphere you see and feel. No charge but donations welcome. Free English speaking tour at 10am & 1pm, we unfortunately missed those but I have no doubt they would be great. English signage and leaflets all round, shows/videos and 4D available in English. Toilets on every level and so fresh and clean. The best bit for us was the children’s museum, fantastic interactive areas free of charge for a set 50min. There is a playground outside for the children to burn off energy and a few cafe to get snacks and ice cream, also blox (Lego) area which looked great but we didn’t use. "
Outstanding Museum & History of Korea,"Sadly, Korea's history has been marred with warfare over the centuries. But this museum is a great collection of this history with artifacts, interactive displays, and panoramas that take the visitor to some of these battles. Also interesting to note are some of displays on the modern ROK military which is one of the strongest in the world. The vastness of the museums reminds me of the Museum of the Great Patriotic War (WWII) in Moscow. "
"Great museum, educational and fun. ","Wasn’t too sure what to expect from this museum, but upon arrival we were blown away by how massive the place is. The museum was really large inside and out, with lots of exhibits to look at, interactive ones as well. A lot of in depth rich history and there’s even free English/Japanese walking tours (12pm and 2pm I believe). The admission to the museum is free and there’s 3 massive levels for you to experience. "
Educational experiance,Was great to learn so much about the Korean war and the struggle the KoreN people had to go through after that to become who they are right now. 
Best war memorial and museum,"Huge collection, spanning early Korean history to most recent conflict in the Gulf. As expected, there is a significant focus on the Korean War, but there is much, much more. The outdoor exhibits are extensive, including a B52D from the Vietnam War. The memorials are particularly meaningful and well done. There are many interactive exhibits, and plenty of English signage. This is easily a half-day visit, especially if you are interested in military conflict and Korean history. Provides great imsight to military history on the Korean Peninsula. Free entry. Easily the best war museum and memorial I have visited."
Don't Miss This,My family of eight visited Seoul in June 2019. We had never been to Korea before and didn't know quite what to expect. We chose the War Memorial because of our interest in history and the Korean War specifically. We weren't disappointed. The museum is well laid out and there is enough English that if you don't take the tour - which we did and recommend - you can still understand things.The tour guide had very good English and was very helpful. I liked that they paid credit to all the countries who sent soldiers to help them preserve their country when they were invaded.I am really glad we had the opportunity to see this amazing museum. 
Huge and full,"We were here a half day and did not nearly see it all. We started with the outside area first coming upon the Clock Tower of Peace and then the Statue of Brothers. From there we visited all the outdoor sights and particularly the Open-air Exhibition Area. On a warm May day I really did not want to leave but there are very few places to sit and take a break and with standing, reading, and observing a nice short bench break would have been welcomed. The first floor held a very interesting up to date exhibit (which may have been a special exhibit) about recent relations with North Korea. Admission is free. Be sure to grab a free brochure as it will help you plan your time at the museum."
Understand the Korean history of conflict,"We spent a half day in the museum. We were with our 20+ year old sons. Shortly after arriving, we drifted apart and did not see each other for a few hours. We all found things that captivated our interest. Lots to see and learn. Very well done displays and explanations. "
surprisingly extensive display,"I was not expecting much about this place, but was surprised to see the indoor and outdoor displays. They have a lot of tanks, artillery, fighter jets, and even a huge air force B52 bomber on display. There is also the coast guard cutter that still contains all the holes during the gun fight it had with the north koreans. Even if the AV presentation was in Korean, it provides a detailed blow by blow on the firefight.Very well kept and maintained, which showcases how nationalistic the country is.Well worth a visit even for non Koreans who are history or war buffs."
Insightful in several ways,"The museum provides a well illustrated history of the painful Korean war. You leave the museum a lot wiser than you arrived. Certainly in terms of the events of the war, but perhaps more interesting, you have a much better sense of the pain and deep wounds this meaningless war has had on the people of Korean. Clearly the history and culture of Korean is deeply affected by the divide and you feel you understand this a little better after the visit. If you are interested in military equipment this is definitely also a good place to visit. "
"The War Memorial Museum, Seoul","Excellent, very educational place to visit. Free admission. Be prepared to spend about 3 hours there. It is about 5 to 10 minutes from the subway station. The signage at the subway station exit is not so clear though, can certainly be improved. The museum is huge. At the lawn outside, there are exhibits of planes and a replica of a submarine. Inside the museum there are lots of war relics and artifacts along with informational/educational descriptions.Poignant/touching/chilling moments for me: (1) the Statue of Brothers, depicting 2 brothers hugging each other, who fought for the opposite sides (as South Korea vs. North Korea soldiers); (2) the inscribed near the main entrance that said “if you want peace, remember war”; (3) strolling through the Memorial Hall honoring the Korean war soldiers. In the UN soldiers section, names of USA soldiers far outnumbered those of other countries. It said that is a copy of the Washington DC’s Korean War Memorial. I don’t quite remember if I saw that during my DC visit, so those who have recollections of both places can perhaps comment."
Heartbreaking and educational,"We visited the War Memorial of Korea today. It was my second visit and it is well worth the time to explore. The building and grounds are beautiful and full of war relics. From prehistoric weapons, displays from different eras in Korean history to the high-tech displays to Admiral sun-shin's turtle ship- it is all here impressively displayed. Admission is by donation. The only suggestion that I would make is to have the address written in hangul on website (for the cab drivers). Be prepared to spend hours here. It's worth it."
Interesting to visit,"Attempting to find one's way from the subway stations can be challenging since the signnage is very poor (exit 12 from Line 6 is the easiest, line 4 more difficult). The memorial itself, however, is well presented and I am sure it would be much more interesting to those with a military background."
Good way to learn some Korean history...,"The area is big and there is a lot to see and learn. No entrance fee and you can learn a lot from the exhibit as there are a lot of things to see, hear, and experience. Suggest to put this in your agenda when visiting ROK."
Interesting and Serene,"There is a Memorial Hall for those who have passed from service in various Wars of Korea. Also there are military vehicles such as planes, ship, tanks and others where you can take photos or get a closer look. Within there are exhibits for the various wars Korea was involved in from early history to current. On Fridays, at 2 p.m. there is an exhibition of the various military branches in the front of the museum. This is where you experience the all female Color Guard, traditional martial arts, the various anthems of the military branches, and many other performances by the various military branches. Make sure to sit outside by one as they start to practice so you get a good spot to sit on the steps. Also, there is no charge for this Museum."
Very Moving and interesting,A total look at Korea at war from early time through Japanese imperial invasions to present day. Well worth the visit.
An Optional choice,"As war museums go this was all the encompassing for the Korean Peninsula. Korean friends back home stressed that we must see this. Well, there is a fair bit of jingoism here and I can see why Koreans feel strongly about it. If stressed for time, this is a miss."
Amazing place ,If you plan on coming here then don’t be rushed! There is so much to see.We had to plan well as we were on a time limit.We visited the rooms about the Korean War which were really informative and interesting. The English is just fine. They have rooms on further back in history which we didn’t have time to visit.Absolutely huge building. There’s a cafe selling nice smoothies and a gift shop on sight. Outside is amazing too - loads of fighter planes and tanks and of course the super impressive war memorial statue.What a great place to be free as well.
Well Worth the Visit,"This place not only documents the Korean war, but also pays tribute to all the nations that sent their sons to fight for the Korean people. Very moving. "
A great way to learn about the Korean War,"For most of us who are uninitiated about the Korean War, you mostly think of it as a US war like Vietnam. However the War Memorial of Korea really open your eyes that it involved the UN and China.The museum doesn't just focus on the Korean war - it highlights how Korea fought in wars during the ancient days, and its involvement in modern day conflicts. I joined a free guided tour in the morning. Although the tour guide's English was quite accented, he was very enthusiastic about what he was talking about."
Detailed View of Korean War History,"Initially I thought this museum would just be focused on the Korean War but it went into a lot more details on other historical battles waged by long ago Kings.Outside there were a number of memorial statues as well as a large assortment of aircraft, rockets and fighting vehicles that you could get up close to and peer inside. A number of the armored personnel carriers were open but you could not go in. Sets of stairs were brought next to a cobra helicopter so you could see inside the cockpit. The PKM357 ship from the 2002 Battle of Yeonpyeong is displayed here with red paint detailing every area damaged during the battle. This was the only display where you were allowed to climb onboard and see the bridge, deck and guns up close and learn more about the battle that killed South Korean seamen.As I walked up to the entrance, there were a number of black pillars dedicated to the UN and other countries that came to South Korea's defense during the Korean War. In addition along the walkways to the side of the main entrance were large plaques with all of the names of soldiers from around the world who died in the war. It was a lot of recognition and honor.Once I entered the museum, it turned out to be a lot larger than I anticipated. The bottom floor contained details about each kingdom’s armies and battles and went into size, arms, skills and success. In the central courtyard were wooden replicas of early Korean warships. The top two floors went into extensive review of the Korean War with 4D movies, dioramas and artifacts. Additional planes, limosines and arms were also displayed.Unfortunately I ran out of time but one could easily spend 2-3 hours here."
Moving and a reminder of the tragedy of war,"The outside memorials are, in my opinion, the best part of the whole thing. The statues and installations are very moving and well designed. Inside the Korean War exhibits are very well put together, and take you through each year of the war, the help received by various countries and the contexts of the war. My only critique would be that they seem to microscopically criticize the north in every facet, while never accepting or elaborating on any of the shortcomings the south may have had. In brief, a broader and less biased history would have helped to understand the nuances of the war a little bit more. The memorial is free! Which is awesome for budget travelers. Near the entrance you can find huge walls with all the names of the victims from each respective country that died in the Korean War, so that was also very special. It's nice to see the recognition showed by Korea to every country that tried to help them. If you're interested there are also war machines out in the front of the memorial with vehicles such as tanks and a big war ship."
"Interesting museum, a bit dull","When you're interested in Korean history, this museum is a must visit. However, I found it a bit dull. The information was presented very simple, without any 'extra's.'I think I expected more information about the course of the war. The information could have been presented way more interactive, or with some items to go with it."
The Beauty of War,A beautiful interactive display of history that gives you opportunity to understand the importance of what it means to fight for your freedom. War is scary but this gives the opportunity to be guided through history to understand the changes and development of people during the sone of worst decades in world history. To see war bring together the most unlikely and war torn countries together to fight for the freedom of others and rebuilding of others. It’s an amazing.
Great,"Very nice to visit if you want to learn about South Korea's history. Lots of military plane, tanks, etc. to see and take pictures here."
An excellent half day--or a day if you are really into this conflict.,"We came after lunch to the War Memorial. It has excellent programs that explain the war and the international coalition that brought the North Korean-Russian-Chinese forces to armistice. There are lots of details for those who love details and it is easy to choose what to focus on and what to pass on. There is lots of English interpretation, unlike some other museums in Korea, and many beautiful sculptural tributes to the many soldiers who gave their lives. Korea lost just over 170,000 soldiers and God knows how many civilians. Just over 10,000 Americans died. There is no entry fee, there are a number of good video programs and there is a coffee shop if you suffer from museum eyes after a while. For Americans especially I think this is a good way to understand something of the very special bond that exists between Koreans and Americans. One thing it could do better is to illustrate the cultural rifts between North and South that existed for centuries before the conflict. This dividing line is not just a creature of the Cold War. Coming during the week would be a good idea. We were there on a Thursday afternoon and found plentiful parking. I'd certainly go again."
Multimedia Narrative History and Artifacts,"Great, free, museum about conflict on and over the Korean peninsula from ancient to modern times. I spent 2.5 hours here and still didn't see, read everything. A wonderful mix of multi-media (movies, actual US/ROK and captured equipment, wax museum like staging, and other artifacts. If I get back, I would visit again and review from current 3rd floor to ancient times 1st floor. Save some time for outdoor equipment."
Great make time for it,It's huge and they have put in a massive amount of time and money.If you are interested in this kind of stuff allow a full day. If not spend an hour or two and see what you want.Probably the most informative museum in the area and its all free.
So much to see ,There is a lot to see at this museum there are old tanks and aircraft and more on the outside and inside There is no fee to this museum and it can easily take a day to see everything They give you a lot of historical information on Korea and the US and it is near Yongsan US military base that will be closing soon so I made visiting both of them a day trip
"Impressive, moving and just a little unsettling","As I had some free time left in Seoul, the War Memorial seemed a good place to visit as a follow-up to visiting the DMZ. Although I'm not really interested in military history, I found an impressive and informative range of displays on the history of war on the Korean Peninsula and an expression of hope for the future. To be honest, I found it all a little unsettling, but it's very well presented and there is an area for kids to learn the history. There's also a wide-ranging display of military aircraft, tanks, missiles, etc, that you can get up close to. Worth a visit, even if military history isn't your thing. Free entry."
A Must for Military Buffs,"I visited this as a last minute decision, heard the announcement on the hop-on-hop-off bus and figured I would check it out. It turned out to be a good decision. The museum is very modern and well organized with a lot more exhibits than I ever expected.There are 3 floors inside with exhibits from the Korean conflict as well as details of the Korean Military's contributions to other endeavours such as the Vietnam Conflict. Very well done.The thing that really impressed me was the outdoor exhibit with US, ROK, and Soviet weapons many of which I hadn't seen before. It is quite a size and includes a B-52 and an entire Patrol Gunboat. As a final touch many of the tanks are surrounded by lovely flowers which somehow seems appropriate for a hope for peace.There was no admission charge."
Gotta go,Fantastic museum. Well worth a visit. You need a few hours to have a good look. Very easy to get to on the subway. 
Informative,Spent a few hours at the large free memorial. Amazing collection of items from the war. The largest I have ever seen at a single museum on the war. Provides detailed history of the conflict between North and South Korea.
Very Moving,A wonderful memorial to those who were lost in the “forgotten” and continuing war. This memorial gives you a feeling for the losses suffered by the Korean military and civilian population which escapes Mose Americans. A Highly recommended stop.
Amazing place,This is quite amazing. Its free and it tells the story of war through the ages. there are lots to look at and many movies explaining the history of the Korean empire. It tells every aspect of the story even the peace keeping aspect of the Korean military. I was very moved by the memorials outside the museum thanking the different nations helping the people of South Korea.
Shocking ,"Well....it definitely IS a WAR museum. I found it simply obnoxious. We were led into a movie play which encountered me to be more like a counter strike video game. It was a 4d movie! Sitting there and watching the invasion of Incheon through a soldiers eye.... ok.... not my idea of a „war museum“(that is supposed to be dealing with the terror of war)..... but when these soldiers started to fire at their own -but north- korean people I was just simply shocked. I have never ever seen such an impiety before. It all reached its peak when some american tourists wanted to start clapping at the end of the „show“. But they wouldn’t dare to as we all looked shocked and pissed and wouldn’t want to clap. The rest of this museum is ok but it rarely displays the terror of war, it even more glorifies it. It took me a few days to get rid of this disgusted feeling when I left the museum. It’s more like US Propaganda."
Interesting,Spent the morning there and it's a must to see. It's wonderfully kept for you to wander around and take in the past. It brings it home to you what South Korea went through and how many countries were involved. It also reminds you that it was one of the poorest countries after the war and how far it has come now.
Memorial & museum - The Forgotten War,"A stunning circular memorial plaza, surrounded by black marble plaques detailing all the names of the ROK dead. The museum details the geo-political background and build up to the war in 1950. Too much to mention, good exhibits all detailed in Korean and English. Lots of hardware outside and inside. Worth a morning or an afternoon. Free entry."
Worth a visit to learn about the war that essentially transformed Korean society,"Very well done war museum that tells the story of all of the wars Korea has faced in its history. But for Western visitors, it's sufficient to focus here solely on the exhibition dedicated to the Korean War. It's a great place to learn about the war that essentially brought the Republic of Korea to where it is today. Definitely worth a short visit."
One of the best war museums,One of the best war museums & memorials in the world. Huge building and huge outside area with exhibits mostly from the Korean war in 1950s
Understanding how Koreans fought for their country.,"It was the first time I saw war weapons, aircraft, war ship and tankers used during the war. Very informative visit."
Fantastic learning for free,"I visited this museum and spent good 5+ hours touring around. They have exhaustive materials on war history, literally from the very beginning. The Korean war materials were very sobering as well as educational. Make sure the check outside yard for their extensive collection of war equipments!"
Quite impressive,Originally we did not plant to visit the musem but we were happy that we decided otherwise. We leaned quie a lot about the so called forgotten war and the museum is a good mix of information and memorials. Also the outside part with an actual B52 bomber is worthwhile
Extensive museum of the history of war in Korea,"This is a massive museum providing information about wars and military strategy throughout the history of Korea (and, now, South Korea). While an English Language tour was provided, it started out focusing intensely (in terms of time invested) on the ""Korean War"" (which I suppose is what most English speakers want to know about). We were hoping for more of an overview of the museum, so we left the group early. It took us 2 hours to see the entire museum quickly. All signage is in English. "
a very moving experience,"this memorial park and cemetery is beautiful and very moving. we learned alot in the little museum there about the Korean War, also a beautiful park"
WOW!,"Excellent museum - It's part memorial part museum.While there is always some sombre moments visiting a war memorial, I found this one to be very well designed and tourist friendly. It tells the story with easy to follow layout and exhibitions.Highly recommended to anyone with an interest in war in general or the Korean war in particular.You could run through in an hour but I'd recommend at least a few hours to take it all in."
Awesome....awesome....awesome!,"This was my highlight in my trip to SEOUL. Fantastic military equipments on the outside and very informative musseum on the inside. Btw, admission is free. "
"Excellent museum, worth a visit!","An excellent museum to learn about Korea. Great exhibits and storytelling. Entrance is free and you can download an audio guide when you get there using their free Wi-Fi. There's some focus on wars, but lots of general history as well. Explains a lot about why the country is the way it is. Would highly recommend for people who enjoy history."
As Deep as You Want to Go,"Covers everything from thousands of years ago to the present conflict, with a surprising amount of depth in any area. Would be good for kids or especially for adults."
That's why South Korea,"I visited with my friend from Australia. He didn't have any knowledge of South Korea. I thought this place just explain about weapon or flight of war something ... I have been there, but I didn't remember well. And I knew I was totally wrong. we had 5 hour there but it was not enough time for see there. Long Long time ago Korea had war and war again a lot too many time. so if you know the war of Korea you will know about Korea history, nationality, geography ... it was my best part of trip. don't think too much Just go there and see about Korea. Never disappointed you !"
Very Interesting Museum,The museum is quite big it will easily take 4-5 hours to go thru all. So we joined a hour guided tour. Very good. Now we understand more about the history and how the Korean people were suffering. Is a MUST if you wanted to know the history how north and South Korea were seperated. We spent about 3 hours there but still didn’t manage to see all. It is free why not! 
COOL and it's FREE,"One of the great things about the museum's in Seoul is that most of them are free to include the war Memorial. It's easy accessible by metro, it's huge with great visual history on the inside and has a large park on the outside. It's one of the best museums that I've been to. It's worth putting on the calendar for a visit."
Worth a visit!,"Really glad I spent a few hours at the War Memorial. So moving. There are free tours in English (one in morning (10?) and 2pm. Many audio visuals to make it interesting, and worth visiting the outside just to see the monuments. Bonus--beautiful cherry trees in the area."
Good rainy day programme,Before heading to the DMZ pay a visit to this museum. You need to understand the histoty of this torn country.
Worth spending up to 2 hours here,"This monumental building is indeed a monument or memorial, and does not include a lot of guns and other military hardware. This contrasts with the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, which despite its name, is mostly filled with the machinery of war. More English lsnguage captions would be useful"
Very impressice,"I’ve been to many number of war memorials and military museums: this takes the cake. Huge collection of both Western and Soviet vehicles (tanks and aircraft) outside.The inside of the war memorial is touching, and appropriately conveys the loss of life in the Korean War.It is also one of the few governments attractions that is free. A must."
Full of history!,We stumbled upon this on a rainy afternoon when looking for something to do in the area. We arrived late afternoon to find it filled with School children but they soon left. The outside was filled with war vechicles such as tanks and planes and you can easily wander between them getting very close. The inside was spacious and set out nicely. There are lots of war rooms telling the complete history of Korea and war history. Everything is written in English as well and all the films have an English option. We couldn’t believe the musuem was free! Thoroughly impressed and educated now.
"Great museum, must see & free! No costs!","Great museum, lots of cool exhibits. Great service and very tourist friendly. Free & no cost which is great. Must visit if you come to Seoul! Learned lots about all the wars Korea was in and Korean history! :)"
Well worth a visit. ,The outside has a large number of exhibits including a huge B-52 bomber. Inside it gives the history of the war and even my youngest child found it interesting and moving. 
Well worth the visit,"One not to be missed, you could spend a whole day here, Well laid out and flow through the different areas. Tell the whole story of the Korean Military and wars. Lots of exhibits to see, emotional in places. "
"Displays, content and presentation are superb","This is a must-stop for any visit to Seoul. The organization of exhibits and content makes for a powerful and moving presentation. You could spend an entire day, but schedule at least 2 hours."
Amazing Museum,This was a wonderful museum to visit. The tributes to the Korean wars was thorough and well-done. We spent half a day at the museum and only saw about half the museum. I highly recommend!
The best museum I've ever been to,"I loved this museum. It was beautiful, emotional, and respectful. I felt so empowered and in love with the Korean people after visiting."
Great history!!,"I’m a huge of General history, so this place hit the spot. And it’s free! There are warring vehicles outside the museum and a little bit more inside. The place is massively huge and it may take a full day to finish the entire place. There are a couple of 4d theaters with limited seatings with scheduled times, make sure u get to each theater a bit earlier to save a seat! The exhibits covers history of the early AD, as well as the Korean War. There are videos, documents, pictures, artifacts, theaters. Definitely learned a great deal about Korean history!"
Amazing tribute to the Korean wars,This is a must see if in Seoul. The museum was very artfully done and told the history of war in Korea. I am not a fan of war museums but this one was amazing. I loved all the different visual effects and felt they did a wonderful job of recognizing the refugees of the wars and especially the section that acknowledged and thanked all the countries involved and lives lost in the North/South Korean War. Such an interesting display. 
Free entry daily (except Monday) to a meaningful museum,"For history buffs like myself, you should set aside at least half a day for this sprawling war memorial and museum. The outdoor section includes symbolic monuments, planes, tanks, and a 4-D video exhibit about heroic South Korean sailors which made me tear with emotion. The indoor section has 3 levels which you should start from the bottom. It starts from the evolving of Korea from even B.C. times all the way post-Korean War - that's literally two thousand years of warring history. There are plenty of exhibits and videos and 4-D experiences. My fiancée and I walked away with a deeper appreciation of the sacrifices of so many, and the realization that ""Freedom is not free""."
Great place to gain perspective of warfare on Korean peninsula ,"This museum is great place to gain a good perspective on the history of warfare on the Korean peninsula as well as the Republic of Korea's involvement in warfare elsewhere (Vietnam, etc.). The museum often has guided tours and offers self-paced tours with recorded explanations in a variety of languages available for use. The museum is large and exhibits are extensive so you should allot no less than 2-3 hours to do the place justice. I was there a half day and still sort of rushed through a couple of areas. This museum is only a couple of subway stops from the Korean National Museum so you could easily spend an entire day experiencing these two museums."
History ,"Beautiful grounds and building. Outdoor full of planes, tanks etc. For children and adults to climb. The museum is one of the best I’ve been to. Must see !"
Historical,"There are many beautiful museums in the world - this is how it will end up in one of the most interesting - as always in this area it gives rise to a lot of sad emotions and thoughts but such places are very important for people not to make the same mistakes! A beautiful, sad place that can show a piece of history to a man"
Very interesting ,"What can you say about war memorials? It’s a memorial, not a museum. It’s a must visit, but we didn’t stay more than an hour. Wouldn’t visit again, but would recommend to friends. "
One of the best museums I've ever visited,"Definitely worth visiting! One of the best museums I've ever visited. Very informative, amazingly done, and all of that for free! "
"The War Memorial of Korea, Seoul, S. Korea.","While in Seoul, South Korea, I had the opportunity, and yes I consider it to have been a real honor, to visit three of the Korean War memorials here in the greater Seoul Metro Area. My visits provided me with some valuable insights into the Korean War that began on June the 25th 1950.Two of the memorials that I visited were the UN FORCES FIRST BATTLE MEMORIAL located in Osan and THE MEMORIAL HALL OF THE INCHEON LANDING OPERATION located in Incheon.The War Memorial of Korea here in Seoul is easily, far-and-away, the largest of the three Korean War memorials that I have seen and visited while in Seoul. It is absolutely enormous. To do it justice, a visit would take a full day and even that would be a push. I feel that I saw perhaps 40% of it and that was accomplished during two separate visits that were several days apart.Which leads me to this comment : IF you are handicapped and have difficulty walking, you may want to take the size of The War Memorial of Korea into consideration. IF you have a wheel chair you will be in great shape. IF not, there are ample places to sit and to rest. There can be no question that IF you have an interest in the Korean War, this is an absolute must-see attraction."
Deeply Moving,"The outside is just as good as the inside. Powerful sculptures, a massive amount of relics, flags and number served from each country, wall of remembrance. Inside is also great, but if you were on a tight schedule, you could easily walk the outside and grasp the depth of emotions still felt by all Koreans. My family was very glad we visited this museum."
A must see in Seoul,I lived in Seoul for five years and visited the Memorial several times and went on the narrated tour. The tour was great. Don't worry if you don't speak Korean the tour is given in multiple languages. It gives a real insight of the Korean War and the suffering the Koreans endured and how numerous country stepped up and defended South Korea and fought along side their army.
Very Interesting,This was on our to do list for our one day excursion to Seoul and it was definitely worth the time. It is a tribute to those who fought and died during the Korean war.
War Memorial,The museum is located in Yongsan-dong. The exhibit contains the military history of Korea. It has indoor and outdoor displays. It was built to commemorate the sacrifice of patriotic martyrs during the Korean war.
"Fascinating, extensive war museum in Seoul","I heard about this museum from a fellow American staying at my hotel, and I'm so glad I was able to visit it during my time in Seoul. The history of the Korean War is tragic and complicated, and the museum does a great job at explaining what happened and how it continues to reverberate. The ground of the museum are also huge with airplanes, tanks, and weapons from the era. A must-see for any history buff."
You need half day for this one,It will take you 4-5 hrs to tour this big museum and see the rich history of Korean War. Restaurants and other food establishments are few meters away. Bring small snacks just in case.
Best and Knowledgeable Experience,"This place is located near to National Museum of Korea. No entry fee which is the best thing.This is one of the best war museum I've ever visited. Lot of informative stuff, 4D movies for experience. You get to see actual stuff used in Korean war. A must visit place."
Extensive exhibits,"This is an excellent war museum and memorial. If you must choose, this museum is much more interesting than the National Museum of Korea. The exhibits are thorough and updated; overall much larger than I expected. Plan to spend several hours exploring and learning about this important era. "
Very informative museum,"I went the day after Chinese New Year, but it was closed, so I was able to go for a couple hours before my flight home. The museum was very informative and provided a great insight into the history and how the war started and the role of the UN forces. Upon entering, I was greeted by what turned out to be an English speaking guide. He was very informative, but I had to part and rush through the remaining exhibits to catch my flight out. Otherwise, I'd probably spend another couple hours there. Highly recommended."
So much to learn and appreciate!!,"It was nice. I feel like I went back in time. You can see how war affected people then, and still today. So many lives were lost, and I feel nostalgic going here. The layouts of the sections of the history were easy to navigate. I like how the rooms connected to each other. It was free entrance, and you can spend a whole day here. "
A very good place to learn history,"A very good place to learn about war in Korea. But the downside is that since the visual is kind of real and they make the wax image and all, it can be kind of depressing once you visited the museum. But still it really worth visiting~!"
An extremely interesting museum for those interested by Korean history,"The museum is quite huge. It is split in many parts, with one part focused on the World War II. The museum is entirely translated in English, and there's various documents and items that are available to see. "
Very nice and informative war memorial,"As a person without that much knowledge and detail about the Korean War since it is not taught in schools here, this place was great. It is not only informative but it is presented in such a way that it makes you want to learn while still presenting the truths and horrors of wars in general. I'd definitely recommend this place"
Arguably...,"...the best historical museum in the world. Certainly the best one I’ve been to. Epic!!! If you’re like me and want to study and read most of the displays in a museum, you’ll need at least a whole day here. For some reason, I especially liked the ones on Korean participation in the Vietnam War. Somehow, the curator was able to put past the horrors of war and honor the soldiers and citizens of Korea. I was fascinated the whole time I was here which was much longer than planned. If I have any criticism of this place, a more nuanced perspective in North Korea’s participation is needed. The displays of wars prior to the partition of the country remind us they are an integral part of the Korean story."
A thing to see on your list,If you have any interest in the war between North and South then it is worth the visit. We have a belief that when we visit any country it is great to try and visit as many places that hold interest. 
War Air planes,We found this by chance after our lunch at Itaewon. We decide to take a slow walk from Itaewon to Namdaemon and come across this place.Interesting to see collections of war air planes and other vehicles store at one open space. We had great time reading through the information guide.FREEDOM IS NOT FREE
"Huge museum, very nice","Probably best to visit this museum a few times to give all the exhibitions the time they deserve. If you are into Korean history, be sure to visit this place. Also good to get background information about historical sites you might visit. (Like Hwaseong fortess in Suwon)The Korean War Memorial is beautiful. "
Amazing!,Its free entrance and very easy to find. We went there on a monday sadly you cant board the gun boat. But you will find more amazing war machine aside from that. 
The History Lesson is Invaluable,Take time to view all of the static displays outside and the amazing displays inside. We spent three hours here and could have stayed the entire day. This museum is a must visit for everyone coming to Seoul. It is very well done.
Informative about a war Westerners may forget.,"Visited on 12/1/2019 after a tour of the DMZ in the morning. The Korean War is a conflict that doesn't get much attention in the West, perhaps being forgotten due to its proximity to WW2. This free museum has English translations and is spread across three floors. It goes into detail about the history of Korea and then the origins of the Korean War and the aftermath. At the moment there is also an exhibition about the relationship between SK and the US, as it has reached its 65th anniversary. A very interesting place to spend an afternoon, definitely recommended for anyone who's interested in post-WW2 history."
Amazing place,"Growing up in former Yugoslavia and going through war in the '90 visiting this museum was very emotional for me. I was planning to stay there for 2 hours max and in the end I stayed 5 hours! Definitely a must to visit and to learn more about what ideology can do to one group of people! My prayers are with brave Korean people and I hope that situation on Korean península will be resolved in future. No entrance fee and even if there was one I would pay it gladly. Visit, visit, visit! "
You will find a detailed explanation of Korean War history throughout the museum,"Very good museum to visit, mainly focusing on Korean War history. It is located in Yongsan-gu, Seoul. Entry is free. The war memorial building has many exhibition rooms and an outdoor exhibition centre. There are nice displays of planes, tanks, and other military equipment. You will find a detailed explanation of Korean War history throughout the museum."
The Best War Memorial in the World,"I'm not joking when I say that. This place doubles as both a military museum with dozens of exhibit tanks, helicopters, aircraft and ships that make military history nerds like myself giggle with glee, and a grand, sombre memorial to the events that literally shaped the founding of the nation. The exhibits chronicle Korea's history of invasion by foreign states, its drive for self-determination, and its fight to survive against its northern neighbour in the Korean War of 1950-53. The exhibits make many boasts of how the nation must be strong to ensure its safety, but they never stray anywhere near nationalist or jingoistic themes. If anything, they serve to underscore the true destruction that war brings, and that whilst it is never wrong to fight for the right cause, the experience of war itself is something that should never be venerated or glorified.I spent almost 3 hours here - one completely lost in the maze of the vehicle yard outside, and the other 2 in the gargantuan memorial building itself. It was easy to navigate, and although admission was free, I made a donation at the end of my visit because of how immensely impressed I was with the experience. If you're in Seoul and want to get a better understanding of South Korea's recent history, this is something you cannot miss."
Awesome place to learn about the Korean war,"This museum is very modern, visual an incredibly informative. Unfortunately, as a Hungarian citizen, we don't learn much about Korean history so I am very glad that I have visited The War Memorial. I didn't know much about the place, so when I planned my day, I only dedicated one hour to this Museum. Needless to say, as I got lost in this enormous history lesson, I actually used up 3 and a half hours. Very thankful for this experience, I am looking forward to visit it again with some friends or family members."
Best Museum in Seoul,"The outdoor military vehicles such as tanker, missile launcher, aircraft and naval vessel were simply amazing. The indoor display of armoury was interesting as well. We spent almost 2 hours touring this free entry museum. Would have spent more time if we were not in a hurry. "
Covers more than the Korean war,"Before visiting, I had the impression it mainly focused on the Korean War. Although that is true, it also has other exhibits that covers history of Korea back to the older empire which was really educational as well."
Very Informative,Large museum on Korean War presented from Korean point of view. Generally positive and contains a lot of information which will satisfy history buffs. Worth visiting especially since there is no admisson.
Powerful and moving,What a great way to spend the day learning more about Korea! Totally worth the trip. We loved taking our time exploring the museum. Very well done--each and every room is wonderful!
Interesting experience,"Enjoyed our visit here. The outdoor area had lots of planes and tanks, and the museum and information inside was great. Good place fo families or those with an interest in Korean War history. Free to enter. "
Trip in Seoul,"Visited when I did a trip around Seoul, there is many things to see in Seoul but I wanted to see this and did"
Very cool place,We have been here a few times and our small children never want to leave. There are plenty of photo opportunities!
Highly educational and engaging,"Large volume of indoor and outdoor exhibits showcasing different era of the Korean military warfare, particular focus on the recent Korean war. Impressive, solemn honour of the fallen at the entrance. Highly recommended for those who would like to learn more about this unfinished war. Plan to spend at least half a day."
This place is a definite “must visit” if you are keen to understand the Korean War,"We visited this place of interest on a Saturday afternoon, and was surprised it was not crowded at all. We spent some time looking at the tanks, airplanes and ship that were somehow involved in the war.Then we moved to the museum inside. The exhibits were well thought out and well organised. There must be a lot of planning that went into the building and arranging the exhibits. Our regret was that we did not arrive earlier as we had to rush through the museum.This place is a definite “must visit” if you are keen to understand the Korean War, and do allocate sufficient time to explore the museum and watch the various documentaries. "
Incredibly moving memorial,"I'm glad I made the time to visit the War Memorial of Korea - it's a beautiful and incredibly moving center. I was fortunate the memorial was not crowded, so I was able to take my time browsing the artifacts and reading more about the events that took place before, during, and after the war. The candlelit memorial hall and ""peace tree"" were particularly memorable. "
War Memorial is Amazing,"Such a beautiful memorial to those lost in the Korean War and a history of all of the other wars they have endured. We were able to see the name of a Soldier who was from my small Ontario town who was killed in the Korean War. The sculptures are stunning as is the Rotunda and outdoor area. Magnificant display of planes , bombs etc. A must see."
Children’s Museum & Outdoor Activities,"We went here to go to the museum with our 3 and 5 year old but we just spent over an hour reading all the signs and talking about each aircraft, it’s purpose and the vehicles and their purpose. My kids were absolutely fascinated with them. There were several they were able to go up to via stairs or into via ramp. They loved the high speed vessel though our youngest got scared in the pilot house when the recording came on. Then after visiting all the airplanes and vehicles we found a children’s museum next to and at the war memorial. It was like a children’s war museum. It used sensory (touch, see and feel) to teach them about the war. Then there was a play area and coffee shop at the end but you are limited to 2 hours before they make you leave the museum. Coffee shop was good too. "
impressive with the warships and aircraft,good place to visit with kids. the extensive exhibits of aircraft and tanks used during wartime. internal exhibition a little bit boring though.
Understand why there are two Koreas!,"PROS:* Excellent presentation of the history why there are two Koreas* Proud of the United States' contribution. Understood America's involvement spurred because of not wanting to support the spread of communism and socialism.* Beautiful museum.CONS:* Was a bit hard to find from the bus stop. Google Maps did not bring us to the front and we had to walk around. The guard helped us find the front entrance.* No cons of the museum. Immersive, interactive and educational."
Must Visit Great Museum,At first I taught that it just like a normally boring museum. But its not...its a great museum to learn about the war of Korea. The outdoor itself so attractive with so many planes and ships. Indoor also good place to learn more about what occurred during the war in Korea. Not regret visited the War Memorial of Korea. Everyone enjoy the place.
Wonderful museum inside and out,"The displays are very well done and every country that participated in the Korean War is presented and honoured.Outside of the museum includes several tanks, airplanes etc used during the war. Give yourself a couple of hours to thoroughly cover. Note it is closed on Monday. Easy to reach by subway. "
"Amazing, beautiful, and educational","The grounds of of the museum are huge and beautiful. You can see Seoul Tower from the outside exhibits. Very educational in an interesting and intriguing way. All information available in english. fascinating exhibits. Best to go on a day that it isn't raining so you can enjoy the exhibits that are outside. Suggested time spent here, 2+ hours"
Learning about the Korean War,Good alternative in addition to other tourist spots in Seoul. There is an outdoor area which holds memorial monuments and also display various tanks and planes that were used in the war. Great place to learn about the history of the Korean War. Be sure to visit the 4D simulator to get a glimpse of what it was like during the war.
Definitely worth a visit,"The outdoor memorial has the famous Korean War monument and the Two Brothers monument. But make sure to stop inside the museum as well, which is free. The museum shows the history of all of Korea's wars. It also has a good souvenir shop with some books in English on Korean culture and history."
Must visit place,A solemn place to visit for those interested in happenings of the Korean war. Good history lesson and a solemn reminder that the price of freedom is not free.
Great history lesson,"I thought before I walked in that this would focus solely on the Korean War as we know it in the US, but it is a complete timeline of Korea’s tumultuous past. It is a free exhibit and there is a lot to see so give yourself a couple of hours. Most of the exhibits have text in multiple languages explaining the display. There is a lot of history on this peninsula and this does a great job of portraying that. "
Cannot miss this place if you go to Seoul ,"Definitely worth the visit, went there on my last day (today) after reading so many good reviews, and I totally agree with them. It is a Free entrance Museum, so there are no excuses not to visit, you can learn and see so much about the country. You spend about 2-4 hours in the museum or even more, I spent 3 hours because the museum was closing (18h00), but could have been there a little more."
English guided tour,Very interesting museum. The Tour was perfect. Lot of new information about the war with lots of items on display. 
A chance to see real war planes and vehicles,The outside houses tanks and aircrafts. Inside the building it talks about the different conflicts and the weapons used. If your into war history go and take a look! 
Such an educational experience!,I really enjoyed the War Memorial because it covered the various wars and not just the Korean War. It included all wars where Koreas were involved and it has been done very respectfully. Definitely worth a visit if you're in Seoul. The outdoor exhibition on all the planes is also amazing. 
One of the best museum I've visited,"We visites the museum with young children (6 and 9), all of us enjoyed with both indoor and outdoor displays. There are a lot of interactive information board, usage or technology to showcase, and most importantly, at least 98% of the exhibits have English explanation. "
Freedom is Not Free,"Excellent learning about the Korean War in 1950 and how the UN coliation came over to help fight this war. For everyone that didn't go through WW2, this museum is a reminder about how destructive war is on humanity and that we must not go to war ever again. Expect to spend at least 2-4 hours going through the indoor exhibits and the outdoor aeroplanes, helicopters, tanks and boat that were used in the war. Freedom is not free because everyone loses in a war. Many other notable quotes on the walls of the mesuem. Do not miss this museum when in Seoul. "
Surprisingly good ,"This makes the Imperial War Museum in London look like crap! There is every type of military vehicle imaginable on display in the grounds and you can climb all over them. In the museum, there are separate exhibits for children and the history of Korea is shown through its various invasions and conquests. Interesting and well presented with plenty of interaction most of which is in English, Mandarin and Japanese. The memorial itself is beautiful and moving. Well worth a visit even if you are not a military enthusiast. "
Very interesting Museum ,"This museum should be on your travel list, if you have a few days.It gives you a very detailed overview about the history of Korea with a focus on the wars it fought.The key focus is of course on the Korean War and it gave us a lot of new insights and a clear understanding of it.The museum is free and you should take at least 2-3 hours time when you plan to visit it."
Korea War Memorial,"Interesting museum with a lot of information and military equipment used in real life inside. Museum has both closed and open spaces. Open space is an exhibition of many military planes, boats, weapons and vehicles. It is better to visit on such a day that weather conditions allow to stay outside long time."
Very moving and inspirational,"This museum is a must, you must go and see the history of Korean war. It is so in details and exhibitions are well done."
Must visit for history buffs ,"The museum grounds are huge. Think similar to the US Congress. The museum has wonderful exhibits that span 2 millenniums of war history on 3 floors. There are war planes, tanks et al outside as well. Admission is free. One could spend an entire day in the museum in a casual stroll and still not cover it all. I would recommend reviewing a museum pamphlet (available in multiple languages) and choosing the exhibits that most appeal to you and go from there. You can also get a recorded guide headset at the entrance. "
Nice museum,Very nice museum and Memorial. Large airplane venue with all Korean War airplanes and jets used during war. Had a nice live military march display and plenty of war history. Would go back if ever in Seoul again.
A must see for history buffs,Very interesting to see how Korea views it's military and relationships with other countries. There was a military parade going on during our visit. It was in honor of the Veterans.
wonderful inteactive modern musum,Worth every minute. Gives real feeling of this not justified war that caused many many casualties of Korean civilians and American soldiers. Many interactive activities. Good organization. Monument very impressive. A Seoul must to my opinion
You shold go,"The Korean war is very important in the contemporan history of Korea, we went to the english guided tour done by a guide who had some souvenirs from the period. weapons, tanks, ships military plans.. A place to visit in seoul"
A must see,"A free museum which offers plenty to see. It highlights the Korean War Outside with tributes to the flags serving under the U.N. Inside there is a lot on the history of Korea. Lots of planes, tanks etc outside to take photos of."
Best thing in Seoul,"If you only had enough time to do one thing in Seoul, this should be it. We found this place unexpectedly moving. It does have the most massive display of military equipment I have ever seen in one place, but the overarching theme is one of gratitude to every country that helped South Korea in this war, and also that war is a horrible thing. A lot of displays focused on the impact this war had on families of all countries. The museum covers military artifacts and uniforms all the way back to prehistoric times, which was a bonus. This museum is very well thought out and again, pays great respect to all countries involved in the war. There are hands on displays for kids (mini castle to walk around in, many military vehicles can be boarded). Several films are available on demand to be seen in several languages, including English. Very impressive museum, and I don't give that compliment lightly. Don't miss. Admission free. Cafeteria and gift shop."
Not terrible exciting,I think everyone has to go here once. It's one of those things you do as a tourist. Some of the sights are cool but overall it does not compare to other international cities.
Great Museum,"Lots of old aircrafts, tanks and a war ship. They did great on remembering the heroes who fought in this war. The plan was to stay an hour but took us 2 hours. Time flies when one is enjoying. The best museum I’ve been to yet."
Beautiful and interesting,"The memorials are spectacular as was the military school display that was taking place when we arrived at 10am. You can easily spend hours walking around the tanks, planes and other military artifacts in the park."
it’s ok,well I am not really interested but went there because I had too ... but it’s ok ... what do you expect ? sad past ... 
English friendly exhibits about Korean War,"Easily accessed by metro Samgakjiyeok. Entrance is free. Site maps in major languages and guided tour in foreign languages available. Large building but simple layout easy to navigate. I went to exhibition rooms concerning the Korean War. I found them well laid out, adequate English and Chinese translations. Videos were English subtitled only. Only thing lacking is details of human suffering. Exhibits of military hardware was impressive and one can even touch a B-52 bomber! In addition to F-86, P-51, F-4,F-5, MIG15 and 19. There are many tanks too from both sides. A must for anyone into military history. "
A good place for history,"The place is huge both inside and outside. The hall gives honor to all The wars in Korea since The earlier years OF its history. The place was nicely organized and prepared. IT covers all the era from The 4th century onwards. There are exhibits, video presentations and actual War machines inside and outside. The outside has exhibits from The Korean wars OF tanks, planes, Rockets and artillery. A must place to visit in Seoul."
You learn something new everyday,"Before I went here i didn't know much about the Korean war but now I know quite a bit , even better it's free to visit"
Korea war HISTORY,"Korea war memorial, This place is like a one stop center for every information about Korean wars and countries that stood by then during the wars. VICE NICE PLACE, I recommend this place for those people interested in Korean history. you can also visit with friends and family as they display airplane tanks and many war instruments.The Place would show you background about the war, it was really fun place to be. for me I can visit as many time as I want to. very interesting placeyou can visit with your camera"
Must visit,"It is a must see attraction if you are visiting South Korea. Full of rich history on Korean war, world war II etc. One of the best war memorial I have ever visited."
Nice place!!,I really enjoyed it. If you are interested in the history of the war I suggest to visit the place which is well organized and completely free.
Free attraction,"Yes, its free. If you really interest in history please pay a visit here. This is one of the best ""free"" museum i ever visit. Very technology orientated and you can take some photo with plane, helicopter, ......."
Korean War Overview,We visited this site as part of our detailed study of leadership of the Korean War. Well worth the trip educationally and historically
Absolutely must see museum,"We recommend this museum to all of our friends who visit us in Korea. It has so much information about the Korean war as well as a huge range of military tanks, planes and even a boat outside. It's great for the whole family, although the kids did get a bit bored inside. The building is vast and so beautifully set out, that even just walking around it is interesting."
Excellent museum,The War Memorial of Korea is well done. It has something to hold the interest of all age levels.We were impressed.Admission is free.Be sure to take the English brochure at the counter.
Wow,"Great museum. Numerous old aircraft , tanks and vehicles. Along with a tone of information on the conflict. Very nicely done Memorial wall as well. Very Solemn "
Very Interesting,Especially enjoyed the section regarding the Korean War. I wish I had done a little research about other Wars as I didn't realize Korea has been involved with so many wars in the past.
Best part may be the planes outside,It's free inside and out. Nice tribute to the UN nations. Decent collection of artillery and other war gear.
Interesting,Take your time at this place. There is so much to see. Outside and in. It takes you through Korean war history for ancient to present. 
beautiful museum,I didn't look at pics or read reviews prior to going and was pleasantly surprised by the detailed history lesson that was presented. I spent many hours here. Thoroughly enjoyable if not sobering.
War Memorial,Great museum to learn about the war of Korea. Had outdoor and indoor exhibits to visit with planes and ships. Good place to go to learn more about what occurred during the war. 
A fascinating insight into the Korean War,"As history enthusiasts we visit a lot of museums and this one was well worth the trip. It is easily accessible from the Samgakji metro station.The museum is beautifully designed and set out, and the exhibitions are informative and thought provoking. All the signage boards are in English. I particularly enjoyed the large outdoor sculptures, monuments and the war vehicles area which includes aircraft, armoured vehicles and a warship, some of which you can go aboard. You could easily spend a couple of hours here. There is a cafe and a museum shop in the building. "
Best attraction in Seoul,"We spent a week in Seoul, and I would rate the War Memorial my favorite attraction. South Korea really went all out on this -- no expense was spared! I have been to other world-class war museums such as the War Museum in London and the Artillery Museum in St Petersburg, Russia -- but Seoul's War Memorial tops them all.Before one enters the main complex of the Memorial, one passes through an immense park packed with military hardware and statues.There are several floors within the museum -- which is free, by the way. There are several theaters that display either holograms or 3-D presentations. My favorite was a theater that was cooled down to about 2 degrees C with snow on the ground. The narrator of the 3-D presentation is a Korean war veteran who relates that one of the most difficult aspects of the mountainous warfare was the temperature factor -- and to reenforce this snow is blown into your face. It is clear that the Korean War is remembered to this day in South Korea with great vividity, and the museum emphasizes Korea's commitment to UN peace-keeping operations. The present-day tense situation with North Korea is refected in exhibitions within the museum, to emphasize that the horrors of the last war could manifest themselves again.The first floor of the museum boasts full-scale replicas of ancient Korean warships, and depictions of Korean's earlier war history in Asia."
Must see,Very education and entertaining. I learned a new thing or two. You can go in the vehicles and planes. Go a bit early because it gets crowded. 
Interesting monument,"The memorial is worth a visit if you have a couple of hours. The exhibits are interesting.There is a section on the armor used in the wor such as Russian tanks, a MIG 15, and other military weapons, There is a Cadillac Limousine gifted by President Eisenhower to the South Korean people.Free admiision. Clean rest room facilities and a small cafe are available."
Over crowded meuseum,Got to this war memorial as early as possible because it gets filled with crowds and children. I which there was also more control since many people were climbing statues with clear warning.Overall it was interesting to learn about the south korean perspective on korean war
A Must Do in Seoul !!,Its probably the best war memorial I have ever visited in any city or country. The eye for detail is exceptional with a huge collection of war memories including a World War II fighter jet ! Highly recommended and dont miss this place if you are in Seoul.
A day in the memorial,"I tought I would stay just a couple of hours here, but ended up been there for the whole day. There is a lot to see and to learn"
Really moving visit,"This is arguably one of the best war memorials in the world, there are memorials for every country, and service person who lost their lives during the Korean War. My favourite display was the 3D theatre showing the history of the Korean War which is told from the perspective of an old man, who’s statue sits in the front row. It’s haunting, particularly given how close they are again to the brink of war. "
Amazing!!!,War Memorial of Korea is very cool. My brother and I spend 2 hours taking pictures around of the memorial. The display shown inside the memorial is amazing. Alot of culture and history of war times if you are interested with the history of Korea.
site seeing,"this one of the attraction to see in Seoul, worth the visit, get yourself familiar with the metro so it will be easy for you to get around."
Good to get insights into the Korean history,The museum has no fee and has the whole history of Korea represented. It gives for an foreigner and good inside into the Korean history from the countries perspective.Plan minimum half day as it has a lot to see!
Moved my heart....,"This War Memorial is just amazing. We spent 4 hours here, taking in all the history of the terrible Korean War. Outside exhibits of military aircraft and tanks is very well done and the statue of the Brothers is just so heart wrenching it will have you gripped. This is such a well put together experience you will leave there certainly more clued up on a war that frankly, we knew very little about and the uk sent over 81,000 troops there!! "
Interesting museum,"This was the first place we visited when we arrived in Seoul as it was just a 10 minutes walk from where we were staying. Because we arrived late, we rushed through the exhibits but we were taken aback by the incredible history it documents. It should be specially interesting for children. The multimedia use is quite effective and at places you might need to pause. We came back from there wanting to learn more about the history of South and North conflict, and Japanese occupation."
Went just to have a look and nearly spent the entire day,"I found the whole Memorial to be absolutely incredible. It's huge too, think how much time you want to give to it. It's not just the Korean War but all the conflict that Korea has had throughout its history right up to the present. When I went through the international recognition (specifically Australian) section of the Korean War room I found myself getting quite emotional."
Nice place to visit,"I would recommend for those that are into warfares, this is the place to go. We enjoyed it and will take you a few hours to walk and learnt about the history of the Korean War and the wars before. We thoroughly enjoyed it but like I said, only for those into army, warfares, soldiers etc. If not, it will be a boring visit."
Wonderfully curated museum,"This is a huge museum that goes through Korea’s military history from the Middle Ages until modern times. Outside there is a large area to check out airplanes, tanks, helicopters, and even a ship. "
Interesting afternoon,"I spent an afternoon wandering around between the tanks, planes and boats outside and through the muesum its self. They had alot of interesting things. I would however recommend going with a guide."
Nice morning out!,"Don’t need too long there but try get an english speaking guide. They will take a group through the museum. They have some really cool things from the war scattered around the museum. Outside they have Korean and US planes. Some real, some replicas (I believe). Don’t need too much longer than 3-4 hours so it’s a good half day"
"Well done, much larger exhibit than what I expected.","It was nice to see this exhibit and I enjoyed the outdoor display of so many vintage plans, tanks, and vessels. You will need at least a couple to three hours to walk through the exhibit, although you could spend longer if you read everything they have to offer. "
Very educational,"You can learn a lot about Korea especially how the country went through its rough time with so many wars and battles. If you're interested in history or war history go check it out. I don't think the ticket was even expensive. Pick a good weather though it contains outside stuff to see as well (airplanes, tanks etc)."
History and beyond.,"The War Memorial Of Korea was amazing. We learnt a great deal by navigating the many floors that boasted with tons of history. Each step gave ample information about the wars that South Korea endured with its neighbors, especially the war with Japan, China and North Korea. This visit made me realize the great success that South Korea has achieved in this small window of time. The wars have made it stronger, better and very successful. I couldn't get enough. Just Wonderful. Go Korea! "
Amazing place! ,"We assumed that this museum would mostly be about the Korean War, but we were wrong. Not only did it have a ton of stuff on that war, but so much more. For example they had what I think was one of the best and most educating sections from the Vietnam War. I was actually very surprised at how many different wars that S Korea has helped allied forces through the years. I could go on and on about this museum, just trust me it is worth it!The museum is free, but please make a donation before you leave. "
So Much History,"Give yourself plenty of time at this memorial. It takes a good hour or more outside to view all the tanks, planes, boats and missile launchers as well as the statues. Inside there are 3 floors of history all very well organized into groups. Loved learning more about a war I was unfamiliar with."
Great Overview of the Korean War ,This memorial is definitely worth a visit. A great display including interactive and old film footage!
"Commemoration, museum or propaganda?","The Korean War Memorial is a large, imposing building near Samgakji metro station in an otherwise nondescript neighbourhood. Its size is a testament to the centrality of the Korean war to the recent history and identity of the Republic of Korea and its troubled relationship to North Korea. It is part shrine (listing the names of the hundreds of thousands of South Korean and UN/allied service-people who died in the war), part museum (giving detailed accounts of the war) and part a propaganda organ, shouting the South's version of the conflict. Despite the importance of its subject, it is far too detailed, even for a visitor - a military historian - who knows a bit about the war. I saw two young Australian women who were enduring a detailed guided tour, who plainly did not really want the detail they were being given. A lot of the presentations deal with aspects of military operations, of course, and the audio-visual programs are often hard to understand. The display outside the museum of military hardware is frankly underwhelming, unless you really do want to see (and climb into) every variety of armoured personnel carrier that the South Korean army has ever used. The galleries generally lack the element of the 'personal stories' now obligatory in most military museums.The presentation of the place (which has been open for about 25 years) is looking a bit tired (eg the 'moat' has been drained) but it's certainly worth visiting, showing the impact of the Korean war on the country, while the long corridors of names on the 'roll of honour' (which doesn't include the couple of million civilians the war killed) is sobering."
Excellent and poignant memorial,"Only had the chance to visit briefly (when the main museum was closed), however there is plenty to see in the grounds. The memorial is very well laid out and is a fitting tribute to those who have their lives in the conflict. The memorial also has an equipment display that is well worth taking time to see. Would love to have gone back to see the interior - I would have been there for hours."
Amazing,So much to see here and a wonderful memorial to all the hero’s. We spent half a day here and could have spent so much more. It is always nice to take time to thank those who have given their lives so we may be free. 
State-of-the-art war museum,"I have been to a lot of war museums in different countries and I must say that the War Memorial of Korea is by far the most advanced and interactive among them all! The museum has 3D and 4D movie rooms, a shooting area and an outdoor display of actual artillery, jets, passenger planes and ships that were used during the war. To acknowledge the help South Korea received from other countries during the war, the museum featured the countries' complete military uniforms and displayed the number of foreign military personnel that were deployed during the war. Best part of it all is that admission is free! Note, however, that the museum is closed on Mondays."
Lovely Memorial,"Stumbled across this as it was right next to our hostel so took a wander through.Lovely statues and imagery, good explanations in English, really made you think. I think my dad would have loved the tanks/planes etc behind - anyone who's into that kind of thing (as well as Korean history ofc) should definitely take a look!"
Memorial visit ,"We visited the War Memorial of Korea on Monday and found it to be shut. Many museums are closed on Monday so check before you go. It is a 500m walk from Samgakji subway station. They have an impressive outside exhibit which we were able to view including tanks, planes and boats."
One visit not enough,"I am not a history or military buff but I have visited this museum two times and always enjoy it. Korean history is very long and filled with fascinating wars and military actions. This museum gives a wonderful overview of it all. Most of the signs are in English and there are English docents nearby to help you find your way around. It is very easy to navigate through the War Museum and it never feels crowded. It is vast so start early if you want to try to see it all. There is usually a revolving exhibit space that shows new exhibits that are not military based if you need a break from the wars. However, you must pay a nominal fee for these. In addition, there are all manner of military machines outside for viewing. Don't miss the gift shop; it has some very unique and fairly priced items. Several are open to exploration and the kids love that! This museum is very easy to get to using the 4 or 6 subway line at Samgakji Station or the 110 bus. You can walk to it from Iteawon as well."
Good museum covering history of Korean war,"Good museum to visit and see the full history and unfolding of the Korean War. All explanations also in English, including the 4D video screening"
Disappointed it was shut on Monday’s ,"We visited the War Memorial of Korea and found it to be shut on Monday’s. So disappointed. Many museums are shut on Monday, make sure you check before you go. They do have a large exhibit outside which was great to see. There were boats, planes and missives. "
So good we went twice!,"Fantastic museum for all those who love history. To learn more and also to remember those who gave their lives for the ongoing freedom of South Korea from communist infiltration.Well laid out, very respectful to those involved. You can spend hours here."
Great visit for the history buff,Large and fitting memorial to the Korean War. Well-presented displays. Most displays have English translations. Most videos are in Korean with no subtitles. Worth the time for the history buff.
Great place to learn war history.,"It is a huge facility, which will take one whole day or two, to throughly read and visit all the presentations. It is free of charge for entrance, to my surprise. It has a couple of free fun rides and even free movie night. Check the program before visit."
An impressive tribute to those that gave their lives for liberty,"Impressive location and building , some interesting exhibits and also a replica of the only UN cemtery ( original at Busan) which was moving.Cafes and toilets on site. Admission is free. Take a 100WON coin to use the free of charge lockers, rather that carting your back pack round.There is a real tangiable thankfullness from the Korean people for those that served and died from the UN "" for a land they had never been to, a people they had never met"" .Closest subway staion is Samgakji (line 4 or 6) exit 12. Come out of sign posted exit and keep walking , you come to it round the corner on your left."
"Outside is quite moving, inside too dense.","This was not a patch on the Korean war memorial in Washington DC. Museum was heavy going, and yet did very little to enlighten."
War memorial and museum,This place is also know as War memorial and museum as it contains all the relics and records related to the many wars fought in the country. It’s really nice that they have the flags placed around the entrance of all the various countries that helped them during the war.
historical,just like the historical background about the place. even though i understood less Korean words but i could feel the feeling of the freedom obtained
A MUST VISIT if visiting Seoul,"I'm a history buff, but to visit the War Memorial of Korea was a really cool experience. I do recommend that you go early, as soon as they open. They have lots of field trips for kids here and it gets busy and very loud. Very informative of the Korean and Allied war efforts on the Korean Peninsula during that time and beyond. Again, it's a must visit if you have a few hours to spare. But leave yourself plenty of time to check out all 3 floors of the museum to include all of the aircraft and war machinery outside."
Loads to see here,"We thought this place would have a few commemorative statues and exhibits. To our surprise, there were 8 separate memorial exhibits including inside the building. The nearest subway for this is Samgakji."
The War Memorial of Korea,"This museum is dedicated to the periods of wartime during Korea’s history. The entire 2nd floor showcases the Korean War. You will not experience a better understanding of the Korean War anywhere else than here. It takes you from the very beginnings of the war, step by step, up until Korea’s military standing in the world today. There are thousands of displays ranging from giant tanks and planes to one sheet declassified memos reporting on the status of troops. You need at least an hour and a half to fully absorb it all. I would recommend visiting this museum twice. Also, it is ridiculously kid friendly. There are special events held for children that they seemed to really enjoy."
Don't miss it,"Thoughtful and tasteful recognition of the sacrifices made my so many countries to help Korea. Feels a bit like propaganda at some points, but they've done an excellent job documenting all the countries that came together during the war. Don't miss it if you are in town!"
Perfect place to visit before taking the DMZ tour.,"Went to the Memorial the day before a scheduled DMZ tour. It is well organized and interesting. There is an outdoor exhibit of tanks, planes and boats used in the Korean war. Exhibits are marked in English and Korean. Spent several hours at this museum. "
So much history & excellent exhibits,This war museum in Seoul South Korea was such a great experience!I went there in December 2015 on a business trip & I was amazed at how well put together the exhibits are. A few of them are audio-visual & interactive. They do a great job at educating foreigners like myself & locals alike of this trying time in South Korean history.Definitely recommended to go there at least once
Must See,"This was a great place to learn more in-depth what the war was like and struggles of those who fought through it. Their are so many displays and exhibits written in English. This museum is one of the best war museums I’ve been to. They have a large selection of Korean War era military weapons. Also on display outside, there’s quite the variety of tanks and airplanes. You could easily spend a few hours there learning about the war. I would highly recommend seeing this museum."
good to know,good to visit such place to know more about histroy of Korea and see some memorial things. it takes 2 hours
REAL MUSEUM OF WAR,"Its a must visit place for each and every individual, it's an open museum. Its displayed real ships Helicopters, Fighter planes those have participated in the war. Most wonderful thing is that all names of the soldiers who sacrifice their lives in the war are written on the wall. well maintained garden with all countries flags are and another attraction."
Quiet reflection,"Must see place in Seoul, it was a very heart warming experience to see it, very well done and staff there were very nice and helpful"
Great miseu,Amazing Museum you can go back several times and still find it fulfilling. It is very informative and the exhibits were fantastic.The history of the war was well communicated in English as well
Fantastic museum - an absolute must in Seoul,"I’ve been to many war museums and I have to say that the War Memorial of Korea is the best. Lots of statues/monuments and army vehicles outside including a very interesting area for Korean children about surviving a chemical, nuclear or biological attack. It was under the monument with the statues around it and I don’t think we were supposed to go in as the staff looked slightly shocked to see us. Of course it has its fair share of propaganda but it charts the history of Korea from the beginning to present day. There’s not much on the current North/South Korea issues. Most of the displays have an English translation and the videos could be accessed in English by pressing a button. No audio guides and the QR information code didn’t seem to be working. I went expecting to spend about an hour but ended up staying for 3.5 hours!! "
Best museum,This is my third visits and reviews. This museum is amazing. I just came back from a week visit in D.C and went so many museums there and other museums all over the world but this is one of the best museum in the world. I can`t believe it`s free. You may wanna go there by yourself or with somebody who is really interested in history because you can easily spend 3-4 hours here. You learn so much not just about war but history and people who were affected. This museum is not about korean military but for everybody who sacrificed and affected. I highly recommend to take KTX and go to Busan after this because they have UN cemetary and this museum will make you appreciate and can`t help getting emotional after learning what happned. Make sure to eat before you go because there are not many places to eat around and their cafeteria is not the best.
Great museum ,So much history it was a bit overwhelming. Much more to it than just the Korean War. We ended up there about two hours before closing and it wasn’t enough time. 
Good place to know more about korean war,This is a good place to find out more about the korean war and the history behind it. It was a nice place to be for a few hrs to hide away from the hot sun. 
Not very interesting,"I didnt find this place very interesting, compared to other similar places that I have visited in the past."
Excellent History Museum,I didn’t know much about the history of Korea and this museum allowed to understand more about what the country and people have been through. Excellent artifacts and displays. People were very polite. I recommend this museum! You will learn a lot in a matter of 1 hour
A must while in Korea.,"This is a must go while in Korea in order to get to know better the details of the Korean war. It is not a sophisticated museum, but is definitely informative."
Great Stop,This is one of the stops on the hop on hop off bus. My first time coming to Korea I did stop off here as my last stop for the day. I didn't go in the actual building but I walked around outside as there is a lot to see outside the museum from lots of memorial statues to various types of military planes that were used during this time. I got a lot of photos and enjoyed myself. Would definitely recommend as an attraction to visit during your stay if you like history.
"Nice military museum, free entrance",Nice to see near hisrtory. Outside are equipments and full story of Korean War. Other histori is quite limited. Recommed
With friend,Went with friend to this museum. The museum is so big and informative. I love how they keep tracking al their heroes. 
A MUST Place To Visit Even If You Are Not A Soldier,"This War Memorial evoked feelings I never thought I had about wars. I have never been through one and with this visit, it was an eye opener. My respect to veterans, soldiers around the world. I salute you."
History unfold and future learning,"There is a very special and honoring feeling when you go to this museum.Very thankful for everyone's sacrifices and lives for peace.Great format.Clean.Friendly staff.Good collection.Well thought displays.Organized.Great learning.Thank you for everyone who made it possible for us to learn and be thankful of your sacrifices, help, courage ."
Free and Enriching Visit,"The War Memorial of Korea, to me, is a must visit. The outdoor area sets itself on a different level when compared to other war memorial due to the fact that they had displayed the different transports or war machine that was used in the past. In the inside, there are simply a lot of exhibition that talks about the history of the wars that Korea was involved in. However, do take note, that majority of the still exhibits are in Korean though there are some that are in English."
very nice,"it was very huge and had lots of history, loved each section as it gave details on different part of history. Outdoor planes, helicopter, tanks, armored vehicle's and replica of navy ship were displaced. my children loved each bit of it."
Not to be missed,"The War Memorial includes a museum, military hardware outside and several monuments to the fallen. I don't visit too many museums but found this extremely interesting as i learnt all about the Korean War. The museum is free to enter and at certain times of the day there are free tours in English and other languages. Outside is a wonderful display of tanks, planes, artillery and even a naval vessel. At the front of the museum there are several monuments commemorating the fallen. Inside there are free lockers to store bags."
very somber,I learned more about the war than I had known. It is a very interesting museum. I would like to spend more time to see everything.
HUGE!,"This place is huge! I loved the huge, moving statues outside. We couldn't even cover a quarter of the place!"
A Must See,"This museum is beautifully presented and a guided tour is a must. The guide will give a detailed description of South Koreas invasion by the north and its visually stunning and thought provoking. There is a large area outside full of tanks, airplanes, a ship , helicopters and missiles that you can get up close to. No entry fee and a very detailed FREE book awaits you as you arrive. Incredibly impressed with this museum and it has lots of areas centred around youngsters as well. Great for all ages"
Mesmerizing depiction of history.,"I've been to the War Memorial of Korea several times. Each time I learn something new. It's a great museum and has very cool exhibits that make it easy to understand the history. I especially like the exhibits on the Korean War. If you visit, I recommend doing the 4D theater experience of the Battle for Incheon. It was fun (and free). Actually, the whole museum is free, but they do accept donations. They also run tours in multiple languages."
So much to see,We didn't even go inside as it wasn't open that but still spent an hour looking at the memorials in the gardens. Very poignant. 
A must visit museum in Seoul,My 1st time experience going to a war museum indeed it’s a must visit place in Seoul. Pretty cool place wit lots of war machines on display.
A must see in Seoul,"Many visitors from outside of Korea have limited familiarity with the events surrounding the Korean Conflict. This memorial and the museum grounds provide an excellent overview of the sometimes violent history of the Korean Peninsula and specifically the war between the ROK and the DPRK. Like other modern museums, the galleries are organized in a linear fashion, enabling visitors to understand the events leading up to the war as well as critical moments in the conflict. It focuses on both military and civilian experiences and does a very compelling job of narrating the history."
Excellent Memorial and Museum,"This is not just a memorial to the Korean War but it also has displays from conflicts on the Korean peninsula from ancient time to present time. It provided a very good history of Korea. There were also plenty of military hardware on display on the outside of the building. Admission is free. This place was much better than I had expected. A hat and sunscreen are highly recommended if walking around the outside displays since there isn’t much shade.Be sure to pick up the free War Memorial of Korea pamphlet at the entrance which has a map and description of the displays. The displays are well-organized with descriptions in both Korean and English. There are three floors. There is a cafe, gift shop, and toilets on site."
Love the outdoor display - have been going there since a kid,"A massive war memorial and a great place to take a pictures of the automobiles and planes on display outside. The museum is clean and intuitive and provides lots of information about wars in Korea. It will take a good 3 hours to check out the place. I don't mind going there for 5 hours or so. There is a restaurant that provides food there and so don't worry about being hungry. If you do want to go outside and pop back in, that is possible. Although, it can be a long walk until Samgakji Station, where you will find Korean restaurants for food. I have made it to 155 countries. I have an extensive blog at pinchetravels.com, if you want to read more about my travels."
"A massive, treasure trove of historical information! A must see for everyone!","I went here the first time with my family about one year and a half ago. We loved it! We also saw a demonstration of sorts. It was fantastic! It's like the changing of the guards in Gongbukgyeon palace only with a huge amount of imperial guards with their traditional warrior uniforms and their flags! It was amazing! I thought to myself, I will come back here again in the future. Fast forward to now, I went to visit with my parents this time. We walked the museums and took photos of all the exhibits. And more awesome, they are FREE to see! How cool is that! We didn't see any performances but just to walk around the whole place was a great experience. The Koreans just take pride in their history and they want to share it with the world! We truly appreciate their history and hospitality. We would love to come back again in the future."
Excellent memorial on Korean War and more,"The main attraction is definitely Korean War memorial and they did a great job. There are lots of valuable documents, items, but I think what they did most well is the interactive theaters and screens. They are not too long (around 5 minutes) but each of them give you a taste of a particular battle or important event. The museum are divided into stages within the Korean War - the early stage of Invasion by North Korea and US assisted counter-attack. The second stage of Chinese Army invasion and finally the last stage that led to armistices. Also numerous tanks, planes, and warship on the side of the museum and a children's museum (not sure why) attached to the War Memorial Museum for your kids' enjoyment.Overall a must visit and prepare to spend a good part of the day here."
Very Nice Garden and War Vehicle for Photos,"I visit this place only exploring the outside of building. It is a very nice park and we can see a lot of war vehicle such as war ship, war airplane, etc."
Great tribute...,A wonderful tribute to those that sacrificed for the freedom of South Korea. Must see for anyone visiting Seoul!
Large outdoor display of airplanes,My boys who are history buffs loved it. Closes at 6pm but outdoor area where the planes are parked are open all the time. There is a warship replica docked outside too which was pretty interesting.Now I finally know why the North and South were at war!Recommended! And free!!
"Amazing, and a must see","What an impressive place this is. As an American, I feel so ignorant on the Korean war. I learned a lot here, and it was very interesting to see. You have to visit this place."
Reverent,Great memorial a must see. So many little details about the memorial that you have to ask the attendant. So many things have significance like the number of soldiers the echted faces on the wall. Go and be respectful.
Amazing history,"Spent a good few hours here, there is so much to see and so many pictures to take. Absolutely amazing, the workers there are so friendly, gave me a couple of leaflets to explain the history. It really does touch you. So if your interested in history I totally recommend this place. It’s just beautiful. "
So many things to see from very close!,"If you like airplanes, canon, tank, etc. It’s a really nice place to visit! It’s free and there are a lot of machines that you can see or even touch!"
Very nice memorial,"I am not a huge history buff, but this memorial/museum is extremely well done and informative. The memorial statues are well done, the old tanks and planes interesting to see, and the museum gave me a concise overview of the Korean war and history. You can only shop and eat so much in Seoul. Take an hour or two and stop by this memorial, you won't regret it! Bonus, it's free!"
What a great experience ,"Another place to give you a complete review about Korean Hystory.Don't forget to pick a war chronicles book at the entrance, it is fee.Lots of pavilions with several war itmes ... places ... cars ... And of course tons of Korean History details easy to go thru."
Must-see when visiting Seoul,A sobering look at the geopolitics of the Korean peninsula. Ignore some of the South Korean propaganda and you'll get a great perspective of what makes Korea tick. Walk through all the floors to discover fascinating history of Korea. I would suggest going to this place first; You'll see Seoul in quite a different light. 
Nice place,Sombre and wonderfully curated. I learned about the history of war on the peninsula and the events of the Korean War. The outside a with the tanks planes and such was really neat too. 
What are they teaching the children?,"It's a weird scene -a lot of one-sided displays, some really cool military hardware, juxtaposed against mobs of schoolchildren all over the place. Not really schoolchildren -we're talking barely kindergartners if that... oddly posing with cartoon characters right next to massive bombers and such.Inside, there was a memorial service for a hero of the Korean War killed in 1953, complete with wreaths, speakers and many modern-day military officers sitting and standing in attention in full regalia. Nearby, a group of toddlers posed by a picture of an island that Korea currently disputes with Japan. I don't speak Korean, but the teacher was prodding them to raise their little fists in the air and shout something triumphal-sounding, so they could all take a group photo presumably proclaiming their solidarity with Korea's claim to the island. It's a little scary... I'm not used to seeing preschool children being actively indoctrinated quite so overtly at quite such a tender age, even in countries where you'd think that kind of stuff goes on. The museum is free, it's huge, there's a lot to see... captivating propaganda for sure. But propaganda nonetheless."
Educatiobal,Gives an outsider a better understanding of why North Korea exists and how american culture has influenced South Korea. Must visit 
English tour,"This museum is very well done and maintained. Tours in other languages including English are free 2x a day. The tour is very nice. A retired ROK colonel gave us the tour. Tour runs 90 minutes. Great displays inside and out for kids. Retired planes, tanks, parachutes you name it!"
Sight seeing,"While on business, I went aight seeing and the war memorial of Korea was a must see and would definitely go visit again. Was a little upset that the shops closed an hour prior to the museum but would factor that into the next visit."
Touching and educational,"Having been stationed on Okinawa for over four years, I'm very familiar with the war in the pacific but did not know much about the Korean War. This again is another free museum that you need to take your time with as there is a lot to take in. There were even free books highlighting events of the war chronologically. I feel so much better educated after having visited the War Memorial. I'm inspired to re-watch episodes of MASH as I have a reference now."
Enjoyable,Enjoyed the War Memorial. Gave more insight on the war and got to see artifacts and listen to stories. Would recommend while in Seoul. You also don't need a tour guide to go and enjoy. 
So much information. So much to learn.,"I knew very little about the history of Korea before visiting this museum. But after a few hours walking around the exhibits, I left with a good understanding the how the country got to where it is and where it fits in historically with it's neighbors (Japan, China, Russia, etc.). It not only explains the Korean War but also several dynasties of rule, war and development. Definitely worth a few hour visit."
Detailed and intresting,"Great deal of work and details have been put into creating/organizing and managing the place. Awesome pieces and collection in the exibition, the outdoor collection if old aircrfats, tanks and flank guns and other military equipments from the korean war is a delight to see.And its Free Free Free"
Must-go place,"I got myself to learn tons of new things here about history of Korea , so tremendous and sacred site "
Impressive," I didn't know that much about the Korean war (except having watched every episode of MASH), for instance I hadn't realised that just over a thousand British servicemen were lost that's less than the Northern Ireland troubles and that over 30 thousand US servicemen were killed. It was good to see that all countries that supplied servicemen and women were represented with a memorial and flag and a short description of their commitments. I did enjoy the military equipment graveyard, even the wife didn't complain.  My interest was piqued about the previous Japanese invasions of Korea having seen the displays of the turtle ships. I've now read several articles about these invasions. It's well worth visiting the memorial, if nothing else than paying your respects for our fallen countryman."
Don’t be a loser go check this joint out.,Hey! Don’t be a loser. Go to the memorial. It has a totally sweetsauce outside section with planes and tanks that you can get into and take photos. Tons of super cute kids running around doing cute stuff. Cool boat that you can climb around on. The entrance to the inside has massive walls of all the names of fallen soldiers. Tried to find people with my last name. Couldn’t. Which was a bummer but also good. If you walk the inside direction backwards not only do you get a lot of “what a idiot looks” but also it feels like you are traveling back in time. You can only bar hop and eat food so many hours in a day and with that 2 hour break come here.A
Somber history lesson of Korea's tribulations ,"One of the initial rooms resembles a starry night, with a pensive in the middle. I found it moving, and it set the tone for the rest of the visit. Of course, the museum captures the spirit of the combined actions taken to keep the Republic Of Korea free in the face of tyrants during the 1950's, but the older wars are equally well represented."
Great Museum,One of the best museums that I have visited and it is free! My kids loved it especially the 3d/4d rides. The videos screened are also very good and provide a good snapshot of the history during the period. Must visit attraction if you are in Seoul
Unlike Any Other Monument,"We almost skipped this, thinking we had all been to DC and seen a million war memorials. This one is soooo different! I have never been to a more hopeful and humble memorial, giving credit and thanks to all the other nations that came to their aid. I don’t want to give any spoilers, but this memorial has an affect on us unlike any other I’ve been to."
Almost as good as Canberra.,"A really interesting, well set out and informative place. Not only full history of the Korean War but lots on the feudal battles of the distant past. Many exhibits of ordinance Very detailed information throughout for English speakers.The only war museum that comes anywhere near the one in Canberra. Do not expect a quick visit there is so much to see. And it's free!"
"A terrific, balanced view of a terrible war","The thoughtful retelling of the years 1950-1953 and the immense sacrifice and suffering is done very well here. It is a quick, thorough way to orient yourself to the Korean War and its enduring legacy."
Seoul Must-Do ,"A huge war museum with detailed information in English and Korean about South-Korea's war-filled past. It's free entry and you can see original tanks, planes and boats and 4D screenings. "
Historical memorial place,"Truly an awesome place to learn about the history of Korean War and showing honour to the people who had defended and sacrifice for their country. There are also exhibits of planes, tanks, warship and others at open area of the building. Best part of all, it's free. "
"Huge museum in military history, hardware galore","Much more than a war memorial (that part us actually the less interesting one) - huge museum with many exhibits not just on the Korean War but also all aspects of Korean military history throughout the ages. Lots of military hardware on display, and most exhibits have English captions (though often abbreviated). The Korean conflict was narrated from the South Korean perspective naturally, which can be interesting and rather different from the version seen in the literature on the war in tEnglish. Parts of the museum are a bit run down, and the displays are perhaps not always illuminating. Nonetheless really not to be missed for those with an interest in this field."
Poignant,"Quite an amazing place. Amazed to see such a selection of aeroplanes, tanks, rockets and even a boat. But then the memorial with all the names of those who died, together with the complete history of the war is very solemn. Well worth visiting."
Amazingly extensive collection,"We started off with the outside expositions. There are two exhibits and many planes, tanks, 2 small boats and 1 large you that you can board and visit the insides. We watched the 3D movie after visiting the boat (I'd recommend watching it beforehand). Turns out it's the exact boat from the battle in 2002. They've indicated all the bullet holes in red, which really makes reality sink in.Once you walk in inside, there is a stand with pamphlet and a museum map. It goes without saying to follow the arrows on the ground. We started off with the last exhibits by accident and were a bit confused, as the exhibitions are in chronological order.The preservation of all the artifacts are impeccable. The amount of donated artifacts is astounding. Everything is translated in English and is very detailed.War buff or not, this is a must. It is a wonderful exhibit. "
A must see!,Definitely a place to visit when in Seoul. The admission is free and the museum has something for everyone.Outside there are several airplanes and tanks to observe. Each one has a sign explaining what it was used for during the war. Near the ship there is a 3D movie representing what it was like to be in a fighter jet.Inside the museum the displays are very respectful and detailed. There are several texts to read and short movies to watch. It explains very well the war and outcome of Korea. It is possible to spend an hour as it is possible to spend all day at this location. 
Good history and good collection,this is good for History buff. its has a lot material to see and understand the history and ancient Korea. 
Respectful,"This was not like so many other war musems in Asia.It was an historical trip, so respectful to those who gave their lives.No gory photos etc. or propoganda.Sad statute of 2 brothers, opposite sides, embracing on battlefield.Also wall plaks with names, so many. A class place."
Must visit,"Impressive Museum with extensive memorial.Names of all the fallen soldiers and their country of origin listed.Info in English, free entrance.You could spend a few hours, there is also a cafe."
A must visit in Seoul.,"You could easily spend an entire day in this museum and still not see everything. There were renovations being made to the pavers in front of the main entrance when I visited, so I sort of came in on the side. That gave me an opportunity to view more of the monuments outside, including the MacArthur Tree, which I had no idea even existed. The museum spans all of Korean history, not just the recent conflict. It is well worth the time to take a leisurely tour of the exhibits if at all possible. Just the war machinery outside could be a morning or afternoon.I recommend spending the 1000 won to feed the fish. It's a peaceful way to end the visit."
Surprisingly interesting,I am no so fan of museum since its hard to understand but this place it is worthy to see it! Inside all the story it's explained about the Korean war and if you don't have time you have outside all the planes and tanks from the war. Also the memorial itself is stunning!!! 
Impressive ,"It is really impressive,especially for nationalists and military people.First of all its free.They have the arms ,thanks and planes of both sides,that includes russian,chinese and american arms.Koreans are equal to all countries that shed blood for south! As an example,us lost of man,Turkey lost 894 man and luxemburg lost 1 man .But the section in museum is same and equal for all."
Went for 1hr and stayed 4,It put the history of Korea in context for me starting from prehistoric times to current. It made me realise that invasions and wars not only shaped Korea but the whole world.I found it extremely interesting both inside and the external displays of military machinery.Beautifully presented. There are lots of video screens and (very short ) movie rooms. For families it would be a great day on very hot or raining days. Kids would love it --without realising the tragedy of it all . The station is only abouit 200m away. There is a basic café and a souvenir shop . There is no charge to visit.
Superb museum. Attention to detail and well with full information for the English reader.,"* Spent most of the day there* Outside area with tanks, planes and rockets* Very comprehensive history of the Korean war, plus one floor dedicated to the earlier history, including Japanese occupation* Impressive building* 4D cinema show* Nice grounds with water and gardens* Free entry, and also free book on the topic* Also a kids museum (although did not look round this), and they had a kids play area and cafe etc* In short, one of the best museums in the world that we have visited"
History Korea,Only the view on this musea is allready imposant.The expositions are respectfull to the history and give you A lot of information about the korean war.The lost of soliders and also the UN soldiers is many.You will vind all the namens of the Dutch lostI recomended to visit this museum.The fee is free
Impressive,"Very detailed, interesting and interactive museum on the Korean War. While it is sometimes a bit biased in its presentation of the Korean War and aftermath it's much less the case than expected. A must do in Seoul!"
Best free day out in Seoul,Visit the war museum in the afternoon it was the best war memorial museum I have seen in the world. Highly recommended 
Dioramas?,"Any war memorial or museum should bring home to people the horror and terror of war. This one tries to do that by having wax figures posed in various dioramas.This does it a disservice - it becomes entertainment, on a level with war movies where we know the heroes will come out alive. There is enough archival materials to present instead of these dolls."
The B52 in real life is shocking,"As a Vietnamese, being able to witness the B52 with my own eyes is something very special. I took my sister here and we were in shock the whole time. Every tanks, airplane and ships are in excellent condition. A very good place for children to learn about history as well! "
A Museum for Peace,"A very poignant and somber experience will hit anyone who enters this building as Korea tell their story about the wars that have inflicted the country including Japanese colonisation and the Korea War which inevitably led to the spitting of the country into North and South Korea and the country's that came to South Korea's side in their time of need. The museum is very big and will probably take most people 3 to 4 hours to get round entirely but there are some not worthy exhibitions including the donated articles and relics and the Korea War segment and all the vehicles outside. The museum is free , there is free Wi-Fi and there is a cafe for anyone who can't stand a 3 hour museum visit."
Definitely worth going,"They start with some general background, and afterwards continue with war rooms each logically divided into time zones. They specify and repeat information a lot but its good as it helps understanding. They added some audio-visual rooms which are a great touch"
Great exhibits,"If you’re a history enthusiast, there’s so much to see and learn from the museum. If you have time and you’d wish to dive deeper into the history of Korea, make sure you watch those videos and some exhibits were interestingly displayed."
Great for all ages ,"This place is truly beautiful. First off, it’s FREE. What a great place to go for no money at all. It’s educational, and coming from someone who HATES war museums and such, this was actually really interesting. The art was incredible in the memorials. Absolutely stunning. And the museum portion was so interesting and interactive. You get to go onto a real ship that was once shot up. It’s really interesting.Great for all ages, but be wary of the many stairs if you have any elderly with you."
Awesome Tanks Display and Museum,"Real tanks and rockets display outside are the highlight for me. But the Museum itself is very informative, clean and organized - a lot of things to see like the turtle boat of Admiral Yi. Very child friendly. We spent 4-5 hours there. Highly recommended. "
South korean perspective ,It's an interesting place to spend a couple of hours. I like how they emphasize the costs of the war to the ordinary families. A good educational experience.
A powerful and respectful reminder,"Each time I return to Korea, this is a must see on my list. This year for the first time I took my wifre. This is not a day to rush. Take ypur time, look and read. The displays inside and out ate second to none and the constant upgrades with technology have made this a must see. Be prepared to shed a tear when you sit in one of the many viewing/video rooms and the remembrance hall and chamber. The new 3 and 4 D interactive shows bring the story of a nation besieged and the world that stood by it. The Korean people are so grateful and will never forget the contributions of all other nations and this is made very clear in their hommage to all that stepped in to help them. Returned Servicemen and women and veterans, if you have PTSD then the reality of some of the displaus and shows may cause you to trigger. Every time I see something new and have left without a tear in my eyes. The raw honesty of this facility even left my wife in tears. Please leave a couple of thousand Won in one of the donation boxes. This is a free admission and it really helps to provide an amazing experience. P.S. if you are taking a school group, please ask the kids to show respect, no yelling, swearing and running around. This is a memorial to thousands who will never go home and a somber reminder of the great waste and distruction of armed conflict."
5 star Museum,"Never thought to stop at this war museum, just because of the jet fighter outside of the museum that you can see when bus passing by that place. I just walk alone in this area start with the all the warrior names. Than start to explore all the hall and this museum is awesome, war history, skeleton of Sargent, lighting for real war situation, 4D 7 minute movie, 3D 7 minute movie in the war ship, all the jet and carrier aeroplane, tanker, launcher and war ship too.. This museum is amazing and they really appropriate their lost soldier and warrior. highly recommend people to come over here and they also give book korean war 1129 for free."
Wonderful Museum,"This museum was very informative and being an American whose grandfather fought in the war, it was very touching. The Korean people are very thankful to the UN for fighting alongside them. I learned a lot about the war, as did my boyfriend who is a history buff."
"Great info. Statues, memorials, planes.","Most poignant was the statute of 2 brothers embracing on the field of battle, one fighting for the North and one for the South, standing on a dome with a crack in it representing the division of the Koreas. A number of airplane including a B52 bomber as well as a Korean made observation airplane the type of which hadn’t been seen in decades until it was discovered in a Korean high school and restored. Lots of information about the War. Only a couple blocks from 2 Metro stops - we took the #4 line."
A must do!,"This place is amazing and FREE! They even offer a free book on the Korean war. You can donate upon exiting, which I did.Outside, the different monuments are accessible to all and in the building itself there are different permanent exhibitions all wotrh a visit. I only spent about 2 hours there but youc an certainly spend more time. It's a great place to try to understand why there are two Koreas today..."
Must see if in Seoul,"You'll feel a range of emotions going through this place. The dome with the crack down the middle, two soldiers on top embracing, that is something that will hit you hard.The planes, tanks, guns, etc are great for the kids.The part that hit me the hardest was they have the names of all the soldiers that died during the war. And not just the Korean soldiers, they had the names of each foreign soldier that died also. They were divided by country, and the USA was divided into states. Gives you a better idea of the scale of the war when you have to walk by the names of everyone that died. A good history tour inside the memorial as well, although a bit long."
Freedom is not free,The history starts from the ancient age to till the 1953. Anyone can live the history in this place. Inside the museum don't miss the tear drop and outside the peace and war statue. 
Very interesting,"This was one of the stops on our bus tour and it looked nice on the pictures, so we decided to give it a try. It is really informative and very well done. Good for kids too, as there are many things to see for them (planes, boats etc.). We didn't go into the museum, just walked around outside. Very impressed, totally worth a visit!"
fascinating and sad,"An amazing memorial giving an insight into the Korean war, free admission and a fascinating display of the history of the war and subsequent events. Don't miss this one..."
Superb museum,"Very nice museum. Free entry. Very big n interactive n gives a good perspective of the Korean war and world history. Really nicely maintained n surely worth around1.5hours. lots of army, aircraft vehicles etc in outside area. Inside, it had a lot of audio visual and historical documents, attracts regarding the Korean war. Totally worth it and popular with families, tourists and history seekers! "
Amazing,"I have been to several memorials throughout the world and this is one of the best. There is an outdoor museum displaying various tanks, guns, aircraft and a patrol boat. It even has a B-52 bomber on display. The staff are friendly and helpful and the exhibits are really well put together. I will go again for another look next time im in Seoul."
Very Impressive even if you don't think you will be into it,I visited this place because it had high reviews on Trip Advisor. I was not expecting too much of it but it was a great experience. I was just disappointed by the national Museum and this memorial saved my day. Totally worth the visit and plan 3 hours at least to go through it.
Very impressive,"I took the English tour at 14:00. I visited here before long time ago, so do not recall what I saw at that time. Couple of years ago, I felt too huge to visit so I visted only the outdoor exhibition. The tour takes alsmot 1 and half hour, the volunteer explain quite well about the details. it is also included 2 short clip, each of them 10, 15 min long. One of them, Jan 4 Heungnam port retreat, this clip runs in a cold room so need a jacket. I recommend this place if you are interested in Korean war and WWII."
easy to spend a full day here.,We thought it was going to be a quick trip but stayed all day. There are so many things to see and lots of english to read. The statues were fantastic and the whole day was well spent.
One of the Best War Memorials/Museums I've seen,"We recently visited Seoul for a week and has the opportunity to visit The War Memorial of Korea and I'm so glad we did. The the Memorial is as much a museum as it is a memorial. It is incredible collection of uniforms, equipment and weaponry used by the countries that were represented under the UN flag.during the Korean War. One of the best collections I've ever seen. And from a memorial perspective it is as moving as any I have seen short of the tomb of the unknown soldier at Arlington National Cemetery near DC. The War Memorial of Korea is very large. The outside displays have some very interesting sculptures, and include acres of military hardware. Some of a highlights of the outside display include a med size patrol boat, tanks and anti-aircraft guns and a B-52. Inside the building there are memorial rooms and room with equipment and uniform display from all of the UN countries that participated. It is quite impressive. It was very clear that Koreans are thankful for the support and sacrifices from all of the countries that helped them. You can spend hours at this place if you want to. Any time though is well spent. An it's free to the public. "
Great day out for kids,"It was a great day out for kids have a look at all the planes, tanks even an old battle ship. The place also has a children museum which has hourly tours you can take surprisingly it was free. The place is interactive and teaches a lot about korean history. "
Large and well curated museum,"We were really impressed with how interesting this museum was. The building itself was huge and was architecturally significant in itself. The memorial spanned over a few levels and was quite creative in how it presented its information. There were large scale replicas, video displays and outside there was a large collection of military vehicles. We spent a couple of hours here."
Most educational and impressively planned museum,"I am one who is normally not interested in museum tours. Since I was in a group who is interested I went along with them. Our English Guide, Mr Park ,who is a retired military colonel explained so passionately about Korean war history that I felt so enlightened and inspired and appreciated Korea in a different light beside it's a paradise for shopping and food. Thank you Mr Park for extending extra time and sharing so much with us."
Incredible,"The outer grounds of the War Memorial of Korea are impressive enough, with several larger-than-life statues/monuments, as well as an impressive collection of interactive planes, ships, and ground vehicles from the Korean War and beyond. The outer walls of the museum are lined with the names of all who died during the conflict, and the the interior of the Memorial is actually three floors stacked with an enormous amount of exhibits and information on not only the Korean War, but also the many conflicts Korea has been involved in in its long history."
Definitely worth a visit,"The war museum offers an excellent way to learn about Korea’s war history. It is well laid out, informative, thoughtful and multi-lingual. The grounds are also pretty impressive, with plenty of ex-service aircraft and tanks to walk amongst. "
Well worth a visit if interested,"I stopped by to use a few hours before I flew out, and I should of allocated more time. Covers the full history of war from Korea's beginnings until present time. Huge building, with plenty of interactive exhibits. There is a large number of items to see.If you are interested in history, then I suggest more than 4 hours for this memorial."
War buff must.,"So much to see - you really need at least a good half day to get around the exhibits and displays. History about the conflicts in the region range from ancient wars to current situations including the Korean involvement with peacekeeping forces. Very emotional, as the tributes to those who gave their lives are really well set out, touching and genuine. The addition of more recent information about the hope for reunification adds a modern touch to this very well set out and organised establishment. Good english coverage with appropriate materials available for foreigners. A must."
Where's a 6 ☆ when you want it,"Went expecting to be there for a couple of hoursFive hours later we had to leave as we had other things to seeAnd we only scratched the surfaceExpected to focus on the Korean War but this place is about so much more, from 'ancient history' to current conflicts and peacekeeping. And it is all so wonderfully doneEnough english to explain without being wordyGood clear logical route through, just follow the arrows on the floorOne of the best museums we have been to, anywhere in our 70+ countries so far"
Sculptures depicting the Korean War,The War Memorial of Korea had sculptures and artwork that were very moving and showed how the South Koreans feel about the war with the North and their hopes of reconciliation for a one Kore. The area also had some nice cherry blossom trees. Worth the visit.
A must for all War-buffs!,"Being a war buff, this was a really cool museum to visit. I loved the dioramas that were on display as it really gave you a feel of how it would have been during the Korean war. What a great tribute to the fallen too!Good on Seoul to have such a memorial - if I was a local, it would surely instill a sense a strong national pride in me!"
My Favorite Seoul Attraction,"Our visit lasted almost six hours. The first hour was spent outside, in extremely cold weather, looking at aircraft, tanks, missiles, bombs, trucks, helicopters, and even a war ship from the last 100 years. Very impressive outdoor memorials that are worth visiting as well. Once inside, a wide variety of displays from the beginning of civilization through all the wars is on display; way too numerous to even begin to describe. Excellent, HUGE building, first-class all the way. Korea is proud of their military, their history, and their patriotism."
Unexpectedly moving,"Definitely a must-visit for history buffs and people interested in diplomacy, intl relations and politics. Makes you appreciate international cooperation in resolving conflicts, and restoring peace. Come here also to honor the soldiers who died or went missing during the Korean war. The facility has stone columns with all the soldiers’ names written on them. Not just Koreans but from all other countries who helped through the UN. The museum inside is foreigner- friendly - with free tours in diff languages and interactive materials also in several languages. Free admission comes with a free English/Korean book on the Korean War which you get from the lobby of the facility. "
Very interesting,"As an history buff, going to Seoul without being to the war memorial is half the experience. The museum was well organized with great exhibits. The only down side was the fact that for some attractions, curtain hours are available. So you cant always explore every aspect of it."
Amazing inside and out!,"I have been to Korea so many times but this is the first time I've been here and I was really shocked that I have not visited before. The place was really amazing. The grounds is so big and the outside exhibit simply took my breath away. From the war planes, tanks and ammunition you can inspect up close to the beautiful manicured grounds it was pure eyegasm! the indoor exhibit is a story of its own. the way South Korea preserve and tell their history is really humbling and eye opening. It explain why they were able to rise above every tragedy."
This place gets better every year,This war museum gets better every time I visit it. I remember when it first opened over 20 years ago and it gets better every time I visit it. It's definitely a must-see location for Korea visitors.
"Fantatic museum, great outdoor exhibits","This museum is a must see when in Seoul, very interesting exhibits inside. The outside statues and displays are incredible. I loved looking at all the planes, tanks etc. I have no idea how they got a b-52 in downtown Seoul but it's very impressive."
humbling,amazing place with loads of things to see. the site itself is incredible and learned loads about the Korean war and other periods of the Korean historywould highly recommend a visit
A MUST!,"I never thought I would love this place! I wish I had more time to read and watch everything. I would definitely come back and spend a day here. I recommend everyone to come to this place if you have a chance. This place has a lot to offer and don't even know where to begin. Just come and explore this place. Not to mention, admission is FREE! "
Totally worth a visit,Both inside and outside a beautiful museum. Most information also provided in English. Planes and other military related vehicles outside. You'll be easily spending at least a whole afternoon here.
Large grounds,Several statues and many airplanes available for viewing. Even a large war boat which one can board and walk on deck.
Nice place ,Very nice place it was a very nice place to visit in Seoul. Lots of history and information. Interesting airplanes and guns left from 1950 and many more. Must see 
You can't miss!,"The memorial is the best place to go if you are interested in the history of Korean War - you can see airplanes, helicopters and even a warship (which can be visited inside); be prepared to spend the whole afternoon there. And it's free!"
Excellent depiction of WAR,"I must say I walked around that piece a couple of times, and walked back thinking I may have missed something. "
Great museum ,Very interesting museum located close to yongsan Went there on a Friday afternoon! Crowds were minimal. History covers a wide range of periods. Has a nice vehicle display outside as well as inside. 7 year old enjoyed it. Best part is the museum is free. So it’s nice if you want to go multiple times to take it all in. 
good,"interesting, a lot of things to see and learn about Korea's recent history. Many things to see from Korean perspectives"
Amazingly interesting and well organized,This is a MUST visit. The museum is amazingly rich with the war history of Korea with special emphasis on the Korean War.Try and have a guided tour as this will lead you through the most interesting stops in this museum. Later on you can go back and re-visit it.Entrance is free and so are the guided tours.We learned A LOT from it.
Understanding Korea,"The war memorial museum is huge and very moving. Maybe over 1000000 died and for no clear advantage on either side and no clear ending. The struggle of Koreans over 2000 years to have their own country, free and independent, is well highlighted ."
So much to see and learn about,"We stumbled upon this place because it is near our hotel. We now wonder why we did not visit this place on our previous trips to Seoul. It is not just a memorial. There was an open air exhibit of the armament that took part in the Korean War. There is also a military history museum, showing warfare on the Korean peninsular from ancient time to the Korean War. Highly recommended to all who are interested in history and warfare."
A good Historical Place to visit ,"It’s a good place to visit if you would like to know about the war history of Korea. A lot of planes, tanks and equipments used during war are displayed. "
Must Go!!! Great Museum,"This is a very educational museum. It is free of charge. You can also bring home a thick book about Korean War. The builiding is very nice, quite and peaceful. You learn a lot about the War. You may have hear about Korean War, but after the trip you will know all. If you like to read everything in detail, 1 day barely enough. For me, I will visit again because I still not able to go over the top floor....For the museum, there are no sign. When you exit the subway for museum, remember just go straight and follow the road. The museum is actually on your left hand side when you exit the station. However, you will not be able to see because of the surrounding building. (I actually got lost)."
"Impressive quality, effects and care about details. ","Make sure you have enough time to visit the three floors of the museum. It is arranges in a clever way to intrigue the visitors with original videos, sounds and memorabilia. And it is free admittance. Great job. "
A great place to learn about Korean history,The visit was free and we had the chance to learn a lot about the Korean history and the Korean war.Highly recommend it!
Interesting content and excellent quality!,"We joined the free tour led by a veteran who speaks impeccable English! He really knew things and every detail of war. I enjoyed his humorous and educating guide. And surprisingly, there was a parade in the middle of the tour so we ended the tour in the middle and watch it. The show was stunning and and dance and music performed by the soldiers were excellent. The exhibit inside also told a coherent and engaging story of Korean history. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
Free and excellent!,"The museum is full of world war display, ammunition, bombs, equipments, uniforms etc. There are details about how each military from different countries are outfitted, different roles they played. There is also a movie theater for you to watch and relax. Outside the museum, there are many military vehicles on display. Definitely one of the better museums I have been, recommended to all."
interesting statue and exhibit of history,very engaging and interesting museum where the history of korea explain. it helps me understand and appreciate korea culture a little more.i spent about 2-3 hours there
As a US citizen excellent,"I was born after the Korean so this was especially interesting. I really learned a lot and I love going to war museums in different countries especially to get a different perspective. The plane, chopper and tank display outside was amazing. I would really recommend to Americans to take the time to visit here."
Fantastic Museum and Memorial,"We caught the subway here from our hotel expecting to spend an hour. It was easily 3 hours, an excellent place to visit and learn the history of the Korean war. Some of the best displays we have seen and most have explanations in several languages ( if I remember correctly; Korean, English, Chinese & Japanese) Also if you are into military vehicles then you will appreciate the outdoor display. Well worth a visit."
A revisit. And a great one ,"Never get bored visiting this museum, the exterior ground is currently under renovation. Comparing to my last visit they've added a few machinery guns and displays on the North Korean army side. One could spend an easy 3-4 hours! And the best part is it's free. "
"Informative, engaging and interesting","Visited this museum as my husband is keen on looking at tanks. Was a bit hesitant at first, but tagged along anyway. To my surprise, it was very interesting! The exhibitions are multi-lingual so we could read and fully understand. There were a lot of interactive and immersive displays too. Best part - admission is free! :D "
Excellent Visit Place,A most recommended for the people interested in the history. The Place has so much to offer that you can spend a whole day watching old war-related things.
War Memorial Of Korea,"Great place to visually see the history of South Korea and countries involved during the war, and is free. The museum is large you could spend a few hours, would be great for anyone interested in history and I feel the young children would also like, the visual displays."
Incredibly moving memorial and museum,"Impressive. Quite a distance out the city, we were surprised at the size of the grounds the memorial/museum is. We were also surprised at the amount of security here and in Seoul in general but unbeknownst to us Donald Trump was in town.One of the best attractions in Korea, it was not difficult to spent hours here. I always visit war memorials and museums, humbled to be able to experience something of the wars from the perspective of others. ?We were here for around 5 hours in total, but could have stayed longer.We wandered around the outside memorials and and equipment before heading up the front steps where we were greeted by a gentleman welcoming visitors. He told us that it was a very special day and the reason for all the security was trump. He made us very welcome and gave us good information to get started.The museum is large and we really didn't do it justice. It was very sobering and moving. We also attended the Da Vinci Alive exhibition - The realm of a genius, which took up another couple of hours."
History and the Military,"This is a place that if you love history will take you all day to read, listen and take in. Children of all ages will love the vehicles, planes and other items outside. Go early and beat the crowds... it is easy to find by subway or taxi."
somber & humbling,this is another must see in s. korea... if you want to get a full spectrum view of the korean war from a slightly bias'd position please do not hesitate! its a beautiful representation and tribute to the lost and disgruntled veterans of one of our worst conflicts 
Extensive historical collection,"This is a large museum and you can easily spend a number of hours. If you don't allocate enough time you might be disappointed that you didn't get to see everything, both within the museum as well as the grounds. The displays are very captivating and is generally centered around the Korean War, but there are many elements of other historical conflicts on the Korean peninsula. This is worthy of at least a half-day visit."
"Fabulous Exhibit, well organized",At the time we were there they had a DaVinci temporary exhibit nearby. It was fascinating and we became very absorbed in the content. The statues are beautiful and capture the essence of the Korean war. Inside the museum is well organized and covers the entire history of wars in Korea. Many military artifacts. Great learning activity for teenagers.
Impressive.,One of he best! Definitely recommend if you are in Seoul. Free entrance and really full of history. Must do!
An unexpected great!,"This free musseum is great yo know the history of Korea. It has a lot of interactive areas such as various 4D cinemas and tons of vehicles, planes and weapons outside."
History and Military interests - go for it!,"I haven't been inside the museum, however, is free entrance. Outside exhibition represents a lot of militaries vehicles and airplanes! Impressive. You can even go inside some of them."
Really Well Done,"Lots of information. Lots of artifacts. Having only a general knowledge of the conflict in Korea when I went in, I felt like an expert when I came out. And the helicopters, planes and tanks...hard to believe that fit all that in central Seoul. Good place for adults and children alike."
Well worth a visit,"Really enjoyed outside and inside of this museum, and its free to enter so really worth a visit.Outside there are lots of planes, tanks and missiles displayed with some information (English and Korean) about each one. There is also a replica boat to climb on and take a look around.Inside there are a few different sections about Korea's war history. We spent some time looking around the sections about the Korean war of the 50's. Lots of information about how it started and how the UN got involved. It was a little repetative at times, with the occasional mistranslation into English, but was really interesting and enjoyable. There is a cafe inside with reasonably priced snacks and coffee. There is a restaurant and convenience store also on the site.... restaurant was reasonably priced and food was OK."
Well worth a visit,"Worth visiting, should be combined with the outdoor exhibition of airplanes and combat vehicles next to the museum (which includes things from a B-52 via a copy of a sunken ROK patrol boat to tanks) which is quite interesting as well. For the very interested, the war museum itself is huge and contains a lot (some parts of it are very detailed and technical, for example the extensive exhibition on various ammunitions and technical sensors) but other parts are more interesting for the layman, if you come from any of the many countries that participated in the UN coalition during the war you can go and find the part of exhibition showing your country’s contribution."
No.1 priority when you're in Seoul,"Definitelly a must-see place when you're in Seoul. Huge museum with lots of interesting sights, inside, as well outside of the museum."
Informative and engaging museum,A very well organised museum which fully emerges the visitor in Korea’s tortured war history. Highly recommended for all visitors to the city.
The best war museum I have ever visited,"I spent several hours here and did not come close to seeing everything before closing time. Upon arrival, you first see many memorials outside and then a huge display of military equipment on the grounds. The displays include a ship, boats, aircraft, tanks, artillery pieces, armored vehicles, and missiles spanning from the Korean War to the present day. Inside there are audio-visual displays, equipment and a wealth of other material, it can not all be seen n a single day."
Moving and informative.,"They have many great statues, monuments and military hardware outside but the main reason for going is to learn more about the Korean War. The building is large and the information comprehensive without being overwhelming. It succeeds in giving the details and facts, as well as the human and emotional side. The main thing I took away from it was understanding that as this war CAME to them, that any local over 70 in Seoul LIVED through this devastation. Sobering but important."
Excellent,"This Memorial (and museum) are incredibly done. Outdoors there are tons of old ships/planes/weapons with an explanation of each. There is a memorial wall to all those who died in the Korean war, listed by country and further by US State. Good history of Korea during different dynasties and how their armed services have evolved over time. Good coverage of other countries that helped during Korean War. Very well done. "
To cry out,I can barely read Korean but I got to read a letter from one of the soldiers and it's so heart breaking that I cried. Worth the visit. Nice to understand better Korean war. 
ok,"good general overview of Korean war. just be ready for long stay, it is really big place, expositions inside and outside."
Moving and memorable.,"The memorial outside was just as, if not more interesting than the museum inside and really highlights both the losses felt by Korea and their gratitude to nations that came to their aid during the Korean war. "
Important Visit to make ,"I have spent 3 hours there and I didn’t see everything, you can easily spend a long time there If you are interested by history.Definitely recommend the place and the English tour that will help you to understand and be more interactive than only reading."
A Very Educational Visit,I remember studying WWI and WWII in school but never recalled studying about the Korean War. It all helped to fill me in on why the Korean Peninsula is divided and why some of the relationships in Asia are a little stressed. 
Awesome! A must visit!,"This place was fantastic. They had loads of real vehicles and weapons in many previous wars on display that you can actually go right up to. There are tons of things to do inside as well dating back to the beginning of Korea all the way to present day. They have memorials to all the fallen soldiers from Korea and the UN that participated in a number of different wars. It's just a fantastic and beautiful place to visit. There are a few restaurants and cafe's to hit up while you're inside as well.It's a huge place and takes hours to see it all. Unfortunately, my visit was kind of on a time crunch and I didn't get to see everything, but I would love to go back sometime and visit again. If I could give more that 5/5 I would."
Definitely worth a visit,A comprehensive look into war history in Korea. Covers conflict from centuries back as well as the Korean War. Would return - a great learning experience. 
Great museum. Informative. Free,I learned so much about the Korean War that I did not know before. Museum was well organized and I could not believe it was free
Interesting museum,An interesting museum full of history. Plenty of things to see regarding Korea's history. Recommended.
Interesting ,"I found this museum very interesting an factual, there are tanks, planes, rockets, guns an even a boat you can look at.Inside museum it gives you detailed accounts of all the wars in koreas history, i peesonally found the korean war very interesting.There are also exhibits an stories throughout the years to read an look at.They also do guided tours, id definately reccomemd it."
History of the Korean War,"This is a free museum. You can see all the Korean War History. This museum has around8 exhibition rooms. Is closed on mondays. And the Subway line 4 or 6 will take ypu there. You can call ahead to reserve free English, Japanese and Chinese guides. Is you love museums and history you will like any museum im South Korea."
A must see in Seoul,"If you have only one day in Seoul go to this museum, if you have only one thing to do in Seoul lets it be visiting this museum, it's A MUST and visiting it will change how you see Korea and will add human values to you.If you are a citizen of one of the countries that helped Korea during its war you will feel proud of your country, you will feel more attached to Koreans and humans in general, and it will inspire you.This museum is great from the outside to inside, don't skip looking at great statues outside, they are pieces of art.The only issue I found is that the guy who volunteered to provide the English tour had a very very poor language, it was so hard to understand him."
lovely,definitely worth a visit for photos and to take in the charming environment. the war museum should be visited showcasing the Korean war and its aftermath.
Korean War Memorial and more,Learned so much more than I thought I knew. The appreciation they illustrate throughout the museum is truly incredible. The amount of suffering they went through was equally incredible. 
Worth the walk down from the station,A large and wide ranging war museum with exhibits ranging from prehistoric to the Korean War. The contemplative fountain is particularly calm. Certainly worth a visit.
Excellent place you can find the recent history of Korea!!!,The Korean War (1950-1953) changed the history of Korea and East Asia.You can find the full detail of the war. 16 countries came here to fight against the Communist attack. Its free entrance. Sure you will enjoy the museum.
Fantastic Museum,This is a great place to visit. Large museum with lots of interesting exhibits of wars over the years. Large outdoor area with many tanks and aircraft on display for you to look at and climb on. We spent all afternoon here. Free entry and easy to get to on the underground. Five minute walk from station.
Great place to wander at your own pace,This is a great way to spend some quiet time to reflect but also kids will love to explore the displays. 
A MUST VISIT,"One of the best memorials, if not the best, I've visited. I loved the 4D viewings available, opening at the start of each hour. Limited seats are available so we had to wait but it was worth it. There is also a huge area where aircrafts, tanks, missiles, boats, and other military hardware are displayed outside the main building. I learned a lot about the Koreans and how they suffered in war, thanks to this memorial. Also very accessible to visit. We took the subway from Myeondong and a few minutes walk from the subway station. I plan to go back."
Lots of history ,A very informative museum. The outside display of tanks and planes was very interesting and gave a good perspective. Inside (all free) was history of war throughout Korean history (which was very informative). The 2nd and 3rd floor was dedicated to the recent Korean conflict (1950-1953) and had informative and interesting displays and videos. We spent 2 hours there and did not see everything. A must for Americans with a connection to the Korean was (my father fought). Keep in mind it is focused on the impact of the war on the Korean people (displays in Korean and English). 
Great museum,"If the subject matter is something you're interested in, there's enough to keep you here for hours. Fascinating exhibits both indoors and outdoors. Statuary in the photo is very striking in real life."
Cool...if you have the time.,"Normal, pretty much what you'd expect, but then the anti-Trump gang came by. The anti-America came up as a surprise, but didn't deter to the tour... Mostly, those in the tour (Can, Swe, Aus, Nze, Mex) all LOVED the tour and America. I'd go right back to again learn even more...well worth the time, excellent time spent by my family of seven!"
Peace not war,there are some materials that are really shocking and the history may be forgotten but we need to remember peace.
"emotional, educational, enlightening","I spent almost 4 hours there, immersing myself in the sad history between the two Koreas. There is a comprehensive collection of exhibits and displays, which are very informative and diverse. It definitely worths a visit. And it was a highlight of my trip!"
"Exceeded all expectations, makes one strangely emotional","Every visitor to Korea should visit this place. Being the typical Korean visitor, blinded by the fashion, food and k-beauty shopping, visiting this War Memorial really opened my eyes to what South Korea is today. There are breathtaking exhibits of tanks, war planes, weapons, stunning statues, that left me in real awe of how far the Koreans have come to live the lives they have now. It is definitely beyond the average history museum. It has left me feeling strangely emotional and enlightened. Parents, this is one for the kids too. They'll love the tanks!"
Unexpected excellence,Visited with my 15 year old son who speaks English better than Korean. Richly equipped with historical artifacts and detailed descriptions. Finely supplied with foreigh language explanations.
Enlightening experience,"If you're one curious cat about South Korea & North Korea origin like us, this is a must-visit. We also spent longer that intended marvelled through all the exhibitions. I was particularly interested with the evolution of war weapons used in the earliest years, armours worn by the warriors & war strategy adopted to win the war. "
Worthwhile visit. very interesting,We visited the war memorial prior to visiting the DMZ/JCA and found it very interesting and informative. It was great to understand more about the Korean war before visiting the DMZ area. Definitely worth a visit
Excellent emotionally touching memorial and museum,"The memorial grounds are huge. I spent approx. 3 hours there, outside and inside, and inside of the museum I only visited Korean war aka UN war exhibition. It is also one of those rare museums where you can see a real B-52 bomber. Don't miss a small media presentation that tells a story about a navy conflict between South and North Korea that took place during FIFA World Cup 2002. It is not well known. It is located inside of the navy ship located in the park.I was impressed by the Memorial. Super high quality exhibition. I was also deeply touched emotionally, especially by the Monument for killed in action and by tear drop name tags room. Those of you who have been to Korean war memorial in Washington D.C. will recognize the famous phrase written here as well: ""Our Nation honors her Sons and Daughters who answered the call to defend a Country they never knew and a people they never met"". Every single name of those killed or missing in action is written here on the walls. There is a deep sense of appreciation to all those UN Coalition soldiers who ""answered the call"" and participated. I also appreciated the fact that the exhibition's main message was not a military success or a proudness in this or that. It was about a human suffering, about the war horrors and, to some extent, about a hope for the better future for both Koreas and for a harmony in the future. Very very emotional. There are a few places to get food, one is located inside of the main building and few others are outside, close to the main parking lot. There is also a museum shop inside and another shop close to the parking lot.I highly recommend a visit. 5 stars on my scale."
Amazing place for history,"As a long time history buff, I love to see military relics from various times.This place has it all.From a B52 bomber and a Russian Mig to helicopters and Chinese and American tanks, this is the place to see.Missiles and artillery round out the showcase with a boat to tour as well.It was cold and brisk for us but the onsite coffee and snack building is perfect to offset.If looking for buses don't worry.... there is a bus stop that taxis and buses stop frequently right in front of the entrance!Kids have a small playground to play on as well."
No more war,I cried realising the historical korean war... monuments and figures are perfectly crafted with symbolics and has story to tell.. most awesome..
Just a little bit of propaganda in the English translations,"Overall a very good military museum, lots of English translations. 3 floors with some very good exhibits, good details on what went on in the war.Also has modern weapons in it, so definitely ups the points."
So much history!,"Admission is free! This is a very nice museum with history dating back to B.C. with an enormous collection of things from A.C. As well as several vehicles, tanks, etc. The iron statues outside were huge and beautiful! Many local children there on a Saturday with their teachers learning the history. Most of the displays have English buttons so you can hear the stories in English. "
Very infromative,Lots of content on the 1950-53 Korean war--very informative for westerners. Other wars covered as well. Very moving!
Great free thing to do,"It was a great learning experience and something entertaining to do, and it's free! It was very well thought out and put together, wonderful things to do and see."
"War, love, relationship, community | Tribute to our fallen soldiers who fought for democracy, peace and liberty","I felt proud of my country and the rest of the world who sent troops to help South Korea protect its people. The individual names of my countrymen who fought were written and remembered. It strengthened my faith in the goodness of mankind, his search for peace, love, friendship. Our soldiers contributed to what South Korea is now with their courage and bravery, and to many, their lives. After this tour, go to DMZ for a full circle."
Very well organised and really impressive,"I am so sorry I didn't have more time to give it at least half a day. The building is huge, so clean and nice inside, with lots of original and replica exhibits, audio, educational videos, fun stuff to do and an impressive outdoor area to see all the planes, tanks, boats and whatnot. Oh, and I think the entrance was free. They also have a kids area, didn't really visit that one."
"Some wonderful exhibits, unsurprisingly a bit biased","This museum was a must visit for me - I have a different perspective as I have travelled to North Korea and visited THEIR war museum as well.I was very touched by the famous statue of the two brothers above a split globe - one South Korean and one North Korean. The main walk to the museum is under repair so you must enter from the side, I went through the left.I agree with the reviewer a few posts down that this museum paints the USA as god sent, and while the North Korean war museum was definitely 100% propaganda, this particular museum has its fair share as well, research your subject matter, see the exhibits and then make up your own mind. My favourite exhibit was undoubtedly the large Turtle Ship reimagination and replica as well as ancient battle armour and paintings.The displays are quite comprehensive and as an Aussie it was gratifying to pay my respects on the outside Australian memorial wall as well as seeing a fine collection of ANZAC displays.This museum is a must visit, keep your mind open and be aware of what you are watching, especially on the videos with energetic motivational music and short snippets of interviews.There is an area to make your own stamped and embossed souvenir postcard free of charge. Also possibly the only openly displayed DPRK flag in Seoul is on the dummy replica of the armistice signing."
Great for Learning History of the Past,It was freezing cold but there were so much to see and learn. Felt sad knowing facts of Wars. Realized how lucky we are now. Totally worth going.
Excellent. One of the most underrated museums in the world,"We spent almost two full days in this 3 story museum. It was structured chronologically and gave insights from the ancient times all the way to today's current situation.It was a lot of information, but explained in a very uncomplicated way and not only through text, but also artifacts, visuals, videos, interviews, maps and other interactive tools. It was very well structured and we actually think we know so much more about the Korean conflict and its history now. Outside you'll find a range of military vehicles, planes etc.Definitely a must-see and not doable in just one hour if you are genuinely keen on understanding South Korea's history (not just in terms of the war, but also its evolution and development economically). "
Interesting but too American,"The museum looks interesting, but it depicts the USA as the best nation in the world and tends to overlook other atrocities. There is no entrance fee and the museum is a couple of steps away from Samgakji Station. "
Great history visit,"I had no expectation when I first arrived at the museum but to my surprise, so much history to be learn there.when you enter the place, you can see these commemoratives plates, remembering the people who died during the Korean war in the 50's (by countries).it's quite an interesting visit and learning experience.You can go there on your own or with a tour agency. I spent 90 minutes there."
Go visit,Our visit here teached us a lot about the Korean war. I recommend visit if you are in the area. Free entrance.
"Tanks, canons, planes, boats and more.","I am a history buff. Since I was a kid, I really enjoyed reading things about military hardware and seeing them up close was very exciting for me. It was some sort of a Disneyland or Universal Studios for me when I went to The War Memorial of Korea. This was the first big war museum for me. I was not disappointed because they have a big collection of equipment used during the Korean War such as tanks, canons, planes and even a patrol boat at the grounds of the museum. That experience alone was satisfying enough for me and its free. Good thing my wife and daughter allowed me to have this moment. This sort of thing is more often appreciated by men and kids. After viewing and photo ops outside, we also went inside the museum. You have to get a ticket to view the entire museum inside. We decided not to buy a ticket because our time was limited. We just visited some of the collection which was free to view. We were also lucky at that time because there were some opera singers performing inside the museum and we were able to watch them for free.Going there, we took the subway (Samgakji Station). You can also take the taxi but it depends on where you will be coming from. If you want to get an appreciation of what South Korea went through and how it is preparing to defend its present and future, a visit to the Korea War Memorial is worth your while. Make sure your wife and kids agree with you first. If they do not want to go, go by yourself."
Pretty good museum.,"Pretty decent museum with exhibits of all the wars Korea has EVER been in. Nice memorial for Americans who fought and died in the Korean War broken out by the state they were from. Nice outdoor exhibit of war planes, helicopters and boats."
Excellent museum for kids too,"Spent 4 to 5 hours exploring the place. Even then did not finish the indoor section. Has a big collection (if not the biggest in the world) of actual decommissioned war vehicles from planes to tanks, ships and artillery firearms.No admission fees. The lady at the gift shop has poor attitude. The cafe serves great pumpkin latte."
Amazing!,"If I had to choose between this museum and the National Museum of Korea, I would hands down choose the War Museum! There are so many things to look at, including a 4-D type warplane simulation room. Also, there are amazing statues outside of the museum to see. This museum is not one to miss!"
"Huge, fascinating and free. The best museum in Korea.","Huge, fascinating and free. The best museum in Korea.Has great indoor and outdoor. Also children museum inside."
Wonderful museum,Go if you want a primer on Korean war history from the last 2000 years. This place is huge. Set aside a good 3-4 hours to see everything. They even have a huge collection of life size aircraft and military vehicles outside. Best of all everything is free.
Powerful Place,Very nice place to visit. Enter the museum and you will learn a lot about the history of Korea and the wars.The Collection of war machines is impressive.
must-do this is free attraction,"Not far from central Seoul, could easily be combined with other downtown sitesThe indoor exhibits were very interesting but all that walking on the marble floors got to me after a while.There is a big display of static aircraft and artillery with English translations as well. Lots of statues, and a large, quiet hall with the names of lost Korean soldiers engraved on pillars. While you are in Korea, I really recommend taking a moment to reflect"
"Good museum, interesting artefacts and info and also free entry","I had a great time at the war memorial, and could have spent a lot longer here than the 2 hours I did, if I wasn't in a rush.It's a really big place, and there was a lot of information along with all of the exhibits. I would have loved to go into the special Da Vinci exhibit as well, but it was overly expensive - not sure how long that will be there for.Unfortunately while I was there, there was a lot of work going on outside which meant that I couldn't take any decent pictures of the memorial outside, but they won't be there forever.One thing to note is that the museum is pretty out of the way, and a long walk from the centre - as are a lot of things in such a big city. I use the hop-on/hop-off buses everywhere I go, and the ones in Seoul have a stop at this museum."
Best educational tour!,It's the best educational tour I attended. The museum walked me through time and the war that happened. Learned a lot from this place
Very informative and a must-see,"It was so much more than what I was expecting and now I'm recommending it to everyone planning on visiting Seoul. Leave enough time to explore this wonderful memorial and to see the countless multimedia displays. It's well worth the visit.Added bonus is the awesome War Memorial souvenir shop just outside the main building. Really worth it. Then, please don't leaave without having a crab bagel at the upstairs restaurant.opposite the souvenir shop. Delicious.Tip: take the Metro and get off at Samgakji station. It's only a 5min walk from there"
"Educational,Worth Visiting.","This place is filled with history not just for Korea but also from different countries,it's very educational.This place is a must visit,you will really learn about the war that happened between different races,but too bad we visited around Chuseok time and between 3 or 4 PM to 5 PM,we didn't have enough time to roam around in all areas because they close early during Chuseok."
A Worthful visit at The War Memorial of Korea,"Last October 2017 me and my sister visit The War Memorial of Korea located in Yongsan-gu, Seoul. We went there via train from Myeongdong and alight at Samgakji station. The moment I saw the picture of the Statue of Brothers it mesmerized me - I am in Seoul and I need to visit it. Like many other attractions in Seoul the attraction is free. Since we stay in the bustling district of Myeongdong this is an escape from the noise and sound of the city. Though a lot of tourists are here it is very quiet and serene. The memorial is built to commemorate the victims of war and the soldiers who served to protect the nation. We entered from the left side and the Statue of Brothers will greet you which symbolizes the Korean war and below the brothers is a dome which is a mini-museum which has a crack that depicts the division between 2 Koreas and the hope for reunification. Following your track in the center is the magnificent Memorial Hall (museum) and in front are 2 separate huge statues of Korean soldiers which is totally grand and magnificent. And to your right are the vessels and artillery used in the war which includes a lifesize replica of Navy boat used in the Second Battle of Yeonpyeong, guns, aircrafts, and tanks. You could get inside the Navy boat and see from yourself the captain's deck and what's inside and outside the boat. I really enjoyed my visit because I remembered how our forefathers fought for our freedom, unity and peace. It's worth a visit."
3D 4D for free,"There is a 3D and 4D experience hereBut it only open once in a hour (and at the same time)I recommend go directly into 4D before visiting the museum. It takes quite a long time if you really look, read, watch carefully."
An important part of Korea,"The wealth of exhibits and details about the war between South Korea, North Korea, China, US totally shock me.It is not a regular museum, that have lots to read and exhibit! It has lots of interactive movie ( 4D, with movement ) fake snow, wind ...to similate the day at war! They have lots of young students onstandby to explain the various sections , exhibits and history and it is free!Enjoy your visit and vote for me if you find this review helpful!"
An amazing memorial,Not knowing very much about the Korean war this was a great learning experience. It is a very large facility you can easily spend a whole afternoon here. 
Tour of the past,"I've been to the War Memorial several times and have always enjoyed it. It is so interesting to see all of the planes, tanks and other machines outside around the museum. Inside is just as interesting. It definitely takes some time to see everything, though. It is not a place to go when you are in a hurry, unless you just walk around the outside displays. "
Excellent museum about Korean War since the founding of the nation,"C ( 17.11.30 ) I didn't expected this museum, but the museum was very good to me. There was exhibited many things about Korean War since the founding of Korea, and the various facility and weapon was exhibited. The museum was bigger than I think, and well managed. And I reminded many nation that helped Korea on Korean War. There was good place to know about Korean War for foreigner as well as Korean."
Must see,"I've been to a few war memorials, and this one doesn't disappoint. I went to the Victorious Fatherland Memorial in North Korea, so it was good to see the otherside. Note: there is a bit of bias (as one would guess), so make sure you come in and reserch anythign that seems a bit not quite.... fully discolsed"
Great history place,Here you can learn all about the korean wars and there are tours in english. Also there is a part of the museum for little children....
very interesting,"my interest was drawn on the list od those who died in the war including those from other nations who helped Korea, its a little heartbreaking but i salute the Korean government for giving utmost importance to those fallen heroes who defended its sovereignty!! another interesting areas are the hardware like airplanes, battle ships, tanks, etc displayed outside!"
Massive place,"We found the memorial to be huge, you could easily spend several hours in here. Lots of information and history. There were lockers to store your belongings and a small cafe inside too. We were surprised to find the admission was free."
One of the World's Great War Museums,"If you are a student of military conflict or are interested in Korean, far eastern, or war history, the Korean War Memorial is a must visit attraction. It's huge. Set aside a day for a visit. "
You can spend the whole day here,"This place was amazing, I can spend my whole day here going through their exhibits and watching their videos. You'll learn a lot and enjoy yourself while doing so. The visit here was also very moving."
A Must Visit ,"This war memorial is also a war museum. I give this place a 5 stars rating for its outdoor exhibits of war ship, planes, tanks, rockets, statues and the indoor photos and exhibits. The admission is free and I would strongly suggest a 3 hours tour of this place to be able to at least cover about 80 % of the place. Strongly recommended to visit; especially if you are also planning to visit the DMZ. The indoor exhibits will give you a general view of the Korean War.  "
Must go,"You have to visit this museum if you travel to Korea. It tells you how to understand today's politics in Korean peninsula. You will find out how Koreans have been fighting internally and against foreign invasions in the past two thousand years, and why they separated into two countries in the recent seventy years. Most importantly it's all free. Is you are serious, schedule a full day tour here. Note most video shows are at the beginning of the hour, important if you want to see and hear about the history."
Amazing museum/ memorial,It's on the route of the hop on hop off bus but you will need at least a half a day to see it all. Amazing park around the huge building. The park is full of war machines starting from little small motorcycle to a bomber plane and a us navy ship
"Worth your time, take your time","It is very difficult to put the value of this Memorial into words. Perhaps it is too personal, and thereby subjective. Advice: go early, commit at least 1/2 day, take your time, and enjoy."
A must see ,"This place is awesome.It was really cool to see all the planes, tanks and boats. Such interesting history and seeing the actual boat that had bullet holes in it from the most recent run in with North Korea was fascinating "
Stark reminder of the Korean wars,"The War Memorial of Korea is located in Yongsan-gu. It is a tribute to those who died in the Korean wars. The memorial was opened in 1994. The museum houses many exhibits of war in two exhibition halls. The outside has the larger weapons, while the inside houses the smaller items in six halls namely the Patriotic memorial room, War history room, Development Hall, Expeditionary Forces Room, 6•25 Korean War Room and Large Machinery Room. The museum also holds cultural events for visitors of all ages. Admission is free – but you have to pay for special exhibitions."
I learned so much!,We learned all about the Korean War. It is a beautiful memorial for all those who sacrificed. I am glad we went. We had a guide but we didn't need one. This is one museum that has a ton of English explanations and videos. It was actually distracting to have a guide. I wish we didn't have one.
Offers a good summary of what happened in the Korean War,"Not ever knowing alot about the Korean War, my husband and I spend a full morning here and thought that The The War Memorial did an outstanding job explaining why the Korean War happened, what happened, and why the current situation exists. If you have any curiosity about the Korean War at all, don't miss this Museum. Even though it does not charge for admission, we left a donation because we were so impressed with its quality."
A must visit local,Don't know much about the Korean War...You definitely must visit this Memorial. It is full of archival footage of a terrible time in the history of this wonderful country. It is nicely set up and easy to follow all the displays. You must see it for yourself.
Great info before JSA tour!,Great place to go to brush up on your korean history. We enjoyed Our short tour here before our JSA tour. The statues outside were great. 
amazing place!,very well preserved and very well kept and provides a lot of information on the Korean war. informative and wonderful place to visit
Worth the trip,"Free entrance and a very cool experience for me to visit the place and learn more about the Korean War that my grandfather fought in as a 17 year old kid. This gave me a better understanding of what happened, the Korean conflict, the USA involvement, and the sacrifices that were made. Many vehicles, tanks, planes, etc.. to see. We happily spent 2-3 hours here. I feel privileged to be able to vist this place that not so long ago was under attack."
"Amazing, A Must-Visit","This is one of the best museums I have visited, worldwide. On the outside there's a Korean War Memorial and plenty of static military vehicles (airplanes, boats, tanks, etc). On the inside, you venture through a very interactive display of Korea's history, from very early history to modern day. Many of the key Korean battles are reenacted through props, projections, and videos. It's a very large museum, so make sure you allot plenty of time explore it in its entirety ."
A must visit in Seoul,"I only gave myself 2 hours in this Museum, so I whizzed around very quickly taking in all the highlights! I would recommend at least 3 hours, if you have the time to spare. The Museum is huge and there is plenty to see and keep you occupied. A very important place to visit if you want to get to grips with Korean history. The 'War Rooms' are curated really well, lots of interactive stuff and video installations. Two 4-D cinemas and I'd really recommend visiting the artwork called The Drop. The Museum is FREE! and they also have FREE leaflets/guides in English so it's easy to navigate."
Awesome museum,Very impressive museum about the past and current conflicts in the Korean Peninsula.Outside the museum some impressive monuments are placed to remember the Korean conflict and honor the fallen soldiers.You can easily walk for hours in this amazing museum. Outside there are some war vehicles placed. The most impressive one for me was the B-52.
Good understanding on the Korean war,Comprehensive explanation of the why and how on Korea war. Good exhibits and audio- visual presentations. Free entrance to main permanent exhibits
Korean war history in a nutshell,"Free entry to well organised war museum. We went on a Sunday and it was strangely quiet. The 4D, 3D and 2D short movies were very informative. Lot of photo opportunities for real life replica of vehicles, weapons etc"
A really interesting place to visit,"We spent half a day here looking around and checking out the vehicles in the grounds, well worth a visit."
This museum / memorial is amazing,Large amount of military equipment and other exhibits. A lot of detail and history of Korea and the war. Tip: Go on Monday if you are interested in the military equipment. The main building is closed but the outdoor military equipment and memorial are open... you'll have the grounds to yourself. 
worth visit,you should spend more than two hours there.... I was there for 2 hours and I can't finish everything therethere are too many things deserve you stay and read them all. I almost cry when I read the history of Korea....I would still visit there when I visit Seoul next year!!PS. you are allowed to enter until 5pm and they close at 6pm
Plan to spend some hours here! It's worth it. ,My husband and I went here and only planned to spend 2 hours here. We needed much more time and wish we would have planned half a day here. The whole memorial is mind blowing and inspiring. Go and visit if you can. 
Very Interesting,"Definitely a place to visit! With planes, tanks, and lots of other war and military equipments on display, it's worth a look. For someone who knew little about the Korean War, the three levelled museum (free entrance) was very captivating, informative, and English-speaking friendly. There are films and a couple 4D experiences as well. We spent over two hours and only saw the displays outside and the second level. To see the whole museum I would put aside more time if you wanted to see the whole thing. Highly recommend it! "
A Great History Lesson Awaits,"Highly recommend US visitors go early during your trip to this memorial. Great materials, shows, etc. to explain the background and details of the Korean War. This visit gave us the context to understand many of the things we saw during our stay. Expansive buildings and grounds."
History of Korean War,"Outdoor exhibition of Korean War era planes, tanks, armored vehicles, ships. Both Us, Korean, Russian and Chinese. Extensive exhibitions inside including terrific audio-video presentations. Some of the best I've seen anywhere. So much to see that it is difficult to do in one day. Recommend breaking it up so as to get the most from the experience."
Outstanding Free Museum,"Everything you might want to know about the Korean War and a large inventory of tanks, planes, helicopters and even some boats outside.Recommend spending at least an hour or two."
Museum with 4D theater!,"For every trip that I take, it is a must for me to visit a museum. This museum has not disappointed me at all. At first, I was amazed by how vast the area is and the outside area looks very clean. What amazed me though was the 4D theater! There is no entrance fee in this museum and yet I was able to experience it.It's a great way to learn about war and the not so good things that come out of it."
Must visit in Seoul,"Apart from Kpop, Kdrama and smartphones, Sokor is known for one of the most brutal and deadly civil war in history, the Korean War in 1950-53.This museum gives special emphasis and showcases the gallantry of the south as well as their gratitude to the other nations who threw their support to their cause. This is best shown by the display of colors/flags of these nations. I was just disappointed though that their records dont bear the names of soldiers who were lucky enough to go hom alive as my grandfather did. They do pay special homage to those who laid down their lives helping a neighbor repeal their brother's invasion.On display on its sprawling grounds are military relics and weaponry through the years. A trip to this museum before or after going on a DMZ tour is highly recommended for further context to understanding the Korean conflict. "
Impressive Museum,"I would definitely put this on your too do list. It not only has a focus on the Korean war but also in depth look at battles fought over the past 1500 years.There is no entry fee for this exhibit, but donation boxes are located on site. Very close to the train station and the National Museum."
Very thorough museum on korean war,"I normally don't like these types of museums much but with such a high TA rating, I figured I go. I liked the outside exhibits of the tanks and airplanes the most. They also have a boat that got shot up. I did not find the inside of too much interest but I don't have alot of interest in korean war. There were many exhibits though so if you do have interest in the wars of korea, this is definitely the place"
Very impressive ,"You can easily spend 2-3 hours between the exhibits and outdoor equipment displays. Especially liked the B-52. The exhibits cover a lot of Korean military history from ancient times. Non-native visitors will likely find the 2nd level (what Westerners refer to as the Korean conflict) the most interesting. If you're pressed for time or not a hardcore history nerd, see that area first before venturing further."
great,the very first thing to do when you in Seoul. It is all free so really a must try. highly recommend froe everyone
Blew me away!,"The museum was undergoing renovations and wasn't opened when I visited, but the display of the old artillery, tanks, guns, missiles and aircraft really was something not to be missed. From P51 Mustang, a Phantom fighter jet to an actual B52 Bomber on display, my son and I were simply in awe for the 2 hours we were there. Pity the museum wasn't opened. I'll be sure to come back again the next time I'm in Seoul.Oh, the pun in the title was really unintended..."
"Impressive, moving sight",Even if you don't visit the (free) memorial museum. the vast esplanade that surrounds it is well worth seeing. The engravings of the role call of those that died from all the nations involved is very moving. The actual memorial is very impressive and stands at the main gate.
One for the nerds - so it's lucky that I qualify ...,"Lots of history here, and not just what we Westerners call ""the"" Korean war.Well laid out exhibitions, and something for every nerd.A little heavy handed on the ""we wuz robbed"" view of history, with plucky Korea continually being buffeted by ill-thinking foreigners. Then again, I guess that isn't so far from the truth."
Well worth a visit,This excellent museum really has some accessible displays that really help one to understand the Korean war and th struggle of the Korean people. I also really enjoyed the the historical section on the lower floors. The volunteer guides are really helpful too.
Weapons weapons weapons,"If you like military stuff and you are mainly interested in weapons of all kinds starting with a real B52-D Bomber and other aircrafts, tanks, missiles etc then this is the place to visit. I was hoping to get more insights into the historical aspects why the wars were actually started, but got rather disappointed. It's more about the who and how instead of the why (in contrary to the War Remnants Museum in HCMCity). Still recommended to visit."
A different take on the Korean War,"We all learn about the Korean War (a little anyways) in high school history class. To us it is always that little thing in between WWII and Vietnam. This museum is really good at demonstrating that the Korean War was a war of survival for the people of South Korea. It also takes a different view of a lot. Americans seems to always view it through the lens of ""and then we save South Korea,"" whereas they view it as a war of survival in which others aided them. It also gives a really good idea of the international involvement. Ultimately a ""must see"" when visiting Seoul."
A reminder to choose peace,"A place to be reminded why we should choose peace. Expect to be teary eyed specially at ""the drop"". Watching and learning the different stories of heroes, kindness and selfless acts despite the ugliness of war would also restore your faith in humanity.Tip: start with the top floor; wheelchair accessible; multilingual materials available; free entrance"
Well Worth visiting,"This could b a whole days activity if u like the history of any wars that Korea has been involved in. I went because my father was a Korean War Veteran but it has three stories of history of Korean wars back to 16 BC. It has a big display of military vehicles that children can get into eg planes, tanks and a big ship. It has a children's museum as well. Well worth visiting. U could take lunch and sit in the gardens to eat."
Good museum,"It was good because throughout the museum, it gave lots of information in details how, where, when and why. The displays were good and fascinating, we were spending abt 3 hrs there and watched 2 short video in Eng, a 3D rides, looking at the guns, tanks, jets, and lots. The boys loved to feed the fishes ($1000won put in the box to get a bag of popcorns), and looking at the jets plus the museum is free entry."
Amazing,This is a very nice museum with multiple floors. Make sure that you allow yourself plenty of time as this could easily take up an entire day. You may want to get a tour as doing it by yourself can be overwhelming. 
Interesting thing to see,"We had nice visit to this memorial, know more about the war between the north & south Korea a half century before. Many war weapons. Good chance to learn about the war."
Worth the trip!!!,"More of a museum than a memorial, but it does not matter.Fascinating and emotionaly moving site everybody should visit when in Seoul. Admission is free, the visit takes about 2 hours and the exhibits are just...impressive."
Brought the Korean War to life,"Large collection of old and current planes/tanks/artillery outside and 3 floors of exhibits inside. We just Ed did the Korean War level. Lots of videos as well as items, all in English as well as Korean. Clearly and well explained the background and details of the war"
An Enlightening Experience,I truly believe that the War Memorial of Korea is a must visit location when visiting Korea. Being from a western country where war has not been waged in my country for over 150 years (Canada) it was an experience to see what Korean people have gone though for many years. And this place is free to visit!The museum focuses on war from ancient times to modern times. There are some great exhibits on the Japanese occupations and wars of Korea. but the real highlight is the modern wars. Learning and knowing the suffering that the Korean people have gone through and how far they have come from being so poor after war to where they are now is amazing. It is also good to remember that they are constantly being threatened with war again and again even today. There are many old pieces of machinery outside and there are even a few you can go inside. These are great to see up close and feel these huge machines. I really do recommend everyone to visit this location when they are in Seoul.You can check out this and other attractions like the National Museum of Korea on our website at the link in my profile.
Interesting look at war in Korea,"On my first visit, I mistakenly believed that it was a museum dedicated to the Korean War. It's actually a museum to all war in Korea, of which there has been no small amount. From stone tools to the Gulf invasions, it covers most everything. "
Unbelievable Scale and Incredible Breadth,"The War Memorial is a vast landmark that speaks volumes to the measure of feeling South Koreans have related to not only the unfinished war and all that came before and after it. The grounds alone could occupy you for over an hour and the inside could keep you busy all day. Not only does it include the three exhibits related to the Korean War, the third and final being a moving homage to the nation's who answered call to aid ""people they never met and a country they never knew"", there are also numerous exhibits on Korea's older history, including the Joseon Dynasty, the Japanese occupation and other special exhibits that change regularly. For any of the culturally curious or historically fascinated, this is an absolute must in Seoul. "
Chand,"Went here in Sept. 2017. Was a memorable experienceLovely well maintained gardens.Well laid out. Loved Indian and Great Britain areas. Would definitely recommend everyone visiting Seoul to go. I did not want to leave,it is very pleasant feeling to stay longer."
Very very big,"There's a lot to read about the Korean War.. A LOT to read. I nearly everything, but it feels like physically walking through a textbook. Some of the information repeats itself a lot thoughout the museum, but it isn't presented in interesting new ways to make you want to re-read it. The outside has some neat pieces, like the clock that will be installed at the time of reunification. The 4D movies inside are refreshing, and the historical models look nice as well. Overall not many high points for how long you will spend here. Wouldn't go again or recommend to friends, but to each his own"
A Truly Great Experience.,"I was impressed. The was it was set up, the sprawling complex was breathtaking. I especially love the collection of aircrafts. Watched the 3D movie, learned a thing or two about the Koreans sense of duty and their devotion in defending their motherland. Great experience!"
Stunning Tribute Musuem,Incredible collection of military artifacts dating back to the early medieval period. Exhibits are well layed out and varied and the grounds outside the musuem house a nice collection of vehicles. Did I mention it's free?
Not a Boring Museum,"The place is huge! My family and I didn't get to explore all the floors because we arrived there at around 2 in the afternoon and every floor got interesting memorabilia and history that it might really take a while before you move on to see another section. At the ground floor, by the way, is the imposing turtle ship (not the original one) made famous by Admiral Yi Sun-shin. If you haven't yet seen the movie, ""Roaring Currents"", watch it and you'll see how the turtle ship made an appearance there. =)At around 5:00, we decided to skip the other remaining top floors and head out to check the war ship docked outside the museum and the fleet of war planes and tanks. It was so cool, really.There's so much to see in this place and so much awe-worthy historical war items. My country was a part of it too (during the Korean War, them and the Koreans were allies) so it's really heartwarming to see that our soldiers are not forgotten. ^_^"
The War Memorial of Korea : Best Place near Iteawon,"The War Memorial of Korea: Best Place near Itaewon-Best place near Seoul to see the history-Entry is Free of cost-Explore the history about South Vs North Korea-Lot of old weapons, fighter planes, Tanks, and ships.-Don't miss the 3D video about the war history-Near to Metro/Subway station, 5 minutes walk.-3-4 Hours are good enough to see the museum"
Great museum,"This is a fantastic museum. Presents a good view of the Korean War, with heavy emphasis on the participation of other countries. Exhibits are in English, and there is a multilingual app available for other languages. Definitely worth a visit when staying in Seoul.  "
If you love history...,"We visited this place because we were with my brother-in-law and he may be interested in this museum. During our visit, there was a field trip of little kids, and they were all adorable. There are fighter planes and jets outside the museum, which would catch your interest. Inside the museum, there are different areas that would touch your interests."
You should visit ,Great place to visit the war museum done very well very big place with slot of thing to see and learn about that war in Korea in easy enjoyable way 
Landmark of world war history ,"I visited in company of friends this war museum and was amazed to see planes, vehicles, war ship etc used in the Korean War. The history is documented in every little space in the museum, and can be a source of information for both military historians and other people who are interested.You need to spend some hours in this monument whenever you visit Seoul."
Huge and interesting place,"This is a huge place so you will need to spend here at least 2 hours. The exhibitions are well explained, the building is impressive and the entrance is free. Easy to access by subway. If you would like to learn more about the Korean war, this is the place to go. If you are not into that you will find this place boring. In my opinion, this is a place you must visit while in Seoul."
Korean War History Leason!,"Sure, outside is where you take all the selfies and Instagram moments. But it is inside where you will learn all about the wars that South Korea has fought in. The War Memorial is a very big place. Make sure you get a free brochure so you know where the 7 indoor exhibits are. There are numerous artifacts, and war documents. Be prepared to a few hour here or all day. Tips:Admission is free."
Wonderful experience for war history lovers and military learners,"The biggest war museum and memorial hall in Seoul.Great for visitors who are interested in the history, especially on wars and military exhibitions.- Accessible from metro Samgakji or Noksapyeong station. Or buses.- Free entrance.- 2~3 hours to watch slowly.- Outdoor museum has aircrafts, artilleries, vessels, tanks, missiles, choppers, etc. The replica of patrol vessel, PKM-357 engaged in 2002 is allowed to enter. Some landing vehicles, too.- In memorial hall, visitors can take a tour to 1st, 2nd and 3rd floor. There are many items of Korean military history as well as Korean War.- Materials of United Nations engaged in Korean War.- Multimedia rooms.- There is a large square outside the memorial hall and it's nice to relax."
A gem in the historical heritage of South Korea,"The War Memorial of Korea is a marvelous establishment to visit. Everyone visiting Seoul should visit this memorial and remember the sacrifices our fellow women & men made to keep this world safer. The exhibits are really impressive and they have taken care of each item with utmost attention. They have honored all the countries supported South Korea in the Korean War and remember their contribution of all the philosophy South Korea stands for. Do visit, entry to this memorial is free and you can enjoy the Armed Machinery exhibits in the grounds. Cheers,BokaBoy"
A good history lesson ,"Growing up on US and European history, the war memorial provided a lot of insight into Korean and Asian history that was missing from my knowledge bank. It was interesting to walk around, I would allot a few hours for this memorial before continuing to tackle wandering around Seoul. "
Learned a lot about the Korean War,"We spent 2-3 hours walking through the museum and military equipment. Read stories about the heroic actions during the war and learned a lot more about the history before and during the war. It was Free, so very worth it."
Great learning experience,I wasn't to keen on going here but I'm glad I did. It's not just about the recent war but all wars in the history of Korea. I found the outdoor exhibits most interesting. Real planes and tanks from the war were neat to see. Lots of school children on tour here when we went. Very accessible from samgakji station...just a short walk away.
Historical,"The War Memorial of Korea (전쟁기념관) is a beautiful and modern museum dedicated to the history of the Korean War. One of my favorite aspects of the museum was when you walked up because they had all of the flags of the countries displayed and have a hallway with the list of names of every soldier, from every country, who fought and died to defend South Korea during the war. I was only here for less than an hour as a pit-stop with my tour group on our way to the demilitarized zone but from those around me, I heard that it take around 3 days to see everything inside of this massive museum. If you are very interested in the Korean War, this would be a great place to see. There is also free admission."
Interesting ,I went here with my husband (then bf) about a year ago and I loved it. It's very interesting with all the history and it's huge!
Intestering place to visit in Seoul,"A good place to enjoy Korean history. Some real models of old war machine: ariplanes, tanks, APCs, cannons, etc. Best of all, it is free of charge."
Great way to learn history of the Korean War- a must visit!,"If you want to know why South Korea is the South Korea it is today, visit this museum! I recommend going when they have a free tour in English- it is always helpful to have someone guide you through and tell you the most pertinent parts of the museum. After you can go through again and see anything you may have passed by. "
A must go if you are in Seoul! - Great museum. Very informative and interesting - And free!,"If you are in Seoul and have a few hours to spare, this museum has to be the greatest place to learn about the troubled history of this divided nation.The place is huge and you can easyly spend several hours looking at the exhibits and installations. There are loads of audio-visual exhibits too. You can see, that they really put huge efforts into making this place as interesting and informative as possible.The museum is divided into an outside and an inside part. Outdoors there is a huge collection of tanks, planes, and other vehicles from both sides. Including a 1:1 replica of the PKM-357, a South Korean vessel, sunken by the North in 2002. The bullet hole riddled hull will remind you in an impressive way, that these two countries are actually still at war to this day.On the inside there are loads of Installations and exhibits describing the whole conflict between the South and the North (and their respective Allies)."
"Very interesting, clean and friendly ",This is a great museum. The whole complex is so clean and the people are friendly. Interesting that there's no charge. There's much to do so plan a whole day. It was interesting to see that the country's in this region have been at war on and off for thousands of years. Like the Middle East and Europe. Kind of sad the no one ever figures out the was isn't accomplishing anything. 
Great overview of the Korean War,"I took the free English tour of the museum. Our guide was a little hard to understand but having her show us around was invaluable. One my own, I wouldn't have stopped to watch the short films, but I found them to be great at explaining the war and I am glad they were part of the tour. The guide mentioned several times how the UN soldiers saved S. Korea from the North and the gratitude and appreciation to the soldiers who fought for a country they didn't know was truly humbling. "
Important place to visit ,Tis is a very interesting place to visit. Both from the historical point of view and for the exhibition.
Simply Impressive!!!!,"Initially, when my cousin recommended paying a visit, I was a little skeptical..... However, we ended up spending close to 2 1/2 hours walking through the grounds!!!!! It was simply amazing.. almost to the point of information overload!!!! Being an Air Force brat, i have to say it brought back some old-time memories... but enough of memory lane.... The memorial would be a great trip.. as adults.. and especially if their kids invovled....the displays were impressive... from the displayed text for each of the artifacts.. to the interactive monitors/displays... it was extremely fascinating...... The memorial covers a fairly large extensive time-period!!! it is definitely a must see!!!!"
History and Tribute....,"There are not enough words to express how amazing and heartwrenching the War Memorial is. I think everyone should experience the journey through a war most people have limited knowledge of...but one which had/has a worldwide impact even today.Phenomenal internal design and display layout. Planes, tanks, boats, and military equipment to explore.Monuments and statues that pay honor to military and civilians alike.Displays and videos are in several languages, including English.Ohhh...and did I mention...FREE admission.O"
A pleasant surprise,"Visited this museum as we had seen the one in Pyongyang, which tells a different version of events. Heaps to see and ended up staying a few hours browsing. The outside area is good fun as you can poke around military vehicles. If your in the area the American quarter is nearby for cradt beer. We walked it in 20mins."
Worth it if you have time,"It was a very interesting memorial. It was filled with exhibits that touched on many different aspects of the war. It also had videos and 3 dimensional replicas and real souvenirs from the war, so it was constantly entertaining."
Excellent place to learn some history,"I wasn't sure what to expect but the war memorial does not disappoint. First, the place is huge. You will need 3+ hours to tour it. We spent an hour just outside of it looking at all the military hardware used during the Korean war and there is a small gunboat outside that was sunk in 2005. You get to go in it (it's a replica) and see the story behind it. Inside the war memorial, there are exhibit showcasing the story of the Korean people. Each floor is for a different period. the second floor shows the ""recent"" war of 1950. It's very chilling to see what happened. Overall I recommend it for everyone."
When the different nations come together to protect democracy,I was hesitant to come due to an aversion to anything that pertains to wars but my husband really wanted to see it. I came away with some dread regarding our future as it appears that not much has changed especially with all the posturing by North Korea happening while we were there. But it also gave me hope that the human race will again come together to oppose their aggression as they have before. 
The place to go for details on Korean War!,"A poignant memorial to commemorate the horrible war.Information and exhibits are very well displayed and informativeSituated near the city centre, it is easy to get to.Suggest spending 3hrs there for a comprehensive visit."
How records speak volumes,In a flash the museum provides much needed information about South Korea and its history. It is a must see site for every visitor to The Republic of Korea
An emotional experience,"We weren't really sure what to expect. The amount of aircraft on display was amazing. There is a ship outside by the aircraft with a great story of heroism. Make sure to catch the quick movie inside the ship. Once inside, the museum seems endless. It was emotional to see all of the hardships the South Korean people have been through. Definitely a must see while in Seoul."
Incredibly interesting. Definately a must do in Seoul.,"Definitely a must do if in Seoul. The English guided tour was incredibly worthwhile and I came away knowing so much more about the recent history of Korea which made it even more amazing to see how the country had advanced in a very short period of time. It also made my visit to the DMZ and JSA much more meaningful having this background. Even if you're not really a museum person, you will enjoy this museum."
The War Memorial of Korea to understand war history in Korea,"Nice and calm museum to understand war history in Korea. It's free admission. I've been many times with my kid. There is nice cafeteria for coffee & cookies in building. If you are lucky, you can see traditional wedding for real couple in the garden side. They have combat plane and tank for view. It's good to walk around regardless of weather."
My best ever museum,"I've seen hundreds all over the world, but nothing like this. So many exhibits (including a B52 or a military ship or plenty of other weapons), so much history from so many angles, so much multimedia including in English, free entry and free wifi. Spent 3 hours there, and could have easily spent more.Way above expectations. Must see."
MUST GO. PERIOD.,This is definitely a must go place when you visit Seoul. Free entry to the musuem and IT IS HUGE with heaps of exhibition halls! You could easily spend 3 - 5 hours should you wish to explore most of the exhibitions.It is closed on every Monday and there are free guided tour provided in different languages at a different time slot.
A Must do in Seoul,"We have visited many war memorials and museums around the world including Auschwitz, Gallipoli, Long Tan and Monte CassinoThis rates very well amongst them as a place to visit and the Koreans have done it very well and spared no expense in doing it properlyThere is a whole floor dedicated to Korean history. Another two floors dedicated to the Korean War and the role of the UN in that war. Outside is an impressive display of military hardware as well as the memorial itself which recognises not only the South Koreans who died but all of those nations that fought alongside themAllow a minimum of three to four hours for your visitEntry is free but donations are accepted. I will guarantee that once you have been through you will be sure to want to make a donation"
Highlight of Seoul,"This was our most favorite spot in Seoul. Not only did we learn about the Korean War and appreciate peace and understand how such a great nation has become, we also enjoyed the beautiful landscape, architecture and sculptures. The English tour was especially great."
"Come for the guns, stay for the propaganda","I've been to several of these War Memorials around Southeast and East Asia. The War Memorial in Seoul is no different from the other flawed sites. It's more like a graveyard for old military equipment (MiG-21, F-4 Phantom, trainer aircraft, assorted tanks), but also has its share of propaganda on the loudspeakers. And just for kicks, even the mothballed ICBMs at the Memorial are facing due north. "
Amazing museum with a fantastic tour,Whether you're interested in military history or not the War Memorial of Korea is not to be missed. The museum offers free tours regularly through out the day with friendly and knowledgeable guides. The displays are detailed and you come away having learnt a lot about the history of Korea and how it's become what it is today.
Amazing place,"My first trip to the Memorial was way too rushed, so I'm going back today to enjoy it more fully. The museum is amazing detailing all the wats that Korea has struggled through for the past 2,000 yeats. The displays are excellent and there is sooooo much to see. Give yourself a half day minimum to take it sll in!"
Fascinating and Well Assembled - A Must!,"To understand current Korea, you must understand the wars that made current Korea. This is the place to get that understanding. An impressive facade gives way to great exhibits that will fascinate you (yes, even those on ancient battles). Exhibits are well put together, multimedia and informative. Outside, there is a host of planes, tanks and boats - all fun to see. I loved seeing many Korean families here with their children, carefully explaining things to them. Take the subway and spend at least 3 or so hours."
Amazing !,Only other war museums that I have been to that compare are Canberra - Australia and Ho Chi Minh - Vietnam. This one has everything - if you love history allow 4 hours if your a skimmer then 2 hours. They have free English guide would recommend this very informative. Great outdoor section with planes and ships. Very well done and beautiful garden/building. They even have a 3D survivor story which was great. 
"Very nice, a bit to overwhelming","The place offers a great getaway from hot summer days. It is a nice place with a strong meaning (a bit too strong for my taste). There is a collection of war instruments in the backyard (vehicles, planes, ships, ...). Inside a great presentation of the Korean war is displayed in a nice way with great impact."
Great Museum. Highly Recommend,"First wonderful grounds to walk around that includes military aircraft, tanks, and artillery. Then on to the museum. Free admission and a free book as well! I thought it would just be about the Korean War; however, it was actually a wonderful surprise to go through the entire history of Korea. A great variety of exhibits,very informative, and the staff was friendly as well. Highly recommend you include this in your visit."
A Forgotten History,"It is a very good museum to understand the history of Koryo division. Although it from one side opinion, but it gives you a clear and bigger picture of the event. Well maintained museum, and it's free, audio tour also available, and for the children there is a playground at the back of the war arsenal yard. Been here several times, and I strongly recommend for visitors to come to the museum. And so they know that KOrea is not only about Halyu and K Pop."
"Very interesting, great wifi, and great place to relax a little.","I actually was in Itaewon and decided to take a walk, and I stumbled into the back entrance of this museum in the garden area. I had wanted to go anyway, so it was a pleasant surprise! The museum itself is quite large, so if you're really into seeing everything the place has to offer, you'll need to plan to spend a few hours there. I really enjoyed the exhibits and learned a lot for sure. The air conditioner was also absolutely lovely, and there's a refreshing little cafe downstairs where I bought some ice cream in between exhibits. The wifi is also great, especially since I didn't yet have a SIM card at the time so I was navigating a little bit blindly. Overall it's a really nice place and you'll learn a lot. I especially recommend going if you want to learn about the Korean war in detail, or are doing research. They were even giving out free books at the entrance with very detailed information on the Korean war that would be extremely useful for research purposes. The entrance to the museum itself is also free, they just take donations. So go, relax, learn, and have a nice time :D"
Amazing,"Great museum abouy Korean war history from the hunting and gathering era till the Vietnam War. From 4D to holograms, this museum captivates you with high quality story telling!"
Thoroughly Enjoyable,"Even if military history is not your cup of tea, I would definitely recommend a trip to this museum. It is very extensive and interesting with a range of displays and artefacts both inside and out. Leave yourself plenty of time to explore the museum. Best of all, it is free of charge!"
War museum. ,"If you are interested in Korean War, it is worthy to visit. The garden is also very beautiful. "
Great Historical Museum,"I probably spent at least 3hrs just looking at things and I'm not one that is into history. Be sure to have time to go outside. Lifesize airplanes, tanks, etc...really neat and you can step onto them. Would definitely recommend it. Easy to get to by metro."
Free and informative,"I would definitely recommend a visit to this museum while in Seoul. First of all, it's free! It's a huge museum that would probably take a few visits to really see everything. I took the English tour and that helped get some extra insight, but you could definitely just wander around by yourself. Great place to learn more about the Korean war as well as Korean history."
maybe the best place to learn about the Korean War,"I went there only for the Korean war, but this museum also about wars in ancient times. If you want to learn about every detail of the Korean war, it takes you 4-5 hours at least.The design is very good. There is a lot of interactive media for you to learn. There are also 4D and 3D movies available. From the museum, I can tell Koreans are grateful for those countries who helped. Outside the museum, there are wreaths dedicated to different countries. There is an exhibition room introducing what each country did at the war. At the entrance, you can get an English book for free about the everyday progress at the war.They even have a veteran volunteer. You can take pictures with him."
Very worthwhile,"Learn about how Korea took shape as a nation and of course the Korean War. Easy access by Metro, spend 2 hours or so here"
Great place to take the kids and learn,"The Korean War memorial was an outstanding experience.Took both my kids here during our stay in Seoul and it's a huge place. So many things to see & interact with here.Lots of history regarding Korea as a Nation and its culture. So many beautiful sculptures and historical artifacts and models dating back thousands of years.You could spend the whole day here and try to absorb it all but with 2 kids in tow, it wasn't meant to be.They have daily tours here so best to research and book yourself a tour as we just ended up going on our own. I think the tour would offer more insight into the museum.You can select the preferred languages in different sections/parts of the museum (where applicable) so that no one misses out on all the informaiton rather than staring at stuff not knowing what the h*ll it is).A great place to learn & educate yourself of Korea and its history."
Very Well Done!,"First off, it's free! Second, it is very well laid out.Third, free lockers to store your stuff.Fourth, we found it was just fine doing it on our own without a guide. All the exhibits and such are in in English so we had no problems following the history of the war. And it is great history! I had no idea why, how, and such the war began and where it is today (just a cease fire). If you are in Seoul, this is a must visit. You will learn many things about how it began, the US involvement, the UN involvement, etc. We took the subway and once outside it was a short walk around the corner to the museum. There are same great statues out front and lots of military hardware on the one side. Again, an excellent museum that is not too crowded and very well laid out and easy to understand."
Must visit,We absolutely loved the place! We engaged an English speaking guide who we met at the lobby at 10am - he was very courteous and came across as quite knowledgeable. Its a very interesting place to visit esp.to soak in Korea's historical background. Children will find the displays outside very exciting. 
I liked it.,First of all the place is huge. Expect to spend over 2 hours there. I think it is worth the time. There's lots to see and I found it quite interesting. I would definitely recommend going.
Thoughtful and respectful,"I've been to a lot of Peace Museums around the world and this may be the best. The building itself honors the military subject matter within, yet has a quiet peacefulness with fountains, spacious halls and the flags of many nations who helped during the moment of crisis for Korea. Our English tour guide covered the sequence of events well and stayed within the one hour tour time. She was professional, interesting and gave multiple perspectives. English signage was everywhere so everything was understandable. At the end, they gave away a book that covered the day by day accounts of the events of the war. That was big for my husband who will want to continue to study the details of this war. Definitely worth your time to come for a visit."
Nice Museum,"Went to the war memorial and museum last week. There is a lot of Korean history contained in the 3 floors of the museum, dealing with the military aspects of the country from its inception through the present, with about half the space dedicated to the Korean War. Most of the signs are in both Korean and English, and tours are available in both languages. There is parking available, but we actually walked there, so I couldn't price it for you. The museum itself is free. It took my wife and I about 3 hours to go through the museum, walking slowly and reading most of the signs. We didn't sit through any of the movies. There is of course a gift shop and cafe in the museum."
A great place to learn about history of Korean war,This place is close to my home and I have visited there several times. It has both free and paid exhibition halls. You can learn a lot about Korean war history as well as about its allies. You can easily get there from Samgajki station Line 4 and 6. This place is close to Seoul Station. There is a pond and fountain outside. I highly recommend to visit this place. If you are taking Seoul City Bus tour. There is a stop here.
Excellent museum,Very informative museum. Lots of detailed exhibits.We stuck to modern history and it took us ~3 hrs.Gardens /memorials outside were also very impressive.
Very Moving,I visited the museum with a group of American Korean War Veterans and found the experience very moving. The museum describes the war in a chronological order and displays some of the weapons used. The Bed Check Charlie brought back memories for some of the Veterans in our group.
Great musuem,Large museum with in and outdoor exhibition. Great place to visit while in Seoul to learn about history of the korean war. The exhibitions are well laid out and easy to navigate. A lot of reading to do though. I spent nearly 3 hours there. I personally don't appreciate this kind of topic but I'm glad I paid a visit.
Beautiful and touching,"Wonderful and large with lots to see in the museum, which is free. The memorial also has a huge display of tanks and planes, etc from the war. A must see."
38th parallel ,"Took a half day tour to the border that divides South and North Korea. Lots of history to see along the border we had four stops and each of them is historic. One of the place we visited is an Infiltration Tunnel that the North built to cross the Southern part. We went a Train Station that used to service the Korean Peninsula, and there's a hill where one can view the Northern part with their Flag flying high. Very educational trip altogether."
You must visit.,"First, you can take what you want of photos inside and out and there is a lot to photograph.Second. It is free.Third. You need 5-6 hours and can easily spend a whole day there.This is a war memorial and war museum, not only about the ongoing war. It is also about wars in Korea in general many ages back in time. Of course, as usual, it turns out to be more about glorification of war than horrification. That is the downside of history in museums, when you try to explain it in a museum the bad times and horror look like adventures. So people never really learn how bad it was. Anyway, this place is a must to visit in Seoul."
Interesting if you're into this kind of thing,I'm not a huge war fan. In fact I hate it so this place did not appeal to me. But it is interesting and well laid out. So if you're interested in the military I would recommend visiting. Entry is free and the exhibitions are displayed in multiple languages.
An Interesting Look at the Korean War.,This is a large enough museum to spend a couple of hours at least. There are displays of the weapons and equipment from the war as well as a chronology of the three years of conflict. The signage is in English so I had no trouble with the information on any of the displays. I did find it interesting that it is definitely from a Korean point of view. A few times it seemed like the Koreans had just invited NATO along for the ride as they won the war! It is a must see for anyone interested in war history.
a must visit,This memorial provided a vast background and history of South Korea. An enjoyable tourist attraction one should visit. 
"If you have only one place to visit in Seoul, come here","I typically do not spend time writing reviews for attractions, but this place blew my mind off.I am SO glad to have stumbled upon this place on the internet, since it wasn't one of the heavily advertised places when coming to Korea, as opposed to Namsan Tower, the palaces and etc. I set off slightly before lunch, and walked around the memorial halls. Take note, that you can spend the whole day here if you want to (or at least half a day) because there is so much to do. The only downside is that the food options here are really limited, there was a cafe but everything was sold out except drinks. And the convenience store outside only had cup noodles, so I decided to walk out nearby to have my lunch. If you are stuck like me, do check out Tama Pasta (opposite the route when walking back to Samgakji station). I believe it is on 1~20 Itaewon-ro. You won't miss it. They have really nice set lunches there!With each increasing floor (there are 3Fs in total), the emotions grew heavier on me. The first floor was the history and formation of Korea, second was the Japanese occupation and so on, and the third floor was specially dedicated to the UN. The amount of people that sacrificed for the sake of reunification and peace is immense, including the UN soldiers whom selflessly risked their lives for an unknown people. And if you like what you see, I recommend that you visit the UN Memorial Cemetery in Busan, where some of the bodies of the UN soldiers were cremated.There was another section on the third floor that was under construction, so do take note of that. It will only finish constructions in December. Aside from that, the war memorial has nothing but praises. Not only is the admission free, they have some activities too including several 4D theatres that you can view the shows. There was also a cinema airing different movies throughout the day which I did not get to enjoy, but I most definitely will go back another day. That does not include the outdoor exhibitions that is outside the exhibition halls, but it was too hot today to explore so that will be sufficient for another visit. Beside the information counter, there was a counter of free books (not old, torn or tattered but perfectly new books) on Korea that anyone can take. I took an English copy and am very glad.I beg to differ that if you have visited DMZ, you should not visit this place. Precisely because you have visited DMZ, you should come to the war memorial as it has comprehensive information about the Korean War that the DMZ may not have covered. If you have ONE day in Seoul, and dying to know more of Korea (and North Korea), do visit this underrated war memorial. You will not regret spending your time there. And, don't forget to put in a donation as well if you can to continue this place! ;)"
Wow.,"I normally get bored fairly quickly in museums, but this was great. Best museum I have ever visited! Loads of stuff to do and see. I learnt a lot about south Korea. Would be great for family's too. Only issue is that it closes early compared to the other museums in Seoul so we didn't get to see it all! Also it's free! But I would have happily paid to get in."
Interesting,"A real highlight at how ridiculous war is. Unfortunately it is of course not a particularly accurate account or any information about what Korea actually means when it says it wants to be re-unified. An exercise in celebrating the Korean military. Fair, but not for an accurate history lesson."
Great museum!,"Beautiful museum inside and outside (make sure to explore outside as well). There is so much to go through - you could easily spend 1 day in there. Everything is so well thought of. There are different sections and I recommend that you take the pamphlet and go through each section in the recommended order to have a much better understanding (some of the info may seem a bit biased though but that would make sense). There are also 4D films. We went to one of them and had to line up. It's not that great if you're looking for a thrilling ride but kids will enjoy it. They usually run hourly and last under 10 min but when we went on a Friday, they ran it every 15 min as of 4PM I believe, because there were a lot of people. Note that the museum closes at 6PM and they start pushing people to leave at 5:45PM :P"
Visit The War Memorial of Korea (64th anniverary of armistice),"Nice place to visit for undestanding the background of war and how much we owed to the people who served and sacrificed to protect Korea.Also giving lessons for today.Open daily 09:00~17:30 (close on Monday), free entrance.English, Japanese, Chinese guide available (10:00 am, 2:00 pm)Close to Exit No. 12 at Samgakji Station by Metro #4 & #6.Also many bus lines."
Best war museum I've been to.,"Very interesting museum, huge amount of armaments on show in the grounds and museum itself (lots of planes, tanks, guns, and a boat - even has the first MiG that the Uwest got it hands on from defecting north korean.) Interesting content, esp korean war aspect, relatively unbiased and very informative. Best war museum I've been in!"
very moving and poigniant,a very moving and poigniant memorial to this tragic and still on going conflict.Well worth a visit .This is an often forgotton conflict for Brits which is very sad
knowing deeper about South Korea,"What a great museum, big place and the i can say its one of the most great historical collection stuff in Asia, with a good condition and display. You can take subway to reach there, just a short distance from station. In the entrance gate/lobby, just find the brochure with the map, and follow the map. this museum is tourist friendly, you can find English Chinese and Japanese letter so dont worry about that. there are some mini theater and you can watch some movie , relax your feet for a while and enjoy the story. I really enjoy this museum, easier to learning about history of this country. You will find the Car, flight, and war vehicle collection in outdoor museum. Its Amazing!! Bring your phone and start snap, many Intagramable object there!"
Interesting but not great,"We enjoyed a quick visit one night while in Seoul. It was interesting but not a must see. The plans, tanks and other military equipment display was fun."
The continuing thanks and gratitude from a nation,"A MUST visit when coming to Korea, never mind Seoul!!! A sobering reminder of the sacrifices given to form the building-base for an amazing nation .... who have never forgotten the soldiers who came in their hour of need. A brilliant park filled with military vehicles and aircraft to the right of the War Memorial is totally worth while!!!"
Very large area,"We stay in Itaewon.Just take the 421 bus line towards Seoul station.On the way there, the bus stop at this place.My nephew love it here.Outside area very big filled with planes, tanks, ship, boats and helicopters that some you can go inside it.A lot of time spent outside.Didn't have time to go inside the building.Will definitely go again."
It was an Ok place to visit. Not a must-see if you intend to go DMZ tour,"Went there in the afternoon. It was raining so I didn't take much great pictures. It was a good place to visit for information of the Korea War. But having visited the DMZ, I think this pales compared to what I have experienced.Still, it was good for people who didn't go to DMZ. I compared this to my cuchi tunnel experience in Vietnam. Everything comes more alive if you go to the actual area to experience it."
Super museum!,"The museum is very informative and explains the situations very well. A lot of artifacts, video support, statues etc.One of the best war museums that I have every seen.The museum is free and I think that museums about important happenings in history should always be free for people, because it is important that you learn/know these things.

Excellent interactive museum,"We arrived in time to take the 2pm English free tour. Our tour guide was a retired gentleman who had been volunteering at the memorial for 10 years. He gave us a brief summary of the war, then had us watch a film explaining what happened in greater detail (approx. 18 minutes long). He then took us to a 4D experience with 3D glasses and a moved platform, which we were seated and fixed into, while we watched a 7 minute video from a first person perspective of what it was like to participate in the war. He explained a few more interactive exhibits, before deposited us in another 4D movie. This time I think the 4th dimension was “freezing during winter” as the air-conditioning seemed to be turned up to maximum in the room! The story was about one gentleman’s story as he experienced the war. A few more exhibits explained and the tour was done.The memorial could be viewed without the guided tour, but I think doing the tour really brought it all together. There are many interactive displays within the memorial and one could easily spend the entire day there. There is a free audioguide system in place which can be accessed from your own mobile phone (but I didn’t personally try it out so I can’t tell you if it works or if the quality is any good); the memorial has free wifi to facilitate access.The memorial has six halls, each with their own theme: Memorial, War History, Korean War and UN Participation, Donated Relics, Expeditionary Forces and ROK Armed Forces. There's a cafeteria on-site if you're in need of a snack during your visit. The memorial is within easy walking distance from the nearest metro station (Samgakji)."
Loved it - Interesting and Educational,"I was very surprised to find that this was my favorite part of South Korea. The museum is very well done, with videos to explain all the bits and pieces. I learned so much. We couldn't finish everything and came back a second day and enjoyed it just as much the first day! The only downside is that there was no restaurant except a mini-mart that had cup-o-noodles. I would plan meals away from the museum and break it up. Free entry and ships/planes/vessels from the war that you can explore outside!"
great among museums!,"i love it, i visited it many times, even if you are not history geek you will love exposition. so don't hesitate to go + it's for free"
Best Museum in Seoul,"Having visited most of the museums in Seoul, this one was the most interesting. Great feature on the Korean War."
Korean War memorial,"Arrived late in the afternoon so did not get to go inside however, the exhibits outside we excellent and kept us engaged for well over an hour. Many planes, tanks, and even a ship can be viewed."
Good for those who like to know more about the wars Korea fought,Provides a lot of good information about the wars Korea was associated with which led to the current situation. 
6 Star Staff,"Previously I posted a review stating my disappointed in the condition of our room , yes they need refurbishing and some renovations but the hotel itself is excellent .The staff are the best in the world and we have travelled extensively . We feel like family, if you are a friendly person they will embrace you with kindness, love and sense of fun .How they remember our names I have no idea but they all greet you with that huge infectious beautiful smile that makes you feel like you are at home .The housemaids cannot do enough to ensure you are happy, the barstaff are amazing and then there is the people in the restaurants ... nothing is an effort and they make you feel like royalty  The grounds are beautiful and perhaps the best beach in Fiji( we have stayed in 4 others ) great snorkeling !!Waterfall tour is worthwhile but check with the staff who has creditability as with other tours .Great place to unwind , no stress , everything provided ... we slept 10 hrs each night despite being at maximum capacity it still has a very relaxed vibe .Talk to the staff if you want to venture out.. we were lucky to be invited to their local Rugby final ...WOW what an unbelievable experience .. thank you Shelly at The Sunset Bar I'll be very sad to leave tomorrow not just because we return to sleeping 5 hrs and working 10 hr days but we will miss their faces and the kindness of the most beautiful people in Fiji Thank you ... btw I'll be back with my grandson .. this is kid's paradise "
Visit to learn about the Korean War.,South Korea is still technically still at war with the North.It is amazing the visit the Memorial to understand the South Korea side to the story. Very well displayed in chronologically - short films are very helpful. We spent 4 hour there.It is free to visit.
A must see history of the Korean War,"This is one of the most interesting Museum's I have ever seen. It is very well designed and informative.if you want to learn about the history of America's involvement in saving South Korea from certain defeatby North Korea this is an excellent, interesting exhibit. It has many well done exhibits, photos and stories of the impact on the civilian population. It also has a lot of information about America's unfortunate use of Agent Orange and the disturbing consequences on the civilian population. "
"Really nice docent-lead tour, learned a lot about Seoul.","Spent a few hours at the War Memorial and had a lovely docent-led tour of the museum by a wonderful gentleman. I wish I could spell his name, but he provided a terrific guided tour of the War Memorial Museum and I learned a lot about the Korean War which I was interested in as my Father has served in the War and was in Korea aboard a Navy vessel. Amazing how Seoul has rebuilt their city and in general how South Korea has become such a leading industrial nation after suffering from such horrible war times. Encourage everyone to go learn more!"
Lots of information about America's forgotten war,"It's a great museum with lots of military equipment, thousands of names on the wall to remind visitors of the sacrifices of many countries, not only South Korea. The problem is that most of the signage is in Korean. There is some English, but I'd like some more. The photos are the highlight."
"Interesting, informative and moving museum","The war memorial museum is a must visit in Seoul, particularly if you are interested in history. Focussed obviously on the Korean War but also has sections on early Korean history. The museum is huge and also has a large outside areas with many aircraft and ships. I spent about four hours here but could easily spend longer. Definitely recommend this memorial to visitors to Seoul. One other thing is that entrance to the museum is free!"
Even better than Louvre at Paris and the British Museum!!,"Go early in the morning once it is open, then you can enjoy the most and take the best photos everywhere, especially with those weapons outside, about which you can get very close to them. As an Asian I were particularly attracted to the background of the Korean War, rather touching over some display and stories mentioned there."
Superb! ,If you're into korean war history this place is not enough for a day. You should bring your snacks with you if you dont want to be interrupted by your lunch. There are plenty of vending machine just in case you need a drink.
Can enjoy for free,"The outside area provides plenty of replicas and statues related to the Korean War and the armed forces in general, that a visit just to the outdoor area is worth it. The large plaza with plaques commemorating the countries which joined in the Korean War is a very informative and sobering exhibit. "
Great learning experience,"I thought the memorial was about only the Korean War in the '50s, however, it is about all the wars Korea was envolver in. Very interesting to know the Korean history, specially how the country overcame all the difficulties and become a developed country. Amazing."
Tour,Must see place while in South Korea! Huge! And very well done. Be prepared to come back though. You can't cover it all in one day and you WILL want ti see more!
"Been here 3 times, would happily go another 3 more","Went with my school 3 times as an annual trip to Seoul for MUN. Thoroughly enjoyed every time I visited. So much history of South Korea documented in such a beautiful setting. I was lucky to be able to catch different exhibitions every time I went, which was extremely enriching and enjoyable. The permanent UN exhibit is definitely worth a visit, the museum has a great collection of UN-related artefacts. The outside exhibition of war vehicles was amazing. Even if you aren't interested in history that much, the museum has amazing exterior architecture with a lake, so it's perfect to just sit on a bench and relax for an hour."
Awesome museum ,I went here with a friend and we were expecting a stereotypical war memorial. But this one was so cool! The architecture was beautiful! There was so much to see and there was a lot immersive experiences that helped you understand what was going on. There was even a 4F experience and video art installations. It was beautifully done. There were tonnes of English translations or general English as well for people like me which made my personal experience more enjoyable. Also there were stories about previous wars not just the Korean War 1950. Highly highly recommend! 
spent day there,one of the nicest museums I've been in. very educational. the ships are great to look at and the Korean War section fascinating 
Great Place to Visit!,"Out of all the places that I visited, I enjoyed this location the most. Hands down, this is a great museum. The museum is laid out very well, story of the history of Korea is very easy to follow. "
Great experience,"Hands down this is one of the best museums around. The dioramas are spectacular, the 4D war experience was a great surprise and the monuments/boats/guns are neat to stroll through."
Museum and exhibition goes together.,You can have insight about Korean war from the museum and you can also enjoy great art exhibitions too. The theme and contents of exhibition changes always.
Very Interesting,My grandfather was in the Korean War. I found it fascinating to walk through this museum and see the progression of the war and to learn about the history of the continuing war between North Korea and South Korea. 
Excellent Museum,Spent 3 hours inside an out trying to see everything. It is a very good way to learn of the conflicts that Korea has good throug for over a thousand years. Starting with external kingdoms the Japanese and Chinese and finally the 20 th century to now. Very well done
Historic place,Historic place. An interesting visit for people who wants to know about the Korea´s War and see the machinery was used in. 
The War Memorial of Korea,"Poignant exhibits, war memorabilia, art works, and military equipment make this a perfect place to learn about Korea’s history of war, most notably with North Korea. Kids will enjoy the display of actual tanks and airplanes."
Informational ,Beautiful location and so much to soak in and learn. A must see if visiting Seoul. The staff was so nice and wanted to help! 
A must visit,"After a visit to the DMZ, the logical place to satisfy one's kindled interest and get an in-depth knowledge about the Korean war is in the War Memorial of Korea. Inside this imposing structure is a museum that puts you right into the Korean War. It is so configured that one is led into halls displaying how it started, who were involved, how it progressed, how it ended. A great tribute to all nations (whose flags fly proudly outside the entrance) that sent combatants and non-combatants alike to help a nation under siege. Spent about 2-2.5 hrs here. About a 3-minute walk from the subway exit. Admission is free."
Hands down best museum,"This is a museum like no other. Although specific to the Korean War (covers the Imperial period as well but clearly the focus is the 6/25 start of the Korean War by the invasion of North Koreans) this museum seamlessly combines historical artifacts abs pieces (declassified docs) with modern day technology to give an impressive background and history of the Korean War. Exhibit signs and clips are in multiple languages (english, Korean, Japanese, Chinese) Easily accessible by the subway line. Cannot believe that this exhibit is free. Both adults and kids will thoroughly enjoy this . If there's one museum that is a must see in korea , this is it. "
Awesome Memorial!,This memorial was great to visit and well executed. Everyone in our group from 80 to 11 came away impressed and enjoyed it. We spent nearly 3 hours and could have spent more time. 
War,A fantastic tribute to all nations involved in the Korean War. Great look at Korean history. Indoor and outdoor. Great location! 100 meters from line 4.
Very Well Done and Worth the Visit,We visited this as well as the National Museum of Korea and we liked this one much better. It has a great history of Korea as well as war in general on the 1st floor and then the bulk of the Korea War was on the 2nd floor. If you only have time for one museum I would visit this one. 
A Must see!,Excellent and well designed museum! Although it includes the most of history of Korea and wars they fought the largest exhibit is about Korean War. 
Just amazing,"This place is big and amazing, and it is free... You must visit this place, it is not only a War Memorial but more a History of Korea Museum. Easy to access with subway, you will need half a day to visit this massive area."
The museum is massive and well done,The museum at the memorial is 3 stories and I spent over two hours between it and the outside exhibit. Well worth the stop and it's totally free!
Must see in Southkorea,"A must see, when you are in Seoul and you are interested in Koreas history. Don't miss it. Big open air museum about the military carpark and planes in the park, also with a children museum.Additional info:- free entry- free book about south koreas war history- informations are in english- broschures in english- regular guided tours in english, korean every day (ask for chinese and japanese, probably it is available)"
Somber Reminder of Korean History,"A beautiful military history museum adjacent to the US military compound near Itewon, Seoul. The museum is free. Outside are many displays of military aircraft, ships, and armaments. Inside are various displays of Korean military history to include the Turtle Ship. The Korean War section is elaborate and in depth. Harry Truman made the right decision to defend South Korea. A legacy we are still living today."
Must see,"A huge museum, mainly dedicated to the experiences of the Korean War, with memorials to all the countries on the Allied side and the names of all those killed inscribed on the façade, which is vast. It was quite a shock to realise how many people were killed.Outside is boy toy heaven - lots of old planes, including a B52 bomber, tanks and a replica of the ship sunk by North Korea in 2010. Inside are some beautiful symbolic sculptures and more about the Korean armed forces than you would ever want to know. We visited on a Friday afternoon, where there was an hour long demonstration on how warfare had been carried out over the centuries, a military band and a display of marching and rifle twirling. All very entertaining. My guidebook says it happens at 2pm every Friday but not sure if this is the case. Even without the show it is well worth a visit."
The BEST and FREE Museum I have seen so far,"This War Memorial of Korea was the best museum I have been in Korea and possibly elsewhere. Not only does it describe the war, it is very big. Usually with this size of museum it probably would describe the entire history of Korea. But this museum describes the history only of the Korean War which is very interesting. ALSO FREE. WOW."
Amazing memorial,"Based on our experience with other memorials, we only allocated 1 hour when planning our day's itinerary. We ended up extending our time and could easily have spent 4 hours there. There is a large air conditioned museum and outdoor exhibits. Admission free. We learned a lot about the Korean war."
Sprawling tribute to fallen soldiers of all participating countries,"This museum remembers the not too distant past in which many nations participated to help South Korea be what it is today. Entry is free and one feels the gratitude the country has for the assistance it so badly needed, layered over the national and personal pain its citizens still feel, but bravely cope with."
One of Seoul's underated attactions,"I visited on a rainy day and was a great escape from the weather, saying this thou I would highly recommend this attraction even if it was sunny. great history from the discovery of Korea right through to present day of the history war that Korea has seen. Well laid out it is easy to wander through and skip anything you dont have time for. I felt everything was done tastefully and that Korea shows their appreciation for the UN and the countries that represented them in the Korean war. Very interesting I learnt alot and came out knowing a lot more than i did going in. For some reason not a big tourist attraction seemed to be more locals here, make sure you wander outside with all the planes before leaving."
Eye opening,"One of the best museums I have ever stepped foot in. This museum is huge! There is an outdoor exhibit and several exhibits inside. You must see fit yourself, it's a great history lesson, best of all, it's FREE! But please consider giving a donation, it is a very well put together Museum."
Big museum,"We spent about 3 hours here, but didn't get to see everything. It was enough though because we felt a little like death by museum by the time we left. We took a free English tour of the museum, but didn't feel as though it was helpful. Our guide just read out the headings of the main sections that we were entering and didn't really explain much. He pointed towards major items waving his hand vaguely, greeted other guests, and then took phone calls on his cell. We felt like it was a wasted hour.We walked around the museum alone after the tour for another two hours. I'd recommend to watch the videos places strategically at each entrance to a new area instead of going on the free tour. They give u an idea of what is to come and what you're looking at because the English translations of things are brief.They have a few interactive activities there which were fun for both adults and kids. There were also two movie theaters in there that only played during specific times. They looked interesting, but we didn't get to see them. We either missed it or didn't want to wait another hour for the next showing. Probably if we spent half a day here we could have seen everything."
Interesting experience,"I haven't seen many foreigners visiting the museum but I went there with my parents after checking out reviews here, and I wasn't disappointed. It's such a meaningful and interesting experience. My grandparents are holocaust survivors and therefore every war themed museum feels very close to heart. It's also good for people who want to learn more about Korea and not just travelled there because of the hallyu wave. Totally recommend!! "
Korean War memorial ,It was a great place to visit and I was humbled by all of those who sacrificed to make South Korea what it is today. An awesome place to visit. 
Interesting war memorial,Good chance to see some of the US armoury that was left behind - including a massive B52Lots of families use the grounds for picnics over the weekend - so not a sombre place as one might expect.
Greatest War Museum in the world...,"... least this is what they claim, Really huge, with most modern technologies for visitors equipped. Shows highlights of the last 1000 years of wars in Korea."
One of the best museums I have visited.,"As a person that has traveled extensively and visited lots of museum around the world, this has to be one of top notch museums. I am very interested in history and war, so this was a must visit. The exhibits were very well designed and thought out, there are written information to read, videos to watch, and lots of 3D and 4D exhibits to make you experience and understand the Korean War. I thoroughly enjoyed this museum and learned a lot in several hours. There is also an extensive outdoor museum with displays of previous tanks, aircraft, etc."
A great educational visit,"Neither of us knew too much about the Korean war, ok, nothing really, so a visit here was mandatory for us. We got a great introduction of the history of the war and where we are now. I highly recommend a visit here. It is very easy to access and also right across from the Dragon Hill Lodge. "
A must stop,We went on Friday which is the day they have various military groups in formal outfits which I found interesting. There are a lot of military planes and equipment. There is a Korean boat that had been shot at. There is a section inside where you can get something to drink. Bathrooms are clean. We were there for about an hour and felt we saw everything.
Great Experience.,"I booked one of the day tours from the city center of Seoul. The first part of the tour stopped at the war museum in Seoul. We were given one hour to look at the whole museum and I thought it was going to be really boring and depressing. The truth was it was really interesting and I could've spent at least three hours there. I learned a lot about the war and the tragedies that happened during it. It opened my eyes to such a terrible horrific war that can never happen again. Good experience, in all should take you about three hours to see everything."
Worth a visit,"We should have budgeted 2 hours here, as we didn't have enough time to see all we wanted to. Informative and impressive collection."
Wonderful Memorial,We visited this Memorial on a Saturday morning. It took us about 2 hours to go through it. It was so amazing and informative. 
Touching,"Everything is educational about the military history of Korea. It is touching even the monument outside. Expect informative exhibits if you are interested about Korea's past. Make sure that when you go to this place the weather is nice to see the western part of the museum where there are airplanes, missiles and other large-sized weapons. So, if you want to learn and make your vacation more educational, this place is a must to see."
"Beautiful, touching",Exemplary work. The memorial is a tribute to the Korean people and all the allied nations who contributed. The attached museum is very well done as well. This should be on your must-visit lost for Seoul.
Favorite Museum in Seoul,"This is easily one of my favorite museums in Seoul. Just to clarify -- This is NOT only a ""Korean War"" museum. It is about the history of warfare in Korea's past. That means you should absolutely wander to the lower floor to see a replica of the famous Turtle Boat and predecessor of the multiple rocket launcher (which, btw, was featured in a MythBusters episode). There are some really fascinating exhibits, including an old car used by Kim Il Sung and one of the most extensive military equipment displays I've seen. There GREAT things inside *and* outside so I recommend coming on a nice day as well so as to not miss out on the airplanes, missiles, and armored equipment just to the west of the museum."
Amazing,"Where do you start! The parade was the best I've ever seen, precise precision movement and colourful costumes of every branch of their armed forces old and new.Kids kept entertained by the many mascots and lots of photo ops to be had.Watch from the step area to get the best view as they come from all directions, get there early to grab a spot.Inside the memorial great, they really showcased the help Australia gave them, our national flag flying proudly alongside theirs."
Must visit,"The museum is huge and there is outdoor and indoor area. Indoor area show the weapon and history whereby outdoor area show plane, tanks and warship. You can easily spend 4-5hrs here. Inside the museum there is a few 3Dmovies. Additional points is the museum are free of charge. "
Korean and Vietnam War ,Good to visit and free . There are lots of planes and tanks outside - mainly American - used in the Korean War . Inside there is a lot of history and very well organised with films . You can see that North and South Korea have battled for a long time and because of the geographical position of Korea it is susceptible to invasion . There also always appears to have been. a Kim in charge of the North . Or some other dictator from Manchuria . It's also about the Korean War and the battle between north and south with the UN intervention . The war lasted between 1950 and 1953 . Korea felt obliged to help in Vietnam . And it seems that participation helped its friendship with the West especially USA . There is a stark warning about nukes and Kim . Good pretzels in the cafe 
A very comprehensive and interesting museum,"My husband, teenage daughter and I visited the War Memorial of Korea on our recent trip to Seoul. This is quite a massive museum, which covers the Korean War in great depth and also various other Korean conflicts through the ages. As foreigners, we found the Korean War exhibits of greatest interest. Extensive galleries are dedicated to this conflict, with hundreds of artifacts on display all with detailed English explanations. Each of the countries that participated in the war also has its own mini-exhibit with statistics on troops served, casualties, etc. In addition to more traditional object displays, the museum also incorporates some interactive, digital elements and shorts films, which bring the history further to life, particularly for teens and young people who tend to be more screen-oriented. There is also a large outside display of military aircraft, vehicles, etc., which is quite impressive. Personally, I would have liked to hear a little more about the civilian experience of the Korean War but the military history and geo-political aspects of the conflict are extremely well covered. Note that the museum is really extensive. We spent approximately 3 hours on our visit but military buffs could undoubtedly spend an entire day, as there are so many things to see and discover. The free admission also make this a very accessible visit. Highly recommended."
Spend worth time here!,"It was a great time to explore the history and more attitude. Before that I had watch Yi Sun Shin movie, the Admiral of Navy, he was a clever in the critical time and beat Japanese navy at that time. So, I did find him here. There were many groups of students visited here as sightseeing subject of school."
Impactful,"This museum is a must see, although you have to have an interest in history and war. It does not only cover the Korean war, which saw soldiers from all continents unite to defend South Korea but basically all conflicts in Korea, from the supression of the Manchu tribes to the Imjin war and Japanese occupation during WOII. Every part has an English introduction but most of the item descriptions are in Korean.The museum is free and also has a kids museum although I did not visit it. "
Excellent rememberance to the Korean war.,"What a great museum, and I did not even get to see the inside. Unfortunately I only had the Monday to visit the museum, but most museums are close on Mondays. But this museum has so many outside displays, information, remembrances, architecture and honouring other nations that I was still able to spent about 3 hours there. Great to see a nation honouring those who came to help them in a time of need and still maintaining it so well. I will definitely come back and totally recommend this museum."
For a memorial really really good,There is so much to see and to learn. All open air and for free. Located close to the subway station Sinyongsan street with some local restaurants around.
Nice & really worth to visit when you're in Seoul,"This is really a historical place to visit, the flags of all the countries contributed or rendered support were there standing. You will see many kinds of air force planes and we're lucky that during our visit there's an exhibition which was fantastic."
Very impressive,Very impressive war museum which practicly explaines where is South Korea today with the conflicts in the erea. It is all about wars in Korea in all times. Recomanded.
Interesting Place,Good place to spend a few hours if you like history or had kin killed in the war. There is a wall listing all who died in the conflict (US dead are listed by state). There are movies and dioramas and weapons. Don't forget to get your free book inch thick which chronicles the war day by day.
Worth the time,"Need to expend at least 3 hours for the visit to be worth. The exhibitions are great, particularly the one about the Korean War. The outside sculptures are quite impressive."
Amazing,"You can spend here a couple of hours, to learn all about the korean history and wars. Very well set up , with some amazing video's and artifects."
Heart warming,"I really enjoyed this location. They have ingraved every person that died fighting in the Korea war from each country on the walls. The outside displays a lot of machines (planes, tanks, etc) used in those wars. I didnt even make it inside but the outside was great. "
A good day out,"The memorial is like nothing I have seen before and gives you a good insight into the Korean war.You really do get a sense of how proud this country is about their accomplishments from the past and you will learn a lot! I loved this place so much that I made sure I visited on my second trip too.This place is massive. Allow plenty of time to walk around. I took a packed lunch and ate near the tanks and planes. I think this place is great for anyone - families, solo or travelling with friends."
very interesting to learn about the Korean War,Have to give credit to Seoul that this museum is free. It had English translation for probably most if not all displays. it had 3d and 4d short movies for free. Best museum in Seoul according to me.
Excellent museum,We have been to numerous museums in Seoul and this is a definite one to see when in town. The museum is free and history books were also being handed out on the day we attended. One of the main points is to thank the United Nations . This is beyond just the overall general history. Most displays and videos had Korean and English options. Got a good sense of what the people in. Korea have gone through over the centuries
One of the Better Museums in Seoul,"Seoul has a dearth of quality museums, but the War Museum is one of the only must-sees in your visit."
Tanks and planes,"Put this on your to-do list in Seoul.It is a museum with free admission.The statue at the front is inspiring, and it has a huge collection of old tanks and planes and also a ship you can go through (with added dramatic effects).The indoor experience was a bit barren and didn't seem to offer as much as the vehicular display, but I'd say it is worth a visit.In early March 2017 it was not busy at all.Easy to get to via bus #421.We stayed less than 2 hours."
"Fascinating history, great presentation - and free!","This place is huge, haunting and interesting - an amazing museum experience. You should allocate at least 3 hours, so come before 3pm, as it closes at 6pm.There are three ""Korean War Rooms"", and we spent an hour or so in each.Recommended for anyone visiting Seoul."
Must See,Glad that we went to the War Memorial Of Korea !! The entrance fee was free and there were so many old fighter planes exhibited. We took so many beautiful pictures and all of the planes were still so well maintained. Nice place to visit when in Korea ! Highly recommended ! 
Good museum to see what happened in this forgotten war,"This large museum tells the story of Korean war where Soviet Union, China and North Koreans fought with the UN troops. There photos and some text in English. Museum shows many guns, tanks and airplanes inside and outside of the museum. Outside wall has names of those who lost their lives in the war. There is also a section about Vietnam war, where many Koreans served their military service. There are usually some volunteer guides able to speak English to show around. Couple hours should be enough to walk this thru. Museum is located next to Samkagji subway station and next to Yongsan US Army base. From the museum there is easy walk to Itaewon restaurant area. "
Huge must see war museum! ,This museum is very large. My husband and I were unable to see it all due to my bad back and knees. (I cant be on my feet for more than a few hrs.) What we saw was amazing. They have lots of interesting pieces and exhibits. The memorial is a powerful experience. They have outside and indoor exhibits and they are all interesting. You could easily spend a whole day here. Plenty of bathrooms and a few places to grab some quick food (as well as vending machines.) Definitely a must see if you are in Seoul!
respect this monuments,i tooke a bus to get here from Myeongdong station exit 8 infront of Migliore. get off exactly when the sign the war memorial. worth to be here as we can see the tanks ships and fighter jets used in the korean war. close to the ministry of national defence. any bus to itaewon will stop here. the subway-need to update the name- close to the ministry.but 5 minutes walk
Huge!,"I, unfortunately, didn't get to explore all of this museum but what I did see was very interesting. I particularly enjoyed the interactive exhibitions in multiple languages."
Best museum we've been to,"This museum is amazing. The way the exhibits are put together is captivating. So many mixed uses of media that work effectively to tell the story of the history of Korea and the separation into the two Koreas. The grounds around the museum are also amazing. Tanks, planes, a boat and artillery spread out on land the size of multiple sports fields. You could spend half a day to a whole day here. We ended up going back on a second day to see the exhibits we missed. Highly recommend to all. "
Brilliant!,"Incredible place to visit,The exhibits within the museum.The sculptures outside.The layout of the buildings.An awesome experience. "
Glad we visited,"For those who would like to understand better the Korean War, it is best to visit this memorial.We took a free guided tour and went around with our guide for an hour. He explained important dates and highlights of what happened from 1950-1953. I personally found it an eye opening experience, seeing Korea beyond the beautiful palaces and the brightly lit shopping areas. To hear something like this actually happen is beyond imaginable and I hope it never happens again.Perhaps a very painful event in Korea but I understood why it has to be passed on and never forgotten. It carries lessons from the past and it is part of Korean heritage that the whole world should learn from.Apart from the stories, the museum has a lot of very interesting displays, some movies are in 4D, and larger than life aircrafts, tanks and ship have been preserved for people to see. During our visit they were also distributing a free book on the Korean War for those who would like to read more about it."
Worth the trip,"We didn't have much expectation for the War Memorial but were blown away once we got there. It's near the train station so it's very easy to find. There's a lot to see on the outside, we arrived around 6 so didn't have a chance to go inside. We like how the plaques are also in English so we know what the statues mean. "
War Memorial was very well done,I have visited here a few times. The museum is well cared for and has a lot of artifacts. It is definitely a must see while in Seoul.
Great museum for kids and adults alike,"This is an excellent military history museum with a very large outdoor park that displays tanks, airplanes, and even a ship! You can learn a lot of Korean history by just walking through the permanent exhibit. For those who are interested in the Korean War, it offers a comprehensive, visceral and sobering experience. They offer 3-D virtual reality theaters and other interactive experiences. You may have to line up for these but it moves quickly. The regular exhibit and the park are free. "
History of Korea,If you are interested in korean's history this is the perfect place. The exhibition is good inside and also outside. Sometimes there are thematic exhibitions ... I really enjoy to spend one morning there ! 
An excellent museum,"On a scale of 1-10(excellent), this is an 10+ museum. My only regret was I thought an hour would be enough to spend at this museum. Boy, was I wrong. I regretted going towards the end of the day. You can spend many hours here and be prepared to be overwhelmed by the excellent exhibits. Short on time, I thoroughly enjoyed the section ""the UN in the Korean War""."
Fantastic experiece,I've been to many museums having grown up overseas and in the Washington DC area. This was one of the most impressive. I'd go back on my next trip. It's that good.
"Good place but if you have huge empathy for others, be prepared to get sad","This place discusses the history of South Korea's fight for its land. But the huge statues (or whatever they're called) outside the museum itself were mostly about the fight between the North and South. Inside, the museum is divided into three floors (if I remember correctly). It has arrows so one does not get lost. There are vending machine for drinks scattered about the place, as well as water fountains and restrooms. There's a cafe inside as well in one of its floors.Like I said in the title, if you're big on empathy, the areas discussing atrocities of war will get to you.It's a sad place that speaks of truth. ""Freedom is not free."""
good for non Koreans,Very interesting and plenty of captions in English. The DVDS and the section on UN forces contribution especially good. Highly recommended.
The best museum I've ever visited.,I was blown away by how good this was. You could easily spend hours and hours here. Couldn't fault a thing. An incredible insight into the history. 
Solo day out,"I passed by the War Memorial of Korea after visiting the National Museum of Korea. Its very close to it. and its easy to visit both in one go. If you love museums and history, this is a def worth visiting. "
Exactly what a museum should be,"This is our second visit to this excellent site. Like the Australian War Memorial, this is not a celebration of war, but rather a reminder of the costs of war spanning the history of Korea. The displays are interactive and interesting and well sign posted in English. We spent an easy 3 hours here and our 5 year old was captivated. The outside display of Korean War equipment was a highlight and incredibly informative. Highly recommended! There's a small children's museum at the end of the display and you need to reserve a time at the counter. Unfortunately no activities are in English, but you can easily interpret what it is. At the end there is a play area which was quite welcome on the rainy day we visited the museum. "
A sober visit,"This war memorial is a tribute to all who lost their lives in a crucial part of preserving Korea! The grounds are kept up well, the monuments and information were very engaging and kept the visitors moving! I highly recommend for the history or military buff!"
World Class ,I'd reckon I've likely been to more than a hundred museums in forty something countries. This was the best. Seoul is only second to London worldwide in quality of museums for me. Vital information to understand Korea and what the people have been through.
Great for war buffs history buffs and young boys,"This is my 7 year old boy's favorite museum in Korea. He loves to climb up the stairs and look inside the exhibits like planes, tanks and others. You can easily spend an hour outside just playing on the big stuff and snapping some photos. Inside has more serious exhibits and info on the UN forces and losses during the war. Also admission is free. Worth visiting at least once."
Can spend the whole day there...,"If you have interest in war history, you can spend the entire day there. However, a majority of the descriptions are in korean. It is recommended to join a guided tour in English which the memorial provides at certain times and for free, i guess. I saw ticketing booth at the entrance but the booth was closed and nobody was selling nor collecting tickets on my visit. There are 3 floors and the 3rd floor is dedicated to the Korean War. From this visit, i now understand how the war started and how the world stepped in to help via the UN, it was not just the American but they did send the largest troop. Didnt know countries like Ethiopia, South Africa, Columbia, Philippines, Thailand...etc had their troops too in action too.Now I also understand the present conflict between North & South, PRC & US, US & Russia, this conflict went all the way back to how the Korean war started. How Kim Jung Il seek agreement from Stalin & support from Mao Ze Dong to attack the South. How quickly the North overran the South, how ill prepared the South was for this war with almost no credible military assets while the North had been training under the Russians, how the UN stepped in, how they fought back and almost defeated the North, when the troops from PRC join the fight, when they called for cease fire....etc. Interesting to know that there was no winner nor loser in this war, it was only an agreement to ceasefire and a line was drawn to separate the North & South. Good education for the younger generation. It is really touching to learn how many countries step in to help, many of them are still rebuilding after WW 2 which ended about 4yrs prior. It is touching to know many thousands of young soldiers died ""...defending a country they have never seen and people they never knew"" (saw this quote in this exhibit as a tribute to the UN soldiers). "
Possibly the best museum I've ever visited ,"I spent over three hours at the museum and thoroughly enjoyed it. There are so many exhibits and I learnt a lot about Korean history, not just the war.There is a lot in English which helped the enjoyment. You could EASILY spend 5 to 6 hours in the museum if you watched all the great videos and read all the information.This is a must see in my opinion "
Please do go and see this,"It's got a lot of stuff here to see. Most memorably the aircraft, tanks and missiles in the outside exhibit. Of particular interest is the B52, the Mustang fighter and the MiG19 flown from North Korea by a defector. Inside you will find a series of rooms with information and artefacts mainly about the Korean War, but also other periods. Perhaps a little light on details ... But what I liked was the very profound way that the museum was very much a living memorial to those who had died in the war. All done with dignity and respect. Well done"
Must see place in South korea,It is a must see place in South Korea. Full Korean war history is displayed in the museum. Need almost a day if you want to cover every thing in detailed.
war Memorial,"Excellent attraction with first class exhibits inside and out and full description in multiple languages. We visited this venue with our grandson who is studying the Korean War at school.Highly recommended attraction, a definite 'Must See'."
Must see to understand Korean history,"We didn't have enough time to go to the entire War museum and will go back in the future by planning more time to see it all. We only went into the Korean War area. Very helpful in understanding the war and the peace and reunification that South Korea desires. Great displays inside and outside. Outside displays include a ship that you can go on. Also includes, planes, tanks, etc. Large memorial was very moving."
Good and vivid retelling,"Very nice museum with a lot of detailed and interactive information ! Don't wait for the 4D theatre, but if you're there on time try it. It's fun."
Touching place,"I`ve visited this place several times, each time it`s a great feeling, there are many showrooms and different items regarding the korean war. I`ve seen also represented all countries witch took part to the conflict. Outside there are all the weapons of the korean war (tanks, aircrafts, choppers etc.)I suggest yout!"
Nice museum and it's free!,"I loved the outdoor exhibits and the various exhibits indoors too. However, more labelling or explanation would have been helpful in some of the indoor exhibits"
Informative Museum,This is the place to go to learn about the Korean war history and also the current relations with North Korea. It's a very moving museum with a lot of emphasis placed on peace and reuniting with Nkorea. Definitely give yourself 2-3 hours for a decent visit.
Beautiful memorial,"Well worth a visit, ensure you visit the war museum which is located nearby the war memorial to learn more regarding the history."
"Interesting, educational visit about Korean War",I went there with my parents when we visited Seoul. My dad & I were quite blown away with the details of the permanent exhibition. The vehicles and machinery on display were really interesting. It also taught us a lot about what happened in Korea war and the role of UN in helping South Korea at that time. The personal belongings of those who fought in the war on display were very moving. Freedom is not free indeed.
The most in-depth museum of the Korean War,"The War Memorial is both a memorial and an excellent museum. From the perspective of a Korean-American, its explanation of the history leading up to the war and the phases of the war was excellent and in-depth. Although there is a definite perspective (from ROK viewpoint), the presentations were much more objective than I expected. If you are visiting Seoul, I would consider this to be one of the 3 ""must-see"" museums or palaces."
History shared in an engaging and entertaining way,"What a fantastic museum, interactive exhibitions, including a 4D cinema experience where you can get a sense for how the war would have been. A good mix of facts and personal stories/accounts to learn and keep your interest. Great for history buffs who want in depth information, but equally for families - parents can learn about Korea, while the kids are kept occupied with fun exhibitions, I believe that there is a kids museum section too. Plus it's free!! U"
Great Visit,The statues tell a very detail and sad story. It especially shows the bond between the US and South Koreans
An Interesting Historical Site,"We enjoyed our trip to the War Memorial of Korea. There's a lot to see. The outdoor exhibit is interesting, featuring aircraft, tanks and other defensive equipment. "
Huge but you have to be interested,Huge cavernous building for the exhibitions plus lots of hardware and sculptures/monuments outside. If you were really interested in the detail of war in Korea over the years it'd take a few hours to absorb everything.
Really great museum,"I learned a lot about the Korean war, info I just didn't know! Highly recommend taking the free guided tour in English!"
So much to see and understand!,"If you love the history and art of war here is where you need to come! Over 5,000 years of history in this awe inspiring place. Also if you love tanks and planes there are no shortages here! Step right upto a US B-52 bomber and explore aa Patton tank plys so many others!"
Excellent museum,"This is an excellent museum, covering South Korea's military engagements since 1945. They have an extensive collection of tanks and aeroplanes and well set out displays on the Korean War, Vietnam War and South Korea's involvement in UN operations. My husband and teenage boys all loved this museum. We spent most of the day here."
"The pride of a free nation celebrating the fight for freedom, through the military ","As the sign says FREEDOM IS NOT FREE This museum and showpiece explains the fight and Struggle. South Korea had over the last 60 odd years to be free and to build a vibrant modern industrial country where the living standards have benefited all the people.It has stories of heroism and the coming together of the nations to support Korea in the their struggle, a terrific museum with the latest Visual aids to show the story in real terms. "
Amazing and impressive museum.,"O.convenient tranceportation by subway train. 0.no entrance fee and can get useful pamplets and memorial book. 0. Great sight room on the second room - Korean War 1, 2 0.Many real used troops include Tanks and bomb airplanes. 0. Enough parking lots and cheap fee. 0. Affordable for all ages."
Sad but true ... Must see to understand!,"Great and interactive experience that all history lovers have to add to their itinerary while visiting Seoul. I was actually crying at the end but isn't this the purpose to remind us what we must not allow to happen again? Museum for adult and child, regardless of if you are into understanding or not the nature of the war itself. "
Seoul War Memorial,"This is an impressive and modern museum covering Korean history from ancient days to modern times. The centerpiece of the museum is a replica of Admiral Yi Sun Shin's turtle ship. A great deal of the museum is devoted to the Korean War period. Lots of outdoor static display pieces of aircraft, tanks and boats. A must see!"
Amazing!,Very good place for everybody whi wants to know a lot of about Korean War.Even it is closed on Monday still it is worth to come to see outsite exhibition.free
Awesome,"If you like war history this is a must see. personally, I am not in to it, but I spent 2-3 hrs exploring here without any great interest in the topic! There are loads of screens/ information documents etc to satisfy history buffs. Outside the museum are aircraft, tanks and missiles form various battles. Inside the huge exhibition halls are fantastic dioramas complimented by digital imagery to provide an experience. there are several 4D theatre experiences around the museum- unfortunately all run at exactly the same time so you can't do more than one at a time...it'd better if they scheduled these at staggered times.It was a really well done museum- some information in English, not all. "
Must go,"If you are planning on going to the border (DMZ, JSA etc) you should come here first. Also if you just want to brush up on your Korean history knowledgeThe entire museum is great, but especially the sections on the Korean War offer an easy, inspiring and educational overview of the war. There is no entrance fee!"
Great memorial,Amazing statues and museum. When I went there was a militar presentation which was so cool! Worth it!
One of the best military attractions,"Within easy walking distance from the Dragon Hill Lodge, this is a must see. Historic, well designed and maintained, it's a wonderful educational experience."
Worth a visit inside and outside ,"Great museum inside and out. As soon as I walked in I was offered a tour in English from one of the curators, which was excellent and focused on 1950-53. "
Touching Tribute ,"This is my first visit to a war museum and i am glad we included it in our itinerary. We went there at 4 pm and i was a little sad we missed the scheduled 2pm tour (the other time being 10am). But we were very happy that they arranged a special tour for us!! We appreciated the place more because of the tour guide. If you want to visit the place, pls attend the tour. It will be more meaningful that way. "
Impressive!,"There is much more here than just the statue. Impressive area with the monument, several sculptures, a USA plane, etc."
A moving memorial,"The Korean War separated numerous families, Korea is still recovering from this war and hoping for reunification. I didn't go in the museum, but did enjoy the memorial area with the sculptures as well as military equipment."
"If you only visit one palace, make it this one","Lovely palace, not especially expensive (more so if you're in traditional costume - free entry). Historical information provided all around the palace and grounds"
"Amazing, Perfect Museum on the Korean War","I was in South Korea in Seoul for the weekend i went to visit The War Memorial of Korea.The museum tells very well the history of the war of the South Korean and he is gigantic and extremely well documented.Many gifts are allowed to collect, authentic objects from different events.I made a private excursion in the DMZ: road invasions in North Korea, It was very short, I think it's too bad, I do not had them time to visit everything.I learned a lot about the history of their war, I loved how the museum was presented. I saw so much monuments, statues very pretty and War Machine it was amazing.. i saw so many cars and planes very cool, i found that awesome ! This is something you should not miss if you go to South Korea I would recommend it to anyone. I love South Korea ! Entrance is free for all ! :)"
Greay,This is a wonderful and very informative memorial I highly recommend it. Not to expensive located in town 
nice place and view,"After few days in Seoul and this place is final our my trip in Korea, though the weather is nice during I am here. Next time will stay longer to enjoy Korean food and wine.(Jinro)"
Impressive and interesting,"That the memories of the Korean War have not yet faded is clear by this monument and museum of almost North Korean dimensions. There is a large exhibition with numerous film clips about the recent war, but also about the wars ion the hundreds of years of previous history. Also the present state of the army is exhibited. The monuments show the gratitude of the South Korean people for the many countries of the UN that came to their aid without often even having an idea of whom they were helping. There was just this notion of injustice being inflicted on innocent people. Actually an example for the present day."
emotional visit,"since my grandfather participated in this war, it was an emotional moment for me. the overall ambiance is getting people to feel the history and the soul of the war. it's certainly worth to visit during your trip to Seoul."
Great reminder of the battles fought,The grounds are full of artifacts and open to the public. Great for an afternoon stroll even if you don't want to enter the museum.
A must see in Seoul. its free.,Amazing place near to a subway station. Free entrance. The place is really nice if you are interested in the korean war or if your country support south korea as Colombia did for example. You will be proud to see your flag but sad for the people who died there.
Great museum ,The museum is great especially the outside exhibition with all the ships aircraft tank and other military vehicles The inside is also well organised and with your smartphone you can enjoy explanations There are very interesting rooms. If you like history you definitely have to go there 
Must visit place,"It's must visit place if you are in Seoul, lot of things to see regarding war history of Korea. And best part is that it's free "
Korean War memorial,By visiting korean war memorial you can know the past of the koreans which is located just in front of American military base camp. 
Decent history lesson,I think it is more than just a War Memorial bec the various rooms do give a decent history of historical Korea
Great museum,"Worth spending an afternoon there. It is huge, so be prepared to walk. It's great for you to learn a bit about the Korean History. "
Educational,"Like most museums in Seoul, it's close to the subway and very reasonably priced. Lots of airplanes outside (accessible for free) including a B-52 (which was not used in the Korean War) if you're into that."
Very interesting,"This memorial has special meaning to US tourists I think, US lost lots of soldiers helping out here. Very well done, explained history well"
Very Worth my While!,"If you're a sucker for history like me and fascinated by weapons or warfare; then this place is Candy Land! everything was well organized, maintained, kept and complete. I could spend a whole day in this place and it will take a whole day off your itenerary if you want to see everything. it is just HUGE. and the bonus? It's absolutely FREE"
"Fascinating history, both military, political, and cultural","We went expecting to see some basic memorials, and was blown away by the breadth of this museum. The best no-admission-cost museum we have ever been in, and one of the best overall. Great for anyone looking to learn more about Korea. "
A must see. ,"If you are a history buff, this memorial traces Korea's military past, all the way through modern times. It is a huge facility so make plenty of time and bring comfortable shoes. "
Huge memorial/museum - very impressive,"This place is absolutely massive - both inside and out. Outside the huge forecourt with various statues is very impressive along with all the aircraft, boats, vehicles and artillery/missile pieces! There's even a USAF B52 there!Inside is absolutely huge, with impressive displays covering every single conflict Korea has been involved in over thousands of years."
Lovely Memorial,Great to walk around. Very respectful to the ones that lost their lives in battles. This Memorial is free and open to the public. 
One of the best war memorials I've been to.,"Well worth a visit if you have a couple of days in Seoul. The externals of the memorial are impressive with static displays, and tributes to all countries that played a part in the Korean war. The artifacts and internal displays are also very good. The overwhelming message of the memorial is one hopeful of peaceful re-unification with the North, which is a feeling you get speaking to most South Koreans."
Impressive outdoor display,"For those who want to see with your own eyes the history between North and South, the Korean War, this memorial is part of the war museum and it is very close to Itaewon. Easy access by public transport. Some prior reading of the Korean war would be helpful. "
Help me to understand Korean history and the Korean War,"We spent a whole day here. There is a coffee shop we can buy lunch. A very worthwhile visit. If you have time, join a DMZ tour to see the situation today."
A place to remember,"Take a visit to reminisce what happened during the times that South Korea went to war. In case you would like to shop some items, they have an available souvenir shop nearby."
Astounded,"Few of my favorite places in every destination are Parks. When my friend invited me to go to this place, i have no second thought to agree... well, being new to the place, I was curious about what the country was experience during the WWII. Well, I was so very proud to know that Philippines is part of the Korean War."
very thorough museum,"museum offers a thorough, engaging review of the many wars which have befallen Korea. We were particularly lucky and pleased that a young university student wanted to practice her English and gave us a guided tour through key parts of the exhibit (this seems to be an offer from the museum management so ask for this when you come in -- it seems they're offered in several languages). The exhibits are exceptionally well done and detailed, giving great context to So Korea's war history. "
Grand building with free admission!,"The public buildings in Seoul are on a grand scale. All the museums we have visited are impressive but because of the purpose of this building perhaps the grandest of them. We just missed the guided tour so decided to do it on our own. Which didn't strike us as a handicap.I agree with the review by 40girl, and therefore also highly recommended. The Korean War onwards I thought would be most interesting, but the history of Korea is extraordinary and extremely well presented using different media. Also provided with a free book on the Korean War in English, but numbers might be limited as there were many when we entered in the morning but got the last one when we left (2 hours later).Highly Recommended."
Interesting and sad place ,"We took the English guided tour to begin with. Our guide was very young & skipped over parts that he thought wouldn't be interesting for us (or him) which was fine with us. He told us some interesting stories & then left us to wander around at our own pace. It's a huge place & we loved wandering around taking in what interested us. The displays were really well done both inside & out & we are really glad we visited. Was really valuable especially as we visited the DMZ a couple of days later. Allow a good few hours to really see everything, we stopped for a coffee in the cafe halfway through. A highlight of our week in Seoul. "
Afternoon well spent,"Made you understand Freedom is not Free. Well laid out, very informative, very enjoyable. Outside displays of airplanes, tanks, missiles and different calibre guns was something special."
Must visit for anyone interested in history,"The War Memorial of Korea is a fantastic site in Seoul and probably one of the best military museums in the world. There are basically 2 distinct areas to the monument - inside and outside. The outside consists of many different pieces of military equipment used by both sides during the Korean War (Tanks, planes, artillery and a boat). This is all really cool and in great condition. You can really interact with some of these vehicles (e.g. Sit in the drivers seat of and armored personnel carrier, walk around the boat, etc.). There's also several statues to commemorate the war and monuments explaining the involvement and contribution of the various nations who fought with the UN against the North Koreans.The inside is an excellent museum which covers the Korean War as well as various conflicts beginning as far back as the ancient Korean kingdoms through the Japanese colonial period. Lots of cool artifacts, models and multimedia here. There's no entrance fee, which was also nice.Overall, it's a great attraction which gives a comprehensive background on the military/political history of Korea through the end of the Korean War."
Excellent museum ,Well layed out. Interesting. Lots of audio visual exhibits. Outdoor section great for kids to see real planes and tanks. 
Visited to get an overview of Korean war,In short ~ outstanding ~ highly recommend. Covers war Plus history and has best selection of planes from war and all the rest including memorial to brave souls whom scarified their lives so Korea is peaceful today
War Memorial of Korea,Awesome museum. Very nice collection of artifacts from many centuries of war and conflict in the region. 
The exhibits on the Korean War were the best,"Enjoyed our visit here. If you have limited time, skip the lower level exhibits on earlier Korean military conflicts, they are a little dry. The experience in the Korean war section was much better."
Loved it & FREE admission!,"Totally cool place to take your sons on a history tour of tanks, aircrafts, war ships! They have the famous Korean turtle ships! More of a father & son place to visit, while the ladies go off to get our hair done or go shopping. This place is free, so why not!"
Absolutely worth a visit,"The exhibit and grounds are extensive. While I thought the displays would concentrate on the Korean War, I walked away with a much better understanding of the length of Korea's history and culture and how resilient the Korean's are, having resisted countless attempts to occupy the strategic peninsula. Could spend hours here."
A Museum where the History of South Korea Comes to Life,"If you want to learn about the South Korea history and wars, this War Museum and Memorial is superb and impressive. The artifacts are detailed and comprehensive. The infrastructure and design of the museum are fantastic. My son and I spent the whole day awed by the exacting details of the museum. The clever use of the multi-media provided a very humanistic experience to the museum. I was most impressed to know that the whole of third floor was dedicated to the UN and allied forces who fought in Korea Wars. I would strongly recommend this war museum - a Must Visit place if you want to know about South Korea History."
Eductional,"The Memorial is in front of the Korean War Museum and a static display of vehicles, planes, tanks and even a boat. The museum provides in-depth information and displays about the Korea War. A must see for anyone visiting Seoul. "
a solemn experience,"I didn't realize that the museum has displays for the entire history of the Korean Peninsula. I spent 4 or so hours wandering the halls. It's a solemn experience. But it's also a must see to anyone visiting Seoul. The exterior displays are military hardware from the last 75 years. Planes, boats, tanks. Most are available for touch. I'm happy I had a chance to visit. I recommend to anyone interested in korean history. "
Amazing museum,Very nice museum.New and clean Beautiful marble. Lotst of resting places with coffee or snack.I loved it.
One of the BEST museum in Seoul,"The Admission: FREE AdmissionThe Museum: Korea's only museum that exhibits the entire history of the Korean war, housing 9,000 items of information and material related to the war. Very informative and educational. Definitely my favorite museum in Seoul. There is a 3D theater right next to where they display all the war flights, tanks, etc. It is on a small ship. It is free of charge as well. The Location: Subway Line 4 or 6, Samgakji Station, Exit 1 or 12."
"Planes, Tanks and more","If you are a history buff, or you are just interested in planes, tanks and other military equipment, this is the place for you. They have an outdoor area featuring real planes and tanks and even a ship. Inside the museum there are lots of interesting things to look at and free tours. "
Good museum ,"Well worth a visit , is military based but also reflective.Aircraft from the 50s/ 60s , if you want to see a B52 they have one!Inside calm & quiet and tasteful , good cafe .As always in Korea spotless & polite."
Atlas exposure,"Spend half a day, free, full of details, to learn a lesson of Korean history. Images and videos depicting the develop of the modern state of Korea, all the wars that surround it and the objects that mimic the environment that finally turn into this modern state. They show the power, in a poetic way, that the war with N. Korea didn't let the unification of the ideals of globalization and modernism that defines S. Korea."
"Free Guided English tour resulted in moving, memorable experience","Initially we were planning on doing this museum on our own without a guide but our hotel concierge alerted us to availability of occasional scheduled free English language guided tours so we timed our visit to coincide with this afternoon tour.. But first we visited on our own the somewhat nearby Contemporary History Museum which was a valuable preface to the memorial tour, which ably illustrated how far free Korea has come, from colonial oppression to an underdeveloped impoverished and corrupt third world country to now a leading industrial democratic nation and which is why winning the Korean War was so important in world history. The guided tour, with many interactive exhibits, was led, and I was told they are usually led, by retired Korean war army officers, adding to the sense of a living historical experience."
quite interesting to see the old war vessels and such.,"nice Sunday thing to do. It's free so why not? Though I feel like some parts of the exhibition kind of glorifies war to an extent, it is still a nice visit. "
Beautiful park,History and relics. A very nice tribute to the vets and fallen during the Korean War. A moivng and inspiring tribute.
The War memorial of KOREA,"Visited earlier this by bunking off from a Medical Exhibition.... did not regret it, I added another "" Buff "" to my collection..... I did not have the time to do a full Tour.... I left the meter running on the Taxi... because I did not know where I was.... will revist. According to Chris the inside is very much worthwhile.."
Must visit,This should be a priority on your itinerary during your visit in Seoul. We spent over 3 hours and we learned a great deal about the history of Korea. The information throughout is explained very well and illustrated clealry through diagrams and interactive resources. 
Amazing experience,"It's more of a museum than memorial. We missed the English tour, so they apologized and sent over another english speaking tour guide, a kid from stanford doing his military service. Learned so much from his enthusiastic tour. Definitely would recommend. "
Very informative,"Lots of walking very informative super static displays. Tanks, cars, planes, wepons, and boats. Many films large place and surprisingly it's free. A must see."
Amazing place and free to visit ! ,"So much to see in a day ! We visited this amazing place with family and learned so much about the country at the same time. There are a number of planes, tanks, helicopters and a small frigate along with missiles all outside the museum all with good description in English.Once inside the main building a whole history of Korea opens up and by the time you leave you have an insight into this wonderful country. An in depth understanding of the Korean War is a focal point and the memorials outside to all the country's who went to Koreas aid is interesting in its own merit.I found the work done after the war quite interesting and shows how the country changed over the years and why Korea is as advanced as it is now.I would certainly recommend a whole day at this attraction there is so much to see  "
"Free, reserve a time for the children's museum","This is a nice indoor and outdoor museum. I enjoyed the aircraft static displays. If you want to see the Children's museum, they had a reservation system on the Saturday we went to control the number of children admitted at a time. We only had to wait 20 minutes for the next window of time to open. It took less than an hour to complete the children's portion. We only went through two indoor exhibits and it is a very well done memorial. Highly recommend visiting while in Seoul."
Free for service members,"An amazing museum with too much to see in one day, but not to worry if you are military because addition is free for you and dependents, so split it up for different weekends."
Deeper Appreciation,A must visit. My grandpa was in the Korean War so it I really wanted to get pictures to send home to him. I'll never regret this and I have a deeper appreciation for Korean War vets.
Awesome summary of Korea,"Although the name suggests a focus on war, the whole exhibition is closer to a step by step of Korean history on the peninsula. Roughly three hours to do the walk through, and then a pleasant stroll around the tanks and aircrafts and ship replicas(commemoration of recent naval incident with North Korea). Tragic pieces of history, but quite romantic at the same time. Remember to be respectful on the compound."
Much more interesting than expected,"My wife, 12 year old son and I really enjoyed this museum. It covers a lot more than the Korean War and the building is quite impressive. "
"Large museum in Seoul city center, free entry.","Interesting museum to visit. Depends on what interests you have, I was mainly interested in military aviation. The museum is in three floors and on each floor there are several exhibition rooms. Many exhibits are explained in English language and there are film presentations on some topics, but these I missed, they all started on the hour. Provides insight to the Korean War and plenty of US material. Outside there is a display of various military aircraft used in Korea. The largest is the B-52 bomber, then there is the Phantom, MIG-19, AN2, small Cessnas etc. You can climb steps to see into the aircraft cockpit on most aircraft on display, including the B-52. I suggest you reserve 1,5 to 2 hours to go through everything at a reasonably quick pace."
A place where you will be transported to the past ,"As this review's title suggests, that's exactly how I felt. A wonderful guide, a uncle who is 72 years old, guided me throughout the museum. It was only suppose to be an hour, but he extended it to about 2 hours. It was great for me as I love history. And I'm very thankful for Mr Sohn Jong Hee's guide when I visited. Pre-history on Korea, Korean War, countries that dispatched resources to South Korea during the War etc. All these helped me understand Korea as a whole better. "
Must to visit,"Its most important historical place, you must visit there, free to enter. There are 4 floors. Really big museum"
A poignant and tasteful memorial,"My mother in law list her first husband to this war so this visit ad personal connections. Very tastefully and simply done. We were able to find the name we were looking for immediately. The recognition of foreign soldiers respectful.. Very moving. Further along is a giant display of military equipment, rather scary and hard to understand. A few minutes walk from the metro. Husband and I were moved and felt like we have visited the grave of a lost family member."
Not only War memorial but also concise abstract of Korean history,"Car parking was convenient and walking aroung the memorial was pleasant because the memorial was spacious still well organized. Outside of memorial building you can find the battle ships, air planes, tanks, and missiles. Also you can find the list of names from all of the world who sacrificed their lives for the peace and freedom of Korea. You'd better to wear comfortable shoes because you have to walk a lot to fully explore the memorial. In side of building, you can learn Korean history and watch the 4 D movie. This is place for all people but good for the family with young Kids."
Well worth the visit!,"This is not just about the ""last"" Korean War. It's about all of them.The museum reflects all Korea involved wars. Exterior to the museum are the armaments of war..airplanes, boats, ground transport etc.The square at the front of the museum has individual monuments and flags for all countries that participated in the last Korean War including individual regiments, number of participants and losses.The museum itself is very educational, beautifully laid out and well displayed.Though there is no entry fee, there are areas where donations can be made."
Important history!,"Visiting the war memorial of Korea is a great oppotunity to learn all about the history of Korea, the well known war and it's results on the present. Very interesting and informative."
Very interesting day ! ,I've been here with my girlfriend Minjung and she told me how is important for the Korean this place.
A must see in Seoul,I have visited the War Memorial of Korea on many occasions and always been impressed with the displays here. As a New Zealander i love the way South Korea acknowledges and appreciates the help many other countries gave during the war. A tribute that is worth visiting. A very moving experience.
Good place to visit for learning about Korean war,Good place to visit as an sightseeing. Many information for the Korean war and related real weapons and stories....
Awesome look into the history and culture of Korea,"I visited the War Memorial on a number of occasions and came away moved and impressed every time. I took students there on field trips three different times and visited with friends several other times, and I can assure you there is something for everyone. This should definitely be on your list of things to see in Seoul. Give yourself plenty of time because you'll want to be able to absorb the information and the emotional impact. A definite must see."
Tribune to the Heroic Soldiers that Defended Our Way of Life,"The War Memorial of Korea pays tribute to all the soldiers of all the nations that united in conflicts across the globe.Very hands on where you can look in the window of a real B52 Bomber, walk the decks of an ill fated Navy Frigate or feel and touch the artillery and weapons of past conflicts.Easy for kids and well catered for families. Food, drink and rest facilities.Time in right and you can see some amazing performances, depending on the holiday."
"A ""Must-See"" experience","The museum was one of the highlights of our trip. It was a bonus that there were no entrance fees. Be prepared to spend at least a few hours here as it is massive! The majority of the museum is indoors but there is also an outstanding outdoor section where you can explore the various military aircrafts/ships/tanks (and can go inside most of them too!) The majority of displays, including the videos, have English translations. There is so much history within the building and really worth visiting. The videos are also a must to watch! One tip: I wouldn't recommend the 4D video experience if you get nauseous easily as is quite full-on with lots of flashing lights and spinning experiences on the screen."
Very Interesting Museum...if a bit one sided,"Overall, the museum does a great job of explaining the history of the war. The exhibits are well labeled and detailed. I also appreciated the section dedicated to UN forces who fought to save the South from a Communist takeover. "
Get a good night rest and be prepared to spend 6-8 hours here.,This place requires a whole day commitment to get everything out of it. It's a massive 3 story museum and each floor is sprawling taking you through the entirety of the Korean War up to and beyond the ceasefire. Just the fact that this museum talks about one topic really gives you a really good understanding of what happened.
Fascinating insights,"I did nt know much about the Korean War. This museum both enlightened me about it - but also explained some of the way Korea had been created before then (battles with Japan, China and Mongol). It has made me look at Seoul differently since going there."
Beautiful museum.,We really enjoyed visiting this museum. They have many wonderful displays and it was very easy to walk through to see everything.
Very educational and inspiring,One of the best things to do in Seoul and cost nothing. Very educational and enlightening on the Korean Conflict.
"War Museum in Seoul, Korea","I visited the War Museum, in Seoul, Korea, and I would highly recommend any tourist that is traveling to South Korea this spring, to include the War Museum, in Seoul, as one of your highlight sites to visit. I went in the month of May, and it was absolutely beautiful! With their weather warming up in the month of May, and all the beautiful flowers in bloom, it was spectacular! You are able to walk around the outside gardens and water ponds, and tour the old war planes, and the battleship, and the submarine, in the out doors, and then go into the inside of the war museum, and learn alot about the history behind the Korean War. Take time to visit the simulator,and feel first hand, what it may have felt like to have been there. The temperatures in South Korea can be very cold during the winter months, and very hot during the summer months. However if you take a trip there during the springtime, or during the autumn months, you can really take advantage of the beautiful outdoor sites and wonderful weather, while enjoying the culture, and learning about the history, of one of the most beautiful cities in the world!!!"
War memorial of Korea,"Very nice place, must visit and do it for full day. Best part is it is free. English speaking guide are available."
One of the best War Memorials I have visited!,"I thoroughly enjoyed visiting his war memorial. My son was only 5 and we walked around the venue quite well. It was a very well set out memorial. The displays of planes, ships and tanks were incredible and I had not seen it anywhere else in the world."
Excellent Memorial!,"This museum is a must see to learn about the history of Korea. Beautiful museum and memorial and nice display of airplanes, tanks and equipment outside with a children's play area for the little ones. Very nice."
A CHILLING REMINDER OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF WAR,"I spent 3 hours walking around The War Memorial, and quite honestly I left this place with deep sadness, and mystified that our world is being continually decimated, in the name of WAR. Why do so many people have to suffer and die, at the hands of DICTATORS. "
Massive War Museum,"This place has it all. Covering the early paleolithic days of Korea right up to the modern day, there is nothing about Korean civilization and its various wars that is overlooked. Inside, you'll find all the expected exhibits with uniforms, guns, maps, recreations, etc. Outside though, there is a massive array of planes, tanks, missiles, and even ships. Be sure to seek shelter under the B-52 for a spell if the Seoul summer heat becomes too much. The statues and parade ground are a nice touch as well. Overall, this is a must-see if you want to get a general grasp of Korea at war."
"Great displays for ""almost reliving"" the war :)","To give ""priority"" once you get inside this vast building are the three rooms of the Korean War on the second & third floors (to put in perspective, the ""entire display area"" of each of the Hiroshima & Nagasaki A-bomb museums I'm quite sure can ""almost"" be fit into just one of the three rooms upstairs here!) where you'll learn or actually ""almost relive"" the Korean War among impressive displays of ""quite-realistic looking"" wax sculptures (especially liked how those 3-D displays kind of ""blend in"" with the big background scenes behind them; you might have a hard time looking at your own pics later to tell which of the images are sculptures & which are part of the background scene!) such as those of: soldiers crossing the 38th Parallel, General Douglas MacArthur at a table with the first South Korean President, a soldier raising the South Korean flag in front of their Capitol building, children learning at a make-shift school outdoors and some reconstruction being done by civilians & soldiers with a background scene of the devastated city - all of which in my opinion are really well-thought-out displays that portray some of the important aspects & moments of the war ""as vividly as possible"". And to top off your ""almost reliving"" experience of the war, be sure to catch the 4-D show in one of the two rooms (either the Room I or the Room II) on the second floor - an ""absolutely outstanding"" (though only for about 10 minutes) documentary of the famous Incheon Landing (that decisively turned the tide of the war) with the great opening line ""I am General Douglas MacArthur, and I will bring hammer upon anvil"", and yes I can guarantee an ""up-close experience"" of sights & sounds of that landing as you can naturally expect from a 4-D show (the sounds of bombardment & such will be ""loud""!).The first floor though, if you're ""pressed for time"" (they close at 6 pm) after the great rooms upstairs, is where you can kind of ""walk through"" since there's not much to learn at the General War History room (with like prototype soldier & equipment displays of some Western nations as well but no theme of a ""particular war"" as the rooms upstairs), and there's the ""dark room"" for memorial purposes which is just meant to kind of pay respect & pass through; and for some ""ancient history"", there's the big ""time line"" of Korea all the way from like AD 100, the big painting of a battle scene of a pre-Joseon time which is actually lit up on & off for different parts of the painting (my favorite display on the entire first floor) and a replica of the famed Admiral Yi Sun Shin's turtle boat (a ""smaller replica"", I'm sure though, than the actual turtle boat).And outside the building, be sure to get to the right side of the grounds (the right side as you're facing the building or equivalently to your left after coming out of the building) where there are ""quite a number"" of military vehicles for land, sea & air (some tanks with ""really long"" cannons that I noticed); for the sea specifically though is only one big boat but it can be gone up on board where there's a 5-minute documentary of a naval incident that actually took place not too long ago (shown in 4-D just like the Incheon Landing documentary inside the building as mentioned above). And apart from those military vehicles, there are two big sets of sculptures (I believe one set represents the South & the other represents the North) with a tall monument between them on one end of the grounds (right by the street actually) straight from the building entrance on the other end and a two-brothers statue on like a lagoon (maybe supposedly a ""hill"", can be entered but nothing much inside) on the left side of the grounds (the left side as you're facing the building or equivalently to your right after coming out of the building) which is the opposite side of the grounds from the military vehicles. Also just outside the building entrance on each side are big plates with names of soldiers who died in the war (similar to the ""big wall"" at the U.N. Cemetery in Busan although the names here are on individual plates and not on a wall).Coming by subway, Samgakji Station (on Lines 4 & 6) is where to get off followed by just about a 5-minute walk and you'll be at the two-brothers statue; just do keep in mind it takes about 4 hours in total for both inside & outside and the 6 pm closing time, and I do suggest (as mentioned above) to start with the three rooms of the Korean War on the second & third floors; the outside can be done even after the closing time actually except maybe for going up the boat."
Spent a day here!,Spent over 7 hours wandering around looking at the vast arrangement of military equipment and reading all the information inside. Well worth spending the day trudging around in snow outside. This is a must see attraction. Free entry. 
interesting,"we joined a tour in english, and it was very interesting to learn about the war of the two koreas. it adds content to the trip."
"Leave plenty of time, there is lots to see",This one of the best memorials I have been to. Not everything in in English but more than enough to keep you busy for hours. Even some of the videos had a button so you could play them in English. I had 1.5 hours here and only managed to see the first floor. Didn't even get to see the lines of tanks/guns outside. I will have to return. The building and grounds will also need a bit of time. All this and it is free.
A place for picnic,Respect to the fallen heroes and heroines. The rows and rows of fallen heroes and heroines is quite a scene. Nice place for picnic. 
Great Museum--Free,Very informative museum with great displays of Korean wars from the past. It's free--who can ask for more than that?! Three floors x2. Most everything in English as well as Korean.
Well worth visiting,"Three floors of history, taking in the whole military history of Korea. Start on the ground floor left side and then follow the arrows. Great artifacts and the videos are worth watching ( you can select language). Korea was a country beset with wars of aggression against her culminating in the utter destruction of the Korean War, which makes her current (rightful) place at the top table all the more worthy of respect and admiration. "
Beautiful and Educational,"A well crafted and laid out museum, the War Memorial gives a thorough look at the young and violent history of Korea. Tons of stories and artifacts. Definitely a full day."
A must for military history enthusiasts,"A wonderful collection, from Korea's ancient history, regional struggles, the Korean War, to modern day. There is a fantastic replica of a Turtle Ship on the bottom floor, and a touching UN Memorial.You can really see how appreciative Korea is of the assistance received by UN forces during the Korean War. The outdoor installations including a B-52, a Mig, various tanks, helos and artillery. There was also a cute family of stray cats living in one of the planes.I spent hours here, alone, totally absorbed, and left with a greater appreciation and understanding, and some tears in my eyes.The only improvement needed is to the gift shop. Some good books in English on Korea's military history would be welcome!"
Great museum - learnt a lot,"I knew very little about the Korean war, but this museum tells you all you need to know. I was welcomed with an offer of a free English guide, very friendly. Museum is well made, text and animations, all in 2 languages."
Stop here for a bit of Korean War history.,"The War Memorial of Korea is located not too far from the Itaewon neighborhood of Seoul -- which is known as an international area as it is close to various embassies and US Army Garrison Yongsan. The memorial is very interesting, and you can spend as much or little time as you like here, taking it all in. Recommended for any balanced tour of Seoul and South Korea."
"The War Museum of Korea: A melange of a memorial, history lessons and video games centre",Large and well worth visiting and provide substantial information on wars which have plagued Korea since the earliest recorded times. It would be better named as a Museum than a Memorial.I guess exhibits such as the Incheon Landing 4D ride are worthwhile for engaging teenagers but more emphasis should be on helping people to reflect what has caused war in the past and how to avoid future wars.
A thing to do,"If you have some time you must go in the War memorial, is very far from European history (I'm italian) but for me has been very intersting.Is a big place to visit so take your time."
Great place to visit!,It was really incredible all the stuffs about the korean war history that was exposed in this museum!
History,"When visiting other countries, its best to learn its history and local culture and this place is one if your in South Korea."
Learned more about the korean wars,"We took about 2.5 hours at this musuem. Went for the free English guided tour and our guide was very sweet and gave good commentary. Do join the tour if you can. There was also an outdoor area where you can see ships, planes and tanks used in the wars. Worth a visit! "
Free and educational museum for those interested in Korean history and culture,I went in solo and I learned a lot. I would suggest everyone who visits Korea to come and check the place out. It talks about wars with Japan and the most recent war. Great place to visit with friends and to take pictures. This place is well worth the time spent walking around.
Great place to learn about the Korean War,"When I visited this place, I thought this is going to be any other museum and then this turned out to be one of the most amazing museum. This museum gave insights into the Korean War and also details regarding other nationalities involved in this war. Almost spent 4 hours at this place"
A must see for any visitor to Seoul,"Large museum which spans the Korean history, but with great focus on the most recent UN War with the North. Outside has some great aircraft including a B52. Put aside the entire day, or go more than once. Oh, and its FREE."
For war and history buffs: you'll enjoy this place!! :D,"Believe me, I've been to a LOT of war memorials, and I've had my share of days in museums. But going here was different. I should have planned to go there for two whole days, instead of just half a day. I learnt much about Korea's troublous history, and appreciated how things go in our present time.. For war and history people like me, don't forget to miss this place when you come to South Korea!"
"Free, in-depth museum","This museum is bigger than I expected! I only thought there would be exhibits covering a fairly recent time period, but the bottom floor of the museum goes back much further in time. There are 3 floors inside, and a variety of monuments and replicas outside. Definitely worth a visit, especially as it is free. Some of the rooms can be a bit repetitive. Overall, the museum is well designed and makes quite good use of technology (many 3D and 4D screenings!), so I think there will be something to capture everyone's attention. "
Seoulmate,Am so amazed with the different war memorabilia displays and other equipments used during the Korean war. 
Could be better...,"From Samgakji Station, we passed the Clock Tower of Peace and The Statue of Brothers at the West Gate. These are poignant reminders for visitors that peace must not be taken for granted. The memorial did a good job to present historical accounts in a chronological order without overwhelming details. The outdoor exhibition area is interesting but I was disappointed to see the replica of the PKM-class Chamsuri Warship. I expected the actual vessel.One major improvement badly needed is to put English translation of the Korean text. I understand the challenge as there are strong demand for Chinese and Japanese as well. Another aspect to consider is to tone down the rhetoric - maybe gradually with time. Some European museums have also exhibited atrocities committed by their own soldiers during colonial period.German museums and memorials displayed balanced presentations in explaining events leading to the world wars and reunification of Germany. This Memorial has a lot of potential and can start by toning down the rhetorics.Nevertheless, it is a good place to spend 2-3 hours to gain an understanding of the unfortunate geographical position of the Koreans."
Great education!,"After 20 year overseas marriage with a Korean finally visited probably the most important site in Korea. The amount, quality and coverage of information superb! Wish we'd visited 20 years ago..."
A typical Memorial,A typical Memorial. A museum is close to it. Easy access via Subway or Bus. Not a must see but good place to go if nothing to do.
Best Museum to visit in Seoul ,"This was a great place to learn about the conflict that has been a part of this country for thousands of years. It does present a very biased view of conflict, something you would not see in other museums of this type, but a good insight into the national identity of South Korea."
War history venue,"A place to go if one wishes to understand the context and detailed information on the Korea War, known to the South Korea as ""6.25 War"" as the North Korea launched the first assault on 25th of Jun. Fantastic exhibits with several 4D experiential theater shows. Besides the Korean War, there is also another exhibition hall that display the origin of Korean dynasties and history, dating back to the prehistoric era. One will get a good overview of historic Korea such as the ""3 Kingdom period"", Goguryeo, Joseon dynasties, as well as the 36 years of Japanese occupation. A must see exhibit for history buffs."
a Must See,"Unbelievable place. The information, art, coffee shop, and outside statues are all amazing. It tells the story of the Korean War through the eyes of the people involved, including almost the whole world. We had planned on half a day, but ended up a whole day there and still felt we missed some of the exhibits. If in Seoul this has to be part of your visit nad be sure to leave enough time. "
Great Museum ,Museum was free of charge. Easy to find and was very tech savvy. There were informational screens and movie rooms in multiple languages. This was a interesting visit filled with slot of history. 
Good museum to reflect on wars in Korea,"Visited the museum, quite impressed with the information and details provided on wars in Korea. I learned more and understood the Korean War now. Many good exhibits and video presentations too"
A glimpse of Korean past,A well documented war history. Highly recommended. Please allot at least 2 hours to explore the place. 
Impressive statues! ,"If you have some spare time this place is well worth visiting! Amazing statues plus a free outdoor museum with tanks, helicopters and fighterjets! "
Interesting,We think it is very interesting to visit the museum inside. Much written and graphic info well prepared.We missed some extra exhibitions that were outdoors previous times we went there. So before going it is useful to check in case you can see them.
A must see!!!,"This fee-free museum is a must see for anyone visiting this beautiful country. While much of the museum concentrates on the Korean War, there are other venues which looks at various other conflicts with particular emphasis on the Korean peninsula. Everything is in immaculate condition and the employees are very courteous. Please plan on spending at least two hours for the full experience."
Worth to go,"This place is actually quite big, we spend approximately 2 hrs there. It's a very good place to learn more about the olden Korea, how Korea has became so successful thought wars. Very big and nice in the inside, lots of mannequin and historical stuff. "
The War Memorial of Korea (전쟁기념관),"We read that this is a very good Museum so we traveled quite a bit to Itaewon to visit it. It is grand just from the outside; very large premises with some old/smaller planes, ships and military crafts displayed!. Not replicas but war-weary ones. Just outside the Museum proper is a large podium to commerate and paying tribute to the 20 plus Nations whom has fought alongside S Korea in the 1950s Korean Way. Flags flew high and it can emotional charging when one moves round to read all the inscriptions, sad stories…It “immortalized” the military history of modern Korea. The memorial building has six indoor exhibition rooms; Memorial Hall, War History, Korean War, Expeditionary Forces Room, ROK Armed Forces Room etc. Displayed are various weapons and equipment from prehistoric times to the modern period as well as paintings of battlefields and sculptures of notable warriors. It is a Memorial to all wars experienced by Korea, including the Vietnam War and Japanese occupation.What a visual treat for a War Museum like this!It was an amazing experience and we were not disappointed having spent close to 3 hours. And we have not covered everything!! This museum definitely worth a visit. It is free entry too."
A must visit in Seoul,"I made last minute decision to drop by this highly rated destination. Since I missed the English guide session, a high school volunteer, Sally took me for a tour. Learned the history of Korea and understood why South Korea continue to defend the country.. I feel the pain of the Koreans both north and south and hope one day the history will change. .... may be tough. You could take a walk around the building. 2-3 hours visit will be sufficient. "
Quite unexpected,"The memorial is a must visit. A showcase of Korean history of battles and war. Ranging from Shilla, Goryeo, Joseon and down right to the Korean warVery valuable lessons can be learn. "
A look back in time ,Great place to visit and learn about the Korean War. Very interesting and educational. The museum is very large and will take some time to get through it. Worth checking out
Excellent Memorial/Museum,"The Korean War Memorial is part memorial and part museum of the conflicts in Korea up to and including the sinking of the Cheonan and the current homegrown defence industry exhibits. There are a variety of videos and interactive exhibits to see while you are there. The exhibits of former military vehicles, armour, artillery and aircraft outside of the main building are well maintained and well signed. All in all well worth the visit."
Very informative peek into Korean History,It was a great visit. We spent about 2 hours. There is a short animation movie about the army/ navy which has regular shows. The museum is also very informative.
Must see. On par with Marine Corps Museum in Quantico.,"Ample english placards, very friendly staff. The planes, tanks, and weapons systems on display are impressive and fun for all ages to get up close to. The war history covered inside is incredibly well displayed in multiple mediums. This is a good experience for non-military, military, and children mature enough for seeing realities of war. "
Expected more,"It was ok, but I have seen better memorials. This one seemed lacking and was mediocre. I guess it is worth seeing if you haven't but don't have high expectations. "
Special Places in my 10 year stay in the Republic of South Korea.,Great re-visit of the Forgotten War....tells the story with excellent displays. Flows well and Historically is quite accurate.
Educative,The museum has been established well. A good 2-3 hours is required to have a look around. Gives a good insight into the dispute existing within the North and South.
In memory ,A nice place to go to remember those who fell and fought in the Korean War. Everything is immaculate. There are restored planes and tanks - any young fan of planes would love this (you can go right up to the cockpit and look in). Beautiful statue - everything beautifully pays respect to the war. A must see! 
An excellent museum,"The museum takes you through the history of Korean wars, all the way from the three kingdoms period until the Korean War. The exhibits are varied and plentiful and the signs are in both English and Korean. The videos dotted around the museum are also available in English, Korean, Chinese and Japanese. In the grounds of the museum there also many replicas of planes and tanks, and a replica warship you can explore. I would highly recommend the War Memorial for any history enthusiasts, or those curious about the Korean War."
Nostalgic!,great experience to know Korea's history. The whole museum is impressive! It's worth visiting. I got lost when I went there thru Namyeong Station so I suggest to use Line 6 Samgakji Stn. exit 1. It's very near and easy to locate. Just a 5 minute wwalk from the exit.
Great museum for families and history buffs,"I have been to the War memorial or what should be called the Korean War Museum multiple times. It has great exhibits, especially the planes and tanks out front. Most of the signage is in English and Korean so self guided is no issue. It is close to metro and bus stops, so also easy to get there. Highly informative with excellent exhibits."
"Interesting, very comprehensive museum, with nationalist overtones","This museum is certainly a very interesting place to visit for those interested in military history. It basically covers all the military conflicts Korea's been involved in (with a big part of the museum dedicated to the 1950-1953 war) in a lot of detail. There is a nationalist overtone to the museum, though, that I personally found a bit surprising."
Let's not forget!,"An important chronological display of the Korean War and all the wars prior in thousands of years of history.An impressive display of artilaries, planes, tanks and warship of different era.Very well designed building in both interior and exterior. Even got a kids playground.Easily to spend 2-3 hours there. Accessible by subway.Best of all, the price is right. "" free ""."
Very impressive museum,"This museum is very well done with great interactive displays that rival the World War I museum in Kansas City that is also a top class facility. They do not just focus on the Korean War, but cover everything from the earliest conquests of the mongols until activity with the currently on ongoing operations.We brought kids ages 6 and 9 and they were interested throughout. They really enjoyed looking into the aircraft and military vehicles outside the museum as well. There were a few 4D movies that the kids enjoyed as well. Best part about it is that it is free. No charge anywhere, which makes the overall display even more impressive. If you have limited time in Seoul, I would recommend this location be on your list."
Awesome place for some History,"I supposed a lot of tourists visit South Korea because of interest and influence from K-Pop. This is 1 place with free Entrance us tourists to find out more about their history, on top of just K-Pop.I've been to South Korea many times but have never visited this attraction.After my visit, I regretted not going earlier and I will visit again my next trip.The Museum provides free Guided Tour in English. Not too sure about other languages as we happened to chance upon the Guided Tour timing.There's 3 levels in the Museum and the Guided Tour is only for Level 1. It took more then 2 hours for the tour to end as it's very informative.There's also outdoor exhibits...If you are a Museum Go-er, half a day may not be sufficient if you were to take your time to go thru everything."
"Nice, but no book shop.","Good museum. A lot of the text was translated to English. I was offered a student docent. He was not a history student, and did not know much. He thought for instance that there had only been two battles for Seoul. But it was interesting to talk to him to get a sense of what young Koreans know and what they don't know.The museums does a great job remembering the UN forces. It had the names of the three Norwegians who died, for instance.But I was disappointed that there was no Museum shop there. Would have expected a book shop, at least."
Great Opportunity to Learn and Enjoy Korea's History,"I'll be honest, I didn't want to visit another museum. I've been to plenty in my life, but this was one of the most memorable ones for me. My husband and I were in Korea for a few days in October and we walked here from our hotel one afternoon. We spent a good couple of hours walking around. It's free too! I learned so much about the Korean war. It was nice doing this before my husband and I did our DMZ/JSA tour. My favorite exhibit was actually outside the building. It was a depiction of a real life incident of two brothers in the Korean War where they were on opposite sides and reunited in combat. The crack is the separation of the north and south. It symbolizes the Korean wish for reunification. Basically, I would highly recommend walking around this museum. It's very well done without glorifying war and honors those who have fought."
Great war memorial - learnt a lot,We decided to visit the Korean War Memorial after taking a day trip to the DMZ.It was a good lesson particularly on the Korean War.The outdoor exhibition of military equipment was also very interesting.We spent about 2 hours in the museum - and could have easily spent another hour there if we were not rushing off to another place.
Wonderful balance of respect and weaponry ,"Wonderful balance of respect and weaponry. Sit under the wings of a B52, and see every piece of military hardware used in conflicts to keep the peace and make peace! Respect for those who have given their lives for the country are beautifully presented in wonderful sculptures. "
Good visit for history lovers,"I recommend this place for any visitors who wants to learn more about the Korean war.There are English tour guides but they start at 2pm, but it can be visited without a tour guide as everything is written in English."
Not Just the Big One,"FREE ENTRY! The museum is mainly focused on the Korean War. It also had exhibits for Pre-Korean War, and what the current Korean Military is doing and how they have contributed manpower to UN missions.IF YOU GO: Bring your passport. They have an audio guide for rent. From what I could tell it was about $3USD. I didn't have my passport with me, so I couldn't get it."
Awesome Museum,This museum is really great. It is huge. We really enjoyed the way it was broken up into different sections in regards to time of the war. It was very informative and interesting. Highly recommend a visit here. 
The attractions outside the museum make it worth going,"Came here on a monday when it was closed, however the museum was still good. The statues were outside, and all the tanks, cars and planes were outside so you can still have a good time"
"Expansive and Informative if You Are ""Into"" It","This place is huge. Well done sculptures of soldiers outside. Many, many tanks, missiles, planes, etc on display outside. Inside lots of munitions and Kim Il Sung's limo! Some very nicely done dioramas of the Viet Nam war inside. There is a lot to see. When we were there first week of October 2016 we were the all alone. Entry is free."
Must visit Museum - Freedom is not free,"A must visit museum in SeoulSamgakji station line 6 exit 12( exit from the train and walk straight, you will see a sign showing direction to Museum Wedding hall and just walk straight. You will see the The Statue of Brothers(Monument).Outdoor and Indoor museum. A 3 story museum(if i don't recall wrongly) need about 3-4hours(to slowly read and watch the short clips). There is theater on short movie about 20 mins. Outdoor exhibition is the airplanes, tanks used in past wars including the Chamsuri ship PKM-35. Amazing place to see and read on the experience and memories of the past wars.A place to remind us that FREEDOM is not FREE"
Very touching ,"This is a must see if you are in Seoul. It's not something I would normally go to but honestly it is so well put together it's worth every minute. It's free but of course you can make a donation. It honours not just the Koreans lost in the war but also the thousands of Americans and mentions every European by name. Very modern and interactive, I thought half an hour would cover it and an hour and a half later we left reluctantly. Very easy to get around so good for young and old alike"
Super History Complex,"This huge complex consist of indoor memorial, outdoor military gallery and kids zone. This is a must visit place if you come to Seoul. I'm using a Seoul sightseeing bus facility to reach there. "
Glad we went before our DMZ/JSA tour.,"We had booked the full day DMZ tour with JSA/Panmunjong. My husband has a good history knowledge of the Korean War, but not me. So going to the War Memorial gave me a 'crash course' on the Korean War and added value to our DMZ/JSA tour. We arrived after the English speaking tour had begun, but because we went on Sunday, they have volunteer student guides and one of them took us through the highlights of Level 2 on the Korean War. We then walked Level 3 on our own. We had skipped Level 1 which is on the ancient wars before the Korean War. Outside of the museum in the open space, there is a very good display of exhibits of the airplanes & tanks used in the War. The museum is closed on Monday. Entrance is free. Do check from their website for the timing of the guided tours."
Memories of war,"Amazing place.. you can see a lot of memories from the past war.Before you reach the building which you can see a lot of war memorial things, outside you can see first the planes which the souldiers used.Outside the building you'll see the statues of the souldiers and flags of diff. countries and inside you can see a lot of things like arcs,artifacts,dresses,guns etc."
Excellent even on a closed day.,"If you know the KR War, the memorial does not fail to impress. We went unaware it was a closed day. We still had access to the grounds. What is impressive are the military relics you'll encounter without being on a military base. The UN flags out front inform of participating nations, their input, & sacrifices. The metallic monuments are stunning & larger than life."
Propaganda palace?,"a bit of a one-sided museum, naturally but would have been good if the North Korean perspective can be elaborated and explained. "
History of the Korean War in reality,"Visited this place right after my DMZ/JSA tour with Koridoor since their office is located close by. I could spend an entire day in here going through the models of planes, tanks etc. and war artifacts displayed in this memorial. It is a VERY informative place to learn about the history of Korea and the Korean War."
Good place to learn the war history of Korea ,This place has remodel war machines used during the Korean War. Very informative place to learn about history of Korea.
Business Trip,"The War Memorial of Korea provides guided tours with guides who were directly affected by the Korean War (1950-1953). The tour guides provide a unique perspective on the ""Forgotten War."" The controversial General MacArthur, who was removed by President Harry Truman, remains a hero in the minds of many Koreans who are alive today. "
Visualizes korean war in reality,War memorial is a kind of war museum which exhibits war equipment and depicts the war field and related historical facts. War planes used during Korean are halted outside the memorial.
"Expansive, beautifully done war memorial","South Korea really does seem to do museums and memorials right. The War Memorial is in a gigantic, expansive building. It also seemed like some areas of the building were not yet completed or there was still room for more exhibits. The outside grounds were also immaculately taken care of, with numerous statues (esp. the Korean War Monument, Statue of Brothers), a humongous area (circle) in front of the museum with the flags of the nations that participated with South Korea in the Korean War, and more.The inside is quite moving in places, especially the Memorial Hall which is quite unique and haunting. There are numerous exhibits and rooms. I would suggest around at least 2-3 hours for a fairly decent circuit of the place. There is a cafe in the place, although I didn't try it. The admission was also free when I went."
Teenagers Loved It!,My teenage boys couldn't get enough of this museum and memorial. Allow enough time in your schedule - they could have stayed all day. Actual tanks and fighter jets in the outdoor part of the museum that you can access. Indoors the exhibits were state-of-the-art and you can actually experience live combat. We all left with a better perspective and understanding of why the US fought in the Korean War.
A record of suffering,The War memorial of Korea records the suffering of the Koreans during the war. The memorial also record the countries who helped Korea during the wars and their gratefulness is recorded in the Memorial Hall listing the names of those who died from the different countries. The various armaments used have been preserved for the people to be oriented and keeping the history alive. As tourist it is to appreciate their struggle to keep peace and a desire for unification with the help of other countries. It are closed on Monday. Admission is free. to really appreciate do it in a leisurely manner and read the description and history posted.
"History and Wars at the War Memorial of Korea in Seoul, South Korea","We got there in the afternoon of October 21st looking to visit this museum and we were delighted to see that there was also a free performance outside by members of the armed forces and people in traditional costumes marching and performing synchronized moves, fights with historic weapons and dancers in traditional dresses with their musical instruments. The memorial tells the history of Korea from the absolute beginning centuries ago to the independence in the 50's. There are cars, military vehicles and planes on display on the top floor and boats on the bottom one. There are many pictures, artifacts, videos and explanation panels (many only in Korean) that tell the story of battles and struggles of this beautiful country. I believe this is really a highly recommended visit for any tourist coming here."
A must see,"Both, beautiful and sad at the same time. The history behind the monument is so very touching. How families were split and to never see each other again..There is always hope. "
In memory of those who suffered,"This was a little personal.Had just lost my grandfather who was in the Army,so visiting this memorial which had a little Indian contribution in terms of Med Corps during the Korean War choked me up a bit too.There's some awesome weaponry on display such as coner-shot rifles,super soldiers etc and the Koreans are not shy of displaying them.One can even take photos of these.This coupled with a brief history of the peninsula from the Bronze Age onwards including the Goryeo,Silla,Baekje,Gaya dynasties and their wars with Japan and the Tang dynasty of China all make up for an interesting day."
Highly recommended.,"We spent 3 hours here and really enjoyed the outside exhibits, statues and memorials. Historically and culturally interesting."
"An amazing place to visit, full of history and promise for the future","Spent a whole day at this wonderful museum and could of comeback the next day too. Poignant to see the dedications to all the countries and their soldiers at the front of the museum, as my grandfather served in this war during his national service. very easy to get to and some good eating to be had in the local area. "
Worthwhile visit to the War Memorial,"The War Memorial is far from the metro station. Get a taxi. This is a very organised museum. Outside there are many planes, army tracks etc with English and Korean labels. Inside the exhibits are clearly labelled, some very good audio-visual presentations."
"Nice ""time-travel"" feel","Went here recently and it felt good to remember the sacrifices made to secure our generation's safety. Loved the vintage and historical cars, tanks and jets. :)"
Wonderful Museum,"I could have stayed here all day. There is so much to see and read. We started outside with the planes - we had a 3 year old in tow. She loved going up into the tanks and on the ship. There was a little children's play area and children's museum too, but we didn't make it into the children's museum. The museum was incredible. So much information. We didn't get to stay long looking at all the exhibits because of the above mentioned 3 year old. And, this museum was free! Amazing! Highly recommend taking the time to visit here."
very big place!,"Lots of history here. Not only to the South Korean people, but to the NATO alliance. You can spend many hours here is you truly want to, and there are large displays of military hardware to look at as well. "
Quite a History!,"The War Memorial is a museum of artifacts and displays of the fantastic history of the Korean Peninsula, including the Hideyoshi invasions of 1592 and 1598 and the Korean War of 1950 - 53 which ended not in a peace treaty but rather in an Armistice Agreement.All sorts of displays are presented, including weapons systems and the famous Turtle Boat. The museum is located near the former Japanese Army compound currently the home of the United Nations Command, the ROK/US Combined Forces Command, and U.S, Eighth Army.Well worth visiting. If you want to see it all, plan on an afternoon, since it's easy to get distracted by all the exhibits."
Historical value,"We visited towards the end of the day, but still worth it. The park in the middle of the city reminds its citizens of the devastation of war. The monuments are poignant memory for the sacrifices of the soldiers from allied countries as well. Every Koreans must visit this park!"
Lots of history and interesting presentations,If I hadn't been in a group I would've stayed here for so long. I really liked seeing the model of the turtle ship. It's wonderful.
Very Moving on the Korean War,"I went to the War Memorial for the Korean War memorials. My husband served in the U.S. Army and was part of the U.N. Forces. My trip was a tribute to his service and the sacrifices that he made during the year he spent here.I concentrated on the area about the Korean War. The story of the war was told with many pictures and artifacts. All the U.N, Forces were represented in the display.It is well worthing seeing. It helped me understand why people would stop me on the street and says thanks for our country helping South Korea retain their freedom."
Very enjoyable visit,"We arrived at 10am to get a tour of the museum by an English speaking guide. Turns out it was a volunteer Grade 10 student who was trying to share information with tourists and practice English at the same time. Kevin, the guide, was very polite and courteous. He spent time with us through many exhibitions, even though he was only supposed to take us through two. He didn't know too much about the actual history, but he was able to offer some translations and also share his personal stories about the war with us. We asked him some questions about North Korea and he provided some very interesting insights!The museum is large, and we could have easily spent over 3 hours there. The exhibitions are very informative and well designed, and certain parts can be very emotional. Great place to learn more about the Korean War and Korean history in general. One of the highlights of our Seoul trip!"
War Memorials,War memorials are normally solemn places to visit and more so this particular one as it showed how people of the same race fighting over two ideology and a nation divided between North and South Korea.
Korean History,Different periods of Korean history - take time to visit :) we spent about 4 hours both outdoor and indoor.There are many well-known retired warplanes showcase in the outdoor - great for the younger ones and even we adults took interest in it too.
Best War Museum I Have Visited,"Entrance is free,three floors inside that have very detailed history of the Korean war. Outside has lots to see including a F4 Phantom,a B52D,F101,Sabre, and lots more tanks,APC's and even a PT boat. Allow at least a full day"
Great place to learn a bit about modern Korean history,"Impressive museum of Korean history and especially civil war in 1950s. Offers really thorough explanation inside and lots of stuff to see. In front of the museum are monuments for all countries which were involved in the war, of course just the western one helping South Korea. With number of fallen soldiers or explanation how each country supported (army or engineers for example). Near the main gate are also all known names of all foreign soldiers (again, only those who helped South Korea) who fallen in this war.When your tour inside is over, you can visit open air museum with military airplanes, cars, boats. Place to spend almost one whole day! I really recommend.Just leave your political views somewhere else and don't bring it inside - I've met a group of Russian tourists and their guide told them the Soviet version of how everything happened - just telling them bullsheet and lying."
peace full,place to memorise the soldiers who die in war against japan and north koreaplease be quiet thereyou should go there if you like to fell sorry people.
A must visit with further attractions,"The memorial itself is impressive, but it also has a park of military plans next to it, which is impressive in itself.Would definitely recommend."
"excellent museum - interesting, well laid out and plenty of english explanations","we spent 2 hours here but could have spent longer if we'd not left it till the end of the day and were tired. Excellent chronology of Korea's conflicts from BC to present day. For the latter stages there are video's, tableaux and plenty of written explanations. Free to enter but well worth leaving a donation"
War history brought to life,"This is by far the best war memorial/museum I have ever been to. I suggest allowing at least half a day (preferably a full day) too see it properly as there is a lot to see, spread over 3 floors. There are 2 cafe's on site if you need a rest and food/coffee. Aside from many fascinating exhibits, there are multiple theatrettes showing short information videos, as well as 2 small cinemas, including one that offers a 4D experience of the battle to recapture Seoul. There is also an interactive photo stand on the upper floor that allows you to take your photo and put it onto a background picture of a soldier or battlefield. There are also memorials to many fallen heroes and tributes to the allied nations who helped the Koreans fight. We were also lucky to also see a military parade in progress outside before entering. Well worth it, and easy to access using public transport. Entry is free."
Lots to see,Very interesting history of the Korean war and we'll as earlier battles. Recent conflict with North Korea also covered. Lots of original military equipment outside as well as huge war monuments around the memorial.
Must See,"Must see attraction for tourists coming to Seoul. Not too difficult to find and huge array of history, weapons etc... from all eras."
Excellent tribute to the war heroes of that country.,Very well arranged. The sculptures are magnificent! There's a large variety of weaponry on display from several wars. From a vintage patton tank to a B52 stratofortess to a scud missile and a small gun boat. It was a very interesting visit.I enjoyed it very much.
Awesome place,I like that place so much. I want to visit there again. I wish I could have enough money to visit...
Must visit for all history buffs!,A huge museum on Korean history and in depth knowledge on the Korean War in 1950s. Lots of interesting artifacts and there is two 4D cinema for you to experience the Korean War.The entrance is free and is about 10 mins walk from the nearest metro subway.
Such a nice place to visit.,"The museum not only explains the most recent Korean War, but the whole war related history of Korea. The outside has real planes and tanks used during the Korean War."
"Worth visiting: Free entry, interesting exhibits, okay with kids","Great gardens worth walking around and looking at sculptures / open exhibits.Museum itself is just a short walk from the subway (take Exit 13 - which is the closest - or if you're coming from Line 4, then Exit 1 and walk towards the signs) Entry is free (donation boxes inside). You enter on the 2nd floor. The ground floor (1st floor) covers the ancient wars to Korean War, and has a great overall timeline of what was happening in Asia and the rest of the world.2nd and 3rd floors cover the Korean War. It's best if you walk in chronological direction (from the 2nd to the 3rd floor - War room 1 to 3, and then UN exhibit). There were many interesting exhibits, enough to engage children and adults alike. It wasn't as graphic and traumatising as some war memorials I've been to. There are many guns for display, in case this may be an issue (might want to have a prep talk with the kids outside about what this is about, before going in anyway).There is a coffee shop and lots of vending machines, which, at around 1200 won for Coolpis and the likes were slightly overpriced but still cheap and convenient. There's also a CU25 on the grounds.Slightly disappointed that we couldn't go into any of the cinemas (what it felt like to be a refugee with windstorms experience, a 20 minute movie, and also a 4D experience of one of the battles - the latter probably not for kids). The shows mostly started on the hour, but they needed a minimum of 5 adults in the audience for them to run the show. So mostly, it was empty and they didn't play anything. When we had gathered a big enough group, it was 1 minute past the hour and we were told we were too late and had to wait another hour, by the lady who was also chatting on her cellphone while the theatre sat empty. But there were plenty of other interactive things, buttons to press, other short films you could see in booths (including a very touching one about a Turkish soldier and his wife who had raised a Korean War orphan / and a war heroes one where an American soldier had rescued many refugees by being clever with his ship).Plan to spend about 2-3 hours here all up if you're into history / about an hour and a half (including time running around in the grounds) if you have children with you. Worthwhile visit."
Amazing and Sobering at the same time.,"This museum gives you a glimpse into the war torn History of Korea's past. It helps you to understand why things are the way they are now, the many hurdles they have had to overcome and who the Koreans are on a deeper level.The multitude of exhibits within and without will give your hours of things to explore.And as with most museums in Korea it is free!!!Oh and they have a replica of a Turtle Ship which is a major plus. Even my father who is a major war history buff learned a lot during his visit.A must see in Seoul.Sorry no pictures but the Museum respectfully asks you not to on most of the inner displays and I don't want to steal their ahow"
A must visit place if you love History.,"I'm someone who's always been interested in History especially that of a country. I didn't have much anticipation when I decided to go to the war memorial but the moment I was there, it was like a small kid being brought to a huge exciting playground. Tanks, airplanes and boats displayed outside with meaningful statues were those that appeared in sight when I arrived. I was already hyped up even before I entered. Looking through at the exhibits, I regretted for not spending more time there although I was there for more than 2hrs. I didn't go to all the exhibitions since I had other places to go but I will come back again. Even if it's for the same exhibitions. That is how awesome the place was."
Informative interesting visit ,"Well laid out museum with interesting, thoughtful exhibits. Definitely worth a visit to learn about the history of the Korean War. We especially liked the tanks, airplanes and machinery displayed outside. "
Spectacular!,"Very spectacular war memorial in Yongsan for a war that is considered the ""forgotten war"" in the US but certainly not in South Korea..."
Patriotism coupled with Technology,"If you are in and around Seoul, chop off 3 hrs from your busy schedule and do visit war memorial. Before stepping in, i had no idea of what the age old korean war is all about. Even the minute details of the war are showcased with finest clarity. They showed their respect to all the martyrs of the war. 4D film of the war proceeding was the absolute delight. Technology has been used to wide extent to portray all the information. "
everything about the korean war,"I hate wars and everything that has something to do with it, so I don't even like war museums, because they sometimes are a bit patriotic or even glorify the war.And yes, you sometimes get exactly this feeling, when visiting this musuem, but still it's a big and interesting museum, with a lot of things to look at.We didn't had much time, when we went there, but you can really get lost in all the exhibitions. The entrance is free, so you can't go wrong - leave if you don't like it."
Good to have a guide,"My time there was made meaningful with a personal guide arranged by my travel agent. Unfortunately, there were also other tour guides who had students and army boys there too and they were a bit noisy. The place is a bit warm for me as it didn't seem to have air conditioning. They offered a free book about the war. It was too heavy and thick and I didnt lug it back."
Amazing museum,"If you want learn a great deal about this incredible country, visit this museum! There are some great displays and some moving moments."
Don't miss visiting it.,I spent a day there between the outside and inside exhibits. Free tours in the main museum explaining the origins and course of the Korean War. The war Memorial of Korea was the highlight of my visit to Seoul. Well worth a visit.
Check out the military show,"I got lucky, but on Fridays (It might just be in the autumn) they have a military show which showcases the history of the Korean military. A highly orchestrated hour of the various eras of Korean war history, from ancient sword and spear demonstrations to the marching of modern military honour guards. It's done in a massive circular space in front of the actual memorial building and makes for a spectacular event to go and see. "
Awe- inspiring.," This war memorial is stunning. There is a statue of two soldiers one a South Korean in full army gear, embracing another poorly dressed North Korean soldier, they are brothers. Inside are the countries engraved in bronze with their name and the contribution of men, arms, The roof has a beautiful coloured frieze in an abstract design. The main building has the names of every military person who died fighting to keep South Korea free on bronze columns. In the courtyard are the flags and a monument, flag and contribution of each U.N. country that fought. On the grounds are many planes, guns and tanks, plus a replica of the patrol boat that was attacked by North Koreans in early 2000. It is amazing only six sailors died when the bullet holes are seen. I left the memorial thinking about all those brave men who fought and died in the name of freedom. "
Quite impressive collection of war artifacts,"Very interesting display of tanks and aircrafts from Korean War and from modern times including a huge B52. A great time to spend with your kids, specially if they are into ""Call of Duty"""
"Very interesting, well appointed and maintained","We visited this free museum and probably spent as much time outside as inside. The outside displays (planes, tanks, guns, boats, etc) are very well preserved and there was actually ongoing maintenance of one of the planes while we were there.The inside has sections for various themes such as the Korean war, captured enemy weapons and artifacts, Korea's role in foreign wars like Vietnam, desert storm, etc, and other themes. The displays were very well done and thorough. For example, providing a cutaway sample of an antitank missile. Most of the signs included at least a rudimentary English description. We spent about 3 or 4 hours there and did not see half as much as we'd like to have. We will have to go back some time."
Visit My Father-in-laws Grave.,My father in law was killed in Vietnam in 1969 and it is traditional for Koreans to honor deceased relatives. My wife is from Korea and after visiting the grave went to see the grave sites of past Presidents to include the first President of Korea Syngmun Rhee.
Very impressive museum - plan to spend 2 - 3 hrs there,very impressive and well designed museum. The history is explained via animations on several floors. There is a large car / tank / jet / ship park outside. A must visit when in Seoul
National propaganda in poor wrapping,When I visited there was no audio guide and the smart phone based system is not supported by wifi. In general the exhibition is difficult to get an overview for people new to the topic. What's worse is that it is very nationalistic in its tone and there is absolutely no self reflection on atrocities committed by the South. The North is the big Evil and the South is the rightful Hero. Tastes bad.
"Huge, moving museum.","This museum covers every conceivable aspect of Korea's military history, but focuses most on the Korean War and a consideration of the sacrifices made in that conflict. The range of weaponry is staggering, especially outside, where the scale and power of modern technology can be experienced up-close. It also contains moving tributes to fallen soldiers, art exploring war itself and in-depth looks at South Korea's modern military. AND there are parades and shows to see. All for FREE. This is a truly great, if sombre, museum."
The war that i never really knew about..,"Ok in all honesty, I've heard of the Korean war but i didn't really know much about it until i came here and boy am i glad that i did. We travelled to this memorial/war museum on our 2nd day in Seoul and it was very easy to get to, i believe we took the subway line to samgakji and walked about 5 minutes up and around the hill where we found it. There was no entrance fee which we found surprising considering the massive size and the attention to historical detail of it all (you literally have nothing to lose here, we would have been more than happy to pay at least 10$ each). There are statues depicting heroic scenes and memorial plaques to commemorate and honour the fallen in battle everywhere. The one thing that really surprised me about it was all the plaques that honoured the foreign soldiers lives that fought and gave their life for the war in Korea, I never knew how many nations were actually involved. Inside there is a museum that holds some of the historical weapons used dating back to periods 2 millennia before the birth of christ, up to modern day weapons used in the most recent conflicts. You will learn about the different korean dynasties, the different wars and conflicts with which nations which ultimately lead to the birth of the modern day Korea."
Most interesting Museum in Korea,"Very impressive depiction of the Korean separation and their suffering. It is beautifully shown how they want to be reunited again and a crucial visit to understand the Korean feelings towards war, North Korea and brotherly love. A free experience. A must-do. And pick a sunny day, then you can have a look at the backyard filled with an incredible collection of old warfighters (planes), tanks and boat and flacs."
Interesting cultural destination ,One get to know about pretty much everything on Korean War but may not be from a neutral perspective. Interesting exhibit but do expect a lot of walking though. 
Beautiful memorial,This is a very moving and beautiful memorial. It's free to see ( along with quite a bit on the property) but if you take a minute to really look at the art behind this and see the true meaning of the piece you will be moved. It is exceptional.
Fantastic - must visit,Lovely environment for a leisurely walk soaking in the history of the place with significant landmarks and accessibility. Strongly recommended.
Interesting and Moving,We went to lots to tourist attractions in the seven days we had in Seoul and I would rate this as one of the best. The old history was really interesting and there was plenty of English commentary to keep us interested. The installations that covered the Korean War were equally interesting and one - I'll call it the tear drop as I have not idea what is actually called - was particularly moving. I'd recommend adding this to your itinerary.
haunting yet respectful,"we walked around for at least 4 hours. this is an excellent memorial and museum for the wars of Korea. some rooms are haunting. all are extremely respectful. I recommend any visitor to Seoul, spend a few hours here. "
Good to see for the value! Free!,This is a must see if you're very into history of the war that has happened in Korea. We spent about a good couple hours here. Be prepared to walk a lot as this museum is HUGE. The great thing about this place was it was FREE entry. It's very easy to get here as well as we took the subway only about 10 minutes from where we stayed (Tmark Grand Hotel). 
Great museum,"It's nice that most of the museums in Seoul are free which is the same asthe museums in Washington, DC. The war museum is free to enter and a very nicely organized museum. It's easy to follow the time line and I learned a lot about the war from my visit. It is great for kids because they have a children's museum and an outdoor playground for the kids."
"Intersting, but very little in English","The outside exhibits were great. Interesting, English available, and lots to see. The inside was harder, more ancient history than I was expecting, and too many school groups. (The kids do sit on the floor and pay attention to their guides though!) I'd plan to spend a hour or two here. Lots to learn."
A great insight into Korea's history and the people's psyche,"This museum is very nicely set up. It goes through the very old history of Korea and all of its conflicts over the centuries. About half the museum focuses on the Korean War, but that's expected. They did a very good job of showing their appreciation to all the nations that helped South Korea retain independence from the North. Of course, there are things that are biased in this exhibit, but that's expected. Be sure to stop by as it's free so worth the visit."
You can learn about war & peace through various displays that are historically proven.,There you can learn about the Korean War (Forgotten War in American term) in detail if you particularly are interested and see various weapons actually actually used during the war together rwith all papers/maps etc. exhibited inside & outside of the museum.
Amazing,If your old enough to remember the war don't miss it. Every day they have several tours in English and another nice thing admission is free
Unexpected pleasure,"Having visited the Korean War Memorial in Washington DC. we wanted to visit the memorial in Seoul. We were not disappointed. It is very impressive! As we emerged from the main building we realised they were preparing for a ceremony, so we found a seat, and at 2pm promptly we watched the Honour Guard Ceremony. It was quite spectacular! So glad we were around to witness it."
"This is massive! If you want to see it all, leave enough time","We came here in the afternoon after a few other sight-seeings.The museum is huge so if you don't have a lot of time, chose which part to visit wisely!I only came here because my husband asked me to but I loved it. It has a lot on the Korean war and other things related to wars. Well worth a visit."
Interactive and Insightful,"A great place to spend a couple of hours learning about the Korean War. Loads of mock ups and interactive videos which make it all the more interesting, particularly if you have children. There is a great selection of outdoor exhibits too, including military aircraft and vehicles as well as thought provoking statutes. For real history buffs you could easily spend a whole day here, looking at other exhibits too."
Surprisingly interesting,I just went here because I was bored one day and was pleasantly surprised. The memorial is full of information that I never knew. This is recommended for history buffs or anyone who has a relative who was involved in the Korean War.
Memorable ,Recommended visit. A lot to see and learn from the war memorial. Have a better appreciation of the history and the sacrifices of the honoured
Excellent way to understand Korean history,"The War Memorial has an excellent display of historical artefacts and the outdoor exhibit is fantastic. As a tourist, this site is a must see and provides some context to the Korean War, a very important event in the history of South Korea.We were short on time but for a family, this can be a good activity for half a day. It is very easy to navigate to the site via the railway."
Fantastic Outdoor Exhibit,"Pros: Excellent collection of war planes and tank, outdoor exhibits are free to visitCons: Lots of school groupsI had a few hours while on a business trip in Seoul, and stopped by the War Memorial on a beautiful October afternoon. I had originally planned to visit the exhibition hall, but the weather was so nice I started outside and before I knew it, 90 minutes had passed.The outdoor collection of guns, missiles, tanks, planes, and a boat is very well maintained compared to other outdoor exhibits I have been to. Each item has a plaque in front with a detailed explanation of the item, its origin and history, and it's use during the Korean War. You can walk up and to in the equipment, and many items even have observation steps so you can see above or inside. There is also a boat you can tour, set above the reflecting pool next to the museum.I can't comment on the Exhibit Hall, since I ran out of time to visit it. But the outdoor exhibit alone was a great experience, and with no cost to attend it's hard to pass up."
"Solemn, yet spectacular. A must see experience.",The Korean War memorial is a massive site dedicated to those that fought and gave their lives to defend South Korea from communist North Korea and China. The displays are awesome and the sculptures capture the struggles both South Korean soldiers and civilians endured throughout the war. We saw hundreds of young military soldiers and students at the memorial probably to learn about the war and why they need to stay vigilant to protect their freedom. It's remarkable how much South Koreans suffered during the war and how they rebuilt their nation to what it is today in just 63 years. The memorial will forever remind future generations of the price of freedom. You must visit this remarkable site.
About The Korean War,"I visited the Exhibittion Hall at the War Memorial, Yongsan in Seoul. The sculptures are the memory of the Korean War, the clock stopped the hour of the beginning of the Korean War. You can see the flags and statues of many countries which joined the war. Many special exhits are at the exhibit halls and be able to see the unique ship, called Trutle Ship at Chosun dynasty. Walking around the Memorial makes you feel and think about the peace and war. Good in all season except winter."
"Great visit, even for those not interested in War Memorials","It's free to visit, so why not stop by? Even if you just go for the walk around of the mostly Korean War equipment pieces they have on display outdoors it's worth the 1/2 hour alone.One complaint, if you will, is the thin amount of material on the Korean War. I know, there are 3 entire rooms devoted to it, but in actuality there isn't all that much ( outside of the vast equipment on display outside ). For a country so war torn in it's long history, a visit here gives one perspective and appreciation for what they have gone thru, and, with the help out outside nations, retained- minus, of course, the northern half of the country."
Great kids museum and exhibits.,The entire museum is pretty great. Our kids loved the outdoor stuff and children's museum. There are weird height requirements for the children's area- but we took our baby and let him play around even though he wasn't tall enough. They didn't seem to mind. Our other kids enjoyed it a lot. They only let you in for 50 minute periods that start watching hour- and when it's busy you may have to wait to get in- but we went on a weekend morning and it was empty!
Insightful and engaging,We took up the offer of a free guide (look around at the entrance as was not clearly visible). This made our experience very insightful.
Most important historical tour place in modern Seoul,"As everyone knows, Korean war is very important historic event in Korea.This place can suggest you historical facts and circumstances of Korean war with selected references "
A spectacular show of the war history of Korea,This location is a must-visit for anyone interested in war history. The museum is well funded and laid out - going over the many centuries of battles that shaped the historical landscape of the Korean peninsula.
Impressive,"Korea underwent 50 years of brutal Japanese occupation and then, after WWII, came the Korea War. There is much to remember and it is very well displayed.Access to wheel chairs. Free admission."
Well done museum,"I only had 1.75 hours there which wasn't enough. I'd recommend at least 3 hours. Entry is free. The tanks, planes (including a B-52), missiles, etc. outside of the museum can be seen after the museum closes, so save them for last. I enjoy my history but this museum still had plenty of interesting information to offer on the Korean war. It also covers ALL Korean wars from ancient times through to today's military, but the Korean war takes up a lot of real estate as a three part exhibit (give yourself a couple hours for the Korean war exhibit if you have high interest).Some of the exhibits are interactive or moving, plus there is some sound and cinema, to make it a more interesting experience.If you enjoy history at all, you can't miss this museum."
Truly an eye opener,"An interesting place.. you can get a glimpse into south Korea's past. From the ancient eras to the Korean war. Didn't know that the nation went thru such difficult times...Really interesting exibits on display. From ancient battleship, war gear to modern tanks and bullets. It's amazing. It also showcases old antique pieces donated by those who took part in the war. The whole place is HUGE! Didn't know that a war could be so sadistic."
Huge war museum for a rainy day activity,"I have been to the Armed Forces Museum in Taipei, Taiwan before, and compared to that, I must say that the War Memorial of Korea is really huge. It is conveniently located next to either Namyeong Station or Noksapyeong Station. The museum can be a good addition as a next stop afterwards if you have a prior Koridoor DMZ or JSA tour, since the Koridoor office is very close to Namyeong Station itself.The indoor section of the museum itself consists of 3 floors of various exhibits, from the ancient period such as the Three Kingdoms of Korea to the modern day. Of course, the highlights in the exhibits are heavily focused on the Korean War, which is often known as the Forgotten War due to the more well known Vietnam War overshadowing it. There are plenty to see within the exhibits, such as firearms, uniforms and scale models of military vehicles. Sometimes, there are also special exhibits that are shown for a limited time. In our case, the museum held a special exhibition regarding firearms used by actors or actresses in Korean films. It was very fascinating to see rather unique firearms close-up first hand.There is also the outdoor section of the museum, which display various military vehicles, artillery and aircraft, and even a replica 1:1 scale of a South Korean patrol boat. The amount of vehicles here is simply astonishing and well preserved. You can see both Western and Soviet tanks and aircraft, such as the M4 Sherman and T-34, or even the massive B-52 Stratofortress jet bomber! You can even go into the back of the APCs, such as the M113, for some memorable photos. There is definitely plenty of stuff for everyone to take photos with.I would recommend at least 2 hours just to cover the inside of the museum itself, and it is very ideal for a rainy day activity. However, do take note it is closed on Mondays though. For those with an interest in military history or those who want to know more about the Cold War legacy that still continue to plague the Korean Peninsula, this is a must go. Best of all, it is free!"
Awesome museum,"Amazing exhibits with English translations. So much to see here. The collection of planes, tanks, and artillery outside the museum are great for photo ops. We came on a national holiday and unfortunately the museum closed 2 hours early. We will definitely come back to view the rest of the exhibits."
Memorable,Very well laid out museum that commemorates the war and all those who died in it. Goes through the reasons for it and the hopes for the future.
A thought provoking visit,This complex is an outstanding reminder of military conflict that has plagued and continues to plague this part of Asia. The war memorial itself is very moving and the extensive indoor and outdoor displays well worth exploring. As with everywhere in Seoul visitor facilities are outstanding with sufficient English interpretation
A refreshing and candid view of the Korean War.,"Our guide shared war and post-war experiences with Australian soldiers and his visits to Australia. A guided tour is the most efficient way to get an overview of the war. Spend 15-30min downstairs to get a quick overview of 4000+ years of Korean history at your own pace. Free book about the war available at front desk, plenty of ammenities (seem to be everywhere throughout Korea) also friendly and helpful staff. Not too crowded, we were there after lunch on a weekday."
Great memorial and museum - a must visit,"This museum and memorial is a great place. Its free of charge, got a large exhibition and is also very educating. The museum got an indoor section over 3 floors and an outdoor section. The Outdoor section is mostly a few monuments to honor the once who fought the korean war and also a section with lots of full size military vehicles used during the decades of conflict on the korean peninsula. In the outdoor part you get to see planes, tanks and even a boat from the korean war. The indoor exhibition is over 3 floors, each covering different parts of war history of korea. It goes all the war from ancient times with the three kindoms era to koreas involvement with Un relief work. In other words load of history to see and learn. Take note that this place is also a must visit for local schools so dont be surprised if you find yourself surrounded by children on a field trip. But dont fear, korean children are very well mannered and you wont see children running around and making a lot of noise.Visit this place on a cloudy day, dont go there if its rainy if you want to enjoy the outdoor exhibit."
Absolutely great place ,"I visited this place with my 2 boys. We loved it lots of information about Korea War. Also very interesting for kids as they can see the planes, ship and other weapons. The admission is free. "
Great museum that's free,Great museum. Lots of history to read and learn. Free of charge. Easy to get to via subway. Easy to navigate around with English everywhere. Lots to see. Highly recommend if you have a few hours. 
"Peaceful, respectfull and above all an informative memorial to those who suffered helping. ","A tranqiul oasis in the city that is informative and also a memorial to those who suffered and those that helped.The War Memorial is a fitting tribute, In my opinion it strikes the correct balance between being place of rememberance and a museum / park / tourist attraction, it also provdes a history lesson and optimisim for the future.I spent about 3 - 4 hours wandeing about learned much that I did not already know. There were people af all ages, families and many nationalities there at the time of my visit but the place is large and well laid out so although there were many people nothing was crowded.The 'park' is large and there are quite a lot of benches where you can rest in the shade and reflect.This is a place to visit that I would recommend anybody becase we can all learn and also be grateful that many of us never have had to be involved in such conflict.As is the case with many of the attractions the War Memorial is closed on Monday."
Great museum that would be worth paying for!,Huge FREE museum with lots of exhibits and things to see. We spent a few hours exploring the museum during a torrential downpour. This place was better then I expected. Definitely a must see during your time in Seoul!
good place when raining ,this is a very good place go when it rains but anytime is great so many attraction you can enjoy from the past to present great indoor and outdoor exhibits a good place just to chill and watch people it's free
Greatest war museum,It's a fantastic war museum. It exhibits the entire history of the Korean War that showed the materials related to the war!!It takes a few hours for tour so need to comfortable shoes! Must see!!
Memorial to Korean war heroes and patriots,"This is a large complex consisting of seven indoor exhibits including the Memorial Hall (commemorates war heroes and the Korean spirit), War History Room ((depicts some military victories and rocket launchers), Korean War Room I-II (depictnig Korean War of 1950 including a 4D visual experience), Korean War Room III (focusing on role of UN in the Korean War), Expeditionary Forces Room (activities of ROK Armed Forces). There is also a outdoor exhibit in form of the Children's Museum (including a trick art photo zone and guerilla training experience). You can enjoy the Smart Exhibition System service with your phone. The exhibitons are open from 9 am to 6 pm (closed on Mondays), admission is free for permanent exhibits."
memorial,"Some statues near eachother which reminds the Korean good people, died in war for their country. Nice really!"
Fantastic museum,"Really well put together museum with something for everyone, just be mindful there is a fair bit of bias and there is always two sides to every story. Enjoyed the inside and the outside bits - and the kids learnt heaps"
Fantastic (and free),"If you take any interest in the Korean war then this is a must. Very good collection of military vehicles outside and the museum itself is an impressive structure and experience. One of the best museums I have been to in terms of displays and information delivery. The external halls pay homage to the fallen from the various nations. Pro Tip: Even though it says 9am open, come at like 8.15/30 and see all the outside vehicle displays before the museum building opens to maximise your day and avoid the tourist crowds. Expect to spend ~3 hrs."
Total History Immersion ,"Enjoyed this place tremendously. The exhibits were very informative and gave me an idea of what it was like when Korea was at war. Many pictures, videos and relics - all of which provide new experiences of learning. The time you can spend here varies. Personally, I spent 4hrs here because I'm the sort of person who reads and studies every single exhibit, and stop to watch every show and video. But there are some people who breeze and browse through quite quickly, and could possibly finish everything in about an hour. I guess it depends on what interests you.There was a 4D show in one of the exhibits on the 2nd level that illustrated the operations of the Incheon Landing. That was rather impressive, I thought. By 4D, I mean that you will be secured to your seat because the motion chairs move according to whether you're on a boat or a plane. Another thing that was really impressive was how you could use your smartphone to read more about the exhibits - either by NFC or QR scanning. Beside the exhibits, there would be a little panel for you to scan which would automatically open a page on your phone. The page contained information about what you are seeing, and would sometimes lead you to YouTube videos to illustrate it. What a great way to learn!One of the must visit places if you're in to history."
More Peace and Less War,After visiting the Memorial I am like most of the visitors would appreciate PEACE and FREEDOM more than ever. This Memorial is so well done that I get to learn so much about Korean history and not just war. We were very lucky to have a FREE GUIDED tour at 2pm (check information for time) which lasts for 1.5 hours. You do not have to be a historian or weapon fanatic to find this place a great way to spend 4-8 hours there. 
Excellent ,This place is excellent a must visit for history lovers you will learn a lot about history and very beautiful and well funded international Musem. This is one of the best museums I ever visited in my life. The staff are extremely helpful and friendly. I am United Arab Emirates citizen o traveled numerous places this is truly a must visit experienced. I'm shocked that the entrance is free. The quality and information offered is of exceptional quality. You can spend more than 5 hours and not finish. It's that wow. 
Awesome building,"Incredible structure with a fantastic design. Web could not get inside because of a holiday but the yard had a multiple of tanks,planes and boats of both sides"
Super interesting (and it's free!),"This was an amazing experience. My friends and I are going to the DMZ in a couple of days, and we thought it would make sense to catch up on the history regarding the Korean War - and we are not disappointed! This museum has it all, and it's definitely worth a visit - take your time since it's a huge area!"
Good for all,"This was a good intro to our trip to Seoul. There is a large outside area with planes, tanks and boats plus some Memorials. Then a large (free) inside area that you could spend a few hours in. Keep in mind this is not just the Korean War Memorial but the Memorial to ALL war in Korea. Vietnam included."
Worth visit,"A place for memorial war. I visited some place in the word but this place is impressive.The aircraft, tanks, and boats displays outside were very well done. The monuments outside were unique and architecturally innovative. The building itself was beautiful inside. The displays inside were excellent. Well worth your time to visit."
Must see for your first time in Seoul,"For tourists in Seoul, especially those from one of the 20+ countries that participated in the Korean War, this is a must see location. The museum has free entry and several guided tours throughout the day. It's really, really large and even has several outside areas with old planes and ships. Most of the museum focuses on the war in the 1950s, but there is a section that talks about earlier conflicts as well. It is a very moving place to visit, especially if you have a personal connection with the conflict in some way. I think it is good to visit early in your trip since so much of modern Korean society is a response to the Korean War."
Great day out and very beautiful and interesting memorial,"Not only is the memorial amazing in terms of statues and old war vehicles, but it is also in Iteawon which is a very cute neighborhood and has great food options from all over the world. I would recommend going there after lunch, spend the afternoon there and then have dinner down the road towards the metro, tons of little shops if you are keen on that too. "
2000 years of wars encapsulated,"A lot of effort has been put in to this national museum. Entry is free and one probably gains much more understanding than by a visit to 'The Border' with the North. It is in Seoul and easily accessible so no excuse not to visit for anyone with even the slightest interest in why Korea is the way it is today.The outside displays include an array of military hardware large enough to fight a small war, collected from most of the nations which armed the 1950s conflict. All, including a full size B52 bomber, shoehorned together in to a remarkably small area to make a massive 3-D jigsaw. The best view of all this is obtained from the deck of the heavily shell and bullet-pitted gunboat which has found its way in to the ornamental lake in front of the buildings.All the nations, flags and soldiers of the UN forces are commemorated in a huge memorial area.Koreans have a history of war to equal any European nation, and this is outlined inside in an illustrated timeline covering several large rooms. The internal displays include a horrific and moving portrayal of the Japanese occupation.We also saw many groups of South Korean school children, all in their pretty uniforms, being taken around the premises being introduced to the facts of Korean life and geopolitical circumstances. Sad but essential"
A must see,This museum is really nice and you definitely learn about their culture and other things. Is big and when we went there was a woo boat in tbe middle of it inside. They do have the war memorial as well as other exhibits land actual planes and tanks outside. 
Very impressed,"I would compare this to our Smithsonian Museums in Washington D.C. The aircraft, tanks, and boats displays outside were very well done. The monuments outside were unique and architecturally innovative. The building itself was beautiful inside. The displays inside were excellent. I could not believe such a wonderful place offered free admission. Well worth your time to visit."
Worth visiting if you're a military history buff,"Great museum showcasing Korea's military history from ancient times to now. You could easily spend hours reading about all the exhibits. The variety of objects and displays is impressive, and the English translations didn't let them down. We thought the Korean War exhibit with the mock archaeological dig/remains underfoot was especially moving.Only downfall was the cafe & shop. The food is expensive and revolting, and the souvenirs in the shop can be bought elsewhere in touristy shops for half the price. Moral of the story: don't come at lunchtime like we did, there's better food elsewhere!"
Eye opening experience,"While I was in Korea on vacation I went to the war memorial with a supplier representative from a company I do business with. Toured the entire memorial, it covered the entirety of the Korean war from the origins to resolution. As you move through the exhibit you can encounter and speak with volunteers who recount their experiences either in the military or living in Korea at the time. It was truly an inspiring experience to be able to speak with people who actually lived in Korea while the war occurred and hear their stories. The memorial also covered a significant portion of Korean history as a whole it is not just dedicated to the Korean war. You can find a large amount of military hardware on site as well both inside and outside the museum. "
Understanding why we were there,You may wonder why the U.S./UN/NATO troops go into obscure countries until you go to this museum. The atrocities committed against humans anywhere is against us all. This museum is VERY nice and free. Make a point to visit it.
Ony the outdoor part. Was great,"Be aware it is closed on mondays! However it was really intersting to take photos next to a warship, and some air crafts including Really HUGE ones, and see some skud rockets, and weapons from both sides of the war ( both US and USSR made).I liked the concept of remembering all countries contrbutions to the war. The green areas around the outdoor area were great too."
Great Museum for Military History Fans,"I suggest at least a half-day visit here, because you have both a large museum building and a spacious outdoor area full of planes (including a B-52 bomber), tanks, boats, rockets and artillery pieces. You are allowed to walk around and enter many of them, so bring your cameras. The very moving ""Two Brothers"" statue is here, so be sure to look for it and read its story. The museum building is fine for a rainy day, but try to go on a clear day so you can spend a lot of time outside as well."
Excellent Place to Learn Korean History and To Pay Respect to Korean Veterans,Had a chance to visit this place. I was surprised by how big it was. The statue of the soldiers in the front as well as the planes and tanks that surround the building are amazing.
Interesting & educational,"The war memorial museum and surrounding grounds were quite interesting to walk around. It's not too large so you could cover everything in under 3hrs, I think.I viewed and read the historical exhibition on the first floor and it was well laid out and easy to navigate. It was educational, unemotive and child friendly.I found the outdoor sculptures, weapons and war vehicles were the most interesting part of the whole facility.Also, there is a cafe, a canteen and an Italian restaurant on the museum grounds."
One of the best memorials you will ever visit,"I've been here multiple times (I ran out of time the first time. Second was with my dad. Third with a friend visiting Korea for a few days and finally before I left Korea as they have renovated the basement level (Pre Korean War history).Outside you have a lot of amazing sculptures with a meaning behind all of them and also the majority of vehicles that served on both sides during the war (A favourite was the plane a North Korean pilot defected many years after the war)On the left of the entrance (before you go inside) is the memorial of names for the fallen soilders. Very powerful. Inside you have the basement level which is Pre Korean War history and Koreas first interactions with many different nations. Also pointing out important people within history.First and second floor is Korean War from the lead up to post war. A few interaction rooms/ride things. Also a lot of displays and important things within the war. EVERYTHING is in English (And some other languages) so don't worry about that.Towards the end gives the information about Vietnam, Iraq etc.Sometimes they have special exhibition's too!"
War Machines,"We do have a very good time in this museum, especially in outdoor exhibibition.Lot of war machines, such as : tanks, ships, airplane, rocket launcher, etc. My kids like it so much. They try every one of them, and take lot of photos.They also have indoor exhibition, and war memorial museum for childreen also. Indoor exhibition explains more about ancient story of Korean war.They also carve the of soldiers who died in the Korean war.And all of those thing is free. Yes, you read it right. You don't have to pay anything when visit this museum.You can reach this museum by stopping at Samgakji station, exit 1.Instagram : @adjimantoro"
"Great War museum, both outdoor and indoor -",This is probably one of the best war museums I have seen in my life. Great information provided and excellent exhibits! Take your time to visit it !!!
Visit this to understand Korea today,"South Korea is shaped by its geography, in particular the Japanese occupation and Korean war and its aftermath. This museum traces the long history of Korea's kingdoms and invasions with a particular focus on C20. It contains many moving memorials and reminders of the importance of international commitment to peace. "
Well done!,Nicely done memorial and museum. Special recognition and acknowledgement is given to each country that participated in or supported the efforts of the Korean War. Highly recommended. 
The War Memorial of Korea,"It is a peaceful and relaxing place to visit. It is also good to see the tanks, war vehicles and war planes. "
Awesome,"Lots of old war equipment you can look at...tanks, aircraft, etc. Inside are historical artifacts. free to visit. not too much in english. Not too bad but if u don't speak Korean...mostly just looking and the descriptions in English are quite sparse."
Touching and Informative,Great place for history buffs. Lots of aircraft and tanks to see. Amazing statues as well. The two brothers is a must-see when you visit.
Great trip,"It is a great museum, it shows a precise korean history. It starts from the 2000 bc until the Vietnamese war, but the focus is on the korean war. It is great but still has a little lack of english just a little. They givea book for free about the korean war. The best is that there is no entrance fee."
Worth a Visit!,"I love history and going to museum but this is definitely one of the best museums I've ever visited! In a few hours of visit, I learned so much about Korean War more than the textbook in history class in high school. Highly recommended especially for those who is interested about Korean war."
Awesome,Excellent Memorial and Museum. It helps to understand the Korean War deeply. Fantastic materiel in exhibition both outside and indoors
Must see if you are interested in knowing more about the Korean War 1950-1953,"I have visited a couple of war museums in Vietnam, London and Paris and I must say that the Seoul War Museum is outstanding by its design and the interactivity of the expositions."
Huge War Museum,"Probably one of the biggest and best war museums that I have seen. Better than Te Papa in Wellington, for instance. Quite impressive (and free)."
Humbling,"We were a group of about 50 of us (mostly kids) and very limited time, but what an amazing museum. Not everything was in English, but enough was to be able to enjoy the exhibits. "
Interactive and engaging place with a great outdoor exhibit,"We recently spent an afternoon exploring the War Memorial and found it to be a very interesting and engaging place. It is not necessary to take a guided tour, in my opinion: the exhibits are very interactive and easy to understand. There are lots of interesting artifacts to see inside the museum, wartime vehicles and boats to tour outside, and some spectacular bronze statues in the garden around the museum. We learned a lot about the Korean war and its heroes. This is an important place to see when you visit South Korea."
"It is a well organized war memorial, which provides good information on the Korean War","I enjoyed my visit. It has a lot of ""hardware"", such as tanks, planes, and even a patrol boat. But at the same time, the exhibits are very well organized. Some of the stories are also very touching. It's free, and I think it is a must-see for first timer in Seoul. "
Great museum about Korea history,This is a great museum that everyone should take the time to see. It has exhibits for Korean history and also for the Korean War. Very interesting!
Great for the history buffs,"Impressive monument & garden display outside the museum. Inside you will find detailed historical displays of various campaigns along with several planes & military vehicles . Follow along from the outside memorial area, past the museum entry, you will find a huge outdoor display area of service vehicles, tanks, guns, planes including a B52 bomber."
Excellent Museum,This museum is brilliant. The whole exhibition is really well translated into English. There are also free guided tours of the museum a couple of times a day which are worth doing. The museum is massive and takes a few hours to see it properly. There are also many army vehicles including tanks and planes outside which are cool and would be brilliant if you were with kids.
"If you near Seoul, recommend to visit",I went here with my kids and they enjoyed walking aroung and learning more about the history of the war.. they liked most the outside displayed war machines
Find your country flag and its significance,"Beyond all the war planes, tanks, rockets exhibits, & ship, i was just happy to see our flag among those of all nations that sent support to the Korean army during the war. It was a great memory."
Great way to spend an afternoon,Very impressive and well done museum. If you're a history buff and interested in the Korean War this is definitely a do not miss stop. 
A good spot to learn Korean history.,"As with most Americans, we were guilty of only being aware of Korea starting in 1950. This was a great history lesson of a country with a long history of civilization. It was a reminder of the statement, ""Freedom isn't free."""
Worth the revisit,"Haven't been for a year but I had some Turkish visitors keen to visit so off we went. I was struck at first by how interesting it is every time I visit. And, now that I am visiting through the eyes of foreign visitors, I can see how sympathetically it is set up, with equal weight given to each country that fought in this war. The outside display of decommissioned hardware was particularly notable, especially for the only B52 on view outside of the Smithsonian"
Excellent displays,Good historical outline of major wars and battles but especially the Korean War 1950-1953. Excellent selection of hardware outside. English translations available. A good museum for children of all ages.
A must see for anyone visiting or living in Korea.,This museum is dedicated to history of war on the Korean peninsula. It is an invaluable resource to anyone living or visiting the country. It helps to put the Korean psyche into perspective.
Loved it,This was an incredibly moving museum. The museum provided a very comprehensive overview of the Korean War. There are other exhibits providing a nice summary of ancient Korea history. I really enjoyed the exhibit and highly recommend it.
Learned A LOT!,"We planned on spending just a couple of hours here not knowing that this memorial/museum had a lot to offer. We spent most of our day here and hubby wanted to come back another day as we were not able to finish going through the whole building. Wear comfortable walking shoes and eat first before coming here. So much to see and learn and so little time! Most moving exhibit for me was ""The Drop"" by Dong Man Kim."
A awesome place to see and understand the military history of this country ,The Korean war museum was a place of full respect and had all the nation's that help them in the Korean war in 1956. The museum was broken up into several sections including history from the early years leading right up to the current history of the nation. This place has some great areas for kids and even a small shooting range they can go and play and pretend to shoot M16 and some other weapons in a mock shooting gallery. The Expeditions are well designed with plenty of interactive displays. This museum is designed for kids and adults and it has a lot of English translated information and you can get headphones that you can use to walk through out the place getting a full understanding of what you are looking at at. It also had a full Parade with all different types of services the parade was absolutely brilliant and I must say was the highlight of my trip in Korea it went for about 45 mins and after you could go down and speak with these people have a talk to them and even get a few photos if you like. This place was really a great area to go and explore and actually had to do it over 2 days as a was too much to see in one.
Great,"What a great work of art. When standing at the monument and looking at it, it is almost if you can feel how these men felt, while fighting the war."
Meh,"I wasn't educated on RoK history before husband took me here. The admission is free and the display of the museum was informational. However, it can be a little boring after 2 exhibit halls. "
Don't miss this incredible museum - It's world class.,"The War Memorial Museum is one of the best museums I've seen. It's very well put together and is very informative. I would suggest keeping an open mind as there is a fair bit of propaganda as well, but that goes without saying in South Korea. All in all, excellent opportunity more about the war and the history of the South Korean military."
Memory of Korean War,"It shows a typical representation about Korean War which occured in 1950. Furthermore, its narratives consist of two things: Korean nationalism and anti communism. Therefore, there is no sorry for Vietnam War and no talks about peace."
Must See in Seoul!,"The War Memorial in the Yongsan-gu area of Seoul is a must-see while in fabulous South Korea! I recently visited with my son, David to honor my father and my teen-aged Uncle David, who was Killed in Action in the Korean War. The main hall, Memorial Hall has beautiful paintings, reliefs and depicts the terrible hardships of the Korean people during, not only the Korean War, but throughout prior wars and occupations. You will need at least half a day to see the exhibits. The museum houses large weapons, beautiful sculptures and even bronze plaques that list the names of the over 33,000 Americans who were killed in combat/hostile action during the war. The South Korean people are amazingly appreciative of American sacrifice and it was immensely touching to finally see our little David's name on the Wall of Honor. Every Korean person I met there shared their gratitude for Americans like Uncle David, who gave their lives for the freedom of people they never met. God Bless America and the South Korean people-Freedom is Not Free!"
Korean War Memorial,"Awesome place, full of history. RIP to all those heroes who died for their country. I'm from Puerto Rico and was very surprised to see a wall for just for fellow countrymen who died in battle. Very modern facilities, right in the heart of Seoul. Admission is free, perfect of history for anybody interested"
Very well maintained,"Had a brief visit here. It portrays the history of war. It is well maintained. The collection includes tanks, aeroplanes, ships, rockets etc. Children will just love this place. The best part is its free entry"
Great musuem,This museum is really good and really interesting! Outside there is a collection of military vehicles including tanks and planes you can wander around. One of the more worth while musuems in Korea. 
Really big museum,"The first impression that hits you when you arrive at the museum is that it is very very big. In fact it is the largest war memorial museum in the world. It has several mini screenings about the conflicts in Korea which was quite interesting. The memorial covers wars from the kingdom periods to the Korean War. In my opinion it is less graphic as the Vietnam War Remnants Museum in HCM and takes a more subtle approach of honouring those who fought in the war rather than the graphic brutality of the wars themselves. Love the monuments in front of the building. Also the tanks, planes, helicopters and warship...Yes a warship outside the museum. Really worth a visit."
War Memorial of Korea,"Two years ago was my last visit but nothing has changed. This is a must do attraction to get a snap shot of the Korean history. There are displays of each transition of military battles to the current state of Korea. If you are a history buff, maybe a whole day is best to set aside. Great place to let the children run out all their energy. There are the typical souvenir shops and food too.Of course, this is just for snacking. There are many outstanding traditional Korean restaurants around the War Museum. And by Metro, three stops away from the infamous foreigner shopping area Itaewon. "
War,Nice Museum in Korea. The history of korean war between north and south korea. Must place to visit in seoul and free entry
Well done!,"Not quite Smithsonian quality, but a really nice job nonetheless. Sadly most of what I previously knew about the conflict came from watching the TV show M*A*S*H as a child. I learned a lot about how it really went down. Especially liked the patrol boat replica with all of its damage reproduced in detail. Standing in the wheelhouse with all the bullet holes riddling the inside, I could literally feel the terror those sailors must've faced.The B52 was also a highlight for me, though a little sad to see it deteriorating outside like that.Well done!!! Go see it for sure."
Interesting spot,"To understand nowadays Korean life and people this museum is a must see. The nation with many wars in it's history and the perseverance of the people to rebuild the country as it is now, this museum tells us the story of war and how the country is prepared to fight again. There is a guided tour at 10:00 ~ 11:00 am and 14:00 ~ 15:00 pm with the volunteer guides. I took the earlier tour with our guide of the day Mr Sohn Joong Hee on August 18th 2016. After the tour I visited the cafe and shop and bumped into Mr Sohn again and he guided me privately through the Vietnam war section and the outdoor exhibition with vehicles, tanks, field artillery, air craft, armored car, guns from warships, submarines, radar, etc. This really is the place for the whole family, despite the war theme. You can reach the place by subway lines 4 and 6 exit 12. Or buses 149, 150, 151, 152, 500, 501, 502, 504, 506, 507, 605, 750A, 750B, 751, 752, 110B, 730, 421, 600. Get off at the Samgakji bus stop and walk across the street. I took the bus there but the traffic in Soul is rather congested at all times so I suggest the subway."
Nice and intresting.,This place is free admission. A very big place where you can walk around and get information about the country. Also a great place to cool down and for the kids much more exciting then the palace.
Big place to explore,"Overall: - would highly recommend- very informative and you will learn a lot- free!Pros:- this is a huge place, so be prepared to walk both indoors and outdoors- many interactive activities like a free photo booth, and automatic projections/shows that tell stories once you enter the room- wide variety of themesCons:- hard to go to outdoor portion if it's raining hard- building is not very new, although well kept"
Very impressive - especially for History lovers!,It's a very impressive monument to just remember the cost of freedom! The area is in very good shape and walking through it will make you know what it took for Korea to achieve their independence! All the instruments of war also very impressive!
"Large Space, Lots to see",Great museum with lots to see. My favorite part was the outside aircraft expo. The inside is a nice rainy day activity. They often have pop up activities for kids as well (with a fee). Worth a visit if you have an extended stay in Seoul or if you're in the Itaewon area. Definitely go if you have kids!
Incredible,Needs about 3 hours to see wellA worth while objective in depth overview of the warThey even give free books at the entrance regarding the war history. A true gift
Free and informative,"This museum was free and pretty big. There was also an outdoor park with models of tanks, planes, etc. Lots of children running around. It is a good rainy day activity (if you stay inside the museum of course) for travelers on a budget."
Interested in anything military - here is the place!,"Located in between the US Army base in Seoul, this museum has a lot to offer in terms of hardware but also many displays of high quality. Although most of the coverage is geared more towards the modern wars, one can find plenty of artifacts and displays of the Korean battles including the famous the Turtle Ship designed and constructed during Admiral Yi's stewardship. This is definitely not the high quality war museum like Canberra, Australia but definitely worth a visit and you can spend hours inside and outside. Some of the planes and tanks, you can actually touch and climb into. B52 bomber is also displayed in its full majestic self."
Visit to the War Memorial,It is really Hot in Korea now so a visit now is very cool in their Building...Many interesting things of their past history ...Many Items that apply to their growth and things that the past wars helped to create...Take the whole family something for all to see...Have Fun...
Clean city with pleasant people,"Easy to walk around the main city center, hectic on business days. Colorful sights and sounds...wonderful harbor."
impressive,"I was impressed about this memorial. It has a lot of planes and tanks from the WWII from Korean and US. it is located near Samgakji station, very easy to reach with the subway. Good for kids too."
Highly recommend ,Great place to check out if you are interested in history and war in Korea. I was very impressed with the collections. Good place for kids to learn history 
Every time I am in Seoul I always stop here,"I am a history guy, and military history is my drug of choice. it is amazing how this place has changed of the years and it keeps getting better."
Amazing sculpture monuments,A must do in Seoul. It's a museum dedicated to some wars in the Korean past (both ancient and recent). Focus is on the Korean war (1950-1953). Very nicely displayed history facts and lots and lots of war objects actually used in the Korean war. Lots of models of actual aircrafts and ships and a bunch of real ones displayed outside. Super fun! Take a (free) guided tour. The entrance is free as well. The sculptures that welcome you before entering the museum are amazing!!
A must go place to understand Korea,You can see korean history in war perspective. History is all about war and this place is all about the wars in korea fron ancient to modern.Easily accessible by metro and bus.Free admission...Good place to take photos with old war plane and tanks if you are interested. My children were really happy.
Impressive and complete history of wars in Korea,"The memorial is actually a huge museum where the whole history of Korean warfare is displayed. It covers from the Medieval period to present day efforts of the Korean Army. Also there is a lot of attention for the UN and the nations that assisted (South) Korea during the Korean War. The museum is very interesting for all ages, there are a lot of vehicles (Tanks, cars, planes and even boats) displayed, a 3D experience and lots of other different multi-media expositions. I visited this place during a rainy day, unfortunately I wasn't able to see the vehicles in the garden well!"
Wonderful museum,"The Korean war exhibits were very informative and engaging. There are even 4D shows to simulate particular events of the Korean war. I was half-expecting the museum to be all about Korean war, but it also delves into the wars in ancient history, which were very interesting. Best of all, admission is free. Strongly recommend a visit."
Great Korean War(s) Museum,I was very favorably impressed with the careful information and graphics provided in the museum about the Korean War(s). South Korea has gone through much since the 1950s (actually 1910 with Japan) and has recovered as a country with great culture and active development of very world competitive automobiles and technological products.
Wonderful,"This is such a wonderful place to visit for a history buff or anyone that just likes to learn. Both the outdoor and indoor exhibits were excellent. You not only get to learn about the war from the Korean perspective, but you also get to learn about all the other UN forces that fought in Korea. This is a museum that I will visit more than once."
Worth It,"Very good exhibits. The park was well kept. Nice, clean and extremely educational. I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in history."
Very Nice - Must Do,"We were on a business trip and had a free day so we visited this memorial. It was very nice and is something that should be considered a Must-Do if your are in Seoul/Incheon.We rode the rail system over from Incheon Airport and after one transfer it was about a 5 minutes walk.There are great outdoor exhibits (Airplanes, tanks, artillery, etc.), tributes to all the UN supporting countries and those that served/died in this conflict - it is very nicely done.There is also in very large in-door museum (with good air conditioning for when it gets too hot outside), again very nice with lots of history about the Korean War as well as Korea's history going back 1000's of years.When we were there there lots of people but not really overly crowded - wide range of nationalities and ages. Please visit."
A lot to see!,"The war memorial is amazing. I thought I knew a lot about the Korean war, but quickly realized that I didn't. Anyone could easily kill 3-4 hours in here, if you spend the time through the exhibits. I would say it's quite difficult if you go through here with young children, but don't let that turn you away, as I took my 2 and 4 year old through here in 1-2 hours. Definitely recommend!!"
A Must-See,"The War Memorial should be early in any Seoul visitor's itinerary. The museum, which is free, traces the history of the Korean peninsula in a clear and understandable way. Coverage of the Korean War is, understandably, very thorough, and I learned a ton about the conflict. I would set aside several hours for a visit, as it's definitely not a small museum. As an aside, there's a really good museum restaurant in a separate building on the grounds."
Good place to visit,"I enjoyed the museum, lots of good info about the Korean War and a good variety of equipments on the show, highly recommended "
Really detailed for a free musuem,"Assuming you have some interest in history, this museum highlights many parts of korean history (from 3 kingdoms in the Silla period till the korean war). Exhibitions are very organised as they go according to the timeline and prettily presented too. They have some 4D shortfilms (for free of course) and some are pretty entertaining i.e. the fighter jet 4D experience. In comparison with the national musuem, War memorial offers a wider range in the presentation of history and a more surreal experience too. Most descriptions are available in english."
A picture of Korea history,I would recommend to go for this in a day trip as you will have a much more understanding of the history and culture of the modern Korea. This museum is carefully design and try to give as much information as possible.
Must see attraction.,"If you want to learn about Korean history, this is one the most important things to do in Seoul. If you want to party and hang with friends, then still make time to see this place."
Excellent Museum,"This beautiful, modern museum is absolutely massive. It has everything that you could expect from a museum and much more.It has ancient Korean artifacts, real warships, tanks, weaponry and planes, stunning displays and many interactive exhibits.It does an amazing job of honouring the soldiers from around the world that fought in the Korean war and it explains the history of the war in an excellent manner.On our visit we were lucky to see a demonstration of formal marching and gun handling by a large troupe of soldiers.The museum is opposite the ministry of defence compound which is well fortified and is constantly guarded overhead by an armed helicopter."
One of the places you can easily visit,"Accessible, with tourists even the cold season, it helps you realize the history of Seoul and South Korea."
Very interesting and huge museum (totally free of charge),You can spend a whole day wandering through this massive modern and interesting war museum (from ancient weapons to 4D movies). A must when visiting Seoul.
Must see,I've always had a facination with war history and this museum will not fail to impress! Amazing collection of war apparatus outside that has been fielded by the Korean army over the past 60 years. They even have WW2 tanks and vehicles from both the Soviet and American armies. The exhibits inside are really in depth and do a great job at telling the story of the Korean war. We really enjoyed the museum. Don't miss out on this if you're in Seoul!
An excellent memorial,"This war memorial is a must-see when in Seoul. Allow plenty of time as it is very large. If you're interested in war planes, there are numerous ones there to see. "
Incredibly informative tour,"A free English-speaking tour was provided, and the tour guide spoke amazing English. I learned so much about the Korean war!"
You visit this with DMZ Spy Invasion Tour,"Excellent - lots of great information and great planes and other war paraphernalia. The variety of planes of many types and varieties used in the war was terrific. Also, the exhibits to demonstrate this extremely complicated conflict were excellent."
Must Do,"Great museum/memorial highlighting history of Korean warfare. I thought this was only for the Korean War, but it covers much more. Very nice displays and great examples of various uniforms, weapons, and craft. Did I mention there is no fee- this is completely free!!! We took the metro here and got a little confused where the entrance was, as it was not properly marked with signs on the street. There is a place to get a snack as well. Make sure to take a walk outside and view the aircraft and tanks."
War Memorial Museum Korea,"A place must visit , cannot be missed .Only 15 minutes from Chungmoro station - sangaji station walk about 5 minutes to the location . Big Location with big space with aircraft , tanks , ship and heavy machine guns used during Korean War Also you have 2 floor building with another memorial to be visited . Will take half day to complete the tour -worth a visit and reading all the facts of history "
"Extensive amount of info and displays, and actual tanks and planes!","The most popular attraction here was the tanks and planes available just outside the entrance. It's great for kids and enthusiastic adults, as it lets you climb up on top of a few of them, allow you to take photos in front of them, and marvel at just how huge these things look like close up.There was an overwhelming amount of information inside the memorial itself, so I spent an hour on the Korean War section and that was about all I could stand.Being Australian, it was interesting finding the list of soldiers who lost their lives in the Korean war.Just a tip: don't order any food from the nearby on-site restaurant unless you're desperate for a meal (as I was). I grabbed a beef bibimbap and while it wasn't exactly inedible, it was probably the worst meal I had in 2 weeks spent in Korea."
Impressed,"Honestly I had no clue what to expect from this visit - I only seen pictures. When you walk up to the museum/war memorial you are greeted with the sculpture of Two Brothers. Already their story is an indication of what is to come - strong emotions coming from sculptures, war equipment and finally the museum itself. The sculptures in my eyes capture the different feelings of war perfectly, from there you can walk to the war equipment used during the Korean War. You walk along tanks, airplanes, ships and more - in the end there is also a museum that is more suited for children.The museum itself is an experience. On the bottom floor you have the general history of war in Korea and it adds to the understanding of this culture. Slowly you walk towards the Korean War part and honestly it left a deep impression on me. Two sentences in the museum stayed with me:""The noble sacrifice of heros who dedicated their lives to the country will be remembered forever as a ray of light"""" Freedom is not free.""Highly recommend this place!"
Pay Your Respects to all who Sacrificed- A MUST SEE!,"As a middle aged American, married to a Korean for almost 30 years, but NOT military, I can appreciate both sides. The American military that sacrificed to save South Korea during the Korean War and the struggles of the Koreans during that period in South Korean history.It is sad that the younger generations, from both countries, either don't know or don't care about all the sacrifices during the Korean War, and they need to see this Memorial, so they can appreciate where South Korea was and is today, because of all those would suffered and sacrificed"
quite impressive,"Such a beautifully kept museum. So much has been gathered here and is spread over 3 floors. One could spend a full day in this museum and still not be done checking it out. Outside the main building you may find a children's museum, a field showing off military crafts and tanks as well as a ship. Seriously worth seeing! If you understand or speak Korean, you may also enjoy the interactive films shown every once in a while at various places within the museum."
Surprisingly Good - and free,This Museum/Memorial was a good mix of outdoor (lots of actual planes including a B52) and exhibits indoors that tells of the Korean war. I wasn't sure about going but am glad we did.
Don't miss,"Of all the places I went to in Seoul this is definitely a top 5. Be ready to spend several hours as you go in and out the exhibits and the different history war moments of South Korea. Museum has an app for free guided tours but be aware that as of Aug 2016 there is no free wifi on site. So you should download museum app before heading there. Very strange as there are free wifi hotspot almost everywhere in the city. There are also human guided tours free of charge at least 2 times in the day. Admission is free. Loved the outside exhibits is war planes, tanks, helicopters and ships. "
Insight into Korea,Museum isn't heavy even though about war. Planes and tanks outside are great. Informative even in English and some nice storytelling. It's big and by the end was a little over 'war' but worth a visit. Also free which is a bonus. 
Being A Veteran I appreacate this ploace,I have over 33 Years of living in Korea and see as many places that I can. Everyone if they have a chance should go there.Mr. P
Impressive,"One of the most impressive military displays I have seen, A must see for any historians. Covers everything from P-51's to F-4's to B-52's, Mig's, Heavy Artillery pieces to light. An Excellent afternoon well spent.The exterior is Vast and the interior is impressive all to itself. "
Extremely informative ,"I had very little knowledge of the Korean War and after leaving I felt very informed but also left with a deep sense of gratitude. I'm not a history buff nor have I been interested in learning about wars but the display and organization of the museum was captivating! There are many English translations, various formats of explaining the Korean war, and done in a way that was infused with immense gratitude to the countries and soldiers who sacrificed themselves for freedom and democracy.This museum is FREE and is a perfect rainy day activity and is pleasantly air conditioned.Take some time to look around outside - many models of aircraft and tanks. Not only for the kiddies but for adults as well.Closest subway stop: Samgakji (about a 5 min walk)Staff was super friendly.Enjoy! "
A must-see! ,"As a foreigner living in Korea, I definitely needed to find out more about the history of my new country. This place has amazing artefacts on display, along with a comprehensive story to go with each item on display. The artefact story is written in Hangul, English and Chinese - thus catering for travellers. Furthermore, the museum is very interactive and you can immerse yourself into the Korean War with a 4D presentation of the amphibious landings at Incheon. We spent a little more than 4 hours perusing the museum and were not left disappointed! This is a must-see for anyone visiting Korea! "
Amazingly Well Done Museum,Took our four kids here and spent four hours wandering around. We ran out of time or we would have stayed there all day! Get there early at 9 before Korea wakes up and the crowds begin. Take your time and follow the prompts! The museum was done to give you the full experience of war and it does so REALLY well! The UN Corridor was my kids favorite and the tear drop exhibit brought me to just that. Can't wait to go back and see more!
Fantastic exhibits and a good place to go,"The memorial has some of the most well designed exhibits I have ever seen, and is highly foreign language friendly with audio options in English, Chinese, and Japanese for many voiced exhibits and subtitles for videos. Come here if you would like to find out more about Korea's history in war. Also has an entire field of military hardware on exhibit including planes and boats, a great place to go for the history/military buff."
A must to visit ,Very interesting and well presented memorial.We can easly spend half a day in the memorial. Most interesting place visited so far in Seoul 
More than just. MASH,"I walked in and asked if they had an English speaking guide. 10 minutes later, I was introduced to my own special guide who took me around the museum. I realize that Korea has been at war many times and how many countries were involved with the current War"
A place everyone should not missed!,"I went to the war memorial with my small family.We spent like 4 hours at the memorial.We were fascinated with all the weapons, missiles, planes, tanks, war ship (not sure whether full scale or otherwise) etc as we do not have this kind of memorial in our place.Very interesting place to visit and admission was free and open to public."
외국인 친구와 다녀왔습니다,외국인 친구가 DMZ에 가고 싶어했어했는데 못가서 대신 전쟁기념관에 갔습니다.한국전쟁을 비롯 전쟁에 대해 잘 알 수 있는 좋은시간이엇네요 It's a place that you can learn about korean war and korean military.It costs free and it was much better than what i expected.Me and my friend visited here instead of DMZ.
Do not miss,"I was so surprised I spent as much time here as I did. It's well worth visiting. Outside there are various tanks and aircraft, monuments etc and lovely grounds. Inside is beautifully air conditioned and is an opportunity to reflect on the world and learn more about the war amongst some interesting displays."
The Glory of War,"If you're interested in Korean military history and its glorification, the place will definitely please you. Don't expect to see evidence of the horror that wars can cause. "
Modern!,"Only had time for a brief visit, but the exhibits were very modern and had good English information. The outside has a lot of military vehicles which is pretty cool, and would be especially interesting for children I think. Very impressed"
history,great place minimum 4 hours to see everything I got an opportunityto speak to a professor of history about the war which is better than reading a book.
great museum,"This place has large collection of tanks, planes and other war things. would recommend for kids not so much for couples. a great museum nonetheless."
Great Museum,Large variety of military memorabiliaInformational for kids Great rainy day activity Close to the base Friendly Staff
great attaraction,"large collection of military equipment including tanks,artillery and airplanes.easy to get to from subway. friendly staff"
interesting for kids,This is place that is great for kids and those who feel like kids. I wouldn't recommend this for couples. 
World Class Memorials & Museum,"The memorials surrounding the Korean War Museum are works of art that pay tribute to all of the nations that fought in the Korean War as well as seeking reunification between Koreans on both sides of the peninsula. On the left outside of the museum as you face the museum entrance there are large placards with the names of every Soldier who made the ultimate sacrifice for the United Nations Command. They are organized alphabetically and by country (and state for the US). The displays inside the museum provide an accurate and understandable depiction of why the Korean War occurred and the armistice that is still being followed today. The museum curation is world class. There are also numerous documents available for research. Other wars on the Korean peninsula are also covered but my primary interest was the Korean War. I would plan on at least 1-2 hours. If your a history buff, you could easily spend a day or two. It is a 10 minute walk from the Dragon Hill Lodge and has a subway stop right in front of it.If this review was beneficial, please click the helpful button."
Great variety of airplanes/tanks including a B52 bomber on display,"We went there one of the afternoon and were pleasantly surprised by the extensive display of old tanls/artillery/warplanes from the WWII, through Korean war to relatively more current times. "
surprised,Had time to kill so we decided to stop here. I would suggest everyone stop here. It was very nice. Very surprised
Well presented Museum.,The memorial is rather a complete museum. There are many displays and a lot of history in the place. You need a few hours to look at the display. The memorials are detailed and a great piece of art. Well worth a visit to take in the history of Korea's armed conflicts.
Recent history brought home.,Within my lifetime but before my memories.Very well put together and summarises the various years of the war in a good easy to understand manner
Very modern and interesting,"The museum is huge so be prepared to spend there at least 3 hours. Inside you can see memorials of the Korean war and learn about it not only ny reading but also with different videos, exhibitions and a 10-minute-long 3D movie.Outside is a wide exhibition of airplanes, tanks, ships and a kids area."
Thoroughly enjoyed visiting the War Memorial of Korea,Visited the Memorial with my teenage daughter. We both really enjoyed it. The Memorial gives good insight and understanding of Korea's ancient and modern history in a way which is easy to take on board. The Memorial is free to visit and you can easily spend at least half a day here. We've been here for a week now and we've visited a lot of places but this has been one of my favourites so far. 
Must see if you enjoy history,"This is probably one of the best museums I've ever visited, especially considering there is no entrance fee. Just walking around outside you could spend 1-2 hours looking at all the exhibits: planes, tanks, armament, boats, and memorials. The inside is gorgeous and has multiple floors showcasing not only the Korean War but also early Korean history. There are 2 small restaurants and a gift shop inside as well. Easy access to Yongsan Army Garrison. "
Excellent Exhibition of the Korean War,"Thoroughly enjoyed the war memorial. It showcases the Korean War in a detailed way..entry is free and it will take around 4-5 hours to see the entire memorial at a good pace. It is very well maintained and the collections are amazing with all the war planes, tanks, jeeps etc"
Excellent museum!,"I came here on my last day in Seoul and only had about four hours before I had to catch my plane, and I regret only having that long. I think it was my favorite attraction in Korea. Outside there are probably about 100 airplanes, tanks, anti-aircraft guns, armored personnel carriers, and other large pieces of military equipment. Most are American/South Korean, but there were some captured Soviet and Chinese machines as well. Inside they have a lot of information about the Korean War. What I found most interesting was the section where they had tributes and explanations of all UN nations that sent men or aid to the South Korean side during the war, but there were a lot of other exhibits. If you're interested in this type of thing, I would recommend at least 6 hours for this museum."
"Outdoors and In, something to see","The display of military equipment outdoors is 'worth the detour' itself, as well as the sculptures and inscriptions. Inside, the 4D Incheon landing show should not be missed. "
"Very, very insightful","Goes to show: I went in knowing NOTHING about the Korean War, and left completely fascinated.First of all: Free entry! And when you see the size of this thing, thats not something you see everywhere.The information and detail that they give on this devastating time is immense. So much so that I did start skipping rooms I didn't have the energy for anymore.Moral: Give yourself enough time and save up enough energy and this is a spot in Seoul you do NOT want to miss! "
Wonderful and informative museum. Must do in Seoul,"This is an incredibly informative museum that highlights not only the Korean war, but early Korean military history. The outside of the museum has a memorial and a large number of aircrafts and vehicles. The inside of the museum has 3 floors that are all incredibly informative and talks in detail about the Korean war.As someone who isn't a large fan of museums, I found myself spending 4 hours there without even realising it. This museum is incredibly interesting and a must-do if you are in Seoul."
Glorios,"A lot of army machines, very nice place for children to see the army at it's bestFoarte interesant, armament bine păstrat "
Comprehensive War History & Memorial,"Great exhibits covering past 1000+ years of Korea history with specific attention to military battles. Only had time to quickly look at the North vs South war exhibits. Many exhibits of vehicles, uniforms, weapons, etc. Outside is nice collection of planes, tanks, cannons, etc. along with a few monuments.A must see for anyone who has relatives that served in the war."
Moving,I visited the War memorial of Korea when I went to the Korean War Museum. This monument is a sobering reminder of a country torn in two. Take the time to visit this and the museum.
"Great museum, must visit while in Seoul","This museum was a wonderful stop. The buildings are beautiful and the museum is very well done. There are a number of theater rooms and a good overview of the events. The aircraft collection outside are worth a visit as well, just try to visit when it isn't peak heat time of day!"
So impressed! ,"I have never before visited a landmark where I learned so much history! I highly recommend the museum; anyone can visit: children, older folks, any nationality. Detailed documentation from the UN, pictures, lots of information about the many countries which sent troops, and the many brave men who gave all. I am so impressed with the effort to repel the aggression shown by the North Koreans, the Red Chinese, and The USSR."
Great monuments and collection of weapons,"It should be visited when you are in Seoul. It's a sacred place not only for Koreans, but for many other nations. "
Memorable,"A very memorable and educational visit to the War Memorial of Korea in Seoul. There's a haunting and solemn atmosphere on the day we went. If you wish to have a better understanding of the Korean War, you won't be disappointed. "
Compelling,"The museum is incredibly informative and well laid out. It caters for English speakers and is a fitting tribute to all those who fought as part of the UN coalition. The scale of the US contribution is staggering when you walk around the outside of the building and see all the names of those who died carved into the walls. Also impressive is the hardware parked outside. A real B52, a replica gunboat, tanks, helicopters, artillery etc. Can easily spend a day here."
Great Museum,"This is a well designed museum with a lot of interesting artifacts! Being ignorant I assumed the museum focused on the Korean War, but it is a total history of wars in Korea. I was super impressed with the design and impact of the museum."
Poigniant and fascinating,"I visited in pouring rain which distracted from the outside exhibitions. Otherwise a well laid out and professionally run exhibition on the war, ancient wars and also the UN involvement. A little thin on detail here and there but a great place to visit before going to the DMZ. Loved the limousine of Kim il Sung and the iron-clad warship of the middle ages! And it's free. A little confusing to intially get one's bearings but once sorted it is amazing."
Well worth a visit - free open air.,Easy to get to via metro. Interesting outdoor museum. Good for a couple of hours. Situated in a park area.
Bigger and cooler than I thought it'd be,"The highlights of this free museum for me really were the tanks, planes, and guns outside of the museum, but there is a large museum inside dedicated to Korea wars of the ancient past and the Korean War of the 50's. I also loved the video screens scattered around the museum were you push the ""English"" button and get a brief documentary about a Korean battle from the past (in English). Really helped me to understand some of the museum pieces I was looking at. You could spend an entire day here. Kids will love the war machines outside and the ""4D"" movie/ride experiences inside, but after that may get bored. Still, lots of cool war stuff here. "
Interesting and well-designed museum,"we could have spent many hours but only saw the highlights in 2.5 hours in this large museum with gardens and sculptures. many exhibits from the centuries ago, but best parts were the replica warship and the Korean war exhibits. make sure to spend some time in the gardens and sculpture garden too. "
Grand display of history in a modern setting,What impressed me about this grand facility is not only the massive size but also its modern presentation in a picturesque setting. Indoor displays were interesting as well as the outdoor exhibition of armament & sculptures. An impressive destination worth a visit!
A Sensitive Statement by a Divided Nation,The Memorial tells the story of Korean War that began June 26 1950 and has yet to be resolved although hostilities ceased with the armistice in 1953.However the Memorial is much more. It is also a tribute by a grateful nation to all those countries that provided assistance in their hour of need.
Beautiful Memorial ,This is a beautiful memorial to remember the fallen soldiers of the Korean War. The grounds of this war Memorial are pristine. The monuments are beautiful. If you're able to go on memorial day in Korea 6/25. There is an amazing ceremony. 
An insight into Korea,"The was memorial is both a war memorial and a museum built to commemorate the Korean War. There are a number of monuments including Korean War artwork, statue of brothers, a gallery of all the names of those killed in war a special outdoor memorials to the different nationalities who fought with the South Koreans.Inside the museum there are also some older historical artefacts including the turtle shaped battleship, rocket propelled arrows and other historical pieces. The majority of the museum is about he Korean War with exhibits of the student soldiers, the expeditionary forces , donated relics, artwork based on dead soldiers dogtags, a 4D simulation of the landings at Incheon and the other war 4D a separate female armed forces exhibit and armistice signing agreement amongst the sites to see.Outside there is also an exhibition area with planes, armed vehicles and guns plus a life size replica of a warship which fought in the war. If you want to find out more about he war this is the place to go and twin it with a visit to the DMZ for a deeper understanding of Korean politics."
"Excellent museum, good to pair with DMZ tour","We didn't know what to expect from this place, but it was a really well done museum/memorial that kept our teenage boys interest as well as ours. We went on a DMZ tour in the morning (also highly recommended if you have an interest) and the bus dropped us off (at our request) right in front of the memorial when we got back to Seoul. (Not sure if all DMZ tours offer this).If you have a relative or friend who perished in this conflict there is a kiosk to look them up. The statues were grand and moving and the interior exhibits were really well done and gave a very clear overview of the conflict. We learned so many things that we didn't know. Highly recommended to get an understanding of this war that continues to shape life on the Korean peninsula."
Free,"It was a great day in the rain, we just wondered the place. It was interesting. It is maybe a 1-2 hours visit, if the weather is good there is a lot to see outside too. I recommend to do it if you have time."
Amazing history ,"This place is a must for everyone. The place is amazing, full of history regards the forgotten war the Korean war. If you put it in your schedule allow at least 2 to 3hrs it's huge and you should not rush it. 3 levels of museum, then there is the huge outside area. 1 of the best museums I've been to out of any country. Highly recommended"
Lovely and free,"We just arrived in korea a couple of a days ago and are staying at the dragon hill. This museum is easily accessible through gate 1 or by gate 16 (but a bit further of a walk from 16). We found this museum to be excellent. Lots of areas have ramps so it is easy to have a stroller here. There is also a food court outside the museum and a small cafe with sandwiches inside. The exhibits are everywhere, outside there are tanks, planes, sculptures and memorials. Inside are displays that are relics of the Korean people that document their history. Very educational. We were able to see the description title of most objects in english, a couple of videos as well have buttons that can be clicked for English too. "
"Statues, old weapons","Interesting and outdoors, this is one of the must-see attractions in Seoul. Large scale and a good spot for photographs."
Nice Historical Place,A place to visit if you wish to have some historical view of the independence fighters. Nice place to get some snapshots.
Worth your Time and Attention,"This museum can be done quickly in two hours or all day long. Depends on how much you would like to learn. It is indeed about all of Korea's wars going back through history, not just it's most recent. Everything is titled well in English and I had random Korean veterans pop up and explain things to me about the Korean war. The Memorial room was beautiful and poignant. Also really loved the grounds and statuary. As a side note it currently has an Impressionist exhibit which you are charged for if you want something different."
Very interesting and beautifully designed ,Highly recommend visiting the war memorial. Good exhibitions internally and also outside. Suggest spending a couple of hours there at least
So much to see,"This place is almost overwhelming with content. First, there is the outdoor exhibition, which consists of numerous airplanes, tanks, mobile guns, and personnel carriers. You can't get into any of the aircraft, but you can climb into the personnel carriers, and there is a replica of a sunken patrol boat that you can explore pretty much unhindered. There is a children's museum and play ground. Playground is outdoors and unshaded, but it's something to do. I never went into the Children's museum, but my wife and daughter did. Kids are only allowed in at the top of the hour, there is limited (free) admission, and kids are asked to leave after 50 minutes. Daughter had lots of fun, but didn't get to do everything there was to do. Inside there is a section devoted to Korea's early wars, three rooms devoted to the Korean War, a room about the UN, and a room about the ROK's later military involvement. It was all well done, fascinating, and even interesting for a toddler (without being too traumatizing). Seeing everything is going to take a full day. Highly recommended. "
"Highly educational, free museum. Great way to spend a day!","Well organized museum. Very interesting and large exhibits. You can go at your own pace and take a free tour if you wish. As someone who never learned about this in school in the US, it was fascinating to learn it all from the perspective of South Korea! Afternoon well spent."
Could spend the whole day here,"This is a vast museum covering every aspect of the Korean War. The best way to get through it is with free guided tour at 10am in English which shows you the highlights. There's big tech and low tech displays, 3D theatre, VR display, outdoor ships and planes to explore. The cafe downstairs is basic but there are limited food options. A few subway stops near by depending on which line you are on: light blue track is closest, dark blue further away. Can catch the light blue line to the Korean national museum as your next destination if you have time to spare. "
"Big, loaded with school groups","Lots of exhibits but I guess more things to see instead of things to read, I like learning but with all the kids this was definitely more visual with its pieces then thoughtful. Definitely worth a stop and photos because its campus is incredible. "
Must do in Seoul,"We were greated at the door by an English speaking member of the memorial staff. He was so helpful, explaining what to do first and walking us there. He suggested seeing a short film on the third floor and then working our way around. Great advice! Plan to spend several hours there to fully experience everything. If you are looking for lunch, most of the food is actually outside of the building, to the left of the front entrance. "
A Must See,"This modern museum fully captures the Korean, US and UN contributions to the Korean War. Exhibits are artful and informative. While most exhibits are presented in Hangul, many have English translation. English tour guides are also available. "
Definite yes for travelers on a budget,"Not only does the War Memorial of Korea allow for much learning about Korean history, but it is a great museum for keeping attention. There are activities for children outside as well as all the old planes and tanks to climb on. There are also numerous exhibits that everyone in our group, children and adults, enjoyed like the Turtle Ship and Vietnam war dioramas. Because it's free, it is possible to split into a couple visits if you are visiting many museums to void getting museum weary here, because all of the museum is really worth time to see."
War Memorial,Big museum with extensive historical information on the Korean War. I was surprised that Koreans also like to hold their weddings here.
Great place to know Korea history ,"The war of memorial ok Korea is near to where I'm stay in Seoul, so I go visit here during my last day, my flight day. I'd check official web site of the museum, noted there is free introduction tour at certain time. So on the day, I just go to the information counter and ask for it. The volunteer who bring us around and telling history is a vigorous retired history teacher. She do introduced how war is being start in Korea and how's the latest relationship of south and North Korea. It is quite interesting to know Korea from South Korean aspects.I do enjoy my visit here."
What a place,Travelled the world one of the best places been to. Many historical facts and displays. Great weaponary on show from many wars in particular the Korean one. Very peaceful and humbling.
Memory Tour,Great review all the history btw North and South Korea War. Can imagine the people life is full of pain and hard during the period.
First rate experience,A very well laid out and complete memorial. Could have spent a full day here but didn't have the time. A must see for any visit to Seoul.
A big space with very little in it,"With all respect due to those who gave their lives in the Korean War, this museum is a waste of time. A massive space that just gives propaganda about the victory of 'democracy' over 'communism'. Very little about the lives of non-combattants. If you really want to feel the raw emotional power of what soldiers went through, visit the memorial to the Gloucester regiment in their defence of Hill 235 in Paju, north of Seoul. The only good thing for me in the memorial was the mockup of a turtle ship used by Admiral Yi to defeat the Japanese invasion of Korea in the 16th century. Korea deserves a better memorial than this."
Informative Place ,You shouldn't miss this place. They have already exhibit of actual guns and tanks that you can have photo opportunities. 
Great place,It's a wonderful place to learn about Korean War. Be ready to spent at least half a day. Cafeteria has great food. It's a great way to spent a rainy day n best it's FREE
A good place to start your trip to Seoul,"This museum has a huge outside component with monuments and military machine museum which includes a variety of aircraft, tanks, and missiles. A good place to learn about Koreas troubled past and appreciate how far this country has come. "
Worthwhile inside and out,"With lots of military equipment outside and historical information inside this museum has something for all military enthusiasts. Leave plenty of time to walk around the outside and inside. If you have time, take the English language tour inside and hopefully you will get as well informed guide as I had. I wanted to focus on the Korean War and he really wanted me to understand who the Korean people were and how the war fitted in their view of themselves."
Go!,"We really enjoyed this museum. We went on a rainy day, it had cleared up in the afternoon for us to go out and see the outside planes and ship. There is a lot to see in this museum. It can move you to tears at times. If you enjoy this type of museum, I highly recommend going. And it is FREE. "
Outdoor exhibit area 1 of the best,"Firstly, this place is incredibly big! I went with friends and we spent almost 2hours just on the outdoor exhibit area alone. Displayed in the outdoor exhibition area are all manners of tanks, planes, AA/AT guns, and helicopters. For those interested in war history/machines but not served in military, I feel this is the best place to see some of these up close and personal. The collection included US/Korean/Soviet/Chinese models as well.Inside the museum itself, I found the section on the Korean War really informative and fascinating. Having grown up in a country not involved in the war, it was interesting to get an introduction to some of the issues, key dates & personnel. It sparked my interest to read more about it now that I'm back home.Well worth a visit for the military history buffs"
Awesome,This place is giant. Tons of things to see with many years of war history inside. We got there towards the end of the day so we were a little rushed. The exhibits were way cool.
A Must See Site,This amazing museum gives travelers a great feel for the history of Korea. A history of fighting for their land for centuries. A country that has been taken over many times. It has one of the largest displays of military hardware I have ever seen displayed. Allow 2 to 3 hours to take in the sculptures outside and all the galleries.
Very historic,"A must for history buffs. It is free and easy to access by the Seoul subway. The memorial is for the many folks who died in the Korean War which took place from 1950-1953. South Korea was helped by many countries during the war as part of the United Nations. All the names of folks who died are inscribed on the walls.Also, there are many aircrafts, tanks, and other vehicles used during the war are on display. "
Probably the most underrated place we visited in Seoul,"The memorial and grounds are beautiful, but the museum is really what should not be missed. It's free, the collections are vast, and it provides not only the historical context for the Korean War, but an excellent tutorial on Korean history in general. I'd recommend planning about 2 hours for a visit."
Informative and amazing,"For all history buffs and cultural enthusiasts, this memorial which is free to enter is a great place to spend hours getting lost in their Korea's extensive history. What is more remarkable is their extensive coverage as well as use of eye catching videos, visuals, statues, 4D rides, models, posters, real life relics. Amazing place!"
Surprised ,A lot more here than expected. Very large and beautiful. Great history exhibits. Walkable from Itaewon metro station 
Well worth a visit,"A nicely laid out exhibit, very educational and I had no idea how many nations were involved in the Korean War.Very peaceful and you can walk around at your own pace.A big selection of wartime hardware on display outside, too."
RELIVE THE KOREAN WARS FROM ANTIQUITY TO THE LAST KOREAN WAR,"You get to see paintings and dioramas associated with different wars in the Korean Peninsula. You even get to feel all the action with a 4D Simulation and all of this is for free.If you like boats and planes the museum garden is full of them, besides having tanks and even Mig planes"
A Must-Go - a real look at Korean Psyche,"A must-visit at Seoul, the museum really showcases the warring histories of Korea from the beginning of time till today.A large majority of the displays are dedicated to the Korean War period and even a history buff like myself saw so many things that I never knew existed, including telegrams to Stalin from Kim, or if that doesn't appeal to you, there are multiple 4D shows and modern exhibits including recent conflicts with the North."
Interesting and Sad,"You want to visit this place to better understand the conflict between North and South Korea. There's an AVP in one room where you can watch some old footages. They also have a hallway that displayed names of fallen soldiers from different countries etched in granite stones. It's terrible to see though how many people suffered, but it's a good education. When we were there, the place was packed with students. "
The War Memorial of Korea - the Korean People's Heroic Fight for Freedom,"In a country that has had more than its fair share of warfare and suffering, the War Memorial should be at the top of every tourist's itinerary in South Korea. It takes the viewer back in time to explain how the Goguryeo General Eulji Mundeok's troops had routed a 300,000 strong Sui army in 612 AD. There are interesting early examples of Korean weapons systems that had changed the course of Korean history.The Shin Gi Geon Hwa Cha was a wheeled rocket launcher than could fire 100 rocket-propelled arrows simultaneously.The carnage at the receiving end must have been terrible.The most outstanding Korean-designed weapon system was the famed Turtle Ship, A 1:2.5 scale model of it is on display It was brilliantly well designed by Admiral Yi Sun-sin. It was fully enclosed to protect the crew, while the roof was covered with sharp nails to prevent an enemy boarding party from getting a foothold. The very small sail probably meant that it could not travel very fast. These ships had won Korea many a sea battle against the Japanese.A large number of exhibits naturally cover the Korean War when Communist North Korea had made a surprise attack on the South, and had over-run it in a matter of a few days. The Republic of Korean (RoK) troops, later jointed by the United Nations troops, had fought back heroically to turn the tide. It was General Douglas McArthur's famous Incheon Landing on 15 September 1950 that had turned the tide of war, which later moved for the first time north of the 38th parallel .The war finally ended when an armistice was signed. Among the displays are captured North Korean weapons, including a Russian-made MiG-19 and an An-2 transport aircraft. Numerous poignant photographs of the people's suffering form a wrenching experience.There are numerous exhibits on the Korean armed forces of today. An interesting one is a Korean-designed light, unmanned attack vehicle.Outside the main building,in the open, are a range of aircraft that had been used by South Korea during the war. These include a Cessna T-37 trainer, F-5, F-86 and F-86D fighters, A Curtiss C-46 Commando and C-123 transport aircraft, and - amazingly - even an eight-engined Boeing B-52 bomber. It is quite a sight. It is quite an experience for those -like this writer - who had lived through the Korean War.Hormuz Mama."
Great Display of Honor,This is one of the most impressive memorials I have ever seen. You can feel the great-fullness had by the Korea people for the sacrifices so many have made in the years of conflict. The displays are incredible both inside and outside the building. 
A must visit in Seoul!,Visit this instead of paying huge money for the DMZ tour. You'll learn a lot more about the history and the culture of the korean people plus access is FREE! We hightly recommend it! 
Engaging and educational ,"I found the Memorial very good with lots of history easy to understand and learn. The videos were enjoyable. The war machinery outside was great to be able to touch and climb in and on for some. I may not like seeing any war occur, however it is a reality that they are some evil and greedy people and we need to defend freedom and equality. "
Very educational,"I didn't know much about Korea upon arriving so me and a friend decided to visit the war memorial. If you're on USAG Yongsan, it's within walking distance. Outside the museum, once you walk through the statue listed in the thumbnail for the museum there's an assortment of airplanes, tanks, artillery, ground vehicles, and a replica of PKM-357. Within the ship, you can see a video that outlines what happened to the ship during the Second Battle of Yeonpyeong and see the memorial to the six Sailors that were killed.Inside the museum, once you figure out which time period you want to brush on, head in that direction and prepare to be immersed in a visual history lesson. It took me about an hour to rush through half of the Korean War section. The museum does have exhibits that are put on from time to time that you have to pay to see, but the museum as a whole is free to explore. There's a diverse refreshment stand near the front entrance and lockers for bags and coats you don't want to tote throughout the day (bring a 100 piece for the locker).Unless you come when they open and stay until they close, covering the entire museum is a multi-visit endeavor."
Wonderful museum and admission was FREE!!!,This was a great indoor activity on a cold December day in Seoul. The museum has many wonderful exhibits that movingly portrayed the events and human cost of the Korean War.
"Interactive, Informative, Accessible and Fre",Really enjoyed my morning at the Memorial. There are several floors and exhibits inside and outside of the museum. The facility is quite accessible and is not far from an elevator from the Samgakji station. All exhibits and video presentations are translated or subtitled into several languages and I really felt the appreciation for international support provided to Korea during the war. There are free luggage lockers and a few cafes and you can easily spend 2-4 hours roaming around. 
Blown away by quality and size of the museum and grounds,Very impressed with the quality of the displays and presentations. You can use your cell phone to scan a code at different displays to get translations. Many sections have 4 language options. There is plenty to read and see in English without the cell phone scans.Great use of technology and visual displays. The sculptures and military equipment surrounding the museum are moving and interesting as well.Only had time to go through the Korean War sections but there are many more sections to see. Museum is closed on Mondays but the grounds are always accessible.
A large war museum that helps you understand Korea today,"I wasn't initially planning to go, but when my wife proposed a visit, I thought why not? Visiting this museum was the right decision!This is one of the largest war museums in the world, with displays of ancient Korean weaponry to modern equipment. They even have a B52 bomber outside, and a replica of a salvaged South Korean naval vessel sunk by the North (with damage and bullet holes marked in red). Much of the museum is taken up by very informative displays on the Korean War. It was a real education.There was a '4-D' simulator ride that took visitors back to the bold 1950 Incheon landings, complete with water and air-sprays.Outside there was a memorial hall listing the names of soldiers killed in the Korean War and a static display of military vehicles.And it is all free! Well worth a visit!"
Extensive museum about the korean war,"The museum is easily accessible, its free entry, free tour guides, a lot of history and culture can be learned here, not just about the Korean War but also how the evolution of Korean weapons and vehicles were made, as well as how Korean army would look like in the future. Really cool stuff."
Very informative,It takes three or four hours to finish the exhibition. Very informative and much fun for learning Korean history.
Touching,It was touching to see the tribute of the Korean Government to the Filipino soldiers who died during the war.
Helps you understand the North/South Situation,"South Korea are a very proud nation and extremely proud of their armed forces; national service is still in place. A museum that tells a storey, the past and potentially the future, with thanks and praise to those countries who helped them during the invasion. Very good!"
"Often called the ""forgotten"" war","This is a huge museum and memorial. While the museum focus is on the Korean War with its ongoing issues, it also contains displays and information on the history of the Korean peninsula, its peoples and culture and its interactions with its neighbours. It provides an insight to the anguish the South Koreans suffer by being split into two and their desire for reunification.The museum has an comprehensive explanation on the causes of the Korean War, its progress ( and how close it came to be over-run) and the final outcomes. Add to this the extensive display of military machines, aircraft and ships inside and out. All the display boards are multi-lingual.The memorial wall lists all those that gave their lives from all the participating countries along with country specific markers around the central courtyard listing the sacrifices these countries made to the war.Plan for a long day to explore all that it has to offer including some of the ever popular ""3D"" experiences that are run regularly. It has a number of small cafes for food and drinks. Oh and don't forget - while it is free, it is closed Mondays."
Very humbling experience ,"My wife, son and I were excoriated by our Korean exchange student and his mom. The Korean's are very thankful for the Americans help. I was moved at the respect for America by the Koreans. I hope everyone has a chance to experience this and never forget the sacrifice made. May God continue to bless America and South Korea!! "
Worth a visit,"This is a beautiful, big, well played out museum. It's certainly worth a trip. There's a fantastic collection of vehicles and planes outside, and a ship to go on. Inside, it's interactive, and informative. We wished we'd timed the 3D shows, but we missed them each time and didn't feel like going back for them. As the Korean War is technically not over, the Korean War section helps you understand past and present of Korea."
Fascinating place!,"Lots of history here, going back to ancient times and up to the present. Lots of airplanes, as well as ships and tanks. Gives thorough history of Korean War."
Chronicles the rich history of Korea,"Due to shortage of time, we couldn't visit all of the sections of the museum, but it has a fascinating collection of war history and memorabilia. The outdoor display of warships, tanks and planes was very interesting. "
It definitely deserves to be no.1 attraction in Seoul and Tripadvisor,"If you love history, you can spend a day in the war memorial. The memorial offers an english tour at 10 AM. Our tour guide was really good and explained the whole Korean war really well. The tour is free. "
A great story well told,"A great museum, well laid out and tells the fascinating story of the Korean War. We were lucky enough to be shown around by an English speaking volunteer who spent almost 2 hours with the 2 of us - and it was for free. Recommend this to anyone - just ask about the free guide"
"Amazing and interesting way to know Korea/World war history, good activity for kids","-Interesting and thrilling museum that contains everything you wanted to know and more about the history of war, cold war and it's effects.Is totally suitable for kids, but expect a lot of question that will be though to answer (like why many people had to die??!!)-Kids will have so much fun with the planes, tanks, and all the war gear that is available to jump on and take a picture.-Plan for aprox 3 hrs to spend here.-Place is suitable for strollers-Entrance is free"
Would have been awesome!,Was only lucky enough to see the museum from the outside as I wasn't aware they closed their doors on Monday. Putting it out there so no one misses out like me. Will be my must do's when I come back to Seoul
Awesome museum,"It’s always great to visit museums in other countries because the history of the nation can be viewed through the eyes of the people. Too often, the war memorials in some places such as Vietnam and China, are full of propaganda. Here, the people just want their country to be unified and free from tyranny. There is so much to see and do here. I especially liked the planes and tanks. The signs are bilingual so it is easy to understand the history. It’s still sad to think about the lives that were lost on both sides and it is a great place to reflect upon our own individual freedom!"
Outstanding,"An expansive and very impressive memorial. We spent 5 hours at the war memorial but could have spent more time. There is an extensive outdoor display of aircraft (including a B52), tanks, missiles and a exact replica of a Korean patrol boat.In the time we had we focussed on the outdoor displays together with the 3 halls devoted to the Korean War.A MUST do when visiting Seoul."
Best thing to visit in seoul,Huge and well done explanation of korean war nice to see all the materiel outside. Best thing original documents and communications around the secret agreements before the war
Good for both young and old,"Both my dad and young son loved this place especially the outdoor area where we could go up close to planes, helicopters, tanks, etc. Good photo opportunities and best of all, all free! Exhibits indoors were informative and the 4D experience rather memorable. I was able to really feel the realities of war and the current need to preserve peace going through them. Stroller was available for rent (free) and premises stroller friendly. My dad also managed to collect a free book on the history of Korea and the war, making him a very happy man."
Absolutely amazing,"Been to a number of similar museums throughout the world, but this one is one of the best. The place is enormous, you could spend an entire day here. Free entry. Asked about English guide thinking electronic device and had this young student Amanda take us around free of charge again. Her knowledge and insights were amazing. A must see"
Learned a lot!!!!,If you want to learn about the Korean War then this is the place to go they have all of the planes and tanks ever used in the war on display it's huge I would recommend spending three to six hours it's intense it's very well done and you learn a lot it's very informativeIt's also good for any age little kids who love it too old people so anybody will love coming here
Amazing presentation of Korean War history,"Don't think that this war memorial is just a cenotaph with lists of the war dead. It is far more than that. It is a major museum with extensive displays and video presentations of events leading up to and following this war that ended in 1953. The museum includes a collection of the weapons of war from that period. You will find many displays that recognize the military contributions of many countries that helped prevent the entire Korean peninsula becoming like North Korea. You will also walk away with an appreciation of the amazing achievement that is modern Seoul, a city built from nothing but war since 1953."
Truly Amazing! ,"This is a must do for history buffs. We really enjoyed the planes, tanks, and boats. This is one of those tours that you can do on your own or with a guide. I wasn't thrilled when we stopped here, but I have to admit it didn't disappoint. Each room gave a glimpse to what was happening during the way. An amazing collection of memorabilia. "
A must if visiting Seoul,"Myself and my partner arrived knowing next to nothing about the Korean war and left feeling like experts but without ever being bored or having too much information forced upon us. The grounds the memorial is in are great to walk around, the statues and flags around the entrance are interesting enough themselves for half an hour to an hour. The museum itself is very well done and respectful, it takes visitors through the war from the very beginning to the present day situation - this is done without too much of a feeling of propaganda or bias. We tagged along half way through a free tour in English and the guide was informative and spoke excellent English. The ground floor is a bonus and gives a good overview of Korean history from 0 AD up until the war beginning 1950 (which is then covered on the top 2 floors). Anyone visiting Seoul should make this a priority."
Historical learning experience,I recommend the War Memorial of Korea as a must-see on anyone's list of things to do. The Memorial offers such an intense learning experience.
Good museum; Avoid volunteer tours,"The museums is very good and you can spend a few hours here. We took a volunteer student tour, which was very very poor. We actually had to read everything ourselves. The museum otherwise is impressive"
Good for knowledge,"Spent about 3.5 hours here. Very good for a history lesson. There are indoors and outdoors. On the outdoors, you can see tanks and planes that were used in the warOn the indoors there are 3 levels here so take your time to walk around. There are information on every display. Take your time to read or take a picture. Some rooms have a short 3-D movie about 5 mins. Its really exciting. Please be quiet here (especially if you are indoors) and if you have children because this is not allowed for kids running around or talking loudly"
One of the best museums I have ever visited.,"As an American sometimes i get caught up in thinking that the world revolves around us. This museum was a great reminder that Korea was a country with a military history long before the Korean war in 1950. However, the section of the museum dedicated to that portion of history represents itself very well. "
A Place In History,It is an interesting and informative institution to visit. A place full of Korean modern history. It show case the pain and suffering of the Korean people. One just wonders how mankind could destroy each other just over different ideology and influence. Friends and families were permanently separated. War is not an alternative to peace. 
inspiring reflections,"An interesting juxtaposition of ancient military technology with the modern one, including B-52 bomber. An eye-opening historical account of the Korean War and the international support and participation. Need 3-4 hours to visit. "
excellent and extensive,"This museum will keep you very busy. Key battles are explained with short videos and plenty of information. Several pieces of military equipment, including tanks and planes are here. I can't think of anything more you could ask for in a military museum. Even non-military or history buffs will find it fascinating. The most extensive part is the Korean War section but my favorite area was the area covering the wars between the 3 kingdoms and Koreans defense against the Japanese in the 16th century. Plan 2 hours for non-history lovers, military and history lovers will need 4 or more hours."
Interesting look into the history of Korean warfare,"Korea's museums generally aren't the best, but this war museum at Samgakji breaks the mold. As well as a fascinating insight into the Korean War, there are exhibits showing a replica of Yi Sun-shin's turtle boat, and when I went there, they had the remnants of the North Korean missile that sunk the Cheonan. If you're only in Seoul for a few days, this should definitely be on the 'must-do' list."
War Memorial ,Very touching and emotional one if you lost a loved one during the Korean War...we did rubbings of our loved ones names on the bronze Wall of Remberance on mulberry paper. Museum was very historical. Great visit!
The best war museum in the world! ,"I love the history between North and South Korea and looked very much forward to the visit. Had 3 hours spared just for this museum and turned out I was there fore 4 hours. It is that amazing in my opinion! So many different exhibits explaining the build up from the Japanese invasion to the regain as Korea, to Kim il sung's invasion and the support from the UN, down to how the DMZ was formed and for the thoughts of reunification. Learnt so much from this visit!"
Worth to visit with kids ,"I've been there several times with my family. Good interesting and peaceful place :). Have different kinds of military transport like ship, airplanes and tanks displayed outside in the park near museum. Your kids gonna love it 'cuz they can touch and try everything. They hold the traditional wedding ceremony sometimes it was interesting to look at for us one day. And the museum inside is good as well. Not the best one I think but worth to visit. In the same building you can find different expositions not related to war. "
Awesome museum,Loved this museum as there was so much to see and learn. Kids (ages 11 and 9) came away with alot of new knowledge. Took 4 hours to go through it all. Highly recommend for age - awesome place. 
The War Museum and festival,"I visited during May and there was a festival going on....families, kids, picnics. Such a sight to see! The museum and memorial was comprehensive, very informative and quite moving. Go!"
The place to be for everyone wanting to know more on the history of the Korean war,"If you are interested in military stuff you can easily allocate 1 whole day for this site.So much to see and so much to read!Be sure not to miss the 4D movie theaters on level 3 (1 show per hour)Best of all, its free! :)"
Understanding Korean Culture,"A visit to The War Memorial of Korea helps give insight to the Korean Culture of today. After all, the War happened in a not so distant past. There are guided tours in English at 2:00pm and some time in the morning, as well."
Fitting to visit during (USA) Memorial Day Weekend,Great museum. Huge place. Free!Impressive museum albeit a sad 'event.'It was warm inside although comfortable temps outside.
surprisingly interesting,"Lots to see outdoors and indoors, we were not planning to go but our tour bus was letting some people out at the end of the day so we jumped out. One of the few free attraction and we were not disappointed. "
A very interesting place to visit,Spent almost 3 hours walking around and found it very interesting and informative. Would highly recommend
Really moving and learning experience,"Since my father was in the Korean War, it was a must see for me. It is great to know that so many countries came to the aid of a country and people that they had never met. This has the history of south Korea through various wars, and also many monuments to honor the soldiers who died, from the US and other allies to protect them."
Poignant,Interesting museum with some great exhibits outside including a B52 bomber. Well laid out inside telling the whole history of Koreas past and not just the 1950/53 war. The tear drop made from dog tags was especially thought provoking.
A military mustsee,"If you are into Military History then you will enjoy this site. I had 2.5 hours there and it wasn't nearly enough. Well laid out with a really nice outdoor exhibit featuring a lot of ""hardware"" I found it very fascinating. Myonly disappointment was there wasn't a lot of information on our Australian involvement that I could see; but I may have missed it on one of the numerous audio visual . Theere are English Speaking Guides if required but I just wandered around and still enjoyed it."
Absolutely amazing place,"A very moving experience. It was fabulous would recommend anyone any age to visit. So much history. The displays are brilliantly done and the voice-overs make the displays better including the aircraft,military vehicle etc.Well worth a visit."
History history history,Enjoyed this museum tremendously. This is so informative and loved that mostly all provided English information. There are 3 D films and so many items to see. Family friendly and FREE!! 
Great Visit,"Right up there with the Imperial War Museum London and the Australian War Memorial, Canberra. Many exhibits of the surprising violent Korean past (outside of the 1950 war). Lots of exhibits, with strong focus on the north/south divide. It takes a good couple of hours to see the place in full including the array of aircraft and armored vehicles outside including a B52!"
Not just one war,"This is a museum about all Korean wars since before history. And this country has gone from one war to another. It is an imponent place from the outside and big enough inside to accomodate ancient ships, helicopters, anti-aereal defense, tanks and others. But what I liked the most was a great panel that shows parallel historical landmarks happening at western and eastern worlds. "
Beautiful and Meaningful,"Originally, I went along to see the War Memorial of Korea because my husband wanted to go. I was pleasantly surprised at how lovely the museum was. The entire museum is based on the single phrase that ""Freedom is not free"". Not only is the historical portrayal well done, back into the early Korean dynasties, but the Korean War section itself shows not only the military history, but also the impact of the many countries that helped South Korea win was, and how thankful the Koreans are for the assistance. The art was high quality, and evoked a deep and thoughtful emotional response that surprised me! My son-in-law is an officer in the US Marines, and my father fought in the Korean War, and I found the exhibit a pleasant complement to the exhibit at the Marine Corps Museum in Quantico, VA."
Truly amazing.... You could spend so much time here,"Truly an amazing experience. This country has so much war history, to even have the chance to learn a small bit about it while I was here was unbelievably fascinating. You couldn't visit South Korea and not make a trip here. Well worth it!!"
If you like history its a must visit,"I was exploring the outside with all the airplanes, rockers and armored vehicles. Took lots of photos. I run out of time inside so next time i will visit again. Its sad to see how many people died because of this nonsense war."
Incredible site ,"We went to the Korean War memorial, it is very nice. The site has many static display's of aircraft and tanks from the Korean War. The monuments are inspiring and very thoughtful. It is a short walk from Iaetwon."
"Very Interesting, Humungous, Museum","Spent the morning going through the museum among Korean kids on a field trip who were delighted to practice their English on us with many ""Hellos"" and giggles. This museum covers wars in Korea from the very beginning with many interesting exhibits. Me, my sister and nephew were mostly interested in the Korean War as our father (grandfather) served in that war. We were glad we visited and this is a museum not to be missed if you are in Seoul for any length of time."
Good Museum,"i love this museum. i could find all information about war memorial between south and north korea. the place are big, from inside and outside are awesome place, i could find movie 3D about war memorial of korea "
Top in Korea for history and culture. ,"I have traveled throughout Korea and this is my favorite place. It's magnificent and solemn. The lessons I learned about the struggles of the Korean people for freedom and the Alliances and sacrifices that earned their freedom opened my perspective not only about the Korean War, but the world. I fell in love with the Korean People. I highly recommend this visit as one of your first experiences in Korea. Especially if you are unfamiliar with the Korean War or you think you are. It is impossible to see the entire museum in one day, so we picked a section indoors and out and plan on returning with family and friends. Noksapyeong station exit 2 or samgachi exit 1/2. It's a quick cab ride from itaewon or Yongsan stations. "
Excellent museum ,We had 2 hours to spend and ran out of time. This is an interactive and huge museum with lots of nice + real objects!!Truly the best in Seoul and free of charge even!We certainly plan to go back. 
Awesome very important memorial. Must see!,"Spent a couple hours here and never even made it inside. Great exhibits with statues, aircraft, vehicles, tanks, missiles...even a Korean Navy ship! Can't wait to go back to fully explore this place. #1 stop in Seoul for a reason folks."
Really great historical review,"This museum is very well done and very interesting for a subject that's mostly about dates and events and historical figures. My favorite part was the timeline that compares Eastern history, Western history and Korean history during the same time periods back to paleolithic period. The Korean war section is very moving and is full of memorabilia from the UN countries who helped during the war."
Great selection of military machines!,"We chose to go to the museum on a Monday !... Don't it's CLOSED!!... But you can walk around the grounds and see the war memorials of all the countries who have served during all the battles over the decades. Great presentation of air- land and aquatic machines used during the War... Great photo opportunities to get a picture of you in a tank or playing ""Top Gun"" with the various helecopters on display.. Disappointed the museum was closed but wasn't a wasted visit ... Very touching and humbling experience .."
Spend an hour spend a day,"This war manorial offers a great guide into the dark history of Korea.Showing the times of fear and joy during the Korean war, the Japanese invasion and dating all the way back to the Joeson period too.Free admission buy I usually give a donation.There are free tour guides and almost all of the objects and exhibits are in English too.Depending on how much of a history or military buff you are, this may be a 1hr visit our a whole day trip. There is also a reasonable priced cafe to take a rest and lockers to store your bags for those who have travel or shopping bags. "
Essential part of any Seoul itinerary,"Came here after visiting the National Museum (it's one stop away), and I enjoyed this museum more. Not a fan of military history, but the details of the horrors of war and the memorials make this a memorable and sobering visit. I was there for 1.5 hours so I didn't have time to dawdle around the various individual exhibits/military vehicles outside the museum, but I did go for the 4D experience room. I would recommend a longer stay. The effects are not the best, but it is chilling to watch the clip because it really does try and place you in the midst of the war and imagine the various struggles the civilians and soldiers had to go through. The surroundings of the museum is really beautiful in the late afternoon light during spring, and the flowers are gorgeous.An essential part of any Seoul itinerary, because it is necessary to remember that beneath the glitz and glamour of modern day South Korea, such a war happened and is still happening."
Spending half day for one museum,"I love visiting museums and South Korea established many interesting ones. As a university student, I learned so much from here. Exhibition is well arranged with clear English translation and directions. Situated not that far from subway, it is walking distance. I would recommend this museum to other friends."
Definitely worth a visit,When rain descended on Seoul we decided to visit this museum and it was incredible. The museum is free although donations are appreciated. A lot of the museum is dedicated to the war in the 50's and this is clearly set out with lots of information and many interactive exhibits. It's truly humbling. The upper floor is almost solely dedicated to outlining the support relieved from their allies and everyone country is thanked in detail showing how their individual support helped the effort. The memorials outside are equally thought provoking and stunning. If you visit Seoul this is a must see to help you understand the incredibly history of Korea which affects them to this day.
Interesting,A good museum with many good displays. Unfortunately the changing of the guard did not take place when we thought it would.
"Interesting museum, but try to go on a guided tour ","I visited this museum on my own. It's large and has extensive exhibits about various wars that Korea has been involved in over thousands of years. The largest component is the exhibits about the Korean War in the 1950s. As I walked through the exhibits on my own, I felt overwhelmed by the quantity of information and was having a hard time taking it all in. I caught up with and joined an English-language tour guide and found that to be a better experience. The guide was very good; he was knowledgeable, his English was excellent, and he picked out highlights from the exhibits to show and explain to us. I certainly learned a lot about Korean history from him and from my visit to the museum--I recommend visiting and joining a guided tour!"
Humbling Experience,"I wish I had more time to spend at this War Memorial. I have always looked up to those men and women who have served our country. Great information and fun war equipment (artillery, vehicles, aircraft, etc.) to see."
AMAZING!!,"This is a fascinating look at the history of War in Korea. Only knowing about the history of US War, I was not prepared for how long a society can be at war and still survive. The Korean people are resilient! There are other exhibits there that we didn't have time to get to. Outside on the grounds is quite extraordinary as well. "
Memorial museum ,"Worth to see it, pretty big museum and a lot of trucks and pieces to see outside. It's easy to go there with the subway from Seoul station for example. They have guided tours or you can explore it for yourself. "
Awesome,"Huge place....more like a complex than museum. Excellent presentation of Korean War info, and really good info on early Korean war history. Lots of English provided. Outdoor museum as well. Spent 5 hours inside and outside and still didnt see it all. Free. English speaking guides provided for free periodically too. Fantastic."
Impressive - A Must See,I've been to the War Memorial on two separate trips to Seoul. It's British Museum - Smithsonian caliber and impressive by any account. Very well done and an incredible look at Korea's tumultuous past. A real testament to a determined and proud people and how far the country has come. 
Fascinating!!,"I am always interested in war memorial because it is an amazing thing to learn the history and constantly reminding us the importance of peace. My favourite exhibition hall was Hall 3, the United Nations. All the tanks, aircrafts and warships would fascinate you and I reckon kids would like to see those big planes. It is a great place to visit and spend the day and actually learn something."
Superb!,You can learn so many things about korea and its history here. Free entry. Need to spend at least one morning to complete. 
It's Not All about the Korean War,Did you know that Ethiopia sent troops to Korea during the war? Nope.....neither did I. And do you know how the war started and finished? No? Well I'm not telling so you will need to visit to find out. It's not all about the Korean War though and there is a lot of ancient history around conflict to view as well. Entry is free. Exhibits are well presented and there are a few surprises (like Ethiopia). A must do on your visit to Seoul and a great way to spend a rainy day as well.
Korean History,Best War museum of the world........from the begiining of the Korean History to modern times. The outsiden exhibition of war-machines is of high quality.
Inspiring.,A wonderful tribute to the people of Korea and the UN who assisted in protecting the people of the South from the invading. Makes you feel lucky to have not lived in such a treacherous time and environment. 
Museums ,"I visited a lot of Museums and this is one of my favorites. you can see the actual tank, aircrafts used during the war. All types of guns, grenade. it's better to have a Korean friend with you because they don't offer English Tour guide and almost all writings in the display was in Korean. so I just walked around. You will see how Korea was totally wreck during the war and you will appreciate how progressive the country now. it's near itaewon you can just walk going to itaewon. "
Korean War memorial and museum,"This is a top military museum and memorial in one. Kind of like if the National World War 2 museum in New Orleans was next to the National WW2 Memorial in Washington, DC.Great exhibits and an outdoor park with planes,, tanks, etc in a truly great collection. The building itself is amassive, impressive structure on par with one of the Smithsonian buildings."
Huge range if giant boy toys.,This and the dmz tour would be my highlights of seoul. Every tank and aircraft used in the korean conflict are parked at the front if the museum and the information inside is amazing with free guided english speaking tours also. 
"High Quality, High Information Museum","I have long had a basic understanding of the Korean War. This free museum gives a very thorough trip through the war. The museum is very well done. Most signs include English translations. The exhibits are high quality and well organized. I learned a great deal. (The museum also covers Korean military history beyond the Korean War, although the focus is on 1950-53.)The museum also includes artwork honoring the sacrifices of the soldiers and people in both the North and South. It also reflects a yearning for eventual unification. It's moving to see groups of school kids learn their country's culture and history."
Our ES/MS boys spent three hours there and didn't want to go!,"It's a great museum for all ages. You can ask at the desk for a bilingual guide. The museum covers Korean history from 1000 AD to the Korean War and has lots of planes and tanks for kids to touch and go inside! A sunny day is best, but still lots inside to see as well."
A big surprise on the positive side,"I had read some reviews, but still did not know what to expect. It was so much more than I expected. I did not know much of the History behind the Korean was, but this was really interesting. They had so many different ways of showing it, from videos to big screen cinema and a lot of weapons and stuff from the war. It was all made exciting and a lot of museums around the world, could learn from this place. Well done. The museum is also bigger than I thought. The section outside with tanks and planes was fun as well, that part is sure to be a hit with children. And the whole thing is FREE. I would not mind paying some money to see it, but that was a nice touch. Outside they have a memorial stone for the different countries that helped during the war. Nice touch ."
"Fascinating, Large Scale Memorial",This memorial is huge compared to anything in the USA for war memorials. Has great information and visuals/videos about the Korean War starting with end of WWII through the war in the '50's
One of place i must visited.,My grandfather is a Korean war memorial. I want to visited this place . It was big and very historical.
The Two Brothers Statue is the perfect opener for this superb intro to Korean warring history,"Keep two hours at the very least( I spent a full day here) if you want a real sense of Korea's own history, South Korean version. Seoul is full of museums which also have entry fee, but this superb one is free. Has guided tours, big sized lockers for you to keep your rucksack and an ongoing parade at 2 pm ( check online before reaching at that time) and many cafes in all directions within the campus, should you get museumitis and want to just take a break. From the quivers to the bomb caskets to the UN interventions, Indians will find the Indian Flag flying outside, in a wonderful surprise and true spirit of gratitude and formality on Korean behalf."
Interesting place,"A very good and informative place. Have to visit it with kids, can climb some airplanes to see what's inside. For adults will be interesting too. A lot of different countries' equipment.Free to visit."
"Best part, not just the Korean War",The name of the museum can be confusing since this place hols much more than just information on the Korean War. Spend the day here travelling through the world of Korean history
Amazing ,I recommend everyone take the time come here and see this. It so moving. It puts into perspective what we may not have been alive to understand
With DPRK not too far away and rattling the cage a country like Korea needs a museum like that,"For us Europeans it is a bit too much and too extensive the description of the Korean War. Remarkably, lots of korean-style new media is applied to keep young generation interested (4D room with real snow, e.g.) as the current youngsters might feel much different towards the North (why should we care, is the question). So conclude w/o DPRK story told would sound different. Its a great museum and tells of a nation that underwent a horrible time post WW2, and the combined effort of UN Forces to keep the freedom and not let it go the sowjet-style way..."
Fantastic Museum,This is probably one of the best museums ive been too. So many interactive models and so much to see. Very interesting to way to find out about the Korean War
Great museum ,Great museum and if you go in a weekend they provide free English tours by students. I went on a raining Saturday so the museum was not very crowded so I ended up with my own personal tour guide and he was very friendly.
not that special,"Nothing really special about it, I have seen more impressive Korean war memorials in several locations in US."
"Very large, easy with kids","We visited as a family of 3 with a 2 year old in a stroller.I was very impressed with the size and quality of this museum. There were three floors of detailed exhibits, detailing Korea's involvement in international conflicts. Highlights:Outside they have many life-size airplane, tank, and ship models.There is an outdoor play facility for children, as well as a children's museum of sorts.The whole facility is easily accessible for those using a pushchair/stroller, including lifts and ramps.Exhibits:They are mostly in both English and Korean. Most of the signage around the facility is as well. Most are very detailed and well thought out. Very informative without going overboard.The exhibits are mostly not opinionated - they just state facts: dates, locations of conflicts, number of trips involved, etc.I would definitely recommend visiting. We were here almost a whole day and didn't see everything. We had a really nice time though!"
Very interesting Museum .,"Is similar to other Memorial , but inside you feel immediately the sensation of how much is till actual the idea and the presence of the war in Korea . Very wide collection of aircraft . Not loose if you visit Seoul . "
Poignant memorial,"The Korean War memorial is definitely worth a visit when in Seoul, and preferably before the visit to the DMZ.There are many multi-media displays, including a 4D theater (with limited seating) which puts the audience in a first person point of view to experience Operation Chromite, the audacious amphibious landing attempted by General Douglas McArthur, which turned the tide of the Korean War.It also clearly spell out the cause of war and the evils the far eastern communist bloc which shattered dreams of Korean unity.A 5-star attraction that helps one appreciate the fragility of the freedom we enjoy, and the price paid by those who gave the ultimate sacrifice."
Make the Time to Visit (just not on Mondays),"This was a beautiful place that shows so much of the history of Korea. There are exhibits about more than just the 20th century, which I found especially informative. The outside has equipment from the war efforts (planes, tanks, etc.) which give you a feel for what soldiers went through and fought with. Plan to spend 2-4 hours depending on your level of interest and prior knowledge."
Huge museum!,My family enjoyed going here. It is huge and all free! Lots of military memorabilia to see. Loved seeing the B52 up close!
Best Museum ,"I'm not a HUGE museum person, but I fell in love with this place. It's built for people with short attention spans who still want to see a lot of history. A must stop in Seoul. "
Half day museum ,Great visit for a half day activity. The outdoor area has several static displays and the inside museum area provides a thorough history of the Korean War. Really wonderful for veterans and history enthusiasts. 
Moving and very well done.,"This museum is an incredibly well put together history of military engagement in Korea, with an emphasis on the Korean War. It manages to set a tone that is somber but hopeful, grateful to Korea's allies yet proudly strong and independent. I have made a point of visiting this museum on every trip to Korea and will likely visit again. While this museum is a great rainy day activity, it's worth stopping by during nice weather to roam around the outdoor park with static displays of various military equipment."
Rainy afternoon activity,"War memorial of Korea is a very well laid out museum of the Korean war. It caters for both Korean and English speakers. The museum had multiple levels and very clean facilities, It can be done in a short time or if you wish to see as much as possible a few hours could be spent here as well. "
Short Visit,"Called in here as part of another tour, so spent about an hour here. I am sad to admit, I had very little knowledge of the Korean War, so spent a while getting myself up to speed. Fantastic displays, the information is well presented, and very easy to get your head around Well worth it"
Interesting to learn about the Korean War,"we did not know a lot about the war, took the English tour and it was very informative and well organised. I also really enjoyed the outdoor exhibits. "
My Dad and My Daughter in Law's Grandfather were on opposite sides,"If you want to understand the Korean War, this is the place to go. My Korean Friend took us here and it was a highlight of our visit. My dad served in Korea. My daughter in law's grandfather was a General under Chairman Mao. It's a small world. "
Good history,Inside and outside impressive monument and Museum. Very pretty. Great information and displays. It is a memorial to all koreans that died and the UN forces. Reminder that Colombia was the only Latin American Country to send help; and why Truman was right.
One of best museums ever.,"This musuem is a real gem. It is very insightful, and has some powerful and moving testimony of what happened during various invasions of the country and of course the war with the north. There are 2 movie theatres with 4D experience, they have a minimum requirement of people to run and limite seats, We went during lunch when they were shut. the museum is free. There is a leaflet guiding you to the different floors and rooms in order of history. the outside is also amazing to see but best to leave enough time for inside which is easily a 2 hour effort. "
It was ok,Not the best thing to see in seoul in my opinion...if you wanted to know more about the war...this is place to be...full of tanks ships and planes used in the war....the statue is nicely done...
Fantastic Museum,"We were led by a wine-loving, multi-linguistic, enthusiastic Veteran named Kim. Our tour was for an hour. I wish I could have stayed longer. The exhibits are fantastic, emotive, informative. Kim was able to give us explanations about specific military tactics as well which was great. I unfortunately got there a bit late so wasn't able to stay as long as I wanted.At 4pm there was a military performance which was pretty much the coolest thing i've ever seen. They only run them in certain months though (April being one of them)"
Worth the time,Worth the visit. It's free and very well maintained museum. The outdoor exhibitions of tanks and planes actually made our stay enjoyable. 
A Sobering Reminder of the Cost of War,"I had no preconceived notions of what to expect prior to my arrival. It was a rainy April day, and I just wanted to spend some time better understanding the history of US involvement in the Korean War. From the moment I hit the outdoor grounds, I was in awe of how elegantly and profoundly the Koreans have chosen to reflect on their Great War. The statues, sculptures, and monuments are breathtaking.Inside, I found a rich history and story behind the war and later efforts at unification. I highly recommend taking two hours (at a minimum) if your time in Seoul to experience, and to truly understand the origins of some of the more contemporary crises on the Korean Peninsula."
Profoundly moving and highly informative,Extremely well laid out and presented and with all English sub titles. The hands on experience outside with a vast array of military vehicles and planes was really great.
"Wow, fantasic","This is a great museum, lots of information on the Korean war, plenty of information in English, interesting exhibits and videos. The real highlight was the amazing array of War hardware, Tanks, Jeeps, Helicopters, Jet fighters, Anti air craft guns, canons and even a life size replica of a Navy Patrol boat PKM 357 (that the North sank during a conflict in 2002) that you can climb all over. The kids will love it! And it's all free. Caught the metro from Seoul Station and then a short walk. Afterwards walked all the way back to Seoul Station, It's an easy walk, passing lots of interesting restaurants."
"A bit sombre, but a great insight to the many injustices and wars that the S Koreans have had to endure","For an outsider, it's a bit of an eye opener. The history of Korea is quite shocking, and for such a small nation, they have had to endure perpetual persecution and wars. If you are a history buff, it's a must see."
Very interesting,"I am gonna be very short on that review but this place is a MUST see i repeat i MUST see , if you have at leat even a little interest in history you have to go there.I skiped a fews parts from the middle age and still took me almost all day , so do not plan any other big thing the day you go there.The tour is a must, the tour only concern the part of the musseum that is about the north and south Korea war, so reserve this part for the tour and do the rest of the musseum on your own.There you can try to really understand what happened during that war and also have a change to look at the big picture.A MUST SEE"
Well worth the time!,"Our intent was to visit the National Museum but got off at the wrong stop and so happy that we did. This place is so well organized. Incorporates the history and experiences so well. You can feel the pride, hope and gratitude of the Korean people here. The outdoor exhibits with lots of tanks, planes and other war vessels are a must see. Well worth the accidental stop!"
How war memorials should be done,"I've seen several memorials commemorating only a particular person/persons or just the country on which it was built. The War Memorial of (South) Korea though, gives praise and gratitude to the nations that assisted in that bloody war.Flags of more than 10 nations including the Philippines are erected lining up the center. So tourists from other nations can have a taste of pride taking pictures of themselves beside their flagpoles.The memorial also exhibits more than a dozen of war machine artillery (planes, jets, ships, tanks, and my personal favorite, an apache helicopter), which is the most I have seen.And the best thing is, the place, monuments and exhbits are well maintained and kept clean."
Weeping Cherry blossom,"I went only because of the cherry blossom. But the way they respect their brave, it's a honourable site. It is next to a subway station and easily accessible. "
A must do in Seoul,"Site includes an extensive museum with very interesting and informative exhibits as well as a large outdoor collection of military hardware, including tanks, boats and planes. Memorial covers numerous statues and grounds. Can easily spend a few hours there. We walked there from city centre but it would be worth getting the subway."
Beautiful open air museum,"I visited on Monday. The museum is closed. But on the yard there are some amazing monuments, as well as outdoor museum of weapons including B52 aircraft . recommended."
Definitely a must see museum in Seoul,Such an interesting presentation to make you feel the atmosphere of Korean war time. This place not only shows very informative details but also presents many aspects of the war. Totally recommended.
Very delusional,The Korean perspective on the war is in line with the typical Korean perspective on things. They were getting beat down; which they do admit a little. They do recognize the help they received from nations throughout the world but they minimize the American involvement that turned the war around. The minimal recognition of the American effort and loss is disrespectful and insulting. But that's Korean. 
It's like a box of chocolate,"Since I went with a tour guide, I can’t really speak for everyone because it all depends on the service. And since I can’t speak for anyone, I’ll be talking about how my trip went. So when we first arrive, it was crowded, full of people, and full of liter. But I thought it was just little things, and that I can worry less about it.  While just looking through away, the buildings are really interesting and massive, I have gone through the history of Korea and the origins of time. There’s only a little bit of English translation so if you’re a foreigner you might get bored easily."
an amazing place,i really liked this place. its good for history seekers surely they will love it. also there are things thats belong to the museum but outside. You can ride it 
A place worth the effort to visit,"We joined the Seoul city tour and this was our second stop. This place is really big and it is so well displayed for all that we needed to know about warfare, weapons and vehicles. We didn't managed to go through the entire site coz it was really big. We missed the outside monuments coz we concentrated on the inside. I really would recommend this place very much evening though I don't like to see about the effects of war and combat. Every single persons who were perished where were taken into account and their names were engraved on the wall. Well done. "
War what is it good for,A great place to learn about the harshness and the reality of war. Free entry for the exhibition and lots of activity on the outside.
Interesting but poorly organized ,Probably a must see but I was not really thrilled. Building is massive and you will go through the entire history of Korea through the wars that they fought since the origine of time. Very little translation in English so you get bored rapidly. There are some old military junk outside which probably will make kids happy. 
"Interesting, honest, engaging","So much to see! Open and honest representation of the war, how it affected Korea and the world. Dioramas and exhibits and films are detailed, sometimes hard to watch, but very interesting. Rooms dedicated to peace and reunification are beautiful. Really a must-see."
Impressive place ,Very impressive facility. Outside are displays of aircraft and tanks and more. Inside is a beautiful museum consisting of three floors displaying history of all wars korea has had to fight through dating back to pre dynasty up to present. 
"Cool exhibitions, heavy on the propaganda","Place is alright. It's free and definitely had some pretty impressive exhibitions - especially if you're a military history buff. Ultimately the place felt way too propaganda-y for me. It is quite apparent that the history is more about narrative. More like something I'd expect north of the border. Still, probably worth an hour or 2."
Huge museum. Very interesting,Very interesting and well laid out museum. You end up walking a lot as the museum is so big. Lots of military hardware in the outside space too. It's also free to visit. Well worth a visit.
Don't go on a Monday!,Unfortunately we made the mistake of not doing our research and going on a Monday when it is closed! However we were still able to access all the outdoor exhibitions and monuments. Luckily it was a beautiful spring day and we enjoyed viewing the replica aircraft.
Lots to see,"The War Memorial of Korea had a lot for our family to see. It gave a great background to the war in Korea along with videos, testimonials, and lots of information. We rushed through it, but could have easily spent 4 hours there."
Very nice museum,"Very informative material and smartly exhibited. There ' s a huge space outside with war airplanes, fountains and two museums for kids. The entrance is free and everything has an english translation or version, including the interesting and touching videos on the top floor. The architecture and the way the space inside is managed is, as in each korean museum that I ' ve seen, beautiful. "
Fascinating!,"A must see to help understand Korean history as well as the Korean war. Nicely done and very interesting. As an American, it helped my better understand the pride that Koreans have in their country and in their military. "
A must see when visiting Seoul ,"The war memorial is a great place to learn about the history of Korea throughout its existence, especially the part detailing the Korean War. Spent about 2 1/2 hours moving through the various exhibitions and spent most of the time enjoying the Korean Conflict displays. Most of the exhibits are printed in English, Hangul, Mandarin and Japanese. Outside there are numerous planes, tanks, military equipment and statues to observe. There is also a kids park attached to the memorial. Not sure how often they occur but was luck enough to watch a presentation of pageantry by the ROK armed forces at 1:30pm on Friday."
Incredible ,"This museum has pulled out all the stops. Retired military aircrafts, tanks and even a ship decorate the lawn outside. Entrance into the museum is free. Full background to the war is provided along with current relations with countries worldwide. Documents, clothing, weapons from the war are on display. Models illustrating Korea's involvement in the Vietnam war are very insightful. Short movies and clips captivate tourists as they move through the museum. We spent 4 hours there and could have easily spent longer. Definitely a must if in Seoul. "
bits of tears in my eyes...,"worth a visit... join the free guided tour. shows how much south koreans appreciate the global help during the korean war. good on ya south korea for being so advanced after being destroyed during the war!!! tears in my eyes and goosebumps for me, seeing many of the exhibit...some moving stories. "
Very interesting and relatively extensive collection of aircraft,"This is a nice opportunity to look at some of the military vehicles, aircraft and other equipment and events that Korea has experienced through war. This is well worth the visit. I recommend this and think it is a great place to start your view of Seoul."
So much more than I expected!,"I thought it was going to be like one of those war memorials you can find in the USA. And it's so much better!For starters, out side, you find a huge exibition of real tanks, missils, war airplanes from different decades. Then you enter the museum and you have lots of interesting exibitions, plus three 4D movies simulating battles in different momments of Korean History.This place is amazing and I recommend everybody to go there."
Informative,"This museum does an undoubtedly good job telling the story of the Korean War and of paying tribute to victim on both sides. Great efforts have also been made to show appreciation for international involvement and aid. I did however find the militarism a little disturbing after a while. There were certainly some stories about the war that were upsetting (appropriately enough), but there also seemed to be a glorification of the military that I found somewhat unsettling. "
Well documented part of history,This memorial is a very well documented and presented part of history. Outside the buildings is an overview of different kinds of transportation and defense equipment. The memorial at the front of the grounds are a piece of art and are highly recommended to be visited.Inside the buildings the layouts present a good overview. To see all I recommend to plan at least for half a day. Several places show videos. The exhibition is kept up to date and show also more recent historical events including samples of drones.The place is next to Samgakji station and therefore easy to reach.A highly recommended place to understand that part of history.
Fascinating,The attached museum is closed on a Monday but the outdoor area is permanently open. Really interesting and emotional place to visit if you are interested in the history of the Korean War. Drinks machines available and toilet and cafe facilities. 
Educational stop over to understand the war history,This is a good stop over if you have half a day to spare during the trip. You get to understand how the civil war started between North and South Korea after WWII. 
Lessons from the Past,"War Memorial of Korea is a place where we are reminded of the past. This is a huge place were war relics are kept. You can see vintage airplanes and rockets, navy boats and tanks in one place (open grounds). There are several ways to go there. One is by subway, line 4 exit Samjakji Station. The other is through bus. I was fortunate to ride a bus, No.73 which passed by this museum (there are other buses but i don't know). There are many out door sculptures and monuments. You can spend at most 2 hours in this place. "
Gracious Memorial to the Korean War and interesting place to view all things Military for Korea.,"Very big memorial , with touching lists of the many men and women who perished in the Korean War. It also is a museum with a floor dedicated to Korean Military History and other floors for the Korean War. There is also a modern era which highlights the Korean Militaries current equipment, complete with static and dynamic (including films, 3D, 4D films!) displays and a huge outdoor yard filled with planes including a B52 , a whole patrol boat! and lots of military vehicles like tanks, APCs, Canons etc. "
Did not know war could be this interesting!,"Went here because my husband insisted we do. At first I was not too keen after all, war is about death and destruction and I have zero interest in guns or tanks, right?Wrong. There is a lot of history in this place and it is actually very well presented that I could not help but be sucked in that by the end of the tour managed to gain a little more appreciation and respect for world history."
Interesting,The War Memorial of Korea Museum is very interesting to see. It explains the history of Korea in an pleasant way. It is quite big so plan 2h to do it. Outside of the museum you have the opportunity to see war machines.
Breathtaking Display of Hope and Horror,"Overwhelming in size and intensity, this Memorial is a stark reminder of Korea's still painful recent history and the unsettling fact that nothing is settled. The Museum is free and takes a couple of hours to absorb it all."
One-of-a-kind memorial!,"This is not like any other museums/ memorials. This one is nicely done up, carries you through the whole journey from the 3 kingdoms all the way to the U.N. involvement. Simply more than graphics on the wall, it is interactive and done up in a way that it's as if you have turned back time and relieved those historical moments. Some goosebumps moments as well, there's even a 4D cinema to allow you to experience how it is like to be in a war zone! We spent a good 3 hours there. Recommended for last day of travel, it is quite a distance from central Seoul, so plan your itinerary for this and head to Gyeongbokgung area for the Korean Ginseng chicken! And a few stops away from Hongdae station for the shopping streets!"
A must see.,I am a little biased because I am a history buff but the war is so crucial to understanding modern life in S Korea that visitors should learn as much about it as possible and this is a great place to do that. The exhibits are very informative and superbly layed out. I have been to many history museums but have never seen such amazing animated dioramas. There is also a very impressive collection of military vehicles outside including a complete B52 bomber. Definitely a must see when you are in Seoul.
Good historical museum,Very sad to see the names of the dead from all the different countries that helped during the war. Very well laid out and concentrated on Korean war and older wars in basement.
Good exhibition,This is one of the good exhibition about the war. The visualization and information will made you deeply into the war period. Need about 2 hours or more if you really want to study the study the war history. 
Pleasantly surprised,"We visited this museum because my father-in-law was interested in S.Korean history and we had 4 kids in tow ages 7-14. I thought they would be so bored but instead I was pleasantly surprised that they liked it. This is due in most part to the excellent exhibits that made the Korean war very interesting. An English-speaking guide gave us a 1hr tour. Although his English was a bit difficult to understand at times, we gathered enough information. They had many videos (one in 3d) and art installations that the kids thoroughly enjoyed so make sure you watch those. Then go out to the Peace Plaza and marvel at all the different planes and tanks, very well maintained I might add. Oh and did I mention that entrance is free?"
Interesting for all ages,"This is my favorite museum in Seoul. The displays are well done and labeled in English as well as Hangul. There are lots of interactive displays making it engaging for all ages. Some activities require a wait or time slot (the shooting range and the MacArthur 4D movie come to mind) but are usually worth it if you have the time. There are also beautiful statues and monuments outside, as well as a ton of old war planes, tanks and big guns outside that you can climb on and in. Highly recommend you give it at least 3-4 hours. "
Great lesson on the History of Korea!,"This was my first time here and I have to say I was quite impressed. From this visit you get a full understanding of the history of Korea, the dynasties, all the occupations from other countries, and what was happening in the rest of the world during these events. There's a children's museum that is good for young kids. The outdoor part with the planes, tanks, and ship is also a bonus. The entrance is free and they were giving out books on the history of Korea! Access to the museum is about a 5-10 minute walk from the subway station."
excellent life sized walk through memorial,"Loved this place!! Totally worth going to see, even if you aren't a History buff!! I had such a great time looking at all the warplanes, ships and tanks. It's great that you can actually go inside the tanks and aboard the ship!! was such a fun afternoon activity!! The memorial also is filled with cool information about the war - some of which i never knew before. Honestly - go see and experience it!"
amazing for everyone,"not only for boys, huge museum with great exterior exhibit and nice view, definitelly worth a visit, save at least 3 hours"
Nice stop if you're in the area,"Huge area showcasing the war history of Korea. Our group stopped by after we paid for our DMZ tour at Koridoor Tours. Did not go inside (it was Monday and it seemed empty) because we didn't want to spend money but there was plenty to see outside. Huge statues and there were old planes, tanks, etc. a beautifully designed memorial. Recommend stopping by for half an hour if you're in the area."
Airplanes and Tanks galore!,"If you are a history buff, this is a great place to visit! The museum is free to the public and there's a lot of history to go through. The structure is beautiful and very serene especially if you go right when they open at 9am. "
Must visit.. loved it!!!,"I visited war memorial with my family in the month of June. Make sure you visit the place when its not raining and the weather is sunny or atleast favourable. It's free of cost which was pretty amazing. History of korea is very well preserved. Loved the giant military statues of men outside the museum. They have a lot to cover outside as well as inside. For an outdoor view, you can have a look at various models like a giant military ship, military tanks and planes. And get yourself clicked. Indoor, they have a museum which showcase the korean war history. It was quite an interesting and a knowledgeable tour and we got to learn a lot about the korean history and war. They also have a canteen outside to sit and grab your meals. We carried out our own lunch so dont have much idea about the food services there. It took us about 4 hours to cover the entire place. All in all, a pretty amazing outing and definitely worth a visit."
"A must visit, very powerful museum","The War Memorial of Korea is must see for anyone who loves history. It is a lot to take in and spans the complete history of the Republic of Korea and tells one story that defines the nation. Definitely a s secret place that you would want to spend as much time as possible looking around and taking in the pride that the people of South Korea feel for their continued struggle for independence with a special emphasis on the Korean War.In addition to what seems like an limitless supply of relics dealing with Korea's military past, they have a collection of sculptures that will invoke a powerful emotion in almost all who see them. I suggest that everyone take the day and visit this museum. Even if you have young children this is a great place to take them. As you walk though you have a good chance to see this the museum full of elementary age school children from local schools learning from all the great exhibits.The museum was recently updated in March 2016 and like most all attractions in the Republic of Korea, this museum is English friendly."
Honor and Respect,"Our family trip to Seoul meant that we needed to pay our respects to all who served in the War. My father was in the 75th Mountain Div. and my wife's father was in the Navy, participated in the Inchon landing and received the Inchon Landing Commendation Medal. For us, and for our children, this was something we needed to see. What impressed us was the honor and respect shown by the Korean people for the sacrifice of those who participated in the War. There were several statements about how the United Nations forces responded and fought for people they did know, and a country they never heard of. Every MIA was listed, by State, on bronze tablets which paid respect to our soldiers, sailors and marines. I came away with the feeling that Koreans are truly grateful for the sacrifices our Country made. The Government spared no expense, and exhibits were very well done. Skip the 3D video of the Inchon landing as it is waste of time. It takes you through an animated bombardment. Instead, spend your time in seeing the history of the struggle. It was very well done. "
Great place to visit ,Great place to learn more about Korean history. It's really impressed. They protect and keep the objects very carefully. We learned a lot from this trip!
A must see during your trip to S Korea.. History impressively captured,"Beautiful and sacred war memorial dedicated to the struggles of North and South Korea. One cannot help but be moved by the sculptures and their descriptions. There is no fee to tour the grounds and the museum closes at 5PM. You will have an opportunity to walk amongst tanks and airplanes. In addition, you can view a replica of a boat that came under fire by the North Koreans as recent as 2002. Hot chocolate and coffee beverages are available for purchase through vending machines throughout the park."
Coolest Museum,"I learned so much about Korean military history in this museum, They even provide free books. There is a large display of equipment and aircraft including a B-52 bomber."
"War Memorial: a Museum, not a monument","The name may be slightly putting you in the wrong direction. It's a very big museum with a lot of information about Korea and it's wars from prehistoric ages untill the Korean War in the 1950's. It's impressive and very good if the whether is bad. It's also the only place I know to buy pins with the Korean flag and the different allied troops flags (like the Netherlands, Australia, Turkey, Luxemburg etc). "
Racist and sexist tour guide,"We visited on Sunday morning and were lucky enough to get a tour. Whilst we greatly appreciated the tour from the elderly tour guide, Lee, he ignored the two females in the group of four of us, only introducing himself to the two males in the group, and also only asked for the names of the males of the group. I may be wrong and maybe not addressing the women is a cultural thing? He also assumed the females in the group did not know anything and made some racist and sexist comments. He missed a lot of the features of the war museum. It's a shame as other tour guides we observed seemed to give a great tour of the museum. We went around the museum ourselves afterwards and were impressed with the free exhibition and the vehicles outside which could be climbed into by visitors."
A great museum,One of the best put museums I have even been to. With story telling exhibits. Numerous historical documents. Allow at least 3 hours to go through it. It is well worth it. It is also free of charge.
Absolutely brilliant!,"We never expected to stay here for 4 hours or more, but the War Memorial of Korea was massive, and very well done. And it's free.It is a huge complex - numerous statues outside and three storeys of displays inside the Memorial building, covering not only the Korean War (though this takes up the majority of it, for obvious reasons), but also South Korean involvement in the Vietnam War and other conflicts, as well as the early military history of the Korean Peninsula.The father of a friend of ours fought with the Australian Army in Korea (and indeed met his wife on R&R in Tokyo, married her and brought her home to Australia), so it has additional resonance for us Aussies. There is a lot of love for the members of the armed forces of other nations who fought for a people they didn't know in a country they'd never heard of in that 3 year war, and much is set aside for that purpose in the War Memorial of Korea.There are displays of current weaponry (guns that can shoot around corners, night vision equipment,,,).There are inside exhibitions of vehicles and planes, as well as a huge area outside with a selection of planes and artillery, tanks, missile launchers, helicopters, submersibles, and even a full-size replica of a warship damaged in a 2002 conflict between the North and the South. You can board the ship, look into the cockpit of planes, marvel at the size of a B-52 and transport planes, and see how cramped it was/is in troop carriers.There are statues depicting the meeting of two bothers on the battlefield - one from the North and one from the South, and of the Clock Tower of Peace (with one clock at the current time and one frozen at the time the Korean War started).There's the original cars presented by the USA and Russia respectively to the heads of State of South Korea and North Korea (a little one-upmanship, perhaps!).There's a moving display depicting the 2008 burial of an Australian wife, finally placed in the UN Memorial Cemetery, Korea, with her husband who died in the Korean War 58 years previously. There were a few of those stories.There's uniforms and other memorabilia from very other country involved in the conflict. And plenty of video, dioramas, 4D movies, etc, to experience.There's a rather telling display of the damage a nuclear weapon would do to Seoul, accompanied by current news reports of the North's continued advances in nuclear technology and military testing.On a brighter note, there are cafeterias and souvenirs, as well as toilets.Well worth a visit and a tribute to the Government of South Korea."
Must See the War Memorial of Korea,"Be sure to make time and visit the War Memorial if Korea when you are in Seoul! The exhibits and tie in with the living history is outstanding, Allow at least 3 hours for a full visit."
Learn history from the land of the people,"We took our time. There is a lot to look at some very graphic, but war is so it is to be expected. I wouldn't bring a young child. There are outside exhibits but it was raining the day we were there so I am not sure what all is out there. I think they had planes. So I will go back just to find out."
A definite to understand the psyche - this should be on your top 3 to visit,"We spent 5 hours here and could have been longer. It's an excellent museum. The outside exhibits are fantastic and set in an area that is easy to navigate and extensive. The only minus was the presence of the American elementary school. They seemed to think the exhibits were a modified theme park, they were noisy and disrepectful. There was an international school who were well behaved and there was also an Korean school who were clealry there to learn, but the American kids were simply there to shout and scream and Create a scene. On the plus side there is a dedicated children's museum and so we could shake them off. The inside exhibits were very much on a didactic model ( tell 'EM. What you're going to tell 'EM, tell 'EM and tell 'tell 'EM again ' but it simply works, there are lots of exhibits and the assortment of media really adds to the story of the 1950-53 war. The exhibits were a good combination of traditional and IT media. Overall excellent - this should be a must when visiting Seoul as it explains the current psychi of the south Koreans and understanding that peace was never achieved.It's easy to navigate on the excellent metro - we went from city hall. Only took about 20 mins in total . The metro is cheap and simple to get around . Personally I would allow at least 3.5 hours although we did much longer."
Great place to learn about the Korean War,"If you're a war buff, the War Memorial of Korea is a great place to visit. I'm amazed by how much the Korean government went through to preserve this critical moment in history so that new generations will never forget."
One of the best Museums,"Must watch for any war enthusiast and kids... What a museum. The planes, tanks and artillery kept outside is unbelievable. Must watch if you visit Seoul. Keep 4-5hrs spare time for this. "
OK if you are in the area and need to burn a half hour of time.,The most interesting part to me was seeing copies of American Military communications equipment. Some still in use in our military.
Peaceful and powerdul,A Korean friend took me to this museum when I first moved to Seoul. It's a really beautiful campus with a very serene atmosphere where you can learn a lot about the war history or take a relaxing stroll. Worth visiting if you have a lot of time in Seoul and if you enjoy museums and parks. 
Excellent Education,"Spent a few hours at the museum. Very educational, told the horrific story of the Korean War. Well worth a visit."
Great way to learn about the War History of Korea,A great place to understand what happened in the Korean War. Make sure you join one of the free tours (available in English). Personally think it's better than simply wandering around the museum on your own. Tip: Make full use of the free lockers opposite the information counter so you don't need to carry any bags or jackets!
National treasure,"Place of pride for the locals and a lesson in history for visiting tourists. No entrance fees, great exhibits. Some planes and cars to keep the interests of the young visitors."
A must see for anyone in Seoul,"A poignant reminder of the war that affected the Korean Peninsula almost 70 years ago. A sad sight to see the statues of brothers fighting brothers on different sides. The War Memorial's exhibits are very well done, informative about both sides in the Korean War and kids love the model US and NORK military hardware outside. You can even go inside one of the USAF planes. Best to go on a sunny day. "
Very educational,"This is definitely worth a visit. The museum is well laid out and there are directional signs to indicate the direction of flow. It is in a story telling approach which lets you learn a lot about the tumultuous past of South Korea, and how the world rallied together to stand behind her. There is also an outdoor area that displays the weapon system and armoured vehicles and planes used during the war, which I am sure even the little ones will approve of."
worth a visit,Entrance is free. it has outside area where all types of tanks and planes used in Korean wars are presentd. inside area is devided into wings for different war periods of korean history. worth a visit
The War Memorial in Seoul,It is located between the US military base at Yongsan and Itaewon (shopping and entertainment district).There are numerous planes and military hardware on display just outside of the museum. Inside you'll find a very good exhibit of the Korea War and other replicas from Korean military experiences thoughtout the centruies.Entrance is free and I believe it's closed on Mondays.I would say you need at least half a day to properly tour the museum.
Actually its great,"I was shocked that this was one of the best/top places to see in Seoul, but it's totally worth it. There are lots to do and see there plus its really beautiful. There's also an indoor part of the museum that has exhibitions at times. It's a great free activity to do."
Big statues and nothing else,theyre big statues and then theres a museum which is a war museum. it was eh at most theres not really anything around the war memorial. 
Must-see attraction,"Worth a visit to get a historical perspective of Korean war history. Lots of hands-on display (both indoor and outdoor) and entertaining videos,including some 3D movies. Huge place and need at least 3 hours to explore all the exhibits. Very well presented. Highly recommend it. "
Awesome,This is the place to go if you want to know about the Korean War. I was amazed by this place it was incredible!! It is a MUST see attraction.
The War Memorial,This place makes you to think about wars and offer many things that you did not know about Korean war
Well worth a visit,"Gives a fascinating insight into the Korean War and the start of the UN, albeit from a very South Korean view. Very glad I went"
Great to learn about the war of Korea,"Free admission on weekdays! I went on a Friday morning, no people around. This is the perfect place to learn about the war of Korea."
Informative and Entertaining,"Since this was among the ""must see"" while in Seoul, I gave it a try. It did not disappoint! First it was easy to access by bus, I rode bus 740 from sinchon area. This is a big museum and you can see war relics (plane, tanks and navy boat on the left side of the museum building. Infant are monuments for the fallen soldiers and for peace. This museum is free admission except for special exhibits. You allow at least 2 hours to see the whole place. there are a lot of selfie moments since there are a lot of display. If your into military stuff, you will enjoy this place. "
Very impressive museum ,"I enjoyed an afternoon in the museum. Due to the huge amount of displayed items, variating from small war memorabilia to huge military planes, the museum gave me a very impressive and educative experience. Especially the exhibition on the Korean War made a deep impression. Most certainly worth a visit!"
One of the MUST & WORTH visitable place ,"This museum is all about the wars happened in Korea and the wars that koreans attended. I saw some people criticized about this museum making beautification of some wars like vietnam war but people should remind this museum is not about glory of korea but abt wars of korean which means we don't need to make beautification but need the truth. Moreover, this museum is not about world wide war but korean's so surely it's based on korean's point of view. Every war museum has the story of their country so if the logic goes on the people who say this museum has a problem ,which i announced at first, then which war museum could have the rights to open their museum!P.s. i've been visited this museum 3 times. Actually when i first visited here i didn't expected a lot but there's some things that i can try and experience, can watch some short videos about war/army so much more exciting then i thought. Worth visiting."
Must visit!,Great place to learn about the Korean War. Every person should visit and learn all they can so that they can have a true appreciation of the sacrifices that have been made. 
Wow place for history lovers ,Its takes us to olden days and explains everything thing about wars between south korea and north korea. Displayed tons of weapons there whice were used in war. Explains how other countries support South Korea. 
"If you are a History maniac, this is a must go!","Located right around 3 minutes by walk from Samgakji Station, this place is in a great location. First, you will be welcome by a couple of statues that commemorates heroes from the Korean War, later on you enter the museum and have the choice to start at either first floor or on the basement. If you would like to focus on the Korean War, start on the first floor, but if the Joseon Dynasty is your choice go to the basement.After seeing the entire indoor exhibition, go to the East side of the museum to see all the military aircrafts in exhibition, which in fact was my favorite part.The War Memorial is free of charge, so you can stop by whenever you want during business hours. JUST MAKE SURE, ITS CLOSED ON MONDAYS!Make sure to give yourself a couple hours to look around the Memorial, so arrive around 3 pm as it closes at 5 pmIf you are a History maniac like myself, you shall definitely go here while you are in Seoul."
A great museum day out,"The museum has free English tours and our tour guide was great. I learnt a lot about the Korean war that was incredibly interesting. There are great interactive features throughout the museum as well.They also have different exhibitions. When we went there was a Monet exhibiting that looked great. Outside there are also a lot of tanks and airplanes from various wars that can be climbed into, some of them at least. Inside there is a small cafe with some nice desserts and some good coffee.Another great day out.Note it is walkable from itaewon only takes about 15 minutes in a straight line."
Truly Amazing ,"My wife and I, spent about 4 hours here but could of easily spent the whole day as there is so much information to take in.We had an English translater who gave us the tour which was very helpful. All the artifacts and visual media were also in English.Very happy I had the opportunity to come here."
History of Korean War,A lot of history and has special exhibits. This is a must visit for anyone that wants to understand the significance of the Korean War.
Great for history buffs!,Great museum with a lot to see. They had videos in English and Korean. The planes and size of the place is surprising. Will take some time to see it all.
Gives me the chills,"Knowing that there is still an ongoing war and that I have relatives who are soldiers, this place just gives me the chills. The park was huge! We only went there for an hour or less and we only had a look of the outdoor exhibit. Even with that, I was amazed. The statues portrayed that of soldiers and their courage to fight. The ships, tanks and missiles was pretty awesome. The ship where we can actually walk in it was good! They have left the bullet marks and you can actually touch it. I highly recommend this place! The museum might also be good too! :)"
Wasn't high on my list but - Glad I visited,Its the only war history memorial. Lots of details plus free so must not miss. I also got a free war history book that is excellent. Not much crowd in Sept. so my wife and I literally had the whole place to ourselves
Great Museum and Free,"Worth the trip to this museum. It's very well done and it's free. We learned a lot about Korea and the Korean War-- it was really cool to see all the countries that came together to help South Korea. We thoroughly enjoyed the trip. If it's rainy or too cold to travel outside, come to this museum. You will not regret it!"
Check out outdoor exhibition,Outdoor exhibition is far more interesting than inside. They have variety of military vehicles/jets exhibited. 
One of the best museums I've ever been to,"This is hands down one of the best museums I've ever been to. You start out with a bang wandering through real military planes, ships, tanks, guns and rockets on display outside, as well as a moving statue dedicated to the victims of the Korean War. Inside, the museum offers everything you can imagine, from 4D movies, to informative slideshows and displays. I am a sucker for early 20th century military history, and this museum delivered. The content was presented in a tasteful, informative, interactive, but also reverent manner. I came away from my seven hour visit truly understanding the impact the Korean War had on this country. "
Great museum. The tanks and other war vehicles outside are fantastic.,"This is a great museum that highlights Korea's history. It is definitely worth a visit if you come to the city. Outside the museum are various army vehicles, helicopters, tanks, jeeps etc. Some of the vehicles you can climb on and go in. It makes for a great interactive experience. "
Can Learn about korea war,I love the short video of Heroes and love one. Total captured the essence of the struggles during war time.
Interesting and meaniingful,"The War Memorial is very meaningful and interesting to see with both indoor and outdoor facilities - sculptures and venue to see, read about and learn about. The place is quite big, so I would recommend at least 2 hours in order to be able to fully enjoy and sightsee properly. It is near Itaewon shopping Center and not too far from Yongsan Station and also National Museum of Korea if one is interested in joining various places of interest in one day."
Worth a visit and easy to find.,"A short walk around the corner from the subway this Museum has extensive outdoor and indoor displays. The displays outdoors of sculptures, aircraft and other war memorabilia are excellent and there is a children's museum to the side (which I didn't visit). Inside there are a couple of cafes and lots to see - most of the information has English translations so very informative and interesting."
breathtaking! take your time ,"a must see in Seoul! this memorial is very large & interesting, take your time (at least 3 hours) admission is free. guaranteed to make you feel some things... very powerful exhibition. "
Breathtaking,"I was moved to see these sculptures and read their history. Admittedly I was never great with history but living here nor, it's something to learn, understand, and appreciate."
Great experience,Both the memorial outside and the museum are a great thing to take in. I stopped by walking back from the USO tour. It was on the way back to Itaewon. I am glad I stopped. It helped explain so much more about the war and the history of Korea.
The best part of my trip to Seoul,My wife's grand parents were buried there. It's such a emotional experience for us and we were so happy to see that they can rest in peace in such a beautiful and calm land. Even just for a visit I would highly recommend it. A huge contrast to the noisy myeongdong and greedy sellers and shoppers. I found my internal peace and profound respect to the soldiers not just korean but also chinese. American everyone who sacrificed for their country in that brutal war. Rest in peace and we'll visit you again. 
The history is still live over there...,"It's sad the fact that the most important museum of a sity is the war museum. The history is still live over there, the wounds have not been healed and the tears have not been dried. Furthermore, the fear for more wounds and tears still exists... The fealings, after visiting this museum are not good: sorrow and sympathy for this suffering and divided people. However, it is, indeed, a must, when you are visiting Seoul."
The War Memorial of Korea,A wonderful museum full of great history about all the participants in the Korean conflict and also a previous worth going back to Korea. Can't wait to go back a second time and spend more time and get an audio
Awesome place and free!,"This place is free to enter but donations are welcomed, which go towards the upkeep of the museum. For those who like history, this place is really cool. It's got lots of planes, cars, tanks, artillery and other artifacts from the Korean war and lots of history on the other countries who helped to fight alongside the South Koreans. "
Awesome,This is one of the better war museum that I had been to. There were plenty of outdoor exhibits on the defunct war planes and vehicles. The indoor exhibits were good too. It was quite interactive in a way that they had videos and special effects. My kids loved the outdoor exhibits more than the indoor ones.
Beautifully done!,"There are lots and lots of things to see here. Each of the huge pieces of art outside have a story to tell, and tell it well.I really enjoyed the display of planes, tanks, and a boat that have good explanations in English.The courtyard outside the main entrance has an amazing display of black obelisk-like pieces, one for each country that sent troops to aid in the war effort. From the U.S. with 36K+ dead, down to tiny Luxembourg which sent 85 soldiers (and lost 2) each piece has words in the country's native tongue honoring those who gave their lives in the fight.By the time I got inside, I was almost worn out. I only looked at a few of the displays there but, again, there were good explanations for the exhibits.For anyone remotely interested in history, this is a ""no-miss"" place!"
Worth visiting,"Such an interesting place to visit. My son learned a lot from the museum. We were even lucky to get a copy of the book ""Korean War 1129"" by Lee, Joong Keun. It has a day by day account of the Korean War. It is a place both young and oldies will enjoy. I was with my 7yr old son and my 66yr old mom and I think all of us appreciated the time now living without war. My mom would recount how her parents would tell her stories about the war and she said she is very grateful we would not experience it now.The museum has all these interesting war planes, missiles, and guns used during the Korean War. It also is very heart touching to see the list of all the names of soldiers from different countries who died during the war. Very educational trip."
Really cool!,"I went to the Memorial because I wanted to finally do something about my ignorance regarding Korean history, and I truly enjoyed my visit: the museum is free, they have a reasonably priced cafe if you get hungry, there are also lockers and even free guided tours in English. Taking a 1.5 hour tour may not have been the best decision though: all the information that the guide gave us I could have easily learned by watching a 15-minute documentary that they show on the 3rd floor. Overall, the place is great for visitors of all ages, and the exhibitions are extremely well designed and are also interactive. However, although I went on a week day, there were quite a few people inside, so be prepared for the place to be a bit crowded. "
A good museum to understand the Korean war,"If you like to understand modern Korea and the influence of the Korean War in the general landscape of the peninsula, a trip to this museum is a must. Good layout and it has as well other great exhibitions about military elements of Korean history "
nice museum,a wide variety of airplanes and war memorabilia can be seen outside without even entering the museum.
A must visit for history seekers,"If you love history, you would love this museum/memorial. I went during the week, so it was more relaxing to read and study the art. Just plan to be there a while...took me about 3 hours...because I read everything and Google things and I still missed some things. *smile*"
An insightful afternoon,"Take line 6 to Samgakji station. It's an easy 3 minute walk from exit 12. The museum is free and offers a great insight into all Korean conflicts over the last 1,000 years. Some stunning sculptures both on the memorial grounds and inside the museum. "
Very good war mususem,"This is a very good war museum that displays the war history of Korea, especially the Korean War. There are displays outside the museum as well as a large collection within the museum. Allow at least two hours if you want to see all the displays. We found the 4D theatre really good. Overall it is an excellent place to visit."
A must go place,"The place is more of a museum than a war memorial a great view of Namsan tower and you can see the old aircrafts, naval ships and tanks. and offcourse there's North Korean's first prime minister's car too (which is cool and look luxurious too)"
Must see!,This war memorial is one of my favorites! The detail of the statues was amazing and the old airplanes add to the atmosphere.
great museum,"wen with couple of friends to this museum, you can find there weapon and army exhibits from the history of Korea, start at the Ancient time until modern warfare.you can see amazing weaponry, ships, airplanes, Vehicles and weapons.the exhibits are very nice and informative and you can learn a lot about the history of Korea from it starting from the ancient fights with the chines and Japanese until the Korean war and modern time.there is also nice memorial exhibits by various artists.at the end of the route you can find Large plot with tanks ships and jet planes that you can take picture in or next to it."
"Free admission, excellent exhibits","This is an important part of any Korean visit, as the War still looms large in the Korean psyche. It is a beautiful and well-designed museum besides, very easy to walk around. The outdoor pieces are the usual military: artillery, vehicle, airplane exhibits, with a few unusual items. Of course the memorial is for South Korean and US soldiers; yet the museum shows all sides of the war."
Interesting,This War Memorial is in the Itaewon area of Seoul. It's rather new and can easily fill an afternoon during your Seoul visit. You'll find several nice displays inside and there is a good collection of aircraft outside to explore. 
Nice history ,I visit war memorial in Seoul nice place to see and have lots of knowledge of Korean War. There is many people and have a great time you never feel how time goes.
Know your history before going,"Nice museum to visit for a day. Visited the Monet exhibition 15,000 won for entrance. It was quite nice but I don’t recommend going on the weekend, just like anywhere in Korea on a weekend overcrowded with a lot of pushing, shoving, and undisciplined kids, but it was nice to see. Also saw the DMZ and Berlin wall display really nice art from the Berlin Wall era. The main museum is free however if you did not know better the ROK Army was the savior of the Korean War. Nice displays but study up on history so you will know the real story not just South Korea propaganda"
It's worth the trip.,"Didn't have any expectations when my brother planned for us to go to the War Memorial. But I'm so glad I went ahead with it because it's one of the places you can't miss if you're ever visiting Seoul.The museum displays history from as far as during the medieval times.But the highlight would be the Korea War. The place feels very surreal with the artifacts, lightings and music playing in the background. And also they have multiple video rooms to show old footage taken during the war (a few language for you to choose) to bring you to a better level of understanding of the blood and tears their forefathers contributed to have the South Korea they have today.It's a pretty educational place.The whole museum is very big, if you are really interested, do go earlier. It closes at 6pm but we only reached at 2pm and ended up didn't have enough time to complete viewing everything."
"Part memorial, part museum","Museum/memorial presented on a grand scale. When constructing the museum they haven't fallen in the trap of making this a museum only for South Korea. The site is part museum, part memorial, part homage to the countries supporting South Korea in the Korean war, and a tribute to the UN. I was amazed at the extent the museum shows how grateful South Korea is to the UN and the states supporting them in the war and its aftermath. It also reminds you that South and North Korea are still at war - although there is a 60 year old truce. In addition to this it shows how South Korea have achieved becoming a industrial great power and a democracy during the last decades."
"Korean history, from prehistory to present times.","A glimpse into history of Korea, medieval kingdoms, and even prehistoric times. You can learn what happened when, what the relations there were between different states and how today Korea was formed. As it is military museum, wars and battles are highlighted here, but you can also learn a lot about politics in the past of Korea. The only missing part for me was from the beginning of 20th century to the end of WWII, when Korea was under Japan occupation. Overall history of Korea is one part, but the other is the Korean War. As much interesting for history fans. Not only you can learn what happened when, but there is also impressive collection of military equipment. Tanks, planes, even navy ship. Not only from the times of Korean War, but also newer ones.Definitely recommended for history and/or military fans."
A must see.,"The Koreans take their history very seriously and are truly patriotic. The War Memorial is fantastic, very surreal as your walking around observing machines used in the Korean War while orchestral music plays in the background, quite an wierd feeling. With so much to see expect to spend a large amount of time viewing the memorial part and Museum. Very interesting and informative. You really must see it."
"Interesting, well presented, worth a visit","We didn’t originally plan to come here; the name sounded like it would be a war monument. But it’s also a museum, and someone recommended it. Now we’re so glad to have experienced it, especially the section on the Korean War.We’ve heard of the Korean War but never really knew the details. The museum presents the history of events in a clear and educational way that was also engaging and provoking. It was never boring. Instead, it opened our eyes to what happened in those intense few years. It was heartbreaking and amazing, and also sheds new light on current affairs today. Really humbling.Very nicely done, would recommend it. Plus admission is free."
Humbling history lesson,"A thoroughly fascinating look at Korea's military history. From prehistoric periods up to S. Korea's contributions to the Vietnam war, the museum is highly educational. Was very humbled by the displays outside the entrance and inside dedicated to the Korean War. Just wish we had more time than we did to spend there. Definitely a must for any American visitor."
Fantastic Museum Leading You Through The Ages of Korean Warfare,The museum had everything from ancient weaponry leading up to modern arms as well. You could easily spend a whole day in the museum looking at all the exhibits both inside and out of the building. This is a for sure thing to do while staying in Seoul.
Very interesting museum and memorial,"I really enjoyed my visit to the War Memorial of Korea. I highly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in military history or the history of Korea. The signage includes English, so tourists feel welcome. It is a combination memorial and a very interesting museum tracking the military history of Korea. I learned a lot about the remarkable history of Korea in my visit. It also has a very interesting military vehicle park outside of the memorial with modern armored vehicles, missile launchers, artillery and some aircraft. The memorial portion of the site also is very moving. It is clear that the South Korean people recognized the efforts and sacrifice of the United Nations troops, as well as their own military, who fought in the Korean War more than many of the sponsor countries, including the United States. For example, the fallen American soldiers, marines, sailors and airmen are listed by states on plaques on the building."
Take a trip in Time!,"The War Memorial of Korea was amazing. So much thought went into the layout and displays I ended up spending the WHOLE day here. Definitely worth the trip. There are large war vehicles, weapons, planes, and a ship outside. You can touch, climb into and explore everything, also there is a informative movie that plays on a schedule. Inside there is an interactive and informative labyrinth of clever and creatively designed displays using multi medias and authentic pieces. There is a 4 Presentation, authentic ships, even a indoor castle you can walk through. Every section is thought out and presented in a way that will deliver the most information possible. You can spend hours here and not get bored. It is a free museum, you can put in a donation of your choosing near the entrance at anytime. There are brilliant sculptures at the front of the museum and a circle court of sorts with a union of flags before grand steps. This is a must see. I happened to pack a snack and water but there is a cafe on site to the left of the entrance. Also there are lockers available for about an inexpensive price (like 50 cents or a dollar maybe I forget) and I found a vending machine or two tucked away. I went the long way but it is a short walk to the subway and there are restaurants in the area."
Very informative,"Everyone should visit. Don't try to rush this experience. Also, summer and spring is the best time to go. "
Will visit in more detail next round!,"The War Memorial was built to commemorate participant and victims of the wars which led to the modern nation state. The museum also has the purpose of educating future generations by collecting, preserving, and exhibiting various historical relics and records related to the many wars fought in the country from a South Korean perspective. "
Eyes Opening Trip,This is a very eyes opening museum. Very clear explanation & the environment is clear & friendly. A lot of new/ high tech (4D theater) are available in this museum.
Best museum,"I usually don't like museum so much, but this one is probably the best I've been to. You can spend hours walking around and still loving it. The direction is indicate on the floor, so just follow it.I've learn a lot about Korea, and I'm considering to going back there again.And it's all for FREE!!!"
Excellent coverage and thought-provoking,"Much more than just a war memorial, this place includes a huge museum covering a variety of wars, but with a major focus on the Korean War. History buffs and those with a passing interest will both be kept interested for hours! Only thing to note is that the 3D movie displays only run every hour or so and have a very limited capacity, so queue early if you want to see these."
a glimpse of the Korean War,"This place is a good place and entrance is free. If you love history and wars, this place is for you. (closed on Mondays)There are lots of monuments outside the building and you can take tons of pictures and even your kids will love all the planes/boats/vehicles exhibits. Its recommended both for kids and war/history fanatics. There is no entrance fee but some exhibit INSIDE the main building have separate fee. Make sure that the weather is not too cold or raining to really enjoy the outside exhibits. To go there: there are 2 stations where you can align to be there: Samgakji Station of line 6 or Namyeong Station of line 1. Use the Namyeong Station since it is a lot closer to the main entrance than the Samgakji station (we walk for 15 mins from that station before seeing the BACK of the museum) If you suddenly went hungry or need to take a pee, there is a cafe inside the main building and a comfort room. Also, there is a building on the side for food selections."
War Memorial of Korea,"We stayed in Seoul for two days, and used a private tour guide (Jake from This is Korea - fantastic guide). He took us to the War Memorial, which was very worthwhile. The memorial has a wonderful exhibit outside of many tanks, fighter jets, and other military equipment and planes. Very interesting. Inside the museum the focus is on the Korean War, and how the US and Russia were involved. This was a great museum and anyone visiting Seoul should spend a few hours at the War Museum."
Interesting viewing,You could spend hours and hours walking around this museum. The outdoor war artillery and monuments are extremely interesting. We have only been once but feel we need to make another trip.
Big museum,"Big museum located at samgaji station.easily accessible ! One of the best museum in asia! Worth the time ,its free (:"
Saw this 3yrs ago and back again!,This place is just amazing..went here 3 years ago and went back again for more. This is a place YOU SHOULD NOT MISS seeing when visiting Seoul!
A great way to spend an afternoon in Seoul,"A hidden free gem. When I worked in Seoul as a teacher I used to bring my classes here. They loved it. Places to eat, real planes, tanks and trucks outside and great exhibits and information inside. Three levels. Well worth a visit. They also have other types of exhibits sometimes. Came back to Korea recently and took my wife here."
"Amazing museum inside & out, interactive. A beautiful memorial to veterans.","We really enjoyed the war memorial. It is so well done & interactive. The planes, tanks, vehicles were interesting for the kids. The memorial is just huge & our children did get tired after awhile, even though the adults could have stayed longer. There is also a children's museum there for young children, which they enjoyed. I would love to visit again, as it was very moving."
Great Museum of the Korean War,"This is the best museum of the Korean War I have encountered. Very strong. Frankly, however, it is pretty over the top in favor of Macarthur. My personal feeling is that this could have been a major war due to MacArthur's recklessness. Containment worked here. At least through 2015. . ."
Good if you like history,The memorial and museum are full of different exhibits from different wars and items from the wars. You could spend as little or as much time as you wanted in this free museum. 
War memorial,i also visit War memorial good to see history of Korea and Korean war with different time in past after visit you know cultural of korea
Interesting place ,"I'm not really into museums of his kind. But I actually enjoyed this museum, particularly the social history of Korea during the war. "
Must go,It is a historical place. IT portray the korean war very well. There are warships and planes for the display. You can get on it and take a look inside. It is incredibly well maintained. Very clean. Must go.
Amazing Piece of History,"This museum covers the situation and the events of the Korea War in a way I had never seen before. Especially as a new resident of Seoul, this is an absolute MUST because it provides so much context into the way Koreans view their world and how they have emerged from economic peril to become the technology hub it is today. There is so much information that it could easily be done in two visits if you have the time. Otherwise, you can plan the better part of a day here if you are interested in learning all of the details of the conflict."
Recreational visit rich in conflict,The wife and I had a blast and had no clue of what to expect. There was rich history and a multi lingual staff that made the trip enjoyable and we were through my impressed in what we experienced. The only bad thing was that it was very large and we spent 2 hours exploring exhibits and we didn't have enough time to clear everything before it was time for the muesume to close. 
Enjoyable Visit,"Visited the War Memorial with my family. We spent about 4 hours there and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. Lots of exhibits and videos about the War with the North Koreans and the Japanese. Although we went on a weekend, we were surprised that the place wasn't packed with people. The outdoor exhibition area, in which tanks, planes, missiles and even a mock-up of a gunboat was displayed ....was very good.Sadly, directional signs on the route one should take in the exhibition halls should improve. We were slightly disappointed that two big halls were closed."
Great museum! Hugh dome and many fields of the real events. Love the real veteran-guides very much. Must see!,"Walk along the path to see all of event hall. There's a subway train just in front of it. Of cause,This museum is best for Korean War. "
Very moved by visit,"This was the end destination of our demilitarized zone tour. The DMZ joint security area was closed when we were there due to tensions between the two nations. Since my dad was in the war and I am a history buff, this museum and memorial was very touching. There is much to be learned from a visit here."
Interesting visit,This is a very interesting place where we get to understand more about korea history. Good to come and spend a good 3 hours here.
Korean War Memorial,"This place is huge. Very impressive. For someone interested in this kind of stuff, one could spend the entire day here and not get bored. One section (there are 8, I think) features military transport of all kinds and missliles. There is a whole B52 bomber on display, various tanks, a whole ship, APC's, missile and mortar systems, artillery pieces, etc. The museum is closed on Mondays. There is an admission charge if you want to go inside. Very accessible. From the subway, get off at the Namyeong station. Signage is aplenty so it is pretty hard to get lost."
Expansive Korean War Museum,"Must see for military historians or anyone that wants to understand the American ""forgotten war"" from the perspective of the Korean people that couldn't avoid this conflict that has torn their society in half. The military equipment displays are fascinating and fun for young children to climb around on, and the memorial to the fallen is sobering."
Beautiful and FREE Museum,"I loved this memorial museum. As someone who prides myself in being a history buff, I was excited to learn more than books could teach as I walked around with my boyfriend and took in all the information. It is an incredible memorial and the turtle ship was definitely cool to see. Outside of the museum there are different aircrafts that you can walk around and they even have places you can go up an look inside. This is an all ages sort of place. I saw kids running around and playing, I saw people my age in uniform walking around with their girlfriends on their break, I saw elderly enjoying the experience as well. One of the most interesting and well set up memorial museums I have been to. Definitely check it out if you love history and want to learn more or even if you are just looking for a place to hide out from the cold and kill time. There was also a Berlin Wall exhibit but we decided to skip is since we have been to the remains of it in Germany already."
Worth a visit on the way to or from Itaewon/Gyungridan/HBC,Title says it all. External displays are well worth a walk around and one of only two B-52s on show in the world
Worth visiting,"It has indoor and outdoor exhibitions, of which the latter is more worth visiting. Award-winning statues, and real military planes, tanks and missiles are exhibited outdoor. Exit 12 of Samgakji is closest to the museum."
Nicely done museum ,"Museum has multiple rooms with history on Korean War. As you go through the museum, you will soon realize there is also lot of propaganda. Just need to be able to filter the good information from the displays. The huge memorial status of soldiers in the front of the museum is amazing and worth seeing!"
Historical Place to Visit,"As the name suggests, this is about the history of war(s) in Korea. For kids, looking at display of tanks and navy boat and armory guns could be of interest. Worth visiting for fans of history. "
Great place ,I can understand why this is rated number 1 in trip advisor. The memorial's exhibition do give you a strong feeling of the impact of war and their way of life during war time. I love the short video of Heroes and love one. Total captured the essence of the struggles during war time. I spent almost half a day. Don't think this is enough. 
Great afternoon learning KOREAN war history,"Excellent exhibits, with some being cinema and 4D. Excellent static displays outside Inc historical planes like a B52, f86, f5 and an Apache. Great way to spend an afternoon. "
Definitely worth a visit,"A memorable yet interesting place to visit . Different facilities are accessible and the building is well maintained . A real navy ship & fighter jets are also available there . Alight @samgakji station , 5 minutes walk from nearest exit (exit 3, pls double check)"
A must visit in Korea!!,"This place is fantastic, I could have spent all day here if I had the time. There is so much to see and learn here. You really get a sense of what was used during the war and what soldiers went through. Inside the museum part of the memorial, there is loads to see as well. Well worth the visit!! "
impressive,a must-see if you are in Seoul. Multiple monuments and exhibits - both indoor and outdoors - show the history and honor the dead. It is best to spend at least 2 hours there in order to see everything.
Interesting place,"Visited with my husband in December. Large areas to see, lots of outdoor military planes, tanks etc. great display inside as well, spent five hours there."
A place not to be miss.....,Free to access. This attraction is great my son love it alot. Do spend more time here to understand the history of Korean War. It can reach by subway.
Spend a day here,"This place is suitable for a weekend family visit, school trips and of course tourist. This is my second trip here the first being eight years ago. Having gone through the exhibits inside and rushed through the ones outside I chose to enjoy the outdoors exhibition this time. There were a few static displays mostly commemorating the triumph of the south and then there were display of aircraft used in battles. The weekend I was there there was a group of school children clearly thrilled with getting to climb on some of the tanks and aircraft. There are benches around the park where you can take refuge from the sun or just to take a breather."
Lots of quality static displays,"Free. Good static displays outside and inside, including a turtle boat. Wheelchair accessible and family friendly. Sometimes there are performances by military drill teams (usually around South Korean holidays like Armed Forces Day, etc.)."
Impressive Military Hardware,We passed by the War Memorial on our walk towards Itaewon. The military hardware display was impressive. They even have a B52 on display. We did not have time to visit all the hardware but managed to view the more impressive hardware.It is a must see if you are interested in the Korean War or military buff.
Spectacular and emotive,"This was a great experience. The collection of military equipment displayed in the yard is quite impressive and the content on the ""themed"" rooms inside the building is extensive.It is a powerful display and quite interesting ""story-telling"" ensemble. You will leave the building with a great understanding of the Korean War events and its participants (the collection of items and stories from soldiers are very touching).You don't have to be a ""history"" or ""war"" nerd to appreciate this memorial/museum. In a way, it also helps you understand some aspects of Korean society (how they treat their seniors, their national pride and their relationship with the outside world)"
Great for part of the history! ,"We were a family of 15, from ages 3-74. We all found it interesting & informative. They also offer free tours in English, which you can book through the internet or by phone. "
"Good for childern, but lack of theme for museum.","The museum is located within Seoul Station and National Museum of Korea. Mainly, this museum perform tregedy of Forgatten war (Korean war). But there is lack of exhibition for adult, but exhibitions for children are filled with APC, Tanks, Planes."
Interesting place and kids enjoyed it as well,"Spent half day looking around. Kids thought it was great, especially outside with the tanks, planes and ship which you can go inside. A English guide is available at certain times of the day but the leaflet was good enough to get around. "
A must-see!,"Wow, this place is fantastic. Many details of the war and excellent descriptions. Although the war was sad, as all wars are, there is a warmth and depth of emotion present in the museum that brought tears to my eyes. I am an American, and I can't count the number of times Koreans thanked me for our involvement and help. They are truly grateful for all of the nations who participated. Kind, friendly people. "
Touching,"This place sent chills down my spine. To see Korea's history, the faces of the people who fought for their country... it was unforgettable."
Very nice museum,Spent a morning walking around this museum. It was very interesting and gave a total history of Korean conflicts. They have brochures at the entrance in English which helps. A lot of the displays have English on them also. The outdoor exhibit is nice to walk around. Good way to learn more about the Korean conflict and spend a few hour. And it is free admission..
Well worth every second,"I must say, I was surprised to hear that the War Memorial of Korea was ranked so highly by tourists as a must-see attraction. And then I got there and understood why. The magnitude of the war and what it has meant for South Korea and all nations who participated just hits you like a ton of bricks upon arrival. This museum/memorial is absolutely incredible. If you have even the tiniest interest in or learning about the significance of the Korean War, then this place is for you. It's highly educational, and there are many videos, and interactive displays that help visitors really put themselves into the shoes of the soldiers who fought in the war. Outside there are a multitude of war planes and other vehicles and artillery on display. It's really quite something to see and experience. Plan to spend at least 3-4 hours exploring the museum and the grounds. I also highly recommend going to this memorial/museum before going to see the DMZ/JSA (demilitarized zone/joint security area) as it really helps you get more out of that tour if you're planning on going on it (which I also VERY highly recommend)."
"Even if you don't like museums, go!","Usually I get bored of a museum within the hour, but I could stay here easily for 3/4 hours. 7 reasons to go:1. The place is free!2. Movies and interactive screens everywhere around.3. There is even some 4D movies.4. If you are not familiar with the Korea war: they explain you everything.5. If you are familiar with the Korea war: there is so many in-depth things to see.6. When bored of seeing historical photos and movies, just go look at some fighter planes, tanks, cars and bullets.7. Everything is in English/Chinese/Korean."
really good,"great activity for half a day, particularly if the weather is not good.. There is a big area outside lo look at all of the ar equipment, tanks etc. Inside ther are loades of exhibits from Koreas history and the war in general, really interesting　"
Great Museum,"If you're like me and barely know anything about the Korean War, go see this museum. We had an English speaking guide that lived through the Korean War and his personal stories made it all that more real. It was insightful, heartbreaking, and awe inspiring all at the same time. If you're in Seoul in the winter and want to go someplace warm for an afternoon, this is the place to go."
Worth Visiting,"This is one place that is worth visiting as there are lots of things to see. The place is quite large and housing many war planes, tankers on display. Pretty impressive and worth a visit. "
Educational & FUN visit! So much to see & do!,"The is a MUST do/MUST see museum! BEST museum I've ever been to! Interactive fun for everyone! Our 6 year old said it was his favorite part of his visit to Korea! He can't wait to return, neither can I! The 4 D movies, realistic scenes, endless military aircraft & vehicles makes you lose track of time! Everyone should go!"
War memorial museum,This place which you can see the war related historic items. This place is close to Itaewon so good to visit there too.
History travel,Nothing like seeing with your eyes .... It's like living history. I hate war memorials because glorify war ....but in Korea its their reality. Their country is still divided. Only seeing the mistakes of the past will keep us away from repeating them.A must !
A WORTH PLACE TO VISIT!,THIS IS AN AWESOME PLACE! I learned a lot and it's very educational and the war museum conveys me how terrible the past was. It is so huge and I so love the place! I'll visit it again next time.
Amazing Museum for History Buffs and those who want to learn about Korea,"I love history--and frankly know nothing about the Korean War. While this Memorial covers much more than just that conflict the exhibits that trace the war from its origins to the present day is simply excellent. I learned so much. There are many other exhibits both about Korea's history and about the present state of the Korean Army. Again well done but not as interesting. There is a massive display of real military vehicles, tanks, planes outside the museum also. If you are in to history--especially military history--visit! It is also a Memorial to those who have passed defending their country and this is very well done and somber."
Really interesting visit while in Seoul,"The War Memorial is a really interesting place to visit in Seoul. I recommend it for those who are interested in Korean history, or for those who just want to know more about the country they're visiting. It's definitely worth a visit!"
Wow!,"As a plane enthusiasts I was amazed thay you could get so close to touch, feel and see some of these awesome machines.If you have a spare couple of hours, then this place will educate you to the point that you will have a new found respect for the men and women who served."
Worth a visit,"I've been wanting to visit this museum for a while because two family members were part of the UN forces in the 50s. Today I finally had the chance. I only had a couple of hours available, but you could easily spend much longer. It was a bit cold, so I didn't have a chance to see much on the grounds, but in warmer weather that would probably take at least another hour. The museum actually covers more than just 1950-53, it includes history of the ROK armed forces and all of their contributions in UN peacekeeping efforts. There is a written guide in English (and other languages) and most of the short video clips were also available in English (and Chinese and Japanese, as well as Korean). There was an English tour available at certain times, but I didn't take advantage of that. The museum has many interesting exhibits with lots of information. It is large, but easy to navigate and there are restrooms on every floor. There is also a cafe and small gift shop as well. I would recommend visiting the museum if you have at least a couple of hours available. Be aware that it is always closed on Mondays and holidays. I got to the museum on subway Line 6 and got off at Samgakji station. If you take exit 12 out of the station just walk straight ahead and you will come to the museum within a couple of blocks. It was really easy to find and an easy walk from the subway station."
A mut when in Seoul,"I am not surprised that this site is the #1 on Trpiadvisor for Seoul, it is a must to visit once you have a free day. I have spent roughly 5 hours in the museum and was not able to go through all the reading material on the Korean War (there are also some other rooms which I even didn't manage to visit).The museum is easily reachable with the metro (Samgakji station, Line #4, exit 12).A tip, make sure you visit this museum before going to the DMZ."
Great place!,An incredible memorial! This should defintely be on every Seoul tourist's to do list. Definitely see it on a day when it's not raining. 
"Take your time, please!","I went there with my parents and we had 3 hours ""to kill"" - man, we were surprised, that this place offered so much more! More time to see everything, more depth, to feel it, more everything. Please, plan more than 3 hours to come here!"
Super War Exhibition Not To Be Missed,It was a super exhibition and the layout was well thought out. It was easy to manouver through the various halls and the exhibits are of high quality and full of information. Many videos available depending on how much time one has. I missed the 4D and 3D show due to poor timimg on my side. Suggest that one check the website and search for more information regarding the shows.
Great War Memorial,An excellent display of war memorials and old planes. Need at least 2-3 hours to see most of the display. It's worth the time and effort. One of the stop on the Seoul City Bus tour.
Great historical site and interesting war machine exhibition,"Learnt many new details about the Korean war, the outside exhibition of planes and tanks is also very interesting, with some historical details to each exhibit. Of course, descriptions are a bit one-sided seeing the ongoing conflict."
Educational and an eye opener,"This is one place I've always wanted to go and glad I found time this trip to be there. Would highly recommend anyone interested in the history of North and South Korea to visit this place. Before entering the building, you will be able to have a view of a collection of the aircraft used during the war time. Nearly missed this as this was at the side of the building in an open area. It's really impressive. In the main building, you will be able to understand the history of the 2 Koreas, why it is spilt and the effects of the "
Very good exhibits. Interesting displays. Educational,Brings you to the first conflict that happened from ancient dynasties to the Korean War conflict. Immerseful and easy flow of information brings clear understanding to its history.
A must see!,This is a fantastic museum with something for everyone. Little ones love climbing in the tanks and older ones enjoy the 4D displays and vivid re enactments. Artists will really appreciate the memorial hall.Definitely worth visiting.
Excellent ,"Amazing war memorial museum. The English guide was free (museum entrance is also free) and audio guides are also available. Learned a ton about the korean war and the museum grounds were beautiful. Definitely visit if you are interested in history (would recommend over Seoul national museum, which is much larger and covers all of korean history, because the korean war focus was more interesting). "
Big and interactive and informative lastly its free !!,Outside of the museum there are cool war machinery and weapons used during the kirean war examples would be Soviet Mig planes and US tanks. Really cool to see and enter these vehicles to see what it was like back then. Inside the museum it is very interactive as you can interact with the exhibits showcased in the memorial museum. Also very informative and has a cool 4D documentary of how Korea was invaded. 
interesting for those who love history,"well documented museum on the 1950s Korea War: a must view for those who share passion for history. the park aslo hosts an impressive number of military equipments, from planes to tanks, to vassels. worth spending a couple of hours or more"
A Top Flight Museum,"We visited 'The War Memorial of Korea' during a visit to Seoul in the very hot month of August. It was a really worthwhile place to spend 2-3 hours of our day. Outside of the museum building were life-sized monuments to the soldiers who fought in the Korean War and an impressive display of the weaponry (tanks, aircraft, artillery, vehicles and even a patrol boat) that were used. It was one of the most complete displays I have ever seen. The inside of the museum was broken up into areas where each phase of the Korean War was explained through the printed word (in English), photos, maps, diagrams and life-like dioramas. It was very well done. At the end of our time there, we felt that we had increased our knowledge of the events and consequences of that war. The museum also gave away a free book on the war that would be a very nice addition to anyone's home library."
Inspiring,"This was my second visit. I remembered that I found it inspiring on my first visit to Seoul twenty years ago and so it was on my list to visit on my return trip. Something for everyone with the outside planes, ships and tanks to the indoor films and memorials to the soldiers of the Korean conflict."
Group visit,"This is a great rainy or snowy day activity. There is plenty to do and see. The exhibits are funny, engaging, and educational. There is several static displays outside to see and touch. As must see in Seoul."
"War memorial, South Korea","It's a vast ease of open space and a very large building showcasing all the history related to wars in south Korea. Outside you have a large collection if battle tanks, oD boats etc where you can climb in and explore. Takes around two to three hours. Snacks and coffee and rest rooms available "
A Place Where Every Filipino Should Be Proud Of,"A trip to The War Memorial of Korea is like experiencing what's like to be during the war. We saw several well-preserved war memorabilia like pictures, documents, flags, actual war footage and others. What's interesting there is they used high-tech audio visuals and life-sized dioramas. There are very interesting 3D film viewings that made us feel as if we're a part of it. This war memorial museum also acknowledges the countries that helped Korea during the war. One is the Philippines. There's a flag and other memorabilia pertaining to the Philippines that made us proud as a Filipino. Outside the museum is an exhibit of several warplanes, a warship and other war tanks where we freely took our pictures. The center of attraction is the War Memorial monument outside. There are human steel structures depicting the war. Very interesting and educational as well. Parking is not a problem and there is no entrance fee. "
One of Seoul's best attractions,"The War Memorial of Korea (free entry) is an important attraction dedicated to the Korean War which raged over the Korean Peninsula during the early 1950s. There are six themed halls and a large outdoor exhibition area where you can spend several hours learning about the Korean conflict. Opening hours are 9am to 6pm daily, closed on Mondays. As you approach the War Memorial, you will see several large outdoor monuments which set the stage for a educational it not sombre experience of visiting an attraction like this. There are also numerous military vehicles, planes, vessels, equipment in the outdoor exhibition area that are worth spending time to view before or after you enter the monument to explore the halls within. Exhibition rooms do a good job of presenting the war in a mixed variety of ways and medium; traditional text and figurative displays, cased displays, wall maps, sounds of the war and even 4D experience of MacArthur's landing at Inchon. In this manner, there is a nice effort to make the memorial as accessible as possible to a younger audience, who might not enjoy traditional war and military museums. At the War Memorial you will find expected lockers, a cafe and gift shop at the War Memorial of Korea but no wifi, unlike the various national museums you can visit around Seoul. Photography is allowed throughout as well. You can easily spend 2-3 hours here leisurely going through the exhibition halls learning about the Korean War. We very much appreciated our latest visit to the War Memorial of Korea. This is one of those attractions that can have a real impact on visitors, a place you want to return to during future trips to Seoul."
Nice place to spend an afternoon,"It's very accessible via public transport. Simply take the subway to Samgakji station and you can walk from there! However, I visited on a Monday, which is unfortunately the day it's closed! Luckily for me, there were a lot of things to see OUTSIDE of the museum. Learned quite a bit about South Korean military history as well as some of the planes/helicopters that SK used."
Now I know why this place rated #1!,"I not a big fans of history and war. But this place is a must visit for those who is visiting Seoul from overseas. The sequence of the exhibits, the interactive and technology fused with the history made it so interesting. This probably one of the many best exhibits I have been to and the admission price is $0!. You need a good 2 hours. "
A historical overview,Definitely a must go especially if you want to learn more about the history between the North and South. 
Informative and educational,"I visited the Museum on a beautiful morning, learned a lot about Korean war and as a Chinese, heard stories from the other side. Respect to Korean people"
Great Memorial and Museum,"I could not believe this place was free, the war memorial is right next to the museum and you can spend hours inside that place. Highly recommend taking a trip to this area, but leave plenty of time to explore. "
Nice park,Get to see some of the actual military vehicles used during the war.Good Information of the Korean war.
Captivating and Free History Lesson,"This museum is free! Inside and out you can see and climb aboard actual military vechicles. There are three floors packed with an overview of the conflict Korea has endured during its history. There are tributes to the people from all over the world who have come alongside Korea and aided in the conflict. Impactful excerpts, but several interactive parts as well. There is a children's musuem with play parks (indoor/outdoor) on the grounds. Beautiful to sit in the cafe and watch the scenery. Our children 12 and 8 were thourghly caught up in this musuem and we learned a great deal more than the basic knowledge. Easy taxi/bus stops right at entrance to grounds."
Learn about Korean history ,"Its a great place to learn about South Korea history , its military history and also ROK at present timeMagnificent ways to keep you interested, there are 3D and 4D shows. Have indoor and outdoor exhibition were you can see a real used tanks and airplanes. Free entrance No guide  "
"Many exhibits to see, either indoors or outdoors","It opens from 0900 to 1800 (last admission is 1700). I took the subway to Namyeong station and walked for 5 mins to reach the memorial.The place is quite huge and you can easily spend 2-3 hours here. There's an outdoor exhibition that showcases different kinds of military vehicles such as fighter jets and even a ship.Inside the building (after the Peace Plaza), there are a few floors of exhibitions. Definitely a place worth going if you have any kind of interest at all in history/war."
Very Interesting and FREE!!,"Tbe war Memorial was one of the most interesting places I visited in the whole country of Korea while I lived there for 3 years. It's free admiaaion and has amazing war vehicles all over the outside grounds, some of which you can board. Surprising finds as to the countries that took part in the Korean war, so many personal exhibita with uniforms. Lots of cool weapons and gagets but also alot of tragic stories. A really emotional, exciting and interactive experience all for free. A must see near Itaewon in Seoul."
War Memorial is AMAZING!,"I currently living in Hong Kong and must say that there are a lot of similarities between HK and Seoul. The War Memorial however is a slice of something very special. Apart from all the military vehicles which I spend hours checking out and the monuments and history texts, this place can easily be a days trip if you are into this stuff. I just went there because it was highly recommended on TripAdvisor but I ended up staying a lot longer than I thought."
willing to cry,"i am feeling pity on those people in the war as same as people in west Asia. this place, i can see a lot of family brought those kids to play around as same in Dien Bien Phu but here is more wealthy and attractive than. "
"Very informative, touching museum","I visited because I felt ""I had to"", but ended up staying much longer than expected. Very informative in an intelligent way, interesting architecture. I highly recommend."
Must visit,"A must do in Seoul. Very educational & moving. Also can see a lot of weapons, tanks & aircraft on display outside the museum."
place for a minute of reverie,we were there as a part of a trip to JSA organized by Seoul City Tour (absolutely recommend) this trip and this organizer.
Can't believe it's free,"This was one of my most meaningful museum experiences. It's set up in a way that is not alienating, but allows various ages and interest levels to get something out of it. It really hit home that this war in Korea's history is not something dusty in a book, but something that is affecting us all today. This is a service to Koreans and visitors and I think it's something we should support, if not with admission, then with our donations and thoughtful reflection. "
A mandatory visit,"The War Memorial is unforgettable. You will need at least 4 hours to have a good view of all areas. It is not only about the Korean War, which took place from 1950 to 1953, but also about almost two thousand of Korean History, such as the period of Three Kingdoms and Joseon Dynasty (from 1392 to 1910)."
Free and Awesome,My husband brought me here while I was visiting Korea and I learned all about the Korean war in about an hour!
Equivalent to the Holocaust Museum in DC,"I couldn't spend a lot of time here but I'm glad I decided to see it on my last day. It was an amazing museum. It was well thought out and very creative. Best part, it was free!"
History,This place is full of Korean history. Good for knowledge especially for those who wants to know a lot about Korean War
You get a lot of information for free!,I love that it was free. There are military vehicles to see on the right side of the main building. There are two big memorials outside. Be prepared to walk. It was very educational inside as well. Start in the basement with the Turtle Boats and work your way up.
Great educational experience,"I knew a little bit about the Korean War, but learned a lot more after going to the War Memorial. In addition to the museum, you can also see tanks and other weapons on the outside of the museum. You can even go on top of one of the ships. I stayed to watch a couple of videos and learned quite a bit about the 3 year war. The video clip had English subtitles for people who don't understand Korean (I'm in this boat).It was a great experience for free, although you can make an optional donation should you choose to do so. It was a short walk from the Samgakji Station."
Great day at The War Memorial of Korea,"my friends and i came across a 'statue of brothers' in one of the souvenir stores at the DMZ and googled to find out more about the background. it brought us to the War Memorial of Korea and i must say it's a great choice we made to visit it the next day!i'm not sure if it's a permanent exhibition, we visited end Oct and outside, there were airplanes, warships and tanks' model replicas on display. you can view a 7 min show depicting the confrontation between South and North in Year 2002, resulting in the death of 6 South Korean officers. the show only starts with minimum audience of 5, but the lady staff was kind to let us view it, even though we were only 3. if you watched it, you can better understand the exhibitions held in the war memorial building.there is a shooting simulation game in the Korean history exhibition. if there are students around, you may get a chance to try it. (my friends did, with a bunch of school students. i tried later on, but the staff rejected me and pointed to the 'students only' signboard)inside, you can view a 3D clip too. initially, they refused to start the clip as i was the only one waiting there. but to my surprise they allow a caucasian couple to enter. so unless you are caucasian or you can speak conversational korean, you probably will be ignored. i followed the couple in, and a male staff wearing a suit (manager, maybe) went to call for other visitors around (a korean elderly tour group) to join in. was told to fasten our seatbelts so we thought it's those 4D shows where your chairs can rock. but to our disappointment, nothing happened. the 3D clip was just a pilot's view on a fighter jet. NOT WORTH VIEWINGhowever there are many interactive screens and many well-made replicas of various incidents and information on South Korea's involvement in the World's war assistance.very educationalthere's a cafe in the war memorial building. serve desserts and waffles. the souvenir shop sells similar items to those sold in DMZ. if you are into history, this is the place for you."
"Impressive ""arsenal"" of Korean history!!!","The war memorial was definitely a pleasant surprise. The building is massive with a neat architecture and you are sure to spend at least 3 hours to get through it all. You will be sure to learn a lot bout the war history by watching movies, viewing displays, several bronze statues, and miniature models. The highlight was definitely the outside display of several of war tanks, planes, ships, etc... "
Beyond expectation,"I was expecting a stunning memorial to the Korean War, however, this is a full scla museum. Lots of aircraft (B52 & many more) and lots of Military hardware. As memorials go, this was breath takingly stunning. A must visit, in my opinion."
Korean War and History ,It is a museum for the Korean war. Here you can enjoy the history of that war and the countries participated in that war. It worth the visit but it is in a central crowded area in Seoul. So you should consider the traffic jam when going there. 3-4 hours are the minimum to cover all. 
Great displays and very informative!,The displays were very well thought out and provided detailed explanations on the war Korea faced. Its a good way to spend a rainy day in Seoul!
Very Touching Experience,"This museum was build to commemorate the Korean War. Some of it was being renovated when we were there. 1 thing to remember, CLOSED ON MONDAY. Must visit place to learn the most important part of Korea."
Really interesting ,"A huge amount to see and a really good way to understand more about the history of the country. There is a really impressive array of planes, boats, weapons and tanks on display that both adults and kids would enjoy."
A must-visit!!,"Intriguing, inspiring and totally worth it. Casts great insight into the regretful Korean war. One emerges from the visit feeling awed - and grateful."
Not just for military buffs.,"Outside is full of tanks and aero planes, some of which you can climb aboard and pretend to fire, drive etc - great for kiddies of all ages. Inside is more serious - with several rooms - each from a different perspective or time. Room three has a great history on the U.N and the Korean War, stating which countries sent help and in what form. There are interactive displays, a 4d cinema and so many artifacts - enough to keep the enthusiasts happy. There is also the more sombre lists of dead soldiers. Well worth a visit. I have been back with my children on numerous occasions (usually we just look at the tanks etc outside.)"
Very interesting,"The War Memorial of Korea is a very interesting place. It a couple of blocks from the Samgakji Station. It's one stop away from the National Museum and 1 or 2 from Itaewon station. There is a large outdoor area with numerous outdoor exhibits that leads into the main building. You could probably spend most of an afternoon here if not all day. Many exhibits are interactive and interesting for children, although it's always about death and war. You'll have to decide whether you want your kids to see it. Outside by the foot of the stairway in front of the main building there are vending machines, if you want more you'll have to walk out a bit. I recommend bringing drinks and snacks. On the right of the building outdoors there are war vehicles. Behind that is the children's museum. I'm assuming there are more interactive things for kids as I've never been in there."
The military vehicles on display outside are worth the trip!,".... Unfortunately the rest of it is pretty forgettable. I also went on the hottest and most humid day of the year (of course). While I really wanted to spend most of my time outside checking out the military vehicles, most of time was spent inside going from room to room and I actually don't think there's a single thing I found very interesting. It's definitely one of those ""if you've seen one, you've seen them all"". That being said, if you have some time to spare and you're near Noksapyeong or Itaewon, I highly recommend visiting the outdoor portion of the museum. It's free. And if you've never really been up close to military vehicles, this is a great way to see some really cool stuff."
Excellent ,"If there only one museum that you have time for, then this should be it. Very informative and exhibits are carefully curated. Moreover, it takes little effort to get there as it is in the city itself. "
Surprised how excellent it was ,It's much better than I expected. Never thought that this museum is real good. Learnt a lot of things about war in Korea with various ways they offered. Wasn't bored at all during my visit. 
A must see if in the area!,"It was really interesting to read all about the Korean War. The impact it had is unbelievable (The Korean War). I was stunned. This day was also a field trip for the middle school kids, they were well behaved. I think I was a dare (to go talk to the American :) LOL) it was funny."
A lot of great information about the history of the Korean war.,The memorial includes a first floor exhibit devoted to the details of the Korean war. It takes you from start to finish and there is worthwhile video presentation in the exhibit. 
Impressive museum,"Our son, who is very interested in information on wars in general, wanted to go here. The museum didn't disappoint. Very extensive, a lot of information and items on display, and most of all it provides a good view on the history of South Korea and the influences of neighboring countries.Outside of the museum, there are a lot of fighter planes, rockets and vessels to have a look at."
Wish we had a whole day to spend there,"Beautifully well done, with multi-language, interactive displays, dioramas and movies. We were moved and inspired to learn more. The children museum and outdoor aircraft displays were a hit with our children."
See before you visit DMZ,"I just came back from visit to this memorial/museum. Good exhibits indoors explaining the war. Outside there are planes, tanks and other military equipment. I decided to come here before my trip to the DMZ tomorrow based on some suggestions I read about on this website. Very easy to get here. I took the metro line 4 to Samgakji station exit 12. Then it was a short walk. In the afternoon I went to the National Museum of Korea as it is on the same metro line and only a few stops away."
Something different,"There are actual plane , tank, machine guns there . You can spend around 1 to 2 hours there . The place will show you their gratification to those who fought with them in war."
Impressive and Moving,"Other than the impressive and well designed museum, this memorial also includes collection of planes, tanks, artillery machineries and other wartime vehicles. Displays and exhibits were well maintained and thoughtfully arranged accordingly. English descriptions were also included. Overall, we were really impressed by the atmosphere of the place and the amount of knowledge we obtained regarding the Korean war while visiting."
A great collection of Korean history,"Throughout its long history, Korea has been a part of several wars, willingly and unwillingly.If you're a history buff and this kind of thing interests you, then this War Memorial is a great place to stop by. It not only contains artifacts and exhibits from modern wars, but those from older periods."
Korean War Memorial,"A great visit, including actual planes, tanks, trucks etc. The memorial is also a museum that goes through the prewar events, and the circumstances the prompted the war. A good historical perspective. For history buffs this is a great visit."
Stunning memorial,"The Koreans are simply amazing at making a statement. This memorial is extremely well thought out, flows well and is definitely worth the visit. I know a LOT about that war now. "
A war to remember,I love this place. it's quiet yet historical. The place will show you the military power of South Korea plus their gratification to those who fought with them in war. 
Absolutely MUST!,"This is the only museum out of all museums visited throughout the world that made me so emotional, yet at the same time so much fun and entertaining. It has full of information, extremely well designed & planned out and impressive use of technology to display the information. Visited this museum twice because the first time I ran out of time.. You need 2 hrs to see just the 3rd floor.. Plan ahead for at least 3hrs."
Favourite attraction in Seoul,I have been here about 4 times and I love the exhibits. Summarises the history of Korea nicely that has never been at peace with all the fighting. The exihibits are fairly new and the outdoor exihibit with real tankers and fighter jets are really cool. Really recommend this attraction to anyone who wants to learn more about the history of Korea!
Seriously good! ,"I was surprised at just how good this museum actually was. I've been to war museums in the past and I've been impressed but nothing like this. Extremely user friendly, by that, I mean it caters to all languages. Don't miss the short videos on the 3rd floor. Each video has its only little pod and only last a few minutes, definitely worth stopping for!"
Great view of history and English speaking friendly,Massive museum with great English annotations in the galleries. Covers Korean war in great detail across 2 galleries. Fine outside area with tanks and planes. Would recommend. Very informative.
Informative and Interesting,"I particularly enjoyed the outdoor military exhibits. Many varieties of tanks, aircraft and artillery. Interesting plaques by each one to explain the use and history. "
Very informative and emotional history of the Korean War,Very informative and emotional history of the Korean War and the help it received from its Allies. highly reccommend a tour prior to visiting the DMZ and JSA. Puts everything in perspective.
Reflective,"Easy to get to. Lots of vehicles and aircraft, tanks outside, so easy to see and lots of room to explore in detail. Displays were descriptive and in English. Most of this exhibit was relating to the Korean War."
Excellent In Every Way,"We were staying at The Dragon on Yongsan Army Base and walked over from there. About a 15 minutes walk.Huge entrance. They have guided tours but we took a brochure and did it on our own. 3 large levels so be prepared for a lot of standing and a lot of walking. We were there for 4 hours and saw pretty much everything. We learned a lot, as we did not know too much about the war. Some parts were very moving. FREE admission. They have lockers to use and there is a small gift shop and food galley. Clean restrooms too. Quite a few school groups but they were respectful and not a bother.We were tired after going through the Memorial so plan on taking a break after. VERY nice museum...a MUST SEE. 5 STARS."
Very well done!,You'll need more than one hour to appreciate the attention to details. Prior to my visit I was ignorant of all the countries involved and te number of lives affected
"Free, a nice space on a rainy day.","We went on a weekday and there were very few people. The attraction is free and the staff are helpful. I have read a little about the Korean War and there was not a lot of new information, but most exhibits are translated and came from a vantage point that gave a different insight. The is also a good range of displays, objects, projections and areas built to look like a kind of tunnel and valley. I liked the memorial areas them selves, for some this may feel empty but I felt that was part of the experience and quite moving. We went after a DMZ tour and I felt that they worked well together. A lot of day DMZ tour will take you here in the afternoon, however I did not feel that we needed a tour guide as the man at the desk gave us a map and had a lot of knowledge about the museum. It is also free so I would advise going by yourself and not paying extra to go as part of a DMZ tour."
Great memorial - very touching,I've visited many memorials but this one is really well put together. It puts together a very thoughtful and respectful representation of not only the Korean War but the Korean peoples struggle for self determination. 
Impressive chronology of Korean conflicts,"Allocate 3-5 hours, lots to see. The museum covers conflicts from feudal times through the Korean War. Lots of exhibits inside and over 160 pieces outside. Most exhibits include English subtitles. Many are interactive. Lots of students and soldiers touring. Very well done."
"Nice on the outside, not so much on the inside.","Nice on the outside, not so much on the inside. I know its supposed to be like a museum and that it shouldnt exactly be ""nice"", which it should be educational rather. but in my opinion, i felt that the interior of this place is somewhat below what i was expecting and it could have been ""nicer"", perhaps i was taking into comparison with the other museums that i've been to. the information given here is also not align with what was shown at the DMZ 3rd Tunnel. but all in all, if you're into the history and especially of the korean peninsula, this place is not to be missed."
Must Go if into history,"If you are into any kind of history at all, this is a MUST visit. There are plenty of photo ops with planes, tanks, APC, gunners, etc. But besides all that, it has a great museum describing the ongoing conflict with North Korea. You can spend a couple of hours or easily a full day there. Definitely not to be missed."
Wonderfully done memorial museum,"Extremely thorough and well-done museum about the Korean War. I honestly did not know very much about it until I came to this museum where I got an excellent education and history about it. The grounds are beautiful and spacious, with some impressive statues. The war memorial is free to visit and is a great place to bookend some time in Itaewon. "
Know more about Korea history,"If you have extra time in Seoul , I recommend go there take a walk knowing more about history of Korea. The entry is free "
Superb Military History Museum of Korea,"If you are fascinated by war or military history, you will love this place. The museum is world class. It is modern, attractive, interactive in places, and full of artifacts showcasing thousands of years of Korean warfare, with a major emphasis on the 1950-53 war. There are two war memorials including the famous ""Statue of Brothers"" on the grounds and dozens of aircraft, tanks, artillery, missiles, and a full-size replica of a patrol boat sunk by North Korea in 2002. The APCs and patrol boat are open to visitors. Inside are more of the same plus exhibits depicting every major campaign in Korean history, weapons of all eras from Neolithic to the present, a large gallery on the Korean War, and a life-size replica of the famous armored ""turtle ship"" designed by Admiral Yi Sun-sin and used by the Joseon Dynasty, mostly in the 16th century. There is the Presidential Cadillac once used by Syngman Rhee as well as the Russian-made limousine used by Rhee's northern nemesis, Kim Il Sung and captured by the ROKs in 1950. As I have done with a hundred or so other museums I have visited, I have photographed nearly every exhibit and posted the photos on my GaryLeeTodd.com website for scholars, teachers, and others who may not have the opportunity to visit the museum in person."
History in a nutshell,Good way to spend few hours and learn about the Koren history and the reasons behind the Korean war. This Interactive museum is easily available by metro. Indoors displays and large outdoors display with old planes and ships and vehicles. 
Moving,"Have seen plenty of decommissioned US military equipment in the past. This one was no difference. Displays of various planes, tanks, weapons, etc. This museum is slightly different in a sense you can get up close and personal. A short walk from the nearest subway station. Another 15 minutes walk to the Itaweon area."
Amazing!,"A fantastic museum which features the Korean War but also presents Korea's history of conflicts with current status and efforts toward peace and unification. The displays include a Naval ship, the B-52 bomber and a C-130 cargo planes. Aside from those, there are dozens and dozens of other military vehicles and aircraft. A must see!"
Lots of older and newer jets/tanks/artillery,"No cost, worth half a day, go to the museum and get a free tour they'll take you through the Korean War. "
Impressive,"A must go if you want to know more about the war 1950-1953. In the museums garden you will find lots of planes, tanks and other war equipment. "
Worth a visit,"Have never really been to a lot of memorial parks before but found this one very inspirational. Not just a somber place, but an educational space with a lot of hands on exhibits. The day I was there saw a lot of Sth Korean school children there along with a number of US military personnel based in Seoul"
Impressive and interesting ,In this huge city of Seoul history does not seem to necessarily be a prevailing theme but this is the place to visit for a lesson in 20th century Korean history. This attraction is free. You can see many Korean War artifacts and displays. Beautiful monument with large sculptures visible from the street.
Interesting and educational,"I didn't imagine my kids will love the place since its just me and my husband who are history buffs. Aside from it is entertaining, it's educational and informative. Restrooms, lifts and cafes are available in area. Vending machines can be seen also if you got thirsty."
"Overwhelming, intense yet must see","We didn't expect to spend much time at this museum but it is huge.The ground floor exhibits were repetitive in information, so make your way quickly so you can spend time seeing the rest of the museum. The hollywood style storytelling with lighting and sound effects was entertaining and different."
Excellent and educational,"The visit to the museum was an excellent educational experience to learn Korea's history and see a most remarkable exhibition. We took the English speaking free tour offered by the museum. Our guide was Tai Yoo, a Stanford university student who now fulfils his military service. He gave us a most comprehensive review in a very objective way and deserves many thanks. The decision of the military to have him as a guide is absolutely fantastic considering his knowledge and fluency in English. I highly recommend a visit to the museum."
Not to miss,"If you are in Seoul, take your time to go to the memorial. I never experienced a memorial of any kind that has been built with so much effort and purpose. Fantastic and insightful. AND ITS FREE"
Not our interest!,It has high importance for its history and a great place to know about it.Sorry but we are not into history so couldn’t write much about it for us was a great photography option!
Fantastic museum,"Great museum that will guide you through the history of korea and explain you everything what you need to know about the war. The museum is huge and if you want to see everything, you need at least an entire day. Very interesting, free of charge and I would highly recommend this place. Free guided tours are also available in english at 10am and 2pm."
Time well spent,Opportunity to be close to a B52 and other planes from WWII. What's more a lot of the exhibits are on the outside grounds - so its free!
Amazing!,"If u are fan to war technologies like tanks or aircraft, u will love it. The entrance is for free. Lots of interesting stuff inside the museum like 4D cinema about North/South Korean war."
Great Sight,This is a great memorial to see and it is free to go visit. If you are into military history and military vehicles then you can't go wromg with this place. It is a good trip to go see if you have a couple of hours to spare. 
Large Museum-take your time,This is one of the largest museums in Korea. Take your time to enjoy all of the exhibits that are on display and learn about Korean history through war. There is a lower level that is designed for young children and a lovely little cafe on the second floor. 
Heartwrenching,"Make sure you have lots of time to go thru this memorial. It is so well done with film clips, explanations of the war and why it happened, who took part, how Korea got divided etc. The explanations are clear and concise in both the Korean and English languages. There are tanks, planes, and guns from the war on display of a memorial that spans 3 floors. A corridor with the manes of all the soldiers who died in the war is long and somber. This is a must see site to go to when in So. Korea ."
This is an absolute must see.,"The museum consists of thousands of weapons, ranging from small handguns to a B52, a frigate and many tanks. The Korean War is retold dramatically and there are many exhibits some of them stunning. There's a lot of educational information on the war before and after the war and there's a section on the reunification movement which given the situation with North Korea looks as likely as a dove flying backwards. Outside there are an amazing number of military memorabilia that look well preserved. I spent 3 hours and managed 75% of the contents. There's a free book detailing every single day of the conflict which last over 3 years. I would say that is the best War Museum I've visited in both size and contents and is suitable for all ages."
Great War Memorial Park,"Lots of planes, tanks, boats that was being used during the war at the memorial. Free to enter. Could easily spent 1 to 2 hours spent your time there."
Very interesting! ,"Didn't have enough time in this monument as it's quite a big one. Would recommend around 2 hours. Was really interesting to see some of these monuments, I wish there were some more explanations and details. "
Touching,"I love the idea of the Koreans knowing that someday they will be reunited as transcribed in the sculpture. A lot of planes, tanks used during the Korean War are displayed. I did not enter the museum as it was closed already but the display outside is good enough for me. There is also a boat there you can get there and have your picture taken."
Educational,Excellent way to learn about the Korean War before the DMZ tour. It is accessible by subway although you do have to walk a bit.
Impressive,"The war memorial is quite large and extensive, with an impressive amount of displays and information! It is well maintained, and it's obvious that a lot of time and effort has been put into it. I'll definitely be going back, as we didn't get the chance to do it all in one visit. Free guided english tour offered every day at 2PM. The tour quickly walks you through the Korean War and the guide seemed really excited about the topic, which is always nice. Lasted about an hour, but there was so much info we felt like we were speeding through it!"
The Korean War Brought To Light ,"Great exhibit if you want to know more about the Korean War. My dad served in the Korean War and spoke of the tragedy and human cost. Outside of the memorial is a very moving statue of two brothers in an embrace, one from the North and one from the South. The museum provided a great background into what happened, why and the powers at play at the beginning of the Cold War. Definitely worth seeing! "
Memories,The war memorial opened in 1994 on the former site of the army headquarters to exhibit and memorialize the military history of Korea. 
A memory to those who fought for Sth Korea,"Wow, the displays are superb and the role of honour is a wonderful memorial. A place of quiet reflection."
The Story of the Brothers is Incredible,"There is so much history here to learn, free admission, and so many exhibits. Was great to visit when the weather was clear to see the outside exhibits."
A must visit,"When in Seoul, do take time to visit the memorial and the museum. The Korean War rooms are all excellent and quite balanced. Very different from the Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum in Pyongyang. You can spend hours here."
Great insight into the history of the war and the country itself,"Do yourself a favor and spend half a day here. For history buffs the place is outstanding, but it is interesting to anyone and your trip to Seoul would not be complete without a trip here."
Summarizing the war history of Korea,"I always likes historical thingy when travel. This is a place that i could spend a whole day in. Understand the war history of Korea, and take a close look of the weapons on exhibit. Tanks and planes is not to be miss."
Good,An enormous building with little inside. All the exhibits were in english. The statues were the best things there. Seemd to be a lot of wasted space.
Definitely a MUST see when visiting South Korea,I was not too keen on visiting a war memorial but what an experience. The huge statues were the first things to blow us away! Then there was the 4-D mini cinemas which brought the war which caused so much suffering to the people of SK. The huge murals and audio screens around every corner and on the way out the life-size war planes. The whole place had an air of solemnly about it and you left it knowing much more about the history of the country than when you entered. Should definitely be high on the list when visiting.
Somber yet interesting,"Lots of interesting history items and exhibits featured inside to see. Outside without entrance are lots of planes, tanks, guns to view and touch."
Essential Visit,"Historically insightful, beautiful and moving displays. Viewing the rolls of the Allied/U.N. Army dead is an experience in and of itself."
Beautiful Bronzes,The two Bronzes opposite each other at the entrance to the Korean War museum set the stage for your visit. Bigger than life and finely textured i lost myself in both the marvel of the art and the resultant depiction. Absorb the statues and then continue to the museum. 
Korea War Museum,"Happened upon this place while wandering Seoul, and am very glad I did Educational, interesting and very moving at times, it's a stunning reminder of the horrors of war and what a country must do to recover from it. If you have time, definitely check it out."
Well worth a visit,A great place to visit for half a day. Loved the planes and you get a good view of the Seoul tower in the distance.
Travel back to Korean wars,"A great place to understand Korean War history. It spans across many centuries. For someone wanting to see it all, keep a day just for this museum."
The surprise of the trip,"Given Korea's history, we felt this was a must visit. What we were not prepared for was the sheer scale and quality of the museum. The extensive collection of tanks, aircraft and weaponry in the grounds was a real surprise. The interior exhibitions combined traditional displays with multi media, including archive footage and interviews, bringing to life the impact of the various conflicts. Far from being a flag waving exercise, the various exhibitions pay tribute to the many allied forces that supported the Korean forces. Don't miss this one from the itinerary."
Well worth the trip to learn & appreciate the evils of war between and within the country,"After doing a bit of tourist shopping, our group tour continued on the bus & we arrived here with less crowd - excellent timing - we could've have easily spend more than half a day here exploring and going thru most of the exhibits. Unlike other historical places all over SK, have language aid is definitely a plus - a grand uncle served here with the US Army and it was moving to come here for a closer understanding, directly - as his was oral history and just a few B&W photos from those days. The scope & coverage make the U.S. memorials (like that of the Vietnam vet's) to shame in that it's more than finding & touching the names of some of those that served & gave their lives to defend freedom. There were local school age children coming thru with the teacher serving as the guide, some of them pre-schoolers and too young to appreciate - however. It's a sober reminder SK remains on war-like alert and lately, tension remained high with NK - as we came back from the East Sea & coastal towns & villages, the military is on alert with tanks rolling, conducting routine drills - somewhat troubled as we directly seen fully armed soliders with their finger on the weapon's trigger - NOT a best practice, even if the safety is ON & the ammo magazine isn't loaded with live rounds (see one of the photo we took)Back to the musuem, for those coming to Seoul - a visit to this place, time permitting, is highly recommended - as Beatles' JL song sang, ""Give Peace a Chance"""
A top attraction in Seoul,"Very well laid out and taught us and our two boys all about how the split Korea came to be. It's easily accessible on the underground. Have a break in the cafes which are outside the main building, because you will spend several hours there "
A History Lesson - A Very Interesting One,Such an intriguing and wonderful attraction. So much to see with copious amounts of history to witness and learn.A must visit when visiting Seoul.
Learn about the Korean war,"This is a great attraction if you want to learn more about the history of the Korean war. That exhibit is excellent, and really highlighting the UN involvement, and the contributions from the international community. There are other parts of the memorial that are more nationalistic, glorifying the Korean military, which you can skip. "
Best of Seoul attractions,"This definitely is the best of the attractions to see in Seoul by a far distance. It is obvious that they are putting in a lot of money in the place because of the importance. Spanking clean exhibits, well maintained yet totally free!Even if you are not a museum buff, don't miss this when you go to Seoul...totally worth it"
truely an impressive collection and well kept.,very well maintained memorial and has a hoard of planes a big yes for a visit.i was all eyes for the entire time of the visit.plan your visiting routs properly as there are different halls from different era.u can touch and feel the planes.
Impressive and thought-provoking,"I was pleasantly surprised at the scale and scope of the information provided at the War Memorial. The building itself is lovely, but the exhibits are well worth the visit. It's an excellent introduction to the Korean War, and a must-see before visiting the DMZ or JSA.Don't overlook the videos that are located throughout the exhibit. They provide subtitles in English. If they aren't on screen, then wait until the video ends, and hit the ""English"" button at the front."
Very good place,Went on a monday so just the outdoor museum part with all the big toys where open...but amazing place...and all free...spend a few houres and walk around in history...recomended
Wonderful,very good Museum not only for Korean War history but also touches on other historical events in Korea. Unique artifacts can be found here as well.
Must Visit in Seoul,"You owe it to yourself to this awe inspiring memorial. I have visited several times, and each time I notice something new. "
"Wonderful afternoon and free!!,",Perfect place to spend 3 hours. The exhibits and films are great and the displays all in English and easy to follow. Outside the equipment will entertain anyone even slightly interested in war instruments. The museum is tasteful and gives a great perspective on a difficult war.
Excellent History of the Korean War,"We visited the museum as part of a Korean War Veterans tour. We toured the museum with a HS aged young man who was very knowledgeable and spoke perfect English. He was an American Civil War history buff too which really surprised me. Anyway we spent several hours inside the museum and many of our group did not realize that there was a large collection of aircraft, tanks, etc. outside the museum building. So take some time to go outside. They have a good collection of airplanes including a B-52. This is a very interesting museum and War Memorial. "
Wonderful!!,What a great place. It's not that informative. Because there are no signs explaining what you see. But it's free and a lot to see. Also what I didn't saw before is that you can enter a lot 'attentions'Really nice place to spend an hour or 2. 
Free and Fun!,This attraction is well located near Noksapyeong and Samgachi stations and is free. An easy way to spend an afternoon!
An all day affair that is cost efficient,"You can spend all day at this museum depending on the pace you go through. It is very informative and best of all FREE! During the summer, if you can try to schedule your visit with the honor guard ceremony, which is interesting to watch. Visited the museum numerous times and is great to walk the grounds during fall and spring."
Beautiful!,This museum is a wonderful way to spend an afternoon. It was very neat to see all the old war planes and artillary. It was very moving. 
Best for history lovers,"This museum was amazing. Although the layout is a bit confusing at first, once you get used to how things work, you will thoroughly enjoy this museum. There is loads of information on the Korean war, not only about South Korea's part in the war but also that of the United Nations and other western nations. It takes you through details of the war from start to finish, and even has information on earlier wars in Korean history. I loved the original archives of important WWII documents as well, such as the Yalta agreement and the Potsdam declaration. We did not get to stay for too long, but this museum is truly worth visiting."
If you like Korean history,"A very informative visit to refresh the North and South Korean War. Lots of things to see, there are videos, exhibits and bilingual guides to explain what you don't quite remember. If you are near, go for it."
Brief war history,"I liked the museum as it has enough information about wars and army people were dressing like. What I liked the most was the animated 3-D looking stories, where you press a button and put your eyes near so you can watch(both English and Korean). I also liked the small wide screen rooms for short films. On the other hand, air conditioning was so bad. I would have stayed for a longer time if the museum's weather was good."
Definitely worth going!,"We came here when they had the Avengers Exhibit which cost 25,000 won but it was well worth it. Unfortunately, the exhibit only contained Korean but it was still super fun. The technology was amazing and we felt like we were a part of the Avengers world.The War Memorial museum is free and it was really well put together. We learned a lot and being total museum lovers, we were surprised at how well put together it was. There were free 3D shows and interactive components. Well worth a visit!"
Great history lesson with a English speaking guide,Great tour we went with a guide as you get more information and history with a English speaking guide and go through the week not as many tourists . We saw the newzeland names of the men that fought in the war and discussed the flag changing in NZ at the moment . 
Good history of Korean War,"Three large rooms describe the Korean War (north/south). Lots to see, with interactive displays and 4D video presentations. At times too many document displayed. There is some propaganda going on here, but a good primer on the war. Lots of emphasis on U.S. involvement, but less on UN involvement (this is mostly on second floor in 3rd room that does not get a lot of visitors.)"
You have to visit,"A must visit if you are in Korea. A lot of great statues, moments and artifacts all throughout the premises. So much history to be seen and it's available in english as well."
"Interested with War, History about Korea? Must visit!",Such a small country with lot of painful war history. great place to visit if you are history buff! Very informative place!
Extensive and interesting display,"Great location and quite solemn in areas. Lots to look at inside ranging from the old fighting ships to modern conflicts. The Korean War historical components were quite moving. The outside static displays were impressive (tanks, rockets, aircraft and a ship). The monuments/statures in the forecourt are certainly worth taking time to look at closely as they are quite moving. I found a lot of people just had a quick look and didn't really take them in."
Very detailed account of the Korean war,"The war memorial of Korea is a good way to spend a few hours of your time in Seoul. The campus is quite large and there are many interesting exhibits outside and inside. Entry to the museum is free. There are 3 floors of exhibits and even though the first floor was closed for renovation when we visited, we still spent over two hours inside reading and watching the movies. The outside static displays of airplanes and tanks is very interesting as well although at the end of the day it seemed more like a playground for children instead of a part of a memorial. It didn't ruin the experience for us but for some who prefer a quiet, more reflective experience could be bothered. I would recommend this museum if you are at all interested in military history or just want a free activity to enjoy for a day."
Amazing eye opener ,"Due to a very busy itinerary only visited this place for a few hours, however could have easily spent a whole day here.This museum is free to enter and offers a fantastic eye opening insight into the Korean war.Static displays, photos, memorabilia along with film shows and 4D film shows along with a vast display of military equipment outside.Incredible place!"
Gives you context on the Korean War,"If you want to understand the context of the Korean War...which is foundational to understanding the North vs. South tensions...then you must visit this museum. While presentations are not state of the art, i.e., many are in the ""glass case"" approach to presentation, there are some videos which give you an overall context to the war. Now, I'm focused on this war for obvious, current affairs reasons. However, this Museum covers their overall history of warfare.I would allow 2 hours if you are able to focus and not get side tracked. "
Something for everyone ,It's a very interesting place to visit with lots of good information in a number of languages. They did a really great job making the museum interactive. They also have lots of cool planes and stuff that all the kids seemed to real enjoy. It's also free which is great if you are on a buget. 
A most seeing!,"It's interesting looking so closely at different weapons and equipment used in any war, depending on the place and time. In this case you can do it with the famous Korea War. Besides is a good way of getting to know many facts you wouldn't know otherwise. "
"A poignant, detailed, sad but ultimately enjoyable memorial and museum.","Let's make it clear: this is far more than a big statue of some soldiers. There's a huge museum behind them on three levels, with huge collections of wartime military hardware on the outside, plus rows of plaques dedicated to the names of soldiers who took part in and gave their lives in the name of a unified Korea.It's a struggle to really get this museum covered in a couple of hours. If you have the stamina, set aside about 4-5 hours for it including a break in the middle at the cafe. If not, come back another day if you have time. It's free! However, if you're stuck for time have a look at the map and see what you'd prefer to do.I personally enjoyed checking out the military hardware first. It's very impressive, and inside of the boat there's an inspiring if slightly overly-biased video about a recent naval skirmish between North and South Korea.Inside, I very much enjoyed a walking tour of the war, which covered the major events in great detail with touch-screens about all the battles available too. It features mannequins of soldiers and other personnel involved in the conflict and a few videos, including a very touching story told by an actual South Korean veteran about his feelings on the eve of what they thought would be a day of reunification, but in fact was the day that the Chinese joined the conflict and pushed the ROK + UN Forces back down south.There's also a very interesting section on the different countries which made up the UN forces which is well worth a look. Plenty of countries took part in various roles, many of them surprising. It's really interesting.Particularly impressive are the number of life-sized recreations of various scenes from the war.As others have noted, it's quite biased against the North and very anti-communist - but you have to remember that this is a country still at war, struggling with the reality that for many of them, there's a strong sense of kinship with their apparent enemies to the North, and for some there's family up there who may or may not still be alive. To try to understand the complex emotions which come with this unique situation must be very difficult for a foreigner to do, and I think it's quite understandable that there's going to be some bias. Despite this, it's really really visiting this memorial and museum. You won't regret it."
emotional,"very emotional experience, the videos on the 2nd floor really drive home how horrible the war was, one of the most memorable experiences in Seoul"
A must when in Seoul,"A very interesting museum, well organised with good equipment. Indoor as well outdoors.If u think u know it all about the korean war. for sure u will discover something you didn't know!"
Incredibe,"Incredibly beautiful and poignant memorial. Grand building, spectacular grounds, with amazingly informative and interesting displays. "
Good place to learn korean war,This place is so big than i expectedI could see many information about korean war it was so informative to me 
Very interactive...,"An interesting place to walk around and learn a bit of history. The displays are quite impressive and interactive, the collection of vehicles of war (planes, tanks etc.) is extensive. Free to visit, just make a donation when you leave :)"
Fears of war,"It was great time. Even though I thought that I knew much about Korean war, there are so many things that I didn't know.... I could feel our war heroes' fears and sadly scream. It was really significant moment that i could understand more about Korean war."
Well worth a visit even if you don't think yourself to be a war- or history buff.,A very interesting museum with lots of 3D and even 4D features. Tells the story of the horrible Korean war in a moving and compelling way. Being run by the Korean government it is of course very patriotic and tells the story only from one side.
"Worth a Visit, Nice Area","There isn't much to say, other than the fact that the memorial was VERY moving and the use of space (indoor and outdoor) was impressive. From an exhibition standpoint, I enjoyed the place. Seeing the planes outside on the front half of the property was pretty cool.If you are a fan of architecture, check it out."
Good place ,The tour and guides were very helpful making us understand the nuances of why the war took place and what has been the situation from 1951 until today 
Must see,"This memorial was very nice to visit. From the wonderful statues to the multitude of surplus military vehicles and weapons you can interact with outside on their large grounds. Inside offered numerous tributes to those who lost their lives including movies, reenactments as well as many visual displays. Very well thought out and convenient to navigate. It is also free of charge which is amazing as they must spend a lot of money on the upkeep and maintenance. Whether your a military buff or just want to spend 3-4 hours learning more about history, I highly recommend going there. "
Nationalism and the Korean War,"To get here, get off at Samgakji, and take exit #12 (there are signs). Walk straight when you get to the street and the museum will be on your left. This museum is very large. It, as it typical of every country that has a museum of this type, presents a nationalistic interpretation of the Korean War focusing on the heroism or the South Korea fighters, as well as the international troops (there is an entire wing devoted to the UN participant countries). It has many maps and interactive touch screen displays that provide lots of useful information. You will learn about the entire history of the war, including politics and battles. There are also lots of materials donated from soldiers so you get to see what items many people had with them during the fighting.There is also an extensive number of displays and monuments outside, including a variety of military vehicles, planes, and boats used in the war.If you actually want to see everything outside, and see every exhibit inside (thoroughly, as in reading most everything, not just walking through quickly), then you probably need more than 3 hours. Otherwise, you should probably plan for 90 minutes or 2 hours."
Worth the side trip,"Really moving! It was quite deserted when we were there, though. I thought that the memorial was quite moving. It was also interesting to learn more about the history of Korea and its other wars"
This is a sad history of my county,"I have often visited here with my son since him baby. This shows from old korean histories to current memorable events. We korea is the only country where it saparates from the north and the south. It means the sad story is still. If you have a child, you need to be here. I believe future generations can meet the great united nation someday when they understand where we were past and are now."
War Memorial emphasizing peace,"Visit if you want to learn about the Korean War and the ongoing conflict. No entrance fees, no crowds."
A must see,"Excellent memorial. If you happen to be staying at the Dragon Hill Lodge, then the War Memorial of Korea is a must see. Only a 10 minute walk from the hotel, the memorial is easy to find. Very impressive displays both outside and in. All free.South Korea had done it's share for the UN."
Stunning Memorial,"The War Memorial of Korea. This was one of my favourite attractions that I visited in Seoul. It tells of a very comprehensive history of Korea, starting from the historical times. As a history buff, there were very detailed explanations of the ancient korean dynasties, large scale models of weapons used in the past, such as a huge turtle ship. Then, moving on to the other galleries, it showcased the more recent past of korea including the Korean War. There were also several 4D attractions that I visited within the memorial, very very impressive. Apart from the Korean War, the galleries also showcased the recent acts of Aggression between the two Koreas. The side wing also had a huge display of military vehicles and outside the Memorial, there was a huge field where even more military assets were displayed, even Missiles. "
propaganda museum - the war is still on,The museum is mostly about the latest war between North and South Korea - It is propaganda style information and it is difficult/impossible to get the North angle of things - outside the museum is a huge amount of war machines - even a patrol boat with hundreds of bullet holes 
A Museum for Korea's Entire Wartime History,"The exhibits here at the War Museum of Korea are a sobering reminder of this place's long—and ongoing—history of conflict. You'll see an impressive collection of military equipment (including a huge yard of various vehicles, outside). It's the kind of place you can wander through on your own, unguided, finding your own way through the rich assortment of historical artifacts.The Seoul Tour Buses include this as a regular stop, so getting here and back couldn't be easier (like pretty much everything in Seoul).Highly Recommended"
Don't miss it!,Definitely worth a visit. One of the best museums I've been to and it's free. The 4-D movies are fun.
Impressive Collection,"It's not so much what's inside the museum, but what's outside that counts. There are actual planes, tanks, jeeps, ships and other amoured vehicles from the Korean war, some of which you're allowed to go inside.The museum is great too and it's all free, so well worth a visit."
A Beautiful Memorial,"It's a beautifuly laid out museum, the sculptures are thought provoking. The old planes and tanks outside was my highligt of the visit. It was nice to spend a quiet couple of hours here."
War Memorial of Korea,"If you want to find out about how this conflict took place, this is a great place to spend time at. I was familiar with the war but not the detail the memorial displayed. One of the most impressive placesI have been to."
Interesting and well presented museum,I was really interested in visiting here as my knowledge of the Korean war was really limited however I found it to be a really educational and I learnt so much from the well presented exhibits.
Fascinating Museum-History of Korean War & Appreciation for Foreign Sacrifices,"Finally visited this Memorial and Museum on my third visit to Seoul. I wanted to make sure I allowed enough time to completely do it justice as I know it is a very large complex and other visitors have said they spent the better part of two days here.The hours of the memorial are 9a-6p Tues-Sunday (Closed Monday and Holidays). Admission is free. No free wifi unless you have an Olleh service plan/account. Cafe on site and gift shop. Nice bathrooms and water fountains. Free lockers so you can stash your bag/backpack and easily accessible for wheel chair or strollers.When we arrived just before 10am we took a docent guided tour with Mr. Jun (a volunteer from Seoul City Hall). The tour lasted approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes and he took us through the galleries pointing out the highlights and most important points of the Korean War. He is very intelligent and speaks English very well. The information he provided was concise and interesting. It was a good introduction. If you don't have hours to spend here, I recommend taking a docent-led tour to give you the highlights of the memorial and gallery exhibits. Otherwise, you'll get too far into the weeds and run out of time before you get out of the first gallery.After the tour we went back through the galleries taking our time to read the captions and look at the artifacts and maps. As this war occurred before my time and doesn't receive the emphasis in history classes in the US, there is a lot we didn't know about the origins and details of the war. The exhibits really filled in a lot of gaps and cleared up a lot of confusion. Of course, I understand this is the South Korean view of the war so I know there's just a little bit of propaganda!The highlights are the multiple films you can watch. There are a total of 4 films. Two are 4-D (where you wear 3-D glasses and there are special effects like movement or snow), one is 3-D, and one is a regular cinema film (only in Korean without English subtitles, but watching the film you can easily understand what's going on). Very good.Outside you'll find a variety of military airplanes including a B-52, tanks, and artillery. There's also a reproduction of the ""Cheonan"" which was attacked and sunk by North Korea in 2010. The film here shows the attack and there's a Heroes Gallery memorializing the six sailors who died.All in all this is a wonderful museum. We found it a perfect complement to a DMZ/JSA tour to really make everything clear and more understandable.There are plans to expand the memorial's grounds upon acquisition of land currently occupied by the US military (they plan to move out in the coming years). Will make the current ""park"" even more appealing.Easily reached by Subway lines 4 or 1 or via bus. About a 45 minute walk south of the Millennium Hilton/Seoul Station and not far from Itaewon."
Stunningly laid-out explanation of the 1953 Korean War. A Must See!,"Outside this unmissable cathedral-like building are two very striking statue sequences, almost Comminist or Socialist Realism in their heroic, exhortative poses. Then there are the various tanks, armoured fighting vehicles, aircraft and marine craft involved in the conflict on the peninsula since 1950. They are well laid-out with good explanatory boards for each external exhibit. The huge B52 dominates all of these and sets the context.Inside, the exhibition is laid out chronologically over three floors, each with two wings. It is vast inside. Each stage of the conflict is depicted using film, sound, static displays and son-et-lumiere, all to great educational and learning effect. There are displays of social and 2-d art, and curiously, in the main foyer, an armoured junk which if used during the Korean War then someone was in real trouble.There is also on the entry to the main ramp, a Hall of remembrance with large marble slabs depicting the names of The Fallen from Korea, in Hangul.This superb museum is an exhibition par excellence, and a visitor would find it rewarding and informative even if they were not interested in warfare. An absolute must see/must do."
very interesting,"good museum, very informative…perhaps a bit confusing but one of the highlights of the city. Enjoyed the interactive parts, you really need a good few hours here though!"
nice place to visit if you get bored of shopping,"interesting place to visit, especially war equipment, bunch our war airplanes, rocket launchers, boats, tanks a transportation vehicles"
Well worth the time,"This was a terrific museum with both indoor and outdoor exhibits. There is a wealth of historical information, large scale replicas and original items. You will want to reserve plenty of time or return for a second visit. We saw several US war veterans as well who served during the Korean War. "
Memorial of Korea,Its only on the main road. easy to find. must come to take picture if you're firstimer in korea.. :)
Excellent displays for all ages,"Allow plenty of time to visit all the exhibitions - even just a quick view will take an hour or two. Very informative displays with English signage, great photos, videos, uniforms and weapons throughout the ages, real helicopters, tanks, planes and replica ship outside that invites children to explore."
Worth the effort to get there!,"We visited on a rainy afternoon. Museum has exhibits on several conflicts, with a main focus on the Korea War. Museum had more interactive attractions and videos than most history museums. For example you can participate in a simulated shooting competition. There are also numerous models throughout the museum that bring the conflicts to life. "
Terrific outdoor display,"Terrific outdoor exhibit of missiles, aircraft and boats. Even a B52. It takes at least an hour to walk through."
A very peaceful and nice place,"I visited this place with my friends and thought it to be like a museum, but apart from it they have shown a tribute to martyrs from over the world who sacrificed their lives in Korean war.The story of all the Korean wars is depicted there. Some in films, models, the artillery and tanks and planes and so on.Outside is a very large place to sit and the peace you enjoy there cannotcannot be described in words. A very nice place indeed"
A must-see (and free) attraction in Seoul,"A great place to visit in Seoul and 100% free!! It is great for a half day or even a whole if you'd like to work your way slowly through.The outside of the memorial showcases the vehicles, air crafts and water crafts used during the war. Inside, there are amazing displays taking you through the war and really piecing together the events from both sides.Entrance is free, there are free guided tours in Korean, Japanese and English and we even got a free book outlining each day of the war.We'd highly recommend the tour. It is about 45min to 1 hour long but the knowledge and information provided was invaluable and the guide was open to questions throughout. It was perhaps the most informative time in a war memorial or museum we've had. There are a number of exhibitions left to explore after the tour and we chose which ones we wanted to spend more time on. There is also an area where you can ""shoot"" weapons in a simulation-style room. It is only open during specific times so we did not get a chance to try it out.Definitely a must-see when in Seoul if you have the time. The Korean war plays such a fundamental part of current politics and events and the memorial sheds some light and further information on the ongoing conflict."
Very interesting War Museum ,The War Memorial is a really interesting place to visit for those interested in the Korea war history. There interesting videos and lot of military hardwares. This museum is huge and i spend more than3 hours which includes outdoor display. Easily accesable by public transport...bus not 421 from gangnam
Free and a good way to kill an hour or 2,Very good considering that it is free admission. It's educational and it has some really cool exhibits that visually show you what the war was like.
"Interesting stories, good exhibitions","A must place to visit, free entry, but do donate some money to keep the place running in top shape. Best war museum I ever visited."
Highly recommended for all visitors to Seoul.,"This is a mammoth space. Plan to spend at least a couple of hours. Lots of aircraft, tanks, and other military hardware on display. Gardens, statues, massive lawns, etc. There is a good children's feature, too. "
Outside displays were great,Nice Memorial and well kept and clean -- We went twice to visit and was impressed with memorial -- When we visited we thought they would have more on North Korea/South Korea war however nice memorial showing all South Korea's wars
War memorial of korea,"This place is a very interesting place... you see alot of military aircraft and its free... many american and russian planes, helicopters... A very nice insight into the history of Republic of South korea.You will have fun if you have a couple of hours spare"
Very much essential introduction to Korea's military history,"The War Memorial is a really essential place to visit for those interested in the history of Korea and how it came to be divided into the two (North and South) Koreas which we know now. One cannot technically blame the South Koreans for depicting North Koreans and Chinese soldiers as the ""evil communists"", namely due to the effect of media propaganda in the 1960's and 1970's, which suffered from the communist scare, and that also filters off into the exhibitions which also dealt with the North Korean army as well. "
Really is a good place to learn the history of the korean war,Interesting place to be especially for a person who likes history. Knowledgeable for those who likes to know the past history of the Korean war.
Awesome vehicle,"Its free, and really worthed to go in there. So many vehicle , and history you can find out about seoul. Have a war vehicles , and its really cool. "
"Very Educational - But an ""Extra"" Site","My boyfriend and I stopped at the War Memorial at one of the stops on the Seoul City Bus Tour. Although it was highly informative and interesting... but because of the limited time we were staying in Korea (1 week), I would have skipped this part. The museum is fairly big and filled with lots of educational material - which I think is great for kids (There were many families there). But if you don't have much time, I would skip it."
Great museum about Korean War,One of the best war museums in the world. Really worth a visit each time I visit Seoul. Has changed a lot over the years. 
Highly informative multimedia loaded exhibit,"Very interactive museum with lots of multimedia displays to keep attention high. Some items only in Korean, but it's possible to get a thorough understanding of events knowing only English."
Any history buff must visit here when in Seoul,"Neat weapons on display outside. Provides an understanding of the event which most strongly shaped modern Korean history, though somewhat full of nationalist propaganda. A guided tour will give you a more complete perspective."
Best war museum I've been to,"Wow, you could spend hours OUTSIDE the museum (which is free) before you even enter the monumental building.The exhibits are balanced and well-currated with clear English explanations. As someone whose grandfather came to Korea to fight, I found the museum even more impressive. You may find it hard to follow some of the exhibits and battles if you're not too familiar with the context, but I think the museum does a good job in teaching and explaining things on a level most can understand.May be better to go alone so you can take as much (or as little) time as you need/want."
Repectful and impressive,"Set in a lovely park this is a feast for lovers of statues and aeroplanes. Don't miss the beautiful mosaic inside the building with 2 embracing brothers on top of it - it closed at 4.30. We didn't go inside the museum, but found the park respectful and impressive. And free"
Stopped in for a brief visit ,"Didn't spend a lot of time at the memorial, but did get to look at all the statues. Would love to visit again. "
A great place to learn about the conflicts that shaped Korea,"If you're new to the historical context of the Korean War, you'll find the War Memorial avery interesting and useful primer. If you already know the basics it is still a fun day out, and there exhibitions on other historical conflicts besides the big one. Very kid-friendly with interactive exhibits."
"The reason for my visit to Seoul, and it did not disappoint.","Spent entire day at this amazing place. Has incredible static display of tanks, aircraft and even a gunboat. I went on the free English language tour, and then stayed for lunch at the cafeteria, and wandered around. The displays are complete, and are geared for schoolchildren, but detailed enough for adults. The appreciation for the United Nations forces is manifest in memorials and displays. There are several short videos, and all in English or subtitles. I really learned a lot, and left less cynical than before. "
So much history...,"It was more than just a museum. The consequences of the war in the Korean Peninsula are still evident in the present days with the North and South divide. Our experience was informative and educational. It is a ""must-see"" place when visiting Seoul."
So much more than a mere memorial,"It's no secret that a proxy albeit very costly war was fought across both halves of the Korean peninsula in the 1950s. It's also needs no big stretch of the imagination that the truce could be irreversibly broken again at any time due to the diametrically opposed political beliefs of the North and South Korean governments. With this as the background, this rather grandiose building, at least at first glance, might appear to serve as a temple to the glories or war. True, there are many exhibits that come across as unreservedly nationalistic and play on the we're-the-goodies and they're-the-baddies mentality. But delve beneath the surface of the exhibits and there are many instances where the suffering of the Korean people is a central theme of a deeper desire for reunification. There's a lot to keep the visitor occupied and for military enthusiasts, it's best to keep at least a half-day free. In fact, the memorial portion of the building is actually quite small compared to the Korean War displays (with plenty of mention of United Nations, especially American, contributions) that take up a couple of floors in one wing. Other interesting sections include one on the local armed forces, more recent skirmishes between the two Koreas, as well as one on warfare during the Joseon period (circa. late-14th to late-19th centuries). Displays range from old sailing vessels to cannons to military hardware. Indeed, military hardware from the 20th century takes up an enormous external park-like space adjacent to the memorial building and could easily require over an hour to do it proper justice. The easiest subway station is Samgakji, serviced by lines 4 and 6, from where it's an easy 5-minute walk to the entrance gates of the Memorial."
A mjst if you are in Korea.,"A must if you are in Seoul. This place is beautiful and informative. If I am in the area, I always stop by to pay my respects. "
Memorable,beautifully sculptured and nicely presented. It is an important part of the Korean culture and nice to visit and see the American contribution revered.
Worth visiting even just outside,I have heard great things of the museum and we found it worthwhile even just to visit the grounds as there is much to see without even going in. Next time I would plan a visit in the museum as well! 
Worthwhile,If you're a history nut or not this is really a informative place. Bury yourself in some of Korea's most grandasious wars.
Worthy memory!,"For those who like the machinery of the wars, this is a place worth visiting! Too bad we had a short time to visit entirely (a museum inside) and one can climb up a ship there! "
Interesting war fact.,"Memorial was very nice and big, outside / inside museum was interesting with all th war artifact, fun for kids and family. "
Worth a visit,This is a really elaborate museum and very well done. There's so much to see and you will be here for hours. Americans visitors will probably appreciate it most after Koreans. The reason I mention Americans is because they are also heavily memorialised here too and you can't help but admire the apparent bond between the two nations. I would recommend a visit if you have an interest in the history of war in Korea. 
Too american,In that area you notice very well the American presence in South Korea. It is full of American soldiers and you do not feel so much the Korean environment. It is the area of Seoul I liked the less.
Lots to see,"Large place with a lot of history to view. Given Korea's history, a very worthwhile place to visit. A multitude of elements from the Korea war are available to view. "
Great museum,We got there just in time and joined the English speaking tour. Our guide was very informative and it lasted about an hour. After that we explored the museum. We were probably there for about 4 hours.
Got to be the best war museum anywhere,"Got to be the best organised and best equipped war museum anywhere. Tells the story of the war that's almost forgotten everywhere apart from Korea. Well worth the 3-4 hours it will take to see the chronological exhibits and the dozens of actual tanks, planes and even a ship outside"
Wonderful Memorial,"For any history buff, I highly suggest the War Memorial. The Memorial focuses not only on the Korean War, but all conflicts Korea has experienced. It was fairly uncrowded and free for visitors, so you won't want to miss this experience. "
Best Museum!,This was by far the best museum we went to while on our trip. It was very impressive. It is good for all ages as it had lots of hand on displays and information. It was very informative and lots of English translations. Don't miss this on your trip.
Well worth it!,Very interesting museum .. Well laid out and keeps you interested from room to room giving you good insight and understanding of the Korean War ..
"Well done, well organized.",Had a great time here and learned a LOT about the history of warfare on the Korean Peninsula. Inside exhibits well done and the flow through the museum takes you chronologically from floor to floor and room to room. Well marked and easy to follow instructions.
Wonderful.,"My grandfather is a Korean War veteran. This museum offers a fantastic learning experience and my grandpa loved looking at the photos I took for him. You can see how devastating of an experience this was for Koreans and their allies. If you go to only one museum while you're in Seoul, make it The War Memorial of Korea."
First trip home as an adopted.,A memorial every Korean should visit.And of course everyone else who respect human life.To show the respect to all the lost ones.And never forget what we could do with this wonderful planet together.......Butiful but yet so sad.I never regret I was there.Peace to the Korean people.All the best K. Hummelnest 
Needs to be on everyone's to see list,"I love my history, especially wars, so I make an effort to visit war memorials when travelling.I have read a lot about the Korean war and seen many films about it before coming here. Let's just say I still learnt much from this memorial, and then some.As I arrived I saw just how long I'd be here. Outside the museum itself is a huge exhibit featuring statues, tanks, memorials and airplanes. I spent quite some time walking around here before even venturing inside.When entering I advise getting one of the maps and following the suggested path. It takes you through some beautiful memorials before introducing you to the wars throughout Korean history. There are many informative displays and some excellent recreations.As you head up there are two floors dedicated to the Korean War, from the beginnings all through to the end and the present. It's done very well, and it was hard not to be moved by all on display. It also shows just how devastating this war was, it always seems to be shadowed by other wars which I find saddening.I would suggest everyone visiting Korea adds this memorial to their list, it's an important part of Korean history, and the fact the war is not over makes it even more relevant."
The number 1 attraction.,A wonderful day out. This is one of the best exhibits we have seen for a long time. Outside all the exhibits are in very good condition and it will take an hour or just to see them. Inside the museum the layout is very impressive and there are many short videos on the history of the Korean war. The place is spotless and there a few places inside where you can get something to eat.Definitely worth a visit 
Great for Warfare lovers,"Out of all the museums I have been to in my lifetime this has to be my favourite, it kinda has everything you need to know about all the War struggles South Korea/Korea has had to struggle with from ancient times up to modern times, it goes especially nicely into details about how the Korean War happened and even displayed a lot of stuff for the nations that helped South Korea in the war, would recommend any-time."
Positive comment,There's a lot to see. Good place to spend time at. And i would say its definitely suitable for solo traveler.
Very different & good,"Very good museum, worth watching if u r in korea. It is very big in size. Outside planes, tanks models are very nice."
must see,"Last day we visited , planing 3-4 hours for it . At least it's taken 6 . So , you can imagine how interresting it is. Lot of 3D cinema-rooms , very well prepaired items , charts etcr ... Perfect . Go there , spend time enought . I've seen only one similar in Saigon/Vietnam . "
Fantastic and Huge!,"The War Memorial was just fantastic! When we went admission was free and they were giving away free books too. The exhibits are very well kept, informative and nice that it was in multiple languages. Be sure that you are ready to spend a minimum 2 hours as there are so many great exhibits and so much is interactive. We have three boys - 4, 7, 11 and they enjoyed the exhibit too. There is also a nice children's museum next door. Be sure you pick your time ahead of time and get your tickets as they are on a schedule. You may only be here 30 minutes to an hour at most."
The forgotten war wrapped in an unforgettable place,"If you are a war history goers, this place is for you. This place says what you have to know about Korean war in the 50s from South Korean perspective.If you go there during weekdays it's quite empty, but I'm not so sure during the weekend. The museum has massive carpark too, so not to worry if you go there with a car.In general, this is one of my favourite museum."
You can see and touch many kinds of weapon.,"It's huge memorial for Korean War, one of the most brutal warfares in modern human history. The frontline of war had moved almost 2,000kms during 6 months, which is the top in modern history. All nation was demolished totally. This is a one of factors of Miracle of Han-River.You can see a lot of exhibitions include hundreds of thousand victim's name. Also there are hundreds of outdoor weapons exhibitions, tanks, planes, even submarines. You can touch and climb in it. I think this is very rare place in this planet that possible to this."
Excellent - the best museum I've ever visited,"Excellent museum. Easy to understand, impressive pictures. Affects yourself from the first step on. The role and action of UN is very good explained."
Impressive and moving experience,"The huge monument of ""statue of brothers"" welcoming every visitors moved me. Korean families celebrating Memorial Day in their camping tents (urban camping being a recent trend) lining up the sidewalks of this huge complex of war memorabilia reminds me how proud this nationality of their culture and heritage. This park is probably one of the best in the world- a living testament how this once poor nation, now a nation of great wealth was able to fight for their land and freedom. Displayed were actual warships and planes, armaments, names of unknown soldiers including some of my fellowmen (Filipinos) who helped fought the Korean war. How can you not be proud? "
Awesome,"An awesome experience to see the fighter jets, submarines, and other equipment used in the Korean War. However, the tribute/memorials to all the soldiers who lost their lives is also a very sobering part of the experience. Inside, the exhibits are bursting at the seams with information about the War. You'll leave with a greater appreciation for those who served and the trials and hardships the Korean people faced. "
Informative and great,"I visited here with my family not even a month ago because I was going to leave Korea for a while soon and I've never been. As we walked up the entrance, there were walls full of names (korean and foreign) or people who died in the war (there were so many americans and koreans) and just walking down was a humbling experience. Inside the museum there is a lot of walking and so many things that I never even thought of.Outside, they have an entire field dedicated to planes, tanks, helicopters, and other ways of war. Just seeing everything (the history, the weaponry, the people) was great. I recommend it."
Large war memorial,"This very large war memorial, committed to keep track of the many wars Korea was involved in, is well built and kept, and very interesting for visitors who are kind of history. "
A Must Visit for History and Military Buffs,"This is a museum that continues to get better from already good. It is huge and one should budget a good two hours to take it in properly. This museum, while largely consumed by the Korean War, also reviews war duing Korea's long history.During the past ten years, the Korean Government has spent a great deal of resources in upgrading the national museums to make them to be world class in quality. This is no exception."
Freedom is Not Free,"This place definitely earns its first ranking in the 'Places to visit in Korea' list rated by Trip Advisor. You will be greeted with awesome sculptures with stories behind that at the entrance. If you love history, this is a must-go destination for you. You would know a lot about the Korean War, which has separated the North and South Korea till today. There are lots of 3D visuals and cinemas to make things easier to be comprehended. You will also get to know interesting stories about sacrifices for brotherhood, family for the nation. Saying it awesome is really an understatement. Please visit this place. it made my friends cried, and my nose twitched when we read all those beautiful sacrifices. ""Freedom is Not Free"" "
War Memorial of Korea - great visit!,"On the next to the last day of our trip to Seoul, I visited the War Memorial and also the National Museum of Korea. These two are definitely worth a visit. Really nice museums, and we had an English-speaking tour guide. He served in the Korean Army and was so interesting. We only stayed to do the guided tour, about an hour. Could have spent longer there."
Unexpectedly fascinating....,"I went with a local friend and thought it was to be a nice excursion. What it ended up being was a massive learning experience that painted Korea in a whole new light. I am embarrassed to say much of my Korean war understanding was learned from M*A*S*H in the 70's. What this visit taught me was the incredible bravery, hardship, and resilience of the Korean people. It was fascinating, and they also have an awesome exterior display that is fun to roam around."
Moving,I dont usually like War Memorials but this was very moving and I am unfamiliar with Asian warfare so it was very informative.
"""Nice place worth the visit and free entrance""",Very nice place and quite impressive. Learned a lot about the Korean war and the exhibits are well laid out. Plan to walk a ways to the entrance but well worth it. Enjoyed being able to look inside an aircraft and walk around on a tank.
Worth a visit!,"Worth a visit! We had a nice time learning about the artillery, planes, jets, tanks, ships and more which played a part in South Korea's history. "
You would like it if you like military stuff,We came here to learn more about the Korean war and the effects it had on the country and its people. However the vast majority of the information was about the tactical military operations and very little on the effect it had on the people. 
Very informative and classy museum.,About half of this beautiful and well laid out museum is devoted to the Korean War of the 1950s and the rest to the history of war in this ancient land. The long exterior entrance is devoted to honoring the soldiers from over twenty countries and is very impressive. The South Koreans have exhibited the ultimate in class and dignity in how they have treated this. Inside the exhibits are well laid out and very well done. In even an hour or two you can learn the facts about this terrible war.
worth to visit,"it's a VERY large museum and recorded the Korean history in details, excellent description and displayed, especially the South and North Korea War"
Amazing place!,"This place is nothing but combination of amazing and great setting by the government. Along the site, you can learn a lot about the war era and the history. Also, you can see the weapons and the armor that the soldiers wore on the war. Tanks and aircrafts are available to see around the outdoor space. The government really knows how to foster the legacy"
Huge museum of war,"Huge area with three large building covering the wars history of Korea. Large exhibits of aircraft, tanks and ships.Entrance is free."
Fascinating,"Located in front of the Korean War Museum, this statute is must see for everyone who has been to Seoul. It is truely fascinating; depicting both countries as brothers in arms.."
Unexpected highlight with a free gift,"Well, I was not so much interested in a war museum, but this one is a true gem. Huge, and very interesting. Some interactive photo opportunities and relics will certainly fascinate you, and especially your kids. The local guards are very friendly, and will give you some extra information about the conflict, in which they or their families were involved. You can take a free, day-by-day description book of the (hopefully) last Korean war. Huge courtyard can be visited also outside the opening hours, exhibiting planes, tanks, etc. One can easily spend an hour or two, just by wondering around there."
Good history of Korean War and ancient military narratives.,"A lot of video, photos, memorabilia, and stories of Korean War. I was touched by the hall commemorating the American soldiers from every state who lost their lives fighting for a free South Korea."
A must visit if your a history or War fan,Try and get there during the afternoon show. The show is a chronological evolution of the Korean Army and the different types of armour and arsenal they used. Very synchronised. you get to take photos at the end of the show with the performers.
Excellent museum,"Excellent and surprising museum, military vehicle park and impressive memorial statues outside, fantastic museum about Koreas military history inside"
A must see in Seoul,A fantastic place to visit. Very informative. The exhibits are comprehensive and full of useful information.
Top Museum in Seoul for a Reason,"I've been here three times and learned something new with each visit. I admit that the museum can be overwhelming due to it's size but it's certainly worth the visit.For starters you could easily spend an hour or two just outside looking at all the old planes, tanks, etc. as well as the names etched in stone. Once inside you could spend another few hours (depending on your interest) on the multiple levels. But what really sets this museum apart from others are the displays and the way some of the information is presented (which includes a couple of 3-D and 4-D theater presentations)."
Impressive museum,Be prepared for a 4 hour visit. Museum covers all of Korean history. is as much a memorial as a museum. It has a very detailed presentation of the Korean war. 
Interesting and Sombre,"I don't really know how to rate the war memorial. It certainly is impressive with the statues and the tanks/war ships with the information on the plaquards. However, it is quite sombre. So it is interesting if you are a history buff or paying your respects for an hour or two."
Worth a visit before your DMZ trip,"Free entry to wander round, very close to the point where you meet for a DMZ tour, so ideal to visit before. Allow an hour. Lots of equipment, plans, monuments, etc"
Unmissable for those with an interest in history,"This is a review for both the memorial and the museum which should really be considered one. First off, the memorial itself was beautiful and powerful. The statues really give a sense of the struggles of the past and even the present day split between the people of Korea. Secondly, the museum allows you to see all sorts of historical jets, tanks, weapons, armor, etc. etc. that you'd be hard pressed to find elsewhere. Truly a fantastic experience for any fan of military history. There's also a lot of history from before the Korean war in the memorial, you can even see a replica of a Korean turtle ship.When I visited in May, they even had a performance that happened right outside the museum. They had various martial arts performances followed by a marching performance done by all four branches of the Korean Armed Forces. Quite a sight to behold.Also, it's free. I don't see why anyone would miss this unless history completely bores you."
Amazing history,Great Tour at the memorial. The Tour guide was a lady with depth knowledge on Korean history and who indeed experience the Korean war.
Very moving,This museum was very moving and impressive. We spent several hours walking through and still didn't see every exhibit. I learned a great deal about Korean history and more about the war. I highly recommend including this in your trip.
Great & Interesting - but could be better!,"This is a very good war museum, with a lot of different displays including old planes outside. At times very patriotic, but still good. One thing- it could do with more interactive displays to make it more exciting! Perhaps open up one of the planes so you can go inside."
Great War memorial and cool for even kids,Very well put together museum and most certainly worth an afternoon or morning. My kids really liked the museum.
its a nice place,"the workers there are friendly, they speak english too, its a nice place to take a girl on a first date to"
highly patriotic yet very impressive,"I do strongly recommend visiting this modern style museum. There are several in and outdoor exhibitions of weapons, uniforms, military equipment not only used by Korean armed forces but theie allies as well. Moreover there are interactive scenes which show the horror of the war. This makes the biggest impression.This place is free of charge and You can reach it by Seoul subway. Then take a 20-30 minutes walk or take a bus from the subway station. The facilities are very good, too. There are number of restaurants offering different kinds of food from Korean to fast food. You order at the central desk by choosing a number of the restaurant and a meal. Very convinient.To sum up good idea if You have more than a day in Seoul."
"Interesting, Large, and Well Organized","Easily one of the best museums I've ever visited, only the Imperial War Museum in London is better I'd say. Everything has bilingual tags, very varying exhibitions and well structured, making it a pleasure to explore this fabulous museum."
Excellent,"Which I has more time to see it. I liked the children was excellent, very informative. I disliked the fact I had limited time to see it all."
Nostalgic Moment,We are appreciative of the soldiers who fought many years ago which sort of shaped the world we are in. Although I never got to experience the war era it was a nostalgic moment to go through the War Memorial of Korea to see the many countries that were part of the war. The displays were well presented and there are a lot of interesting readings and items to see.
Creative presentation of Korean War,The place was very creative in presenting the Korean War. At the entrance there were walls filled with the soldiers names from different part of the world. Then inside there was a 4D presentation presenting the war and how cold the weather was. And not forgetting all the memorials and the equipments used over the years.Strongly recommend you visit it.
Very information and educational,"If your into history this is for you. The worlds largest war memorial, offered free admission (might be a summer promotion) and english tour (was about an hr) which I highly recommend to do over just seeing it yourself. Theres different floors which are dedicated to the diff wars that took place in korea or affected koreans. "
Impressive collection of vintage war airplanes and armoured vehicles,The recollection of bygone korean war's succession of defeats and successes and the sufferings of the Korean people throughout the war and after.
Moving,"Fascinating museum suitable for all ages as the museum has currently the only 'war museum' designed for children. Most of what we saw was the children's area, which fascinated our 7 year old twins. No doubt the focus was a South Korean perspective, as one would expect. I'm sure the North Korean equivalent would tell a contrasting perspective."
Disappointing exercise in propaganda masquerading as a museum,"I'm fascinated by the Korean War and I was really looking forward to seeing this museum, but I was hugely disappointed in it; this is less of a museum than an exercise in propaganda, in which the heroic South Koreans and savior Americans defeat the evil North Korean & Chinese Communists. A more balanced and nuanced perspective on the history of this important war would do much to contribute to educating the public about it, but this museum is really a waste of time, I hate to say. The only thing that piqued my interest was the huge model of Admiral Yi Sun-shin's famous turtle ship that he used to defeat the Japanese in the Seven Years' War (1592-1598). The Korean government needs to commission a group of Korean War scholars to revise the text in English and Korean of all of the exhibits in the museum; I'd suggest Prof. Bruce Cumings of the University of Chicago, one of the leading experts on the Korean War. Until and unless this is done, this museum will have limited credibility as a history museum."
Good insight to Korean history,If you are interested in history and war this is the place for you. It is huge. We spent a whole day there.The only complaint is that the Korean war section is bordering to being too long
"Overwhelming, so plan ahead","The War Memorial of Korea is a place of epic proportions, appropriate for a place that pays tribute to just about every single battle fought on Korean soil in recorded history. The visitor route starts in the actual ""memorial"" room, which is very plain, and then moves downstairs to a huge display recounting all of the battles of the medieval and early modern eras. Some of the information on specific battles was a bit dense and this section felt somewhat repetitive as one battle against the Chinese/Japanese turns into another. This section does make use of replica fortress walls and a turtle ship and also includes the first fantastic life-size diorama and audio-visual presentation, more of which are found in the Korean War display. The Korean War display is the real highlight of the museum and is worthy of lots of your time. The life-sized scenes showing soldiers crossing the 38th parallel, soldiers defending bridges in Seoul and the signing of the armistice really brought the history to life. After this I went outside and explored the park with its countless tanks, missiles and planes on show. The War Memorial of Korea is a truly impressive museum but I wish I had taken a moment when I got there to figure out exactly what bits I wanted to see before aimlessly starting my visit. When I visited they were giving away FREE copies of a day-by-day history of the Korean War in English and Korean, which I thought was a great idea for a meaningful souvenir for visitors to take away. The War Memorial is a must-see for anyone visiting Seoul."
Informative educational trip,"A very informative place to scan through all the war in Korea. Very interesting historical timeline that many people have a misconception about Korea history. Recommended for students, military enthusiast, and educator. "
Impressive historical War museum,"Fantastic museum, maybe the largest I have seen. Inside a huge building Koreas history was presented from 0 BC to today, with main focus on the Korean War. Then there was tanks and battleships and planes outside together with some very impressive War monuments. You could easily spend a day there and learn a lot about Korea. I learnt a lot."
Enjoyed the tour in English,Spent one hour exploring the museum. What really made the whole experience come alive was the English tour. It covered the Korean War in as much possible as an hour allowed. They have some fascinating exhibits but the tour really helped all these things to come alive. The korean war even holds 2 guiness world records! Something I didn't know but was impressed by. Go find out what! Try your best to get on a tour though as you will simply learn so much more. I would not have enjoyed the museum as much if it weren't for the tour.
Turtle Ship,Really great museum! All the planes and war machines outside were fun but the replica turtle ship inside was my favorite. 
Very informitive interesting Museum,"This is a great museum, I only spent a few hours here but could of easily made a half to full day here. "
Excellent!,"The world's largest war memorial, it was really interesting and you can probably walk around for hours. Great exhibits, and best of all, it's free!"
Huge museum!,"We spent a long time there and there wasStill so much more to see!! Beautiful war memorial! With a huge indoor museum and outdoor planes, ponds and sculptures!"
Interesting and Educational Visit to A War that is still going on,"The exhibits were amazing - real life aeroplanes, tanks, military transportation, war ship. Great place to learn more about the contemporary history of Korea. "
Makes the history come live,"I thought that I knew the history of the Korean War but this museum gave me so much more and in a very interesting way. It made the history come live, and made me curious for even more info.There is an interesting and very impressive collection of original airplanes and vehicles from the war, and in addition you can see more modern vehicles used by the Korean army.The long rows of stone columns with endless rows of names on South Korean soldiers who died during the Korea War made me quiet and thoughtful. I can't really comprehend the extent of the casualties such a war takes.The history is taking you right up to the newest incidences in the Korean conflict including the naval incidents 1999, 2002 and 2010. This clearly shows why South Korean people and government still take the situation very seriously.The Korean War Museum is a must-see, if you’ll try to understand not just that particular war, but also the whole situation in the East Asian area."
The Best Museum in Seoul,"The title of this attraction does not do it justice as it is so much more than just a memorial, but an entire complex and museum where you could easily spend half a day.  The property itself is gorgeous, containing many sculptures of the war and an entire field of tanks, planes and other weapons which are cool to look at and explore.  The museum itself is very well done, and surprisingly, completely free. The bottom floor contains Korean history and an overview of all the dynasty’s, while the other floors focus on the Korean war.  I honestly didn’t know much about the war before coming here, nor am I a big museum person, but I found this museum to be extremely informative and engaging and I learned quite a lot.  This is a great way to spend an afternoon, learn some history and see some tanks :)"
Good way to gain a historical perspective on Korea,"A well-designed explanation of South Korea's history, with interesting exhibits and plenty of English translations. There are planes, tanks and helicopters outside, too."
Very interesting,"I now have a much better understanding of the Korean War. Make sure you go to the cinema room to watch ""war & peace "" in is offered in English."
Impressive,The building is very impressive as are all of the displays and videos. Korea is scarred deeply by its civil war and this museum gives it some context and dignity.
Korean War Memorial,"Very well planned and elaborate memorial to honor those that fought for their country! Spacious, modern and well, designed museum. Highly recommended stop if you are ever in Seoul, Korea. It is one of the stops on the Get On Get Off Bus Route that loops through the city."
A great experience,"A truly amazing experience, and free as well. The exhibits are incredible and they have a good contrast of indoor and outdoor stuff to see. the actual building tells you the importance Korean people put upon their military history. I would recommend spending at least 4 hours here."
Very thorough and entertaining museum,"I really enjoyed the War Memorial of Korea. Not only is it a very informative museum, teaching you in great detail the history of Korea and the Korean War, but the museum is presented in a very enjoyable way. It's laid out in a way that makes it nice to walk through, even for someone who is not a history buffAdditionally, the outdoor area is interesting with old fighter planes and battle tanks. There are also multiple 4D theaters that show short films - though sadly these were closed from MERSThe museum at times can be a little intense due to the nature of the subject, but it's definitely a worthwhile, enjoyable and educational place to visit while in Seoul. "
A top visit in Seoul ,"Absolutely fantastic museum detailing the Korean War in depth. I loved seeing the tanks, airplanes and other engines of war on the grounds, and the timeline of Koreas history on display is a sight to see. Even better, it's completely free! A must visit in Seoul to all those visiting. "
A memorial serving as a reminder for the cruelty and absurdity of war,"I visited it twice; each time I feel sorry for so many killed and the great losses inflicted on the people, regardless of their place of origin. It stands to witness the evergoing conflict between the north and south. Huimans do not seem to have learned much from history"
"Worth a visit to see war planes, tankers etc up close","If you haven't had a chance to see ships, warplanes, tankers etc up close, it's worth visiting. We didn't enter the building, only walk around outside cos the great stuffs are outdoors as shown in everyone's pictures reviews. Kids should love this."
American Vietnam Vet's visit to respect our aliies,"Very well done statute of Vietnam Veterans. They even had a replica of a MASH unit in the museum. Easy to get to on the step on and off bus tour which is 12,000 won for the day. The US Army base is the next stop on the tour."
Worth a visit,"My kids and I really enjoyed this, we learned a great deal about Korean history and they have excellent displays both inside and out. We orginally thought it was only about the Korean War which would have been fine, but it's so much more."
A well made museum,"Easy to follow the right directions, things are presented in a chronological order. Gave me a good insight to Korean history and the reasons for the division of the country."
"So Moving, So worth it!","Wow...I learned so much about the Korean War, and I was so moved by the way they paid tribute to other nations who fought in the Korean War. This is definitely one of my personal top attractions in Seoul and even in South Korea. It will give you new perspective on the locals and how much pain many families still suffer because of this conflict. Definitely, definitely plan to spend 3-4 hours here at least, and make sure you watch the films they offer. I don't remember the names of them, but I walked away from one of the films with tears in my eyes.A must-see. "
New and Informative,"A few of my friends suggested to visit this place, so I gave it a shot. The exhibits are clearly written and the information is well presented. The facilities are new and a little interactive, so it is definitely worth seeing while you are visiting Seoul. Unless you dislike history, you will get some enjoyment and knowledge out of visiting here."
A nice memorial,"This was a nice, clean, tranquil, and big memorial. There were plenty of things to see both inside and outside. It is also very close to the train station and military base."
Very peaceful yet humbling experience,"This was a very interesting stop for me and I'm glad I managed to fit this into my trip to Seoul. It's definitely worth a visit for any who also love history. Take a couple hours at least to see both outside and in, it was a very humbling experience."
Not quite as good as we hoped for,"Decided to go here as we had booked a trip to the border of Koreas for the next day and wanted to be as informed as possible. The museum is very large an you need to take some time to go through it. The history starts from way back and we were mainly interested in the modern history so we sort of rushed through the stone age etc parts and spent more time getting to know the recent history. We found it to be a bit too one-sided, which of course can be understood but would have been interesting to know a bit more about the reasons etc of the wars but it turned out to be a ""how much do we love the UN for standing with us""- kind of experience. The next day we took the trip to the border and turned out that theres a ton of information and slideshows included in the tours with much deeper level of recent history than the museum had, so in case you are going here just to be informed about the recent (100 years maybe) history, and you are going to the border trip as well, don't bother. Otherwise, if you are interested in history this is your kind of place. Entrance is free which is a plus. Be aware that it's closed on Mondays throughout the year."
"Good museum and memorial, pleasant afternoon",For a war memorial there wasn't much emotion about war itself and how war is bad. The displays are in reasonable shape but not excellent. Good that it's free though. Probably would 2 hours to see the whole thing.
Mother of War Memorial 😰,"If you like history of Korea especially its war history then this is the right place for you to visit. The first floor was from prehistoric era, so you'll probably best to skip it but it is still not bad to see though. Second and third level were for Korean War, Vietnam war, donated artefacts, arsenals, tanks, howitzer and jets models.Can spend more than 1 hour just to look at all the exhibitions there; more if you want to read all the explanations in details. Do not forget to visit the park on the left, since it contains more of real size vehicle models (tanks, jets, tank destroyer, etc). A really good place to spend your time in Seoul. There is no entrance fee, close at 6PM, can hire local tour guide there from inside the building."
the whole family,Take your time and free up two hours!! There is so much to see and very interesting. Do donate as it is a free venue. Really cool morning out! 
Worthwhile,"Great displays in the museum. The memorial part was moving and emotional, especially if your family members served during the Korean War. "
Understanding Korea,"This is a nice place to visit, it a 'must' to understand the 'today' of Korea. I just spend like 1 hr outside to see the machinary of war (airplanes, tanks,...) and the sculputures and let my mind trying to immagine how was it back then."
A Great Museum!,"I usually don't enjoy museums, but I actually learned a lot from touring this museum. At the entrance to the museum, you'll see several statues/monuments with the descriptions of each one. I in particular liked The Statue of Brothers and what it meant. For yet another free museum, it has the usual showcases, but also, short movies. One was even in 3-D! If you enjoy reading/learning about the military, then this is the place for you. There is also an outdoor area with military planes and a ship. So much to do at The War Memorial of Korea! "
Moving museum,"We didn't have enough time to tour the entire museum, but I'm so glad that we stopped by. This museum is interesting, informative and incredibly moving. It gives you a real feel for the scale of this awful war in lives lost, property destruction and in the tremendous international support/mobilization.This is a must see site."
Better that we expected,"Insightful and interesting displays and exhibitions of Korea's wars, with special focus on the Korean War. The outdoor aircraft, tank and cannon displays alone are worth a visit for history and aviation buffs."
"Absolutely Outstanding, highly recommend","No question this was the most interesting thing I visited while in South Korea. It is very easily accessible from the Samgakji train stop, no more than a 10 minute walk (Just make sure you get out of the correct exit). I would save about 3 hours to go through it quickly, and hopefully its not a rainy day as there are some very impressive memorials, old tanks, vehicles, places, boats, and missals on display outside. Along with a few large passage ways which honor every solider that was killed in duty from every country and even state. Inside its just massive, and gives you a great run down of what happened, why it happened, and where things stand today (which i knew very little of the history). Obviously there are artifacts galore on the war but its much more than that too. I highly recommend this. Oh yeah and its Free. "
It's like heaven for the history buff,"I totally LOVED this museum. I am a bit of a war history geek, so this place was like heaven. As you enter there is a very moving statue that is a tribute to the Korean War, and while much of this museum is dedicated to Korean War history, there are also displays about other military campaigns and military artifacts from the entirety of Korean history. On the grounds of the museum there are a lot of aircraft and tanks and troop transport vehicles that have played a significant role in Korean Military history - most impressive is an American B-52! Inside there are more displays that highlight the history of the Korean War as well as a limousine that belonged to Kim Il Sung that was captured by the ROK Army during the Korean War. The highlight of the museum - the reason for my visit - was the large scale model of a Turtle Ship which is the ship that was used by Admiral Yi Soon Shin to defeat the Japanese Navy in 1592. "
Great place to learn about history,best place to understand more about Korean war and the current political situation between north korea & south korea
War Museum-A must see,"Amazing, and well presented in the floor lay-out and displays. A very impressive outdoor armament and aircraft display too."
great historical monument of cold war,"great historical monument of south korea. But, the most important story is in this museum, i can feel the strong relationship between south korea people and usa. USA is like a father and a savior for south koreans "
Not the best if you are looking for history,"Perhaps for those who are looking for stories and anecdotes this is not the right place. On the other hand, for those who like walking around vestiges of war artifacts it could be an interesting afternoon. "
Brilliant and free.,"This will take a good 2.5 hours to walk around. Very interesting. It is free to get in, although I gave a donation. Lots to see outside the museum and the monuments are superb. Be patient, Koreans don't care if you are trying to take a photo!"
Armaments!,The display was tremendous. It gives you an insight to the power this country had and has. This kind of display always interests me. 
Pride and Gratitude Abound,A wonderful way to pass a few hours to better understand the War in Korea. The pride of the South Korean victors and their gratitude to the UN troops is evident and heartfelt. I walked away with a new respect and insight into the fighting spirit of their nation. English tours at 10am & 2pm. 
Get ready to learn a lot!,"The museum was very educational. Coming from the U.S., I didn't really know a lot about the war. It was very interesting to hear about the role played in the war and how close North Korea was to victory before the United Nations got involved. Probably one of the best museums I have visited in awhile."
After 25 years visiting Seoul I finally visited this Great Memorial,Have been working and visiting Seoul for 25 years and walked by almost daily. finally took the time to visit and it was a great education on the Korean War and the U.S. participation.Had great indoor and outdoor exhibits and sculptures. Located right outside Yongsan Army Garrison.
Must see,"This is the best museum in Seoul. Nice outdoor part with lots of tanks, planes and other military equipment, which you can visit from outside and inside."
Nice,I have been here and you have an awesome view over the city from here. Also the Memorial is very impressive.
a do not miss in Seoul,"Very nicely done walking between the glories and horrors of war. An especially good place for Americans to lean of the incredible heroism of Korean troops, as well as Americans during the Korean war"
War Memorial,"An enormous museum that was very well done with visual effects and artifacts from the conflict. It conveyed the tragedy of the war, heroics of many and the human sacrifice and suffering. It also pays tribute to those who came to its aid from a thankful nation."
The War Memorial of Korea,Huge museum which takes a lot of time to cover. If you love history and especially war history this museum is a must when visition Seoul or Korea.
First time visitors should not skip,"I'm not the biggest fan of museums, more so of remembering any war. Having said this, I would have to say that a visit to Korea would be incomplete without at least taking a look at the collection technology throughout the decades. The displays are either replicas or the real artifact that saw battle in the wars that South Korea has been involved with. There are also many vehicles and weapons that have been collected throughout the museum's history to give a better view of what may have happened at that particular time in history.This museum, much like the entire city is high-tech. There are viewings and displays that employ the latest tech in presenting the visitors the look and feel of what happened during a particular battle. There are 5-10 minute video presentations. Some of these are done in artistic ways to evoke feelings of commiseration from the viewers for the full sympathetic and empathetic impact.Outside the memorial however, the visitors can go in and out the the different type of tanks and go up the big planes that have seen wartime. This is a great treat for the young and the young at heart. For pen and paper game board enthusiasts that paint soldier and vehicle figures having a more tactile experience with the life size replica or real tank can bring wonder to the mind that it can take a visitor a couple of hours going in and out the tanks and ships in the courtyard of the memorial.This was our second visit to this place and there have been changes to the displays and viewings. At least we know that the museum is dynamic and is still relevant to visiting tourists and locals alike."
Nice and calm,"The great green garden is there to remind you that we all come to ashes. The whole area is full of memories of the nuclear attack. Keep your eyes open for the large group of students they take there daily from all over the country, they are so cute! We all have to remember the war and never repeat it!"
AMAZING!!!!,"The outdoor exhibit on the war machines used by the US, Koreans, North Koreans, China, Russians during the Korean War was amazing! The indoor museum was huge and really it takes 3hrs just to have a glimpse of everything. Best of all, its free! "
The War Memorial of Korea,Very educational visit. I have always been fascinated by the Korean War and this location is great for learning about all aspects of it. The statues are great for photos but the most interesting part of the memorial is the area containing the tank and plane replicas. Probably a good way to engage the kids! Free as well!
Worth a visit,"Interesting perspective of the Korean War, obviously biased, but very well explained and in detail. Most of the information given is factual but always with a twist but it is worth the visit to learn more about this short albeit important war."
Don't Miss This!,"Excellent museum with extremely moving exhibits and monuments. Outside there is a large selection of war machines sitting beside a peaceful garden and koi pond, which is very surreal. Being able to see a B-52 bomber up close was also a highlight."
Very well done,I only spent about two hours there because of other other commitments. Two hours is not enough. Very well done
This one is excellent,"As far as museums, go, this one is interesting, varied and easy to navigate. Most things are in both Korean and English. Many artistic dioramas and displays make it easier to imagine the war settings and to see the ingenuity involved in the battles and strategies. I found it very educational and moving. I had no idea that 1,800,000 Americans had fought in the Korean War! 33,000 were killed. And 22 nations were involved. Those are big numbers!"
i really like.,it was a good idea to go there ; fantastic and mazing collection wich make you travel over history of asia and surely south korea; i really like it and i think it s a must to go there ; also for kids .
A lot of information about the Korean War,"We were really surprised at how large this museum was. There are three floors devoted to war. Outside are over 160 planes, helicopters, heavy armaments and even a ship to look at.If you enjoy history, or want to know more about war in the Korean Peninsula, come here. I would say that some of the information is a little repetitive. There would have been more personal history in the form of videos. Very moving though and a definite must during a trip to Seoul. Easy to get to by subway and there is a food court building just nearby. We found it impossible to do this museum and the Museum of Korea in one day. Plan on a day for each. Both excellent museums."
A comprehensive war history of Korea,"Highly recommended. After the visit, we understand Korean history much better. Need to spend at least one to two hours to browse through all the exhibition"
History place," If you are a military buff, you HAVE to visit this museum. Armored vehicles, choppers and planes on display outside. Even the entrance to the property with huge statues dedicated to the war will keep you for 10 minutes snapping photos. "
GREAT museum!,"Many exhibits, hands-on, great documentary movies, large outdoor display, kids park ... Free tours daily!"
Educational,Very educational! Even our pre-teens enjoyed seeing all the displays. We spent a few hours wondering around the museum.
Lots to see,"Set in impressive grounds the front yard is full of moving monuments. The back yard is full of planes, tanks and boats, so of which you can climb onto. More displays inside make for a very informative and intriguing afternoon. A personal highlight was the turtle ship replica."
Great Place,It is a must place to visit in seoul. It was great to see thoase real war machines at one place. Also some miniature models are kept in the memorial.
Place of solace,War Memorial of Korea is grand. I felt sadness as the saw all the name of people engraved on the plaque with their Country. I felt uncomfortable when we took and picture and was instructed to hold in each hand the Korea Flag -way up high! .That picture will NEVER be in my photo album.
Well worth a visit,This is a very well done memorial. Very moving. You walk through it and see different aspects of the war as you go. 
Best Museum in Korea,"If you like history, then this place is for you. Yes it is called ""War Memorial"" but I'm telling you, this massive place shows you more than that. I was here for at least four (4) hours! I felt like a little kid just walking around looking, reading and listening to everything."
a gentle country born from fire,gives you a very good insight on the culture and identity of this nation. I showcases how Korea was before world war 2. 
"Worth a visit, at the right time","Came to visit on Monday, bad decision, as it's always closed on Monday. But I still got the explore the entrance and the outside area, which already amazed me. People recommended for next visit, to stay longer to explore the inside. It could take up to 3 hours. "
Not to be missed.,"Well worth visiting, it is well kept and a very moving experience. We were on a tour, we spent a number of hours there but would have liked more. If given the opportunity we would like to go back."
Educational visit ,Pretty impressive collection of pre-gunpowder warfare items. English explanation provided on most stuff. You can easily spend up to an hour there. Good for rainy day itinerary. 
Excellent!,"This is an excellent place to view the history of the Korean War. Outside the Museum, there are a few monuments and a whole section dedicated to equipment used during the war. Highly recommend it to people interested in War history."
Understanding of Korea's military history,The steel statues and sculptures are a sight to behold and within the main complex is a huge museum which documents Korean military history with numerous artefacts and equipment.
I can't believe its free!,really good museum and memorial and lots of fun activities inside. They should charge an entrance free!
Back thru memory lane of the 3 kingdoms,If u love history then u shld visit this location. It's not about world war 2 but about the 3 kingdoms and the wars in korea. 
Free!!!,Free!!! It was free !!!!!!!free!!!!!!!free!!!!!!Free!!! It was free !!!!!!!free!!!!!!!free!!!!!!Free!!! It was free !!!!!!!free!!!!!!!free!!!!!!Free!!! It was free !!!!!!!free!!!!!!!free!!!!!!
Don't miss this attraction!!!,"I can't say enough about this museum! It's an historical walk through Korea's time at war and it is extensive.The museum is huge and each section is dedicated to specific time in Korea's history such as their conflict with the Mongol's, to their long history of fighting the Japanese to the more recent Korean war. The Korean's are particularly grateful to the 21 nations of the UN who came to their aid against North Korea and there are many moving memorials to commemorate the lives lost. There are also many planes, ships, and vehicles from the Korean war on display outside the museum and most are available to climb on or in. A great place to take families, kids or just spend some time alone. Leave yourself 3+ hours AT LEAST to see this attraction. "
Amazing!,"This place hits home for me. Amazing museum that is very interactive and well designed. So educational and could spend hours here. Also, loved the air conditioning!"
"""Remember, this is the South Korean version of history...""","...So said our young English-speaking guide at the Korean War Memorial Of course, this is the case with all such memorials and museums of conflict. Nonetheless, it is an interesting way to spend a few hours, and I recommend that you arrive on time for a guided tour.One small thing - as one approaches the memorial building from the front, one can see vending machines on the flanks of the building. That's just naff - I can't imagine walking up Anzac Avenue in Canberra and being greeted by the sight of vending machines at the Australian War Memorial. It looks cheap; disrespectful, even."
you can see everything of korean war history.,"while staying here, i felt like so sad and respectful for sacrified army. they have lots of evidence things like tank, document and movie. must go place in Seoul."
"Very interesting, but very propaganda-y :)","Loads of really interesting info on all aspects of Korea's conflicts all through the ages. From the Japanese occupations and earlier up to the present, ongoing war with the north.It was obviously very one sided, but that is to be expected."
"Sobering, dignified, VERY interesting","I literally spent 6 hours here. The exhibits are all subtitled or signed in English. The sculptures out front, and the 'court of flags' (of the nations who had troops in the war) is a great ""thank you"" from the Korean people (or at least, that is how I see it). There is a very somber section where the names are engraved. The only suggestion that I would make if the managers read this is to put a sign in many languages in that area requesting silence, maybe some of the other tourists can take the hint!"
Very interesting,We took about 3 hours to stroll around. It was very interesting and informative. Most displays have an english translation so it was easy to understand most things.I noticed plenty of guides around but none of them seemed particularly interested in interacting with us.
good place,"Its a must visit place, good for time pass and learning about korean culture and history. I have visited 3 times since 2012, i like visiting these kinda places and its located near to Itaewon just 10-15 minutes walk from Itaewon market."
large museum for a good primer of korean culture,"the museum is free! there is also an hourly free movie viewing at the 2nd floor one can come in the morning because there are lots of things to explore.my family enjoyed this the most! my father loves the aircrafts,war tanks that are displayed for picture taking. every room also showed a very tourist friendly exhibition! there is a coffee/souvenir shop at the lower level too. "
War Memorial Museum,"Excellent display, interactive learning, perfect location and very well organize and thought out. Even for children a lot of activities and stuff for them. Excellent historical learning."
If you're into war stuff...,"If fighter jets, tanks and missiles are your then then don't miss this place. We just strolled around the grounds and the displays are excellent. The ubiquitous piped music comes with the experience unfortunately and it was practically deserted. There is a certain air of neglect to the place and a bad smell of bins around the convenience store on the grounds. Like many war memorial in Korea, I really struggle with the incongruity of siting kids play facilities adjacent..... "
Classical tribute,This museum housed in a beautiful classical style building covers all Korean Wars. A large section is devoted to the 1950-53 conflict but it stretches back in history to the Japanese invasion of 1592 and earlier invasions from the Mongols. It is located near the American Army Camp Kim. For history buffs it is definitely worth a visit.
Interesting and huge!,"This museum was much bigger than I expected. There is a lot of information and detailed exhibits of the Korean War. It would be good to go here before going to the DMZ but not necessary. I suggest going earlier in the day than I did. I only planned for an hour or two and it took much longer! After I finished with the inside, I made my way around to the side of the museum where you can climb on old tanks and planes. This part was particularly fun since most museums don't allow visitors on or in the weaponry. I highly recommend going here!"
Simply breathtaking and FREE!,"Hungry, and still a little shocked from the great fish market massacre, we decided to hit our next stop, which was the War Memorial of Korea. Be prepared to spend 2-4 hours at the museum and walk up a lot of steps just to get to the entry. It was ginormous and definitely an attraction you do not want to miss. The best part of all, it’s free! There were countless displays, interactive exhibits, and they even offered a self-guided audio tour in your language on request. I’m by no means a history buff, but there was a video exhibit detailing the war history alliance between South Korea and America that made us tear up, but again you can’t take us too seriously because we watch Korean dramas — so we cry at everything."
Close on Monday,"It is close on Monday, but that is the best time to visit, since you can walk in the yard and enjoy it without the crowds."
Excellent exhibitions!,"This is a must see when visiting Seoul. If you are planning on visiting the DMZ when you are in Seoul, visit this museum before going. It will help you understand the history behind it so much better. It is such a great museum!! You can easily spend a day here! It will help you understand the Korean war as well as the Korean history so much better and it will make you appreciate traveling in the country so much more. This is also a free museum so you have no excuses for not visiting it!"
A step back in history,"Great museum with no entrance fee. FREE! Interesting museum with multiple display rooms of different themes. Outside of the building you can see tanks, planes and larger pieces of history. We have taken numerous visiting friends to this museum and everyone enjoys going. Not sure of the schedule, but on many mornings they have a performance outside that is worth watching. I believe they are closed on Mondays, confirm before trying to visit on a Monday so you won't be disappointed. "
Strange war memorial,"War memorials tend to be grave and sombre. The outdoor display of guns and other warcraft was however quite stunning and the surrounding park is actually quite pleasant, albeit different from most experiences of this type."
Impressive museum,"Great exhibits, representation of not just the Korean War but all wars and conflicts Korea has been involved in up to current humanitarian missions. Worth the trip. "
A place to think,It is the most beautiful and meaningful war memorial I have ever seen. It makes you feel sad about horrors of war. Various killing machines are displayed for you to remember that human flesh is much weaker than war steel. The memorial building itself is really grand and impressive. Definitely worth visiting.
I recommend anyone who visits Korea should visit this place.,"It was a good experience to visit to The War Memorial of Korea. They were showing the history of Korean War. I have learned a lot. Good education, for showing history of the country over 2333 years ago which was very interesting. "
Place for learning and appreciation,"Since admission is free as well as easy accessibility via subway and between other points of interest, you're time investment is low in relation to what you can learn. If you're willing to invest some time, then you'll have an excellent opportunity to learn much history. Before you enter, take a moment to contemplate on the thousands of names listed of those who sacrificed their lives to protect Korea. Some of the exhibits need more English signage, but there are many others that provide a great many historical insights that I was not exposed to in the US. I am grateful to the Korean taxpayers for making this free of charge."
Great museum and artifacts from War,"museum is free, great selection of planes and inside very nice with café and movie clips . all in English as well"
impressive building and musuem,"the war memorial was very impressive. the whole building is stunning, the surroundings are super nice and the musuem itself was one of the most fascinating i have seen so far. i'm not much into museums but this one was really a highlight in korea!"
Worth a visit,"Especially if you are not up on the sobering history of the Korean war. Get there early to avoid the crowds and then head over to Itaewon for some dinner, or up the hill to Namsan Tower to see a view of the whole city."
A must see in Seoul.,"Plan at least a half day to visit this museum, to learn more about the war. Nice exibits, with many weapons on display."
A place you should not miss.,"This definitely deserves it's place on the top 10 list. A must see for all. Another plus, this is the only attraction that you will not see huge hordes of Chinese tourist pushing and shoving their way through and you can take a leisurely walk through the memorial. More chances to get great photos with the family."
Must Do!,Great place to learn about Korea war & History. Very informative showing photos of War. Everything explained was in English and many other languages to suit all traveler. Worth going! 
Great free museum about all the wars Korea has been in,"This large museum is interesting on both the outside and inside and it's quite large.Outside there are many plane and other military equipment to look at, and in many case climb on or go inside. My son and husband enjoyed this area more than me, but it was interesting to see so many different planes and vehicles. Also outside was an exhibition room that we seem to always miss when the show was starting so we didn't get to view the video. There is a peace clock tower, Korean war moment that was erected to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Korean War ceasefire. And the most powerful statue there of two Korean brothers who fought during the Korean War on opposite sides hugging each other. There is a plaque that describes the true story behind the statue.Inside, the museum is three floors. Paintings and some equipment show wars from many years ago, including a mobile rocket launcher that was designed in 1451. There is a 1:2.5 scale battleship that was still really large in one room. It looked pretty intricate. The Korean War does take up the largest part of the museum. There is info on the ceasefire and when, over the years, North Korea has violated it in some way. There was a combat experience room that was only 6 minutes long but quite powerful with the sounds and sights experienced in a battle. A 7 minute 3D video of being a fighter pilot was in a different area and there was a shooting arena with graphics and simulated K-2 rifles. I didn't do this, but my son liked it.One room had many planes and other things hanging from the ceiling and information about parachuters. There is a lot more actually, so much to see in this museum. I highly recommend it, if you are visiting Seoul."
Insightful,I went on my last day in Korea and it was very spent at the war memorial. Very easy to get to and lots to see! 
Good Memorial,I would recommend going here if you are in Seoul. Informative and worthwhile. When I was there there was a 'show' outside the Memorial at 2pm by the Korean military. I was happy I went. 
good,"This museum is very interesting as explains very well all Korean History. He has lots of representations, miniatures, and also some movies. This museum is huge. So be interested in Korean history, and plan lot of time !"
war 1953,a very moving experience also a reminder that more nations were involved in this war than many people realise
"Fabulous memorial, well spent 4hours","Well worth the visit, a bit out of the way from the main center but easy to get to on the subway. Great memorial to the ROK and the UN soldiers. Thoroughly enjoyed the time spent there!"
Powerful and Emotional Place to Visit,"What an awesome memorial - its size and scope convey the appreciation for freedom! The sculptures of the soldiers/civilians are roughly double-life-sized and quite powerful. There are numerous tanks and planes on exhibit and many are set up so visitors can climb up on and into them. There is also a life size replica of the Korean naval ship from the incident in 2002. Inside, you can walk around the various spaces and also watch a 3-D movie about the event. A sad but very real reminder that freedom must never be taken for granted. Finally, there is a prominent exhibit hall; we ran out of time to go in and look forward to that on our next visit to Seoul."
Seoul Must Visit Place,"A place worth visiting despite its distant location. It amazes with delicate and respectful attitude towards the history. Definitely, the statue of two soldiers is the most striking figure of that place."
Excellent and should definitely stop by!!!,"We found this place absolutely amazing and spent almost an entire day there (from11am to closing time!!). There are tons of information there, not just on Korean war but all the war history from ancient time as well. We learned a lot about Korean history esp the Korean war, and information is well presented. If you visit Seoul, it's a compulsory stop IMHO."
Amazing,I really was surprised that this museum offer you high quality experience for free. you will watch all of tools used in wars for more than 2000 yrs. very clean and we enjoyed.
This is not to be missed,Whilst attending a family wedding we had the opportunity to visit the War Memorial. We were very fortunate to have the assistance of a tour guide who was able to explain in detail various aspects of the visit. Everything was very impressive and what more impressive was that even with the tremendous footfall everywhere was so clean and tidy. This being a thing we noticed during our stay in Seoul.
Surprisingly good!,"I must admit that this isn't the sort of place that I would usually go but after reading some reviews I thought I should. I was really impressed, the whole place is really well done with great installations, I have worked it that field (sets and installations) for a few years and I wished that I was a part of the team that made it. It was very informative, in English and very nicely done. I learned a lot. Defiantly a must see when in Seoul."
A piece of history,It was a very modern museum and very well maintained. As a citizen of a country which participated in the war; I wanted to see the details and honestly it was a great experience. The design of the museum is perfect and there are many attractions kids can enjoy such as free photos. Transportation is very easy (by subway) and the prices are cheap. A must see for lovers of history. The cleanliness of the washrooms by the way is amazing!
History,It's a museum. For those who like military history and weapons this is great. But then they also have concerts and things for the children if you track their schedule.
Can't beat free.,Nice museum and a wonderful place to spend a few hours. Some of the museum was closed for update but still plenty of history to keep you busy.
Nice place to visit," free entry, it will take few hours to visit this place. so much to see. In the museum you can see many part of war in the korea"
Good Museum,"Some exhibits could be better but the ones of the history of war in Korea are amazing. This museum brought my interest in learning a lot more about the Korean War. I also liked all the tanks and planes parked outside the museum, I specially liked the B-52, big bird, never seen one that close."
Its is a Historical Place to visit.,Korea war memorial is near Seodumun and people who enjoy history will definetely like this. People vist here for refreshing Old War memories and for piece.
Great museum!,"This was a very well put together museum that gives you a good overview about the Korean War. We also went on the day where they had an English tour guide. The guide was nice but he pointed out things we can see on our own. This is definitely a touching museum, and it's worth visiting."
Impressive in scale and perspective,"The museum was much more impressive than I originally expected. The whole area is quite large, and befitting the significance of the event to the Korean peninsula. The elements inside are very good. I especially appreciated learning how events after WWII lead up to the conflict + seeing the large military hardware (planes / tanks). "
Great to see,allow us to understand more on the korean war'. The location itself is not a tourist spot but worth to go.
Worth a Visit,"This is a great attraction - we spent so long in there we had to miss out other planned sights. There is so much to see and take in, we could have spent all day in there. Outside the memorials are worth walking around too. Gives a very detailed insight into the Korean War and other conflicts. Also, it is free!"
"Best Museum I have been to, and it is free","We only stayed a few hours and i think half day is not enough to see all the items on display and its scheduled activities. Best part is, entrance is free and there is a dining near the entrance so i suggest to have a quick lunch there to maximize your stay"
Excellent museum and memorial,"Free, with free guided tours in English. Worth a visit if you have the time and are into war history. Combine with a lunch in Itaewon. "
Recommend this place,"Beeing in Seoul for 4 days at the moment this place is so far the most interesting place. I have not been inside of the museum only outside. I liked the outside area a lot. It was children's day during our visit and we had the luck to see some kind of a show from the korean army and bunch of other stuff. This and the war statues, old planes and ships were amazing."
Wow,"It was free, take a half day to see. so much to see. The displays were colorful and full sized and unique. "
Depending on your interest,"Came to this memorial as part of a tour, as we only stopped briefly here I didn't really get to check out the different monuments carefully and get to really understand the history and meaning behind it. I guess it would be a really interesting stop to visit if someone's interested in history and eager to learn more about the Korean war."
Very informative,"This museum is very aesthetically and architechurally pleasing. The contents was very informative but took about 3 hours to get through. On the Friday we went back to watch the 'changing of the guards' ceremony which involved a marching band and reenactment (we think this is a seasonal display, however). An easy 10-15 minute walk from Itaewon. "
Interesting to see the Korean beliefs on their wars,This is about the Museum more than the monument. The people there were very friendly and helpful. I brought my carry on as I was headed to the airport from there. They assisted me with storing it. If you are interested in history this is an excellent museum. Having been to Chinese museums for the same periods the comparisons are insightful.
A memorial that made me feel proud of the Korean War veterans.. ,The war Memorial of Korea displays all that had happened in the war between North and South Korea.. The way North Korea had started planning for the attack 10 years before the actual war had taken place.. It has safely kept the artillery and ammunition used during the war.. It also has the letters written by the soldiers to their families and so on which actually made tears well up in my eyes.. It has 3D movie theater which shows interesting war snippets.. It has a different section in which all the help that the UN had provided South Korea is shown including videos about it.. Relationship between a soldier husband and his wife and many such heart touching stories can be found here.. Its just great.. Those who are interested in historic events should definitely visit it and others also should visit so that the Korean struggle is known by the world.Since I'm an Indian the memorial brought back my memories of the war that took place between India and China and between India and Pakistan.. But now these three nations are at peace.. 
Impressive Museum - Great Day!,"I felt like the majority of my trip to Seoul was filled with war-related activities. That being said, this was a very interesting museum. Filled with useful facts, cool exhibits and 4D experiences, the museum is a great trip for a family or any war/history buffs! Also, the statues outside are a must see...super cool"
Great memorial and museum,"Plan at least 4 hours to see this amazing museum, with exhibits inside as well as outside. All the exhibits are understandable in Korean and English. We also recommend the free Engilsh tour."
A great war museum,This museum details some very important parts of Korea's history in an informative and interesting way.It is definietely worth spending a few hours exploring the indoor and outdoor exhibits.
A great museum,"This is a great museum, plenty to look at and learn about considering the Korean history..plus it wasn't that long ago so also poignant."
Great outdoor/indoor museum,"The inside part caters more to the Korean population but the outside part is fantastic. They have so many planes, tanks, a huge boat, etc. that you can go inside and explore. Really one of the best museums for all ages in Seoul. "
Definitely worthy your time,"Allocate 2-4 hours to this place. Museum focus not limited to Korean war, but has exhibitions about military struggles throughout the history. "
The outside exhibits are the best,"Travelled to the Museam as part of the DMZ/JSA Tour so we did not really have enough time to take everything in, but the inside displays/exhibits were really well done, but the outiside exhibits were the star with a B52, fighter jets belongiing to the Korean Air force etc were really impressive."
A historical gem,"The museum did not dwell on the Korean Way, but did present some wonderful artifacts and details. The facility gave a wonderfully balanced coverage of the major wars that Korea has been involved in for centuries."
Don't miss it,"Very impressive War Memorial. Big display of planes, tanks and missiles from past war years. Inside the Memorial is a terrific Korean historical display. Well worth a visit and easy walk to Itaewon."
Must Visit If You're in Seoul!,"The museum is huge and provides hi tech media. I think it's good to know South Korea has a museum dedicated for those who involved in Korean War. My faves are the United Nations room, a room filled with items, pictures, and diorama about UN involvement in Korean War. I also tried the 4D theatre. The short video tells about civil people who suffered in the war especially during the winter and there's this snow effect too, nice!"
Informative and interesting visit,"We really enjoyed our trip to the War Memorial. The visit was very informative and insightful as we learned many historical facts on our half day visit there. The military equipment, ships and aircraft on display were well presented and done in a professional manner. Definitely worth the visit when you're in Seoul."
Wonderful place,This place is simply woow. How they have set the infra is amazing. The way they potray the culture and war related info is mind blowing. I took lots of pics here. 
"Other than shopping, this is another must visit","First, it is FREE, second, it is huge you can learn about Korean War and breif history of the development of Korean Army Force."
Interesting half day visit,Very interesting half day visit to the War Memorial. Lots of displays with many aircraft and other military equipment to see. Well worth a visit if a history or military buff.
"It is nice to be appreciated, and good for kids","The Memorial includes a list, in English and organized by state, of the Americans who fell during the war. It also includes the ships and tanks which actually fought in the war on both sides."
Great insights into Korean War,"Great museum with very good items and couple of 4D cinemas, giving you great insights into Korean Civil War and overall Korea history."
Moving and Interesting,Really enjoyed this Memorial. The outside pieces of heavy armoury were very interesting to see up close. The inside rooms filled with stories of war were even more moving to see. I was expecting to see only Korean War memorabilia so was surprised that this memorial has displays from all wars fought in Korea. The hall listing all the names of those who gave their lives for their country was the most moving. Take your time to look at the many displays on the many levels.
Very large memorial,There was so much to see but our tour time was limited. They had a lot of artifacts from the korean war. One of the most interesting for us Americans is a signed Douglas MacArthur letter.
A must see!,"Visit Friday afternoon, at 1pm there is a War Parade in front of the museum. The museum itself is really interesting and gives a good explanation of the history of the Korean War."
Great Stop,"My husband and I spent about 3 or 4 hours here, just walking around and looking at everything. There is lots to see, and it is incredibly informative. Definitely worth the stop."
A Peak at History,"The South Korean government has done an excellent job of honoring the memory of those who fought so bravely during the Korean Conflict. Not only Koreans, but those from all the United Nations countries who served, many of whom lost their lives in the cause of freedom!As one enters the grounds, there is a stunning statue atop an open mound known as ""Brothers."" It depicts two brothers hugging one another: one is an officer from South Korea, the other, a soldier and younger brother from North Korea. They meet on the battlefield and embrace. It is a very powerful statue! Inside the open mound are pictures and images from both Conflict that express the desire fro reconciliation felt by all the Korean people. It also depicts the 16 UN nations that fought so courageously in this war.Past this is a huge open field where planes, tanks, trucks, helicopters, rockets and missles are displayed. Many of these were Korean, but there were also a wide variety of US, Canadian, Russian and Japanese planes, helicopters and tanks. The largest plane is a B-52 Stratofortress. There are information plaques to identify each of these and what part they played in the fighting. The area is surrounded by beautiful flowers and ponds. There is also a battleship from the war that one can board and see the huge guns and ammunition that was used. The outside was simply magnificent. There is also a museum with indoor displays that not only showcase the Korean Conflict, but also many other periods of war in history. One can easily spend 3-4 hours here enjoying the beauty and the history. It is a great place for children and families with all the outdoor displays."
Impressive Building,Plan to spend half day wandering through the many floors of the this museum. This tastefully done memorial is a definite tribute to the many people who lost their lives during the many wars that Korea history has experienced (from BC to present). I especially like the testimonies from soldiers or citizens on the 3rd floor regarding the Korean War...this was very touching and tastefully done. I also enjoyed the dragon boats and don't forget to view accompaning video near by.Tip-Bring address or card (in Korean) from your hotel (all hotels have them) to give the taxi driver when returning to your hotel as many drivers do not speak english.-Bring an umbrella as the day we went it rained on the way in to the museum and then the hot sun came out when we were leaving. 
Looking back,"You'll be amazed with what this museum is offering. This huge place is very informative, from the tanks to artillery, from documents to uniforms, to how it has affected the country. If this is not in your itinerary, change your plans and allot at least 2 hours. Seeing the outside exhibition will take about an hour and a half. And it's really worth it."
Huge and fascinating,This is a massive memorial to a forgotten war. Displays are interesting ans generally well kept. The military equipment outside is a highlight. Recommend at least two hours to see the place.
Just Amazing,This is a modern and facinating museum where the exhibits are interactive and interesting. A must see. 
Nice museum if you have time,"We were trying to get the 3-day tour done and spent too much time in this museum to complete the plan. I did learn more about the Korean War than I knew before and most of the displays are in English also. The museum is free, so you don't feel bad if you run through quickly. I'd skip it if you are not especially interested. "
Learn more about the Korean War and more,"This is an incredible place to go to and learn so much about the Korean War. I spent over an hour and a half here and could have spent longer here. Amazing that you can experience this all for free. Really makes you realise how much South Korea has evolved since the Korean War, and even further back, to the wonderful nation it is today."
Nice place to visit,They have a lot for us to read and learn and they provide tour guides as well (the problem is they don't really speak English)
Great free museum,"The best part of this museum is that it's free. You must visit the outdoor exhibit w/ all the tanks, war planes, and a ship. And the main entranceway is amazing! The inside exhibit is really well done and interesting. It's so well put together that includes a lot of information and the technology used to make the history of war in Korea interesting. You have to spend a few hours there to get it all in. If you do not have hours, then go see the outdoor exhibit (great photo ops), and don't go to the lower level unless you are interested in the very early early history of war in Korea. The first and second levels are devoted to the Korean War."
"nice, when you have enough time","The museum is a bit out of the way, so you need to take the subway and walk a bit. It's nice to see, maybe 30 minutes. But you can't compare it to the WW2 museum in Moscow, by far. I would say there better things to see in Seoul."
Wonderful Museum of the War,"This museum is a real surprise. I wasn't expecting to find so much of interest, but it is a completely absorbing experience, from the tanks and planes outside to the multi-media shows inside. And it is far bigger than most museums of its kind, and really shows how important the war was and still is to the people of both Koreas. There is not too much focus on the military history of the war - despite all the weaponry on display - but a nice sensitivity to the massive social impact that the war continues to have. In that sense, it may be 60 years ago, but it is a real living museum. And it is free!"
Amazing History on S.Korea,"This museum is huge and beautiful. Admission is free. It is a memorial for the fallen soldiers of all the countries, with much focus and thanks to the US, who have helped S. Korea become the nation it is today. Very touching. "
Great museum to see before a visit to the DMZ,"If you wanna learn about Korean history and especially about the recent history, this is the place for you. On the first floor, there is a big exhibition about ancient history and the second floor is dedicated to the Korean war (so if you're in a hurry, you can directly skip to the 2nd floor). A lot of explanations in English and possibility to rent an audioguide as well.The area outside the museum is also impressive : a statue of 2 Koreans (south and north) brothers, flags of all the countries that helped during the war, tanks and planes in the garden (where a lot of flowers bloom in springs). Anyway a nice visit.Practical info : Open from 9am till 6pm, free admission.closed on Monday.Located next to Samgakji station (line number 4 or 6), exit 12. Just 2 stops away from Itaewon or Seoul Station."
excellent,So many weapons are outside of the museum. You could even get in these machine and take some photos.
Go!,"If you want to learn more about the War, this museum is the place to go. Many multi-media presentations. Well marked displays. My kids, 18 and 11 both got something out of it."
Grand and well presented history of korea,The entrance is free. It will take you at least 2 hours to explore the place. I specially liked the airplanes and tanks on display. There is a room filled with candles for the soldiers. It was a dimly lit room with a peaceful and serene ambience. There was english translation . The exhibit were all in pristine condition. The museum was very clean and well kept.
Moving,"We had extra time before our DMZ tour and fortunately, this memorial was about a 10 minute walk. We walked through the memorial and grounds of the nearby history museum. Well worth the extra time."
Great museum,"A great visit for children and adults. Entrance is free. There are 2 parts to the museum. The outdoor area is filled with planes, tanks, and even a model of an actual ship that was attacked by N.Korea in 2002, killing 6 S. Korean navy men. They even recreate the actual bullet holes. Afterwards, you enter an immense modern building with 3 levels covering the war history of Korea from ancient times to the most recent Korean War. There is good english descriptions and the exhibits are supplemented by various short films (some in 3D/4D). While the Korean war was relatively short (3 years), you are able to get the sense of the shock of the surprise attack by the N Koreans, the devastation to the country, and the continuing sense of loss of a country separate into 2. Really excellent and worthwhile to visit. Across from the museum is the main US base in Seoul as well as S. Korean military installations. There is a small neighborhood with restaurants where you can buy korean bbq or spicy stew (ramen noodles with sausage and other extras) favored by their military clientele."
so amazed,"Not a fan of war memorabilia and things related to war of the past.We thought we only needed a couple of hours to visit this place. We were so wrong.When in South Korea, make it a point to visit this wonderful place. Even if you are not fascinated or interested with war, you will appreciate how South Koreans value the people who fought for them during the North/South Korean War. They honor these people with such respect and of high honor that you could feel their gratitude for those who have died for their country.The best advice that I could give you is to allot one whole day in order to appreciate everything that this place could offer.They have tanks, planes, subs, cinemas, memorabilias, and a lot more. The place is so huge that for war enthusiasts, one day may not be enough.Hats off to the South Korean government for establishing this great monument for all to see be and be inspired for the courageousness of people from all over the world."
Very educational,Really enjoyed this - beautiful monuments lots of history. I learned a lot and enjoyed the exhibits. Pretty cool seeing all the old planes and tanks.
Must see,We saw a drill team show when we arrivd outside the Memorial. It was really fun. We thought we would only see a few statues....but the museum is quite large and has an impressive collection of war artifacts and displays about wars from the beginning of time in Korea. We could easily have spent a few hours there ....and I'm not a big war buff.
One pf my favorites,"This is perfect for those who wants to see the true story behind their favorite Korean Asia Novela (Dynasty Genre) or the wars that passed, totally worth it!!, Must Visit!!!"
interactive museum,"This would probably keep children entertained. Interactivity occasionally came at the expense of a clear narrative of the war. However, definitely worth a visit if you have any interest in the history of the Korean war. Do save time for the top floor exhibit on international involvement. "
"Great archives, strong sense of shared sacrifice","The Korean people are resolute in protecting hard won freedom. The comprehensive war memorial and museum provides a sense of their cultural gratitude. The exhibits are displayed with bilingual interpretation and maps of the sprawling complex are available. There is no entry fee so plan to spend either the whole day and take it all in, or just an hour at a time on repeated visits.The UN-supported action of the early 1950's (the one that remains unconcluded to this day) has a memorable contemplation theater where the sacrifices of the many thousands who died in the effort, including my grandfather, are remembered. A large sculpted teardrop hangs from the ceiling and spins in a darkening chamber illuminating some names of the fallen into the space. It can't be captured meaningfully on camera, but has the same ability to speak for the dead that the Vietnam Wall in Washington DC does for those who gave all in that war. My father is among those."
Wow! Definitely Worth The Visit while in Seoul,"This museum truly does an exceptional job of showing all the people of South Korea have been through in their history, as well as highlighting the key role the UN and The USA in particular have had in helping secure their freedom. Be sure to give yourself plenty of time as you will need it to see everything, and you don't want to miss anything. "
A great history,This place marked us to remember about a great history of Korean many years ago. The place with many many exibits and grear stories marking about Korean heroes and great people. A must see place when u visit Seoul.
War memorial,"one of the more impressive memorials/museums i have been to. Generous exhibition of artefacts, planes, tanks, ships etc. from both the Korean war and from the more ancient Korean history. You learn a lot about the relationship between Korea, China and Japan as well as the role Korea plays in international diplomacy today. It is free"
The Best Historical Museum I have been to so far.,"From the little things, i loved how there are guides, like arrows for you to follow so that you won't just randomly go to rooms, and miss some.Admission is free but even if it has a fee, it should have been all worth it! on the other hand though, people wouldn't want to spend on historic museums. But maybe if you have a peak to what's inside first, you would want to spend some wons on it. It was multilevel and contains a lot of things about the war. interactive displays, real memorabilias, 3d and 4d theaters, we loved wasting 3-4 hours on it. Outside the museums were planes, fighter planes, tanks, helicopters, etc used in wars by us, rok and china. lovely just lovely."
Layout and Visual history of the war,Like everything about this place. When you visit this place you will learn what had happened in 1950. 
Great museum,"As an American it was eye-opening to learn so much about the Korean war and particularly, the heavy involvement of the US."
Fascinating insight into the military world of South Korea,"Outside or inside, there is so much to see at the War Memorial of Korea. We visited on a quiet Sunday morning (5th April 2015), strolling between the aircraft bombers and tanks before heading inside to see the exhibitions. The displays were fantastic, very informative with English translations. We could have easily spent hours in there looking at everything."
Excellent and free !,"If you know nothing about Korean tragic history... go and visit this museum.A lot to see inside, with diferent experience to live, cinemas, audio testimonials audio and video, real war machines to see outside the museum...All this for free."
Learn a lot,We went to the War Memorial Museum with a grandson aged 10 and a granddaughter aged 8. They too found it interesting. The displays are excellent. We were lucky to happen upon a military exhibition practicing for an upcoming festival. It was fantastic.The English translations on the explanations of displays were good. Enjoyed everything about this museum.
Definitely worth the time,Really enjoyed this. Great to see the massive bombers and other aircraft. All well presented and well maintained. 
Knowledge about Korean war,"We got to the memorial in morning about 9.30 A.M on the way from metro station we sought few people that seating on the ground with placards near entrance to some military facility ,I spoke with one of women they protested against plans to set missile system in Korea. In museum we have volunteer guide that spoke English, all tour take about 1.5 hour and we sought all phases of Korean war, especially was interesting movie in special theater ,of general Mak Arthur landing from sea at Incheon. There is very huge and impressive exhibition of all kind of weaponry."
Great museum,"This museum is one of the best I've ever seen. Although they should have had a native English speaker check their translations first the displays are top notch. Go on a weekday to avoid the crowds. The planes, artillery, etc set up outside is fun to peak at also. Kids loved that part the most."
Busan Un War graves,Excellent visit with a well presented video and helpful staff. Cleanest toilets I have ever seen!!!!!
Moving Museum Visit,"Spent about 3 hours here. Visiting levels 2 and upwards. The museum is very well laid out, easy to follow arrows, very informative and engaging. Lots of video footage and small cinemas to sit in. Different interactive displays. The subject is a difficult one and has been presented very well. I especially liked the UN room and stories of the different soldiers from around the world who contributed. Outdoor area is also nice to sit on one of the many benches. Would recommend as a must visit to anyone going to Seoul."
one of the best museum,"This is my secound visit and review. We decided to fly back to seoul 2 years later so we can visit this museum again. It's very impressive and informative. Can't believe it's free. Place is huge and lots of visual displays to help you understand. You learn so much about what happened and want to know more. If you're planning to do DMZ tour maybe it's better to visit this museum first. If you're going to Busan you may want to stop at UN Memorial also. If you take subway even you take right exit you might feel lost a little bit because there is no big or good sign to this museum. If you take a local bus it drops you off right in front, but taking local bus is challenging unless you understand korean. City tour bus drops you off right in front also, but expect to spend at least 2-4hours here."
massive memorial/museum,well worth a visit. even just the statues and displays outside are interesting. the museum with several movies gives a good understanding of the war and consequences. it's easy to get to from the subway.
Need to Visit!,"What a great museum to visit! I recommend anyone to drop by at least once when you travel to Seoul/South Korea. The war memorial of Korea has great variety of things to see, which offers something to anyone, even if you're not interested in history and/or museums. The whole experience provided a good overview of war-related Korean history, with lots of visuals and also tangible interactions. At the end of the visit, my wife a not-so-much-into-history person, found it great and loved it that she's learned a thing or two about Korea and its rich history. The kids will love it too, especially the outside park. Check out the photo's I've submitted."
A Must See,Absolutely amazing place. Plan to spend several hours as there is a lot to see. Admission is free but they will take donations. If you get hungary there is a small cafe next to the gift shop.
Impressive,We visited the museum before going to the DMZ. It was a very good introduction to the Korean war. The collections are impressive but there are also a lot of interactive activities which make your visit very lively. 
Free and Informative,"Spend some time here to learn the history of the country. Dress warmly, as the building is unheated. Very good outdoor display of tanks, airplanes, artillery pieces, etc."
Two Great Museums in One...Both Inside and Outside,"The War Memorial of Korea is a great museum and one visit will probably not be enough to see most/all of it. My fiance and I went on a nice autumn day and when we arrived, we discovered that there is an exhibit outside of the museum, displaying old U.S.A., South Korean, North Korean, and Chinese warplanes, tanks, submarines, etc. We walked around that part for about 1-2 hours and then had lunch at the cafeteria next door to the museum. We decided we would check out some of the smaller exhibits and come back in the winter for the much larger the 6.25 War (Korean War) exhibit. It was a good choice because when we visited again a couple months later, we spent a good three hours or so in the 6/25 War exhibit. We didn't know much about the Korean War before entering, but it was very informative and we both left with a much better understanding or the history of the Korean War. I don't usually say this about museums, but I definitely recommend this one and you should consider putting it on your must-do list while visiting Seoul."
Interesting history lesson,My favourite floor was the 2nd floor - alot of information about the korean war and easy to read. There are also videos for you to watch which are very informative. Its fairly cold in this memorial so bring a jacket! The coffee vending machines were very helpful in keeping me warm. 
Quick Course in Korean History,Our volunteer guide was a Korean war veteran who gave us an escorted 1 hour tour of this amazing museum. A must see.
"meaningful, interesting","The displays are interesting- old airplanes, jeeps, limos, weapons etc.- and the descriptions are meaningful."
Fun afternoon out,"We spent about 2 hours here. It was not on our plans, we happened to be passing by and saw it. Really fun with the vehicles outside and then wonderful history lesson inside."
Essential viewing if you're interested in Korean history,"This museum tells the story of the Cold War, focusing on its effects in Korea. Good collection of the military equipment (e.g. planes and tanks) used and donations (e.g. letters). Endless lists of the names of the soldiers killed."
Huge museum with many exhibits and its free,"This is an excellent museum to visit if you like military things and like to learn about Korean history. Entry is free. The memorial gave me a new perspective on who were all involved in the original conflict and also the fact that the war is not actually over yet and its actually on a long cease fire! Outside the memorial is great if you like planes and war ships. For more info and pictures, kindly visit my blog: http://tummyfull.blogspot.com/2015/02/war-memorial-of-korea-seoul.html"
Comprehensive and educational,"Huge museum and entrance is free. I highly recommend that you visit this place. The museum is well designed and the exhibits are interpreted in english. I specially liked the tanks,airplanes,artillery on display. I also the ambience of the room dedicated to the soldiers, the candles gave a serene effect.It is an interesting way of knowing about korean history."
A Firm Favourite in Seoul!,The museum is expansive so you will need several hours to visit here. It's an interesting trip if you're looking to learn more about Korean history and the Korean War.
Not bad,"This museum is kind of old. It covers the ancient periods of Korea's history, and slightly the history of the 20th century. Considering the advanced and contemporary vibe of the city, the museum could have been more new and interactive. I think it has lots of potential but to tell you the truth I got bored a little from the constant reading of the wall posters.Well, it is free at least."
History Buffs will love this Museum,There was a time when US policy makers were afraid of Communism sweeping the world after WW II. This museum helps explain what was going on between two sides Russia and US each wanting the Korean peninsula in their vision. And we see that stark difference between the two Koreas.
Large museum with numerous sights,Provided very interesting insight into history of Korean War. Had a lot of interactive options that made tour engaging. Large display of military equipment. 
Should be included in your list!,"The museum was big and very trendy! There was no entrance fee they even provide brochures and the museum was huge!! It was worth travelling for. They are also helpful, I went to the Van Gogh's Exhibit (which was an exclusive gallery, I paid additional 15,000 won) and my boyfriend and I agreed to meet outside the gallery after an hour. I was lost and there were no means of contacting him since we dont have access to data roaming. I almost cried like a little girl lol but the staff was super friendly! They paged him through the speaker and we met at the lobby. Can be a bit shallow but it was a big deal for me. Thank you so much! :)"
Glimpse into the Past,This was well worth the visit if you like history. I did not realize the lead up to the Korean wars as well as how many soldiers that Korea has sent to other wars since. Very well done. Need at least 2-4 hours to do it justice.
Impressive view of Korea's history of war,"Wow! Very impressive...wish I could have spent more time. I was confused about the name...museum covers all of the wars in Korea from 100BC to the latests in the 1950's. Gives you a good view of the history of the Korean people. The 1950's war, which covers about 1/3 of the museum made me cry! So many countries sent people there to fight for freedom of a people who they did not know, I suspect some of those that died, did not know where Korea even was! This is what made me cry! In Korea, they say Freedom is not Free! These people know! In the three weeks I was in Korea, I had the opportunity to meet many Koreans. So kind and helpful to me. I grew to love them. I asked many of them ""are you afraid of North Korea?""...many said the same basic thing ""no, because they are Koreans""! Wow! This gave me the first hope for a unified Korea I have ever had! What a gift I was given!"
Well worth the visit!,"The War Memorial of Korea covers the entire history of Korean history. The Museum is very large in acreage as full size planes, tanks, rockets, a ship and other Korean, US, Russian and Chinese war vehicles span one side of the Memorial. The statues are reminiscent of Smithsonian type quality of defection of historical events. Plenty for children to see and do! A large children's play area, interactive children opportunities on the grounds and a small cafe to grab a coffee. Beautiful clean building with flags of all participating UN nations welcoming visitors in the front. Once inside you will walk through history from Joseng Dynasty to present day. It took my husband and I approximately 2 hours to leisurely stroll the Memorial. One very touching display at the end worth watching in a small rotunda with a tear shaped object hanging from the center. There was no charge the day we visited. Some areas of the Museum was closed to public for refurbishment."
Fantastic,"Great museum. Plenty of detailed information about Korean history. Very well organised, with English information and free entry. The Memorial Hall is emotive, while the outdoor area has a lot of military vehicles and airplanes (including a B52), and sculptures remembering the foreign countries that helped the country during the Korean War."
Extremely interesting,This museum teaches about the Korean War. It is very well done with creative displays. It takes a few hours to go through all 3 floors. Don't miss the sculptures and exhibits outside including the planes and tanks. Note it is closed on Mondays. Very worthwhile to visit.
Learned a lot of Korean War history ,"The day we went, Friday, admission was free. Not sure if it is everyday. We had limited time and rushed through in one hour. You should really plan to have more time. They have done a very good job setting up rooms and explaining the wars throughout their history. Do not miss the large tear drop at the end of the tour made from hundreds of dog tags from fallen soldiers. Worth the visit. Enjoy!"
Interesting experience,The museum was not on my list of sights for the two days my husband and I had to visit Seoul sights. But we ended up going there and it became a very interesting experience. The outdoor area is huge and if you are interested in aircrafts used during the war this is the place to go. The museum contains a lot of artifacts which makes it more interactive and you get a very good insight into the Korean War. I highly recommend this place.
Great way to kill time,"We had some time to kill and found a fun way to do it. The War Memorial museum is fairly interesting. Gives a ton of information about Korea and dates far back before the North/South Korean War. There's is a bit of information about other country's military as well, if you like that. The museum has a few interactive pieces to keep the little guys busy. We walked around the entire thing and it took us just a little over two hours."
Brilliant and interesting day out,"The War memorial in Seoul is a must visit. It's located really close to Itaewon and you can literally spend the entire day looking around both inside and outside. Go in the good weather so you can get the most out of the day. Also, don't forget to visit the War memorials that countries like Ireland and Canada have erected on the site."
a museum showing the hugeness of war,"Half monument, half museum. This museum is not as hard hitting as some but it is good. Outside are lots of monuments as well as machinery used in the war."
"War, what is it good for?!",A large museum documenting the history of the Korean peninsula. Many interesting memorials around the building.
A playground for military freak,"I could spend hours in this place! Tanks, old aircrafts, rockets, all the military freaks dreamed about. And all provide sufficient information in English.Recommended place to visit."
good place,"It was pretty cool to see this place, you can see lots of war equipment but it's better to go when it's not cold "
Get to know history of Korean war,It tells the history of Korean war and how it develop until today. Good way to learn the war history. Put in lots of multimedia inc theater. 
Worth a visit,Definitely worth your time. It has a lot of static displays outside and the inside offers some much information in a very well laid out building.
Fun & enjoyable learning,"It is one of the best museum i have been visited.they used video, 6d cinema to let visitor learn and understand the history. enjoyable for teenagers. Must visit!"
War Memorial of Korea,Huge place for history fan. You will need at least 2 hours in the museum and another one hour for the displays outside.
Love the study of history!,"Unexpectedly, it was quite fun to wonder around the museum. The history of wars in Korea is interesting, added with touching videos of the armies that survive the war. The decoration outside the museum is well-maintained, with few carvings of the warriors at the wall. And since the admission is free, I think it was a well worth visit ;)"
You must visit,"It was good to know the story of South Korea, and understand the relation with the international comunity and North Korea."
Very interesting,Excellent explanation of the war. Gave me a good insight. Also very well maintained. Well worth a visit. 
Nice place to see! Easy to travel to by train!,Cool man! Worth the trip. Great with friends but they provided a tour guide in Chingu Guesthouse! I liked everything about it!
Tells the story of the Korean War,"They really cover the war...including events leading up to it and it's aftermath. Museum provides local English speaking guides. Ours was a wonderful gentleman who was 6 years old when the war started and experienced it first hand as a child. You can do the museum on your own too, but the local guide really made it for me."
Must See,Loved this. Huge and interesting. My husband went back a second day to cover all the history. Excellent exhibits overall. Enough for a couple of afternoons and a great coffee shop too.
must visit,This memorial was well worth the visit. I learn so much about the war and the lasting effect it had on the nation. Definitely worth visiting (its free) before you take a tour of the DMZ
Really interesting,"Lots to see here, not just on the Korean war of the 50s but tons of other military history too. Some really moving exhibits, well worth a visit."
Worth a visit but not a must for me!,"This visit can be done around 2-3 hours, not a bad place as first activity of the day. Show's lots of history regarding south korea and past famous generals of korea!"
An Absolute Must,"Simply put - this is a must do. Modern Korea was was shaped, and continues to be developed in the manner that it is largely influenced by the Korean War. This place is impressive. Ensure to give yourself several hours (we spent 4 hours there and still felt like we could have gone a little slower). Since my last visit in 2004~2007, the Museum has been revamped and it is awesome! Not sure if we just picked the right day, but the main museum was free entry, but I know it has not always been. I HIGHLY encourage you to visit this museum a day or so before taking a DMZ Tour, it really pulls the whole thing together. - Majority of the displays are in English as well..."
Great,The war memorial should be top of your list when visiting Seoul. Spending a few hours in the museum is easy due to the magnitude of exhibits that was both interesting and informative. The staff are very friendly and happy to answer any questions.
A Must for Visitors,"Free entry to many exhibits. Bits of technology and military memorabilia for everyone as well as tons of older exhibits that give a story to Korea from ages ago as well as their interactions with the world over millennia. There is a lack of English translations and explanations so bring an educated native if you want the full story behind many things in order to enjoy them better. Lots of memorials for and respect paid to veterans of various nations. I also went while the Van Gogh exhibit was being featured. That part was 15,000 won per person but their presentation and creativity in chronicling his life made it totally worth it. "
Great,very informational. My husband is a 3rd generation Korean born in Hawaii. He was very interested in visiting learned a lot
Spectacular,"Very interesting museum to visit during the day, and also free! Lots to see and I really enjoyed the monuments. "
Very Informative,If you are interested in the Korean War the War Memorial has a fantastic museum with signs in English and Korean.
Great experience free of charge,"I visited War Memorial of Korea during my exchange trip. I went there with three friends. We spend over 3 hours in the museum and we ran out of time to see everything. It didn't cost anything and it was easy to get there. There were alot of interesting weapons, war machinery and facts about Korean history. If you are interested in stuff like this, you cannot miss this place while your visiting Seoul."
Surprisingly comprehensive + free + in English ,I wasn't sure what to expect by coming here & ill admit it wasn't on my to do list for Seoul. Not knowing much about the Korean War I did a 2 min scan online to get the basics in case that wasn't covered... i soon discovered my research was totally unnecessary. Across 3 floors and an enormous floorspace the Korean War has its own floor. Work your way through the guides and information. A smartphone QR code audio guide can be downloaded for free. Everything is in korean & english.Spent 2 hours here although a day could easily be spent wandering the floors. Can feel somewhat repetitive in parts.Seemed to be lots of bored school aged children during my visit (school holidays perhaps?).Bring your walking shoes. There are free tours in multiple languages. 
Best museum I've been to,"Clearly one of the best museums I've been to, so many things to see and read. It's also free admission which is great, a must visit if you're in Seoul :) "
Amazing way to spend the Day,Amazing artifacts of the Korean war along with the History of the Korean history dating back thousands of years
See the past to make better future,"You will know the history and much more information about the wars that happened in Korea. You may think it's quite sad, but worth for visit. And you will realized that ""Freedom is NOT FREE"" "
Memorial,"The war memorial has a very big outdoor exhibit area full of planes, helicopters, tanks, artillery & boats. Inside there are several floors of small war memorabilia.Overall it was worth spending a half day viewing it all."
Don't Overlook,"If you're in the area and have some time, this should be on your list. I live and work very close and have been a couple of times - need to go again. As others have said, very nice inside and out. On a nice day you can walk the grounds, enjoy an ice cream, and take in the views. The turtle ship in the lower level is a must see! Although it's always just the wife and I, there are many families there as well. A great stop for everyone."
Amanzing place to learn some History.,I truely enjoyed my first visit to this museum. Its exhibits are exceptional inside and out. It a great way to spend half a day and learn some history at the same time. Plan for atleast 3 hours to see everything. 
War Memorial,"It was nice and well maintained, plus free which was great. I liked seeing all the old artillery and aircrafts. Didn't check out the museum inside but enjoyed touring the grounds outside."
Stunning both inside & out,"With some very thought provoking spaces inside, comprehensive displays & an awesome assortment of military vehicles outside, this place is a must visit for people interested in the history of Korea."
A Reminder,this memorial gives an excellent insight on the history and current state of affairs in Korea. A bit of nationalistic propaganda here and there but it's a chilling reminder of the suffering and brutality of war and what many had to endure.
Hats off to a Korean Soldier,"I visited The War Memorial of Korea yesterday 15th Feb.2015.It is spread over huge open grounds where real old war planes, tanks, missiles naval frigates,boats are displayed from their wars with Communist China and North Korea in 1950's.Each exhibit has a clear plaque explaining the details.There is a separate museum for children. Inside the main three storied big 'Culture Building' there are electronic displays, interactive screens in Korean, English, Chinese and Japanese languages showing war as it happened who fought it and how Korea with big help from USA and other Western Allied forces defeated North Korea in spite of huge backup by China.Outside the building there is a big circular open ground like Vatican in Rome where u can stand in center and see all around.l experienced as in real war."
Great,So much history that is lost on our generation. Its good to go back in time and see what has happened and how our world is shaped due to events of the past. 
plan on at least a half day to get full value,I have toured this museum a couple times and still have not seen everything. English and Korean signs and videos are available at almost every point. You have the opportunity to actually enter and walk through many airplanes out side and the tours inside the building are very impressive. worth a whole day but need at least a half day to see it!
Interesting and friendly,Just a great place to look at this interesting part of Korea's history. Great displays and moving tributes to the fallen
Must-see museum!,"Even if you're not a war history buff, you should see this museum. The grounds alone are worth a visit, and the exhibits inside the museum are well-presented and engaging. When you're done you can hop over to the National Museum or take a stroll through Itaewon for a bite to eat and end up at the Leeum Samsumg musem for a solid day of museum action."
It makes you think,"I was glad I went there even though I am not much for war museums. It was the first time I was close to a B52 having seen them on TV being a part of many wars in my youth. The deploy of all the planes, helicopters, tanks and so on was ok, but I like the huge square the most. Loads of school kids were there during the daytime."
Free entry so make a donation,"This is excellent if you like military things and want to spend a few hours. Entry is free and you do not need to take a tour and spend a lot of money, just walk arround. If you do go make a donation after all it is free. Its a huge building on several floors and otside is huge as well. We would have spent more time outside but it was raining and very cold. Inside there are lots of interactive displays some of which are very good some not so good. Gave me a new perspective on who were all involved in the original conflict and also the fact that the war is inot actually over its in a long cease fire!!! Outside is great if you like planes and there is a large ship with loads of bullet holes in it. We had a good day walking arround."
Great Site,Very humbling to be here. The museum is very well done with lots of options for visitors to interact. The plaza outside is very large. There is a list of all those who died in the war surrounding the plaza.
Impressive Korean War Museum,"Extensive collection of military armament war paraphernalia from the Korean War. Gives tribute to the soldiers from other countries, especially the United States, in the role played in fighting the war. Many models and recorded of that time are displayed and the histories of the major participants are detailed. Worth the visit to see the numerous actual military hardware on display. Entrance is free."
Good place.,War memorial is a big place the exterior seems museum is tood good. The internal muesum seems good not too impressive. Some are good and some are ok. Seems all the meusum in korea the same. Visiting muesums in korea can be done only once and if you see this muesum without seeing any other muesum it is a good place. And if you see this museum. Spending time in seeing other muesums on korean history etc is a waste of time.
Only toured the grounds,Got here early so I didn't get to enter the museum building area. Fantastic display of monuments and military equipment.
Impressive,"Before coming here, I had very little knowledge about the Korean war and its process. Being a Dutch person we mainly treated European history so the Korean war was relatively unknown to me. This war memorial and museum was a great way to learn about this history. Furthermore, the memorial is a beautiful place with impressive war sculptures and the museum has free entrance that stimulates people to take a look and learn more about Korean history."
Enthralled,"Even if you appear on a Monday (closed like most museums) you have all the machinery outside of the museum, that in itself is interesting enough. The sculptures are also powerful and moving, and the sheer number on names on the honour rolls is commands respect. Inside (free admission) is the history of the ROK regarding military conflicts. The lowest floor starts off hundreds of years ago and has some great replicas of the 'turtle' boats. It winds through the years up to the current times which in the end does feel like a recruiting drive. However, the sections on the Korean War are outstanding, with amazing multilingual displays and even two 4D experiences. It is worth listening to the multimedia displays because they are so well done. The recognition of the UN armed forces is was fantastic. It also shares the plight of ordinary Koreans and helps you understand how the current nations have been formed. Even if your not interested in war history, you could still spend an hour here and take something away."
hard to separate fact from fiction,"After the nth battle where a small army of korean peasants defeated a foreign army composed of hundreds of thousands of cruel but well trained soldiers one starts to wonder if this is a history museum or just some fairy tales told to kids to make them like their country.Seriously, the whole museum is like that. All countries do this, but here is probably too blatant... You'll learn something just not sure about what: history or korean views of common stories..."
Must Visit Place..:),This is one of the best place to visit in Seoul. The war room exhibitions are really good to see. At least 3hrs required to visit the place. Just near the Samgakji subway its very easy to locate. The best thing is its totally free of cost to visit the memorial and the exhibitions.
Very well maintained and informative,"The memorial was much bigger than expected, hence allow a good 2 hours to explore. Easy to get to and find as well."
"Japanese bad, Koreans good",A whole floor dedicated to pure propaganda about how bad the Japanese are. Left a sour taste in my mouth. The rest is very kitschy. The outside area is nice with come cool like planes and tanks.
You'll walk away with a better understanding of the Korean culture and people!,"Brilliant museum. I don't know how they provide such a museum for free but it is worth the efforts to go and see it. Allow 3-4 hours to tour the outside grounds of the museum as well as inside. One could easily spend 1-2 hours outside if you read all the information about each plane, weapon, tankers etc... used for the various wars fought in Korea. Inside is very easy to walk through with arrows pointing in the suggested tour route. Several mini documentaries throughout the museum you can sit and watch through as well as and a couple of simulated 4-D shows (very short). Enjoy the cafe at the entrance before or after your tour of the museum. This will truly give you an understanding of the Korean people and how they have evolved into such thriving country."
This is a must see sight visit,This museum is a must see when you come to Seoul. I gained so much knowledge on this visit and to understand the history of Korea and their struggles was humbling.The admission is free but the exhibits are amazing. It is well laid out and there are so many planes and tanks and other military weapons to see. Time well spent.
VERY WELL LAID OUT MUSEUM,"If you don,t know much about the Korean war before you go you certainly will know by the time you leave. Interactive displays, actual footage from the war and informative displays from all participating countries.info on the Australian involvement and commentary from Australians is on level 2.A large array of monuments, planes , tanks, artillery is on the outside.Well worth a visit, don't go on a Monday or some public holidays as its closed, check prior to going."
A must for every tourist,"You find a big Monument at the entrace of the Museum. I would advice to visit the complex on day with good weather conditions (at least no rain), because one part of the exibition is outside.There you can find a lot military Equipment, like planes, helicopters, tanks, guns, artillery, rockets and even boats from different countrys, e. g. China, USA or ROK. It starts with old tanks from the forgotten war, moves to more current objects to the current battle tank from South Korea. When you move inside you are about to explore a lot of awesome Details about the korean history. You see a famous turtle boat or the use of gun powder starting looooong ago :)And of course you will see a lot about the forgotten war in every aspect. The use of multimedia is really awesome and a plus. Let me give you an brilliant example: During the evacuation of refugees at Hŭngnam, they had to cross frozen water to reach the ships. In the musuem, when you move to this Scene, you suddenly hear crushing ice under your feed. With the help of multimedia you see the ice on the floor chrush, while you move. Very impressive and I saw a lot of People looking to the floor a Little bit shocked. Well done :)Another Highlight of the musuem is the officel car of Kim Il Sung, which was found in the USA (I think it was New Jersey) after the war and shipped back to the musuem.You can find a lot of Pictures of my trip to Seoul on the following Facebook Page:https://www.facebook.com/ralphistravelingFeel free to comment.Cheers"
Very informative and best museum in Seoul!,"I loved the exhibits especially the interactive ones. The museum really takes you in depth of the Korean war with weapons, armor, personal accounts and interactive videos etc. Outside is an amazing exhibit of planes, tanks and other vehicles used during the war. Highly recommended."
history,"the entrance is free, the tanks missiles planes and boat outside will be a good place to take picture and kids would like to see real millitary eqipment"
Interesting,Allow at least 2 hours to visit the museum. There is a lot to see and learn! The monuments at the front are amazing. Well maintained and organised.
Excellent Museum,"This is an excellent place to have a good and comprehensive 101 lesson on the Korean War, and is even more educational than the more popular day trips to the DMZ. The exhibits are very well-done, with well-maintained war relics and accompanying summaries/details in English. There's also a couple of 4D theatres inside for a fun and immersive experience for the children.The most ""surprising"" thing of this impressive place? It's free! But for a good few hours well-spent, you could always donate towards the fund for veterans and for running this place (donation boxes available at the front).There's a cafe at the first level serving fairly decent coffee and Belgian waffles. A useful pitstop if you need a break in between visiting the various galleries. If history is your thing (and if you feel you should know more about Korea then just its beauty products and Kpop), do put aside more than 2.5 hours for this place.Travel tip: Take the subway to Samgakji station (Line 4, Exit 12). It's just about 7-9mins walk away."
A great set of aeroplanes,"We went on Monday only to find it is closed then. But it was still fascinating to walk round the outside where you will find a park with a large group of military planes, tanks and assorted hardware. Fascinating to walk round."
comprehensive,"Great place - if you plan to go to the DMZ, do stop by here for a more comprehensive explanation of the war before you go. The compound is large. So plan on spending some time here. "
Feeling of war,"This place really worth 2 hours to spend, there are many vehicles, tank, planes for anyone interest. The documents also very informative."
Great history of Korean War,"Multiple stories of informative information. Easy to get to. Every exhibit was in English making it informative and each display was intricate with tiny details. The military museum with planes, cannons and helicopters was awesome!"
Incredible,I spent 4 of the best hoursi have ever done. It was a wonderful and moving experience not only was it free but I have been to many museum s and this is as good as it gets 
A unique yet sad museum in South Korea,"I visited here in November of 2014 with my class. My Korean students prepared lots of background information about the museum. The outside with all of the planes and vehicles was my favorite part. The exhibits inside were great as well. My favorite was the turtle ship. Since this country is technically at war with North Korea, you really get a sense of the reality of war. I highly recommend visiting this great museum."
Incredible experience!,"This was perhaps the attraction I was most exciting about visiting, given the outdoors military vehicles display. I was not disappointed!The outdoor display showcases some real classic Cold War-era planes and tanks that anyone interest in military history is sure to recognise. There is everything from a B-52 bomber to a classic MiG-17 fighter, a Sherman tank and even a North Korean small speedboat. As fascinating as all that was, it was definitely a different experience to be able to enter and sit in the personnel carriers and getting a feel for what it would be like to travel in one.Once you go inside, none of the excitement and interest built up from the outdoor displays is lost. The different documents in the collection are displayed in interesting ways and the various video installations were extremely informative. There is definitely a wide variety of activities even within the museum proper, you get both the classic museum experience and a more interactive experience. Especially touching was the short '4D' video narrating and narrated by a Korean War Veteran.It was definitely worth the trip and even my girlfriend, who initially was reluctant to go, ended up really enjoying it and found some of the displays and videos quite touching."
Spacious War Memorial with lots in it,Good for an hour's look around and plenty to photograph. Obviously of more interest to those with an interest in the military. Not the easiest place to find.
Surprisingly interesting!,"Very interesting place. Interactive with lots of interesting features inside the museum. There were displays of vehicles, planes, tanks, rockets outside. Spend some time exploring the place. There are cafes and restaurants inside and outside the museum. Don't forget to take photos with the soldiers visiting the place. I'm sure it will be a good memorabilia."
Take your time,"Take your time if you visit this excellent exhibit, eg half a day. We only had 1.5 hours and rushed through half, without watching or reading anything. Nevertheless we're glad to get a sense of what they offered. A huge variety of exhibits including general history of weapons and wars, specifics to the area, details on the Korean War. I don't like glorification of aggression, but this was an interesting look at war and battles for freedom. "
This place is really nice,"I have visited the War Memorial museum in Seoul on several of my visits. It is well put together, and loads to see, plus the price is free. In the warmer months, there are several outside displays of old machinery (tanks, planes, anti-aircraft guns, etc) that are also very nice."
We liked this more than we thought we would,We went mostly in honor of my father who had fought in the Korean War. We were surprised at how engaging this museum is. We liked the exhibitions about Korea as well as those treating the Korean War. The statues and war memorabilia outside are also interesting. My father was touched when we told him about the many Korean soldiers were there visiting the day we were there. Lots of Koreans and tourists patronize this attraction.
Surprisingly good! ,"Worth to go! Even kids will love it. War planes, tanks, boat are on displays both inside and outside of the museum. Need at least a day here if you are a history junkie. "
Emotional entrance,"The rows and rows of the roll call of the dead really is quite an emotional entry point, especially two red poppies in the Australian names, makes it a personal loss. The displays to the side of the actual planes, boats, paraphernalia is excellent. The exhibits are very well presented and flow naturally from point to point, enticing you to just one more display. Loved the peace room."
Great Experience,"If you are visiting Korea, this is a must-see. many of the displays include English descriptions, and the Koreans have done a great job of commemorating their people and their culture. Even if you are not into the war memorabilia on display outside, the history and the stories told inside the museum are very moving. Plan to spend at least a half-day."
Must Visit!,A salut to the Koreans for their pride for their countrymen. I admire them for providing such wonderful site to commemorate their soldiers and heroes. It was actually kind of an emotional experience. Plus there was an area where the Koreans commended the countries who helped them during the Korean war.
Great for kids and sobering for adults,My son loved climbing over the tanks and planes outside the museum. For those of us that are older and more understanding of the meaning of war the museum is a sobering experience. Lots of audiovisual displays.
Must visit in Korea,The guidance around the place by putting arrow marks.English description of everything.This is a must visit if you are interested in Korean history.
One of the best museums I've been to - free 4D experience!,"Let's talk about what's outside the museum first - planes and some exhibits that could entice you even before entering the museum. The museum is divided into timezones or parts that illustrates the Korean war and the narrative is done in such an interactive manner (from the exhibits, to usage of technology). One of the most interesting parts of the museum is their free 4D experience shown every 15-20 minutes at certain parts of the Korean war. Very interesting! I had only 1 hour and 30 minutes to visit the museum since its near closing and wished I had more time to discover the museum!"
Great place to learn some history!,"I am not usually a museum kind of traveler. Having said that, my visit to this museum was really memorable, because I had the chance and the opportunity to learn a lot about the war and the consequences of it.They have really good displays inside that get you easily hooked. I did an English guided tour which I totally recommend. The tour guide was really well educated on the subject and made the whole experience worthwhile (it took about 1 hour and a half to 2 hours approx.).I think that this museum is a must see for everyone. Not only for those who like history, but for everyone visiting Seoul. And again, if you have time, I strongly recommend to do the free guided tour."
very good for those who appreciate history,"very good facilities, not too crowded. comprehensive with multi-media presentations and shows. must see attraction when in seoul"
Cannot miss this if you are a history buff,"If you like history and to find out more about the Korean war, there no better place to go. There are many varied exhibits and multimedia shows. They have spent a lot of money on the displays and in maintaining them. They also have exhibitions on the first level on the ancient history of Korea. I could have spent a whole day here. "
A must-see,"As a military buff, I enjoyed the armored vehicle display, but there is a significant portion of the museum dedicated pre-Korean War history as well. A fantastic museum."
Amazing museum - one of the best I've seen.,"This museum gives a thorough overview and history of all conflicts that Korea has been associated with from early times through to most recent. It does this in a variety of ways from huge statues/sculptors, amazing dioramas, moving multimedia presentations and impressive relics. We spent a few hours there and our 11 year old daughter was interested and engaged the whole time. The further you go into the museum, the more impressive it gets, so if you've only got a couple of hours, breeze through the early sections. Eating choices are quite limited. There's a small cafe upstairs with a lovely outlook and a small cafeteria on ground level near the gift shop but sandwiches had stopped/run out by the time we got down there at about 3pm. But the coffee and the muffin I had there were yummy. Entry was free as were the lockers! Very interesting and impressive. Recommend highly!"
Very well done displays; moving remembrance,"This is a ""must see"" for visitors to Seoul. It explains much of the Korean history and events that shaped modern South Korea. Several new exhibits and completed renovations since my last visit. There is a large section just on allied military participation in the Korean war including some very moving displays. Another section specializes in the Vietnam War, with many detailed dioramas. Along two very long outside covered corridors are the names of soldiers who died in the Korean War, including a large section for american soldiers, listed by state. The overall structure and surrounding monuments are quite impressive. The museum/memorial also includes very interesting contemporary military equipment and events. Ancient Korean military history is in the basement/bottom floor. As with the other national museums, there is no entry fee."
Absolutely worth the time,I have been to The Korean Peninsula countless times from being stationed in Japan for 5 years with the Navy. This place most certainly delivers living history lesson that gives you a sense of respect but a sense of deep sadness. I don't like sad things but sometimes you have to see things like this to remember the seriousness of war. A must see if you're in Seoul.
Very interesting ,This place is very interesting if you want to get to know more about the Korean War! It has a nice exhibition and everything is well documented! On the outside you find some airplanes and old war machines! 
A very informative and interesting museum,"This is a very unique museum, with an impressive collection of war machines and weapons. It was not crowded at all, when we visited it (at 11am). I must have missed some sections of the museum as I could not find some of the artifacts pictured in TA. We learned a lot more about the Korean War, during our visit. As commented by various readers, this is a very fun museum for children, because you can really view the tanks, planes, rockets etc up close, and even board some of them."
A good museum to spend some hours,"The War Memorial of Korea is a nice visit to spend some hours, even thou I am not so found of war ect. Went there with my two kids and we all enjoy it. It it free and got much to show the history of Korea. Indoor it got three flats with history way back in time and outside there were airplanes, tanks ect from the war between north and south.There is also a children museum we did not enter, we had to wait for more than an our to go there because they let you in as a group. However, outside the children museum there is a playground where the kids could spend some time too."
"This is a ""Must Go""",This is a must go to know more about the history. Try to make appointment with the english speaking volunteer guide. One session is 1.5hr.
Best Museum in the world,"This is a must visit attraction in Seoul, in the way to N Seoul Tower.The memorial is huge, in the outside are, you will find tanks, airplanes, rockets and vessels from the Korean War (1950). The indoors is gigantic and you will need around 3 hours to see everything from the inside.Free entry, over thousands and thousands of war reliquary from all centuries, with a focus on the Korean War and how it changed the country forever.Simple amazing."
A must to visit,Must be the best museum I've ever visited. It told a story and gave all the answers. It was very spacious and so much to see. Great also for kids as it showed the history of their nation.
Impressive,"It is a great part of the Korean history and lots of information is compiled at the place about the wars that the country has seem over the ages. The displays include information, artifacts and exhibits on historical milestones and weapons and its evolutionary stages as well. It is an acquired taste for one to be interested in the artillery exhibit but the information on the Korean war makes it a worthy visit"
Very educational ,"I didn't know much about the Korean War before coming here, I only had a little time so didn't see much because it is so big, I learned so much and am really glad I went. If you are interested in learning more or even curious about it definitely go, it's free and worth a look! "
Impressive Display,"I did not have enough time in this museum as I went there really late, however in the short time I was there I was impressed. They displayed so many models of tanks, war ships, guns and ammo, it kind of put me in awe. Being a girl I was never much into these, so I had limited knowledge of the items displayed, but they had information pasted there in English which helped a lot.I would visit this place again to get my fill of it, but the hour I spent here was enough to impress me."
A must go!,"This museum and memorial is a must to visit when you are in Seoul. It tells a lot about the insanity of the Korean war as well the history of all the small empires what Korea used to be in the past. The rememberance alley's with allnames of the fallen soldiers are quite impressive. It is a war what is quite forgotten here in Europe, but the people who have given their lives for a free Korea hare honoured and remembered by the Koreans in style and dignity."
A great museum (and totally free),"This is a great museum that deals with the history of war in Korea - from ancient times to modern conflicts.The museum resides in a huge and beautiful building, surrounded by ponds and trees. Outside the museum there is a display of battle ships, airplanes and several beautiful monuments, but it's the museum itself that really shines.The museum is divided into several sections on a couple of floors, and you are advised to follow the directions according to the brochure, as it is easy to get lost in the huge building.It includes thousands of exhibits - pictures, photos, models, artillery, uniforms etc. .Some of the exhibits are interactive, which makes them even more effective.A special part of the museum is dedicated to the ongoing war with North Korea, which is very interesting (and heartbreaking too, actually).The museum is free of charge, which is pretty amazing, since it goes to show just how much respect the South Korean government pays to the ones who lost their lives in the battle for freedom.You need at least 2-3 hours to explore this wonderful museum.Do try to plan a happy itinerary following the visit to the museum, since its atmosphere is quite gloomy.Not to be missed. Easily the number one attraction in Seoul."
I'm certain you'll enjoy this museum...,"I've been to other War Memorials, but this is more like a museum with some very impressive displays. It is an extensive attraction that also teaches about the history of the war along with the sacrifices of other nations. l practically saw and read every display because it all seemed significant in one way or another. Plan on spending a good half day there in order to take it all in..."
The war is not over yet,"Three floors, two of which were devoted to the Korean war, tell you a lot about the background to many people's thinking in Korea. There are basically battle by battle maps, memorabilia, analysis, personal histories and film clips. The below ground floor covers Korean military history up to WWII, which is also quite interesting, especially the large scale models of the ""Turtle ship"" an early iron-clad. The top floor has exhibits on Vietnam, Korean participation in UN peacekeeping and the modern ROK army. You can get through this in a couple of hours, but if at all interested in Korean history, plan a day trip."
"War Memorial and Museum of Korea - planes, tanks, guns, heroes","On the pedestal are two soldiers reaching to embrace each other. They are brothers divided by the war who by chance meet on the battlefield. One represents a South Korean soldier and the other is a North Korean soldier. It is still hopeful that one day Korea will be reunited.Other displays include tanks and field artillery pieces used by South Korea and her allies from the West who came to her defense in the 1950-53 war, as well as tanks and other weapons supplied by China and Russia to North Korea's war effort. The aviation section has a couple of planes that allow visitors access to their cargo holds, as well as the planes that the South Korean Air Force has used throughout its history. Inside the museum itself is the military history of the Korean peninsula, and includes a section devoted to General-Admiral Yi Sun-shin, hero of the Imjin War / Hideoshi Invasion of 1592-1599. A mockup of one of the ""turtleboat"" battleships used by Adm. Yi is on display, as well.If you visit, come expecting to be here a while. There is a lot to see and to experience."
Great place for Kids (Fun and learning),"We spent a whole day here, exploring the outdoor exhibits before going indoors to learn about the history of the Korean War. A must if you want to understand how the South Koreans feel about many things and how their current mindset came to be so."
"War Museum with large tanker,plane and ship in there.",An interesting war museum with lot of armor equipment in there free entrance if you take Seoul city bus will take u there just across the street.
Must see if you like history or military,"Learned a lot from this visit. Great displays, 4D theatre room where they dropped the temp, blew snow flakes around you and ran a 3D movie about the brutal winter fighting. Worth it just for that. Outdoors is massive with collection of equipment and even a ship you can climb around on thats all shot up from battle. Huge indoors with state of the art displays and multi-lingual media. Take a few hours to enjoy. "
"More than war...history, culture, and 5000 years on the peninsula!",World class. A must while in Korea. Something for all ages and interests. No cover charge. Spend a few hours or an entire day! Very close to the subway. Enjoy!
Understanding Korean history,This place would be a great start gor 1st day trip to korea as it will help you understand the history before you move on to other modern parts of korea. Admission is free. Opens till 6pm. Very beautiful sunset view
best war museum ive seen so far with so many vehicles,one of the best war museums ive seen so far biigger than the war museums in vietnam ... has a large collection of vehicles weapons and other displays... i could spend the whole day here it was heartwarming to see a place in the exhibit for many of the participating countries of the korean war
Excellent!,"Very nice displays with vehicles, aircraft, ships and artillery guns on display outside. Sadley we went on Monday so the museum was closed."
War memorial ,"As you plan to visit seoul the very nice city and you plan to see the attraction point there , here it is , the war memorial is one of the site that you must see in seoul , you can get there and actually visit 2 site at the same time ; the war memorial Is directly next to the seoul national meousem, after nice round in the meousem ( very big and you need full day to cover all ) after that you can visit the war memorial it's only waking distance in the same area of the meousem , both entrance are free of charge as you don't need to pay anything there is also nice meousem park that you can visit when you are in that area ,You can reach there by different way , if you are using city tour then this is one of the bus stop and if you prefer to see sight by yourself it also very easy access place by using the subway as meousem is having subway station Hope you enjoy the place , and prefer time to visit is in the early morning so you can see all place in one day and if you use the city tours bus keep it till the end and stay there as much as u want other ways if u start with that then you can't see anything else during that day"
Helps one understand more of Korea's long history,"The museum covers a lot of ground over many centuries of military conflict in the peninsula. It flows pretty well from the main entryway down to the lower level then guiding you all the way back up to the third floor if you have the time and patience for it. It would have been nice to have a bit more English explanations for individual displays of objects, as English translation was typically only provided for the overall gallery or a specific event. "
A Must See!,"This would rank among one of the most comprehensive war museums in the world. Plenty of preserved tanks, aircraft and even a patrol boat are on exhibition outside the very imposing building. Included is one of only two B52 bombers in a museum outside of the USA (the other one is in Darwin). Inside are some fabulously presented exhibition halls dedicated to remembering those who gave their lives fighting for Korea. The columns of names of the fallen are a very sobering experience. If you are visiting Seoul, set at least a half day (full day would be better) to have a look at the War Memorial of Korea. It's unforgettable. "
Powerful and Informative,"The memorial is a tribute to two large areas of Korean war history, namely one for a history of wars throughout Korea's history, and another that focused specifically on the Korean War. This is what I went to the memorial to see, and I was very impressed. If one takes the time to move slowly through the memorial and read, there is so much that can be learned. My knowledge and appreciation for the Korean effort was greatly enhanced by this experience. In addition, there are plenty of artifacts, documents, shows and an outside area displaying airplanes and tanks used during wars not limited to the Korean War. I give this attraction a massive thumbs up for anyone, not just history and war buffs."
This is a must do,"The museum has a large display of aircraft, tanks, weapons and a large patrol boat outside that can be seen at any time. The museum is closed on Mondays.As the museum name states it is a war memorial and as such it covers the Korean War extensively, it gives a comprehensive history of the war and older wars Korea has fought over the centuries.If you have been on a DMZ tour you need to go to the museum and vice versus."
Well worth the visit and the price was right!,"This was not highly recommended in the research that I had done prior to coming to Seoul. I am still not sure why. Thankfully two different people had mentioned it to me and I stopped on a rainy day. I would recommend this on any day. Outside there were planes, tanks and other military vehicles. Inside there are lots of exhibits written in Korean and English. Well worth the price - free."
What to and not to expect at the museum.,"Don't expect much in terms of artifacts and original pieces in this museum. As one reviewer before me comments, it does seem somewhat empty especially in comparison to its size. I also doubt, though may be wrong, the authenticity of many items on display. I wish items had been more clearly labelled as replicated or original. Instead, here is what you SHOULD expect. The square in front of the building and the outdoor monuments are humbling yet impressive. There are commemorative plaques bearing the names of the soldiers from Korea and other nations who died protecting the country. The building itself and the grand rooms inside are spacious and quite beautiful. There are many installation/video displays that help convey bits and pieces of Korea's long history. Towards the end of the museum (if you follow the suggested walking tour), there is a gallery for donated articles and I found this to be the most fascinating, of course, because if the authenticity of the items on display. This room is worth seeing. Overall, I truly enjoyed my time at this museum and only advise that tourists wanting to visit remember that it is a museum to educate, commemorate and remember."
Great for all ages,"If you have men or boys in your party, they will love this! Lots of battles scenes, tanks, airplanes, and weapons. And not replicas, the real thing! Very well organized and puts the Korean War in context. "
Korean History,Very good history of Korea and static exhibits. You can get plenty of walking excersise and there is a small gift shop and cafe. The location is close to other museums and local sights as well as restaurants and shopping.
Spend days here!,"I have visited the museum twice and still, I did not manage to get past the Korean War exhibition. I've spend 5 hours there in total, and there are still a lot of other exhibitions that I have not seen. And it is all free! Definitely a Must-see!"
A good history lesson experience,"I have always been a fan of History subject, so a visit to this attraction is definitely 1 of my checklist. The War Memorial not only narrates the North-South Korean War, but traces way back to the Korean Three Kingdoms. As you walk around inside of the building, take some time to study the flow of history timeline. Tips: Choose a weekday if and non peak hour if you wish to avoid large tour crowdsExtras: If you are lucky, you may be able to catch military personnel practicing their drills in the square!"
Rather empty,Not what I was looking for. It was quite empty. They tried tried to make it with style but I did not understand how this could help me remember the war.
Good for a visit,"Easily located in Samgakchi, this is good for a short visit. The outdoor exhibits are as good as the inside!"
Excellent,This place is huge and not just about the Korean war but about the history of Korea. It's had to put into words the size and amount of information there. What is funny is victory write the history and the US is less than a foot note in the Memorial. All us equipment but no :American looking people.
Massive display of Korean War History and Relic,"Do you know that Korean war never stop since it start in 1950's? They are in ceasefire situation right now,, This place offered massive display of Korean war story and relic. The area was so big. Front of museum full of big statue and diorama about the war. Inside, display of many heroes statue, pictures, diorama. Also background story of it. Of course from the side of southkorea story teller. It must been a visit here."
Very educational! Learn more about the history of Korea here!,We stopped by this place before we went to JSA. Walking through the hallway w/ the names of the people killed during the Korean War is quite a solemn experience. It makes you wonder why the war even had to start. The impressive thing about this museum is that you learn so much through the interactive simulations and computers around each section. Quite an interesting experience! Definitely going to start reading more about the Korean War soon!
awesome,I visited the museum on my birthday with my son. It was so interesting. It was free and every exhibit was excellent. It really gave you a sense of the history of the country. 
"Massive, and massively impressive","This place is an absolute must-see for any resident or visitor in Seoul. It is vast, brilliantly put together, and, in some places, very moving. There has been a big revamp in the last year or so, and 99% of the changes have been improvements, but I wish they hadnt so hugely reduced the section on refugee life."
Perfect Place to Know Korea's history,You must allocate a whole day to appreciate all that this place has to show.The place is most ideal to know the background of why things are in Korea. The place showcases all history and armory from the 13th century to to the current modern pieces
War memorial of Korea,Opened my eyes to some of the recent history and culture of South Korea. Well laid out and interesting.
interesting!,"a lot of exponats you can go up and touch, history of korean weapon in on building, huge boats, tanks, air planes! "
A must for boys,"Ample exhibits, both outdoors and indoors to keep the kids occupied. There's even a bullet ridden ship and B52 on site."
good museum,this museum is a must visit in seoul. they have great collection for history lesson. bring your children here too. they will learn a lot 
Simply Amazing,"This attraction is a MUST see, its is simply awesome, the displays are incredible and so well done. So much to see so I recommend having the time to explore, its free which is a bonus as there's not much free in this world anymore!"
Must visit for those like military history,"By the way,visit this place only if you interested in Korean War (which i'm) and it will be an interesting experience.What you read in book or watch from the documentary regarding the Korean War is totally different when you visit this place.You can feel the pain of the war and the desire for unification.For those who have no idea at all regarding the Korean War, this is still a worthy place to visit since is free :D"
Must visit!,Very eye opening. While understandiblyh somber it helps you remember that freedom is never free and it helps you remember the work and sacrifice of those now long gone.
"Not bad, but no where near the number one attraction in Seoul","I've been to this museum 5 times over 15 years. It is not that good. If you are an English speaker, and I'm guessing you are because you are on this website, the translations are not good enough to keep your interest. This place was great 15 years ago before the National Museum of Korea was built. Now, its a second rate military history museum."
Really Cool,You must have to go there if you are in Seoul! One of the best museums I have been! There are two 4D cinema inside and it is free admission fee.
A must see if you are of Korean and American descent,I have been in Korea for 3 years now and this was my first time coming here. The War Memorial brought upon sadness and pride at the same time. Knowing what my ancestors had to endure during the Korean War made me appreciate their sacrifice as a Korean American. Every Korean and American that lives in Korea or visits should visit the memorial to understand the Korean War. I thank all those that fought in this war against a tyrant country and their allies. For they made the ultimate sacrifice to allow South Korea to blossom into the successful country it is today. 
"Yes awesome, kids love it",Kids love this place and it's open free to public. My 2 sons 3 and 6 were both very excited about the war planes and tanks and all...overall a fantastic place to visit for family with young kids.
Every Visitor to Korea should stop here.,"Even if it is 15-30 minutes. This is such an impressive Memorial. I could easily spend 2-3 hours there and not see it all. But as an American, it makes me proud."
Awsome war musesum full of war planes canons and missiles,A big B-52 bomber along eith many other fighter jets or propeller driven planes used during the war. Many big caliber howitzer guns. Hawk missiles. Inside the enormous building one can find interesting arms used through out Korea's long history of armed struggles against many ennemies.
Fun!,"I love reading history, so it's no surprise I went to this museum. What I really enjoyed were the 4D cinemas! Yes! 4D! The gentleman at the 4D simulator was really nice, and spoke English which was a plus. He invited me to join the ride and it was really good!The replicas of the warship and planes outside the memorial are not to be missed as well."
Extremely interesting and interactive,"The War Memorial of Korea is definitely the most interesting museum in Seoul. It is well presented and efficiently organised.The various rooms guide the visitors through a very interactive experience of the tragedy of the Korean War. Photographies, original documents, reconstructions and exhibitions of weapons represents the keys to the success of this museum. Hosted inside a brilliant architecture and with plenty of available space, this museum ensures that all visitors learn about the causes, events and consequences of the Korean War. A fantastic learning experience!"
Impressive,"I was not sure what to expect when visited the War Memorial. As an American, whenever you go to a place like this you can feel either really proud, or really guilty. Well, this one made me feel good. Excellent display of history"
World's best presented museum,"Not just another museum, quite possibly the most interesting and informative museum I have ever been to! It is so interactive and well done that you can't help but be impressed. The statues outside are beautiful and the museum itself is informative and leaving you wanting to learn more about the colorful South Korean history. A true must!"
Very cool stuff,"Very impressive collection of war memorabilia; gives you a glimpse to the Korean war. Actual airplanes, tanks, missiles, choppers, and a huge ship are all outside the main building, while inside are arms, uniforms, and other war artifacts"
Impressing,"Very interesting place, outside the building there is quite a lot of military equipment, tanks, cannons, planes helicopters, guns, ship from both North and South Korea as well as USA. It could only be placed on a larger area, now it is too crowded. The most impressing is B52 plane. Internal exhibition is also very interesting, even for foreigners there is information in English . There are some sections where you can watch short movies, as well as interactive screens displaying additional information.You can get quite some knowledge about history of Korean wars."
Great interactive history exhibits,Don't miss this slice of insight into the Korean War and Korean history. The volunteer took extra time with us and answer our questions as well as explained a Korean view of history. Great fun!
Freedom came with a price,A must-see place. It stirs great emotion and helps one to come to appreciate the sacrifice and bravery of many men and women fighting for freedom of people in South Korea. 
History lover paradise,"With a lot of history and a lot of pictures and models. There are tanks, planes, war ship outside for the people to see. The museum has a lot of history, pictures, models and a great education for the students. I love this museum."
No entrance fee 😄 !!,"It's a huge place/building with lots of great collections in and out...a very interesting and really nice way to learn Korean history. I admire how Koreans value their own...and how they are so proud of it. Their kindness and hospitality are worth mentioning. I loved the park right outside the museum/building.... clean, nice weather, fresh air, safe, and cute locals. "
Interesting but hectic!,So much to see as its on such a large scale!! If you're into hectic war history then it's the place to be! Rather amusing to walk out the front and be asked to take photo's with Korean soliders haha :) 
"If you visit ONE thing in Korea, this is it!","The Korea War Memorial is an enormous place with a large War Museum built around it. Pros: 1. If you are at all interested in the Korean War or how it led to modern South Korea, this is the ONE place you should visit. There is a fascinating audio-visual exhibition on the Korean War just inside the main building on the left. And simply put: It will explain EVERYTHING you could possibly want to know about the Korean War. You'll understand:How it came to happenWhat happenedAnd from first principles, you'll understand very clearly how this has led to the modern South Korea of todayFurthermore, by understanding the background, you'll understand very clearly the current context behind the North-South Korean situation. And possibly it's future ramifications.2. There is a wonderful outdoor exhibition as well demonstrating US and Ex-USSR and Chinese military hardware from the mid 1940s onwards. If you can think of a tank, missile, helicopter, aircraft, anti-aircraft gun, it's probably here. This is probably the SINGLE and most COMPREHENSIVE collection of post-world war 2 hardware in Asia. In my humble opinion, the only place you're going to find better is probably the Smithsonian (Washington DC, USA) or the Imperial War Museum (London and Duxford, Cambridgeshire, England). 3. If you are interested in middle-ages Korea, the basement is quite interesting. There is a lovely replica of a Turtle Ship (Geobukseon) in the basement. Worth visiting. Cons:1. You need to walk a little bit to get to the museum. It took me about 5-10 minutes to find it. The nearest subway station is Samgakji or Namyeong Stations. 2. The military hardware is outdoors. It started raining when I visited. Thus I suggest you bring an umbrella or appropriate waterproof/outdoor clothes if you intend to spend much time looking at the outdoors military collection. In summary. The War Memorial of Korea is probably the BEST War Museum in the whole of Asia. You will not find a larger or better collection of military hardware in Asia. To find better, you'll have to go to Washington DC in the USA or Duxford, Cambridgeshire, England. I spent 3 hours at the Korean War Memorial. And only saw 25-30% of the exhibits on offer. This place is VAST. You could easily spend the whole day here. To conclude, if you are a family. And you have a boy in your group below the age of 21. Just GO TO THE WAR MEMORIAL of Korea. Your son will have more fun that the REST of your trip to Korea put together."
Surprisingly Good,"Exhibits on the Korean war are presented in chronological order and easy to follow. Additionally, there are 3 3D indoor exhibits, a shooting experience thingy, and outdoor exhibits. There is a reason why this is rated #1 on tripadvisor, and I spent 2.5hours touring, more time than expected."
Best museum over seen,All the use of high-tec makes this an experience for all ages. Takes a whole day to see everything. Also much displayed outside
A touching memorial in the heart of Seoul.,"My grandfather fought in the Korean War so when I was visiting the Korean War memorial - I was not sure what to expect. However, the memorial celebrates all coun tries and soldies who fought in the war and beautifully describes the relationships between the countries. Though the Korean War was a horrible war, as they all are, it was wonderful to see it in a beautiful way the memorial has it. "
"Overwhelming, but with a lot of good elements","Mostly of course this is a propaganda building explaining that the Korean War was fought to preserve ""democracy"" (which certainly S. Korea is now, but in 1950? not so much), and ""freedom"". But the museum also has other elements that might appeal to a wider audience: there's an amazing set of planes and other military materiel outside (I didn't realize supersonic planes got that small!), and in the basement, there's a rocket-launcher...for arrows. It's pretty awesome.Oddly, there's also a wedding hall. Yeah."
A Must Place to Visit,"Whether you are a history buff or not, visit this place to learn about this beautiful country and how it pulled itself into a very progressive country as it is today. The statues at front are grandiose, the exhibits inside compelling and the various aircrafts and tanks on the right are entertaining. They even allow you to climb the aircrafts. Spend enough time here to learn history. "
why must be first attraction ?,"First attraction in Seoul must be more interesting than this , just few monument and some war tanks and airplane is not so interesting to skip other attraction , obviously everybody have one war museum in their country which got same things like gun and tank . Don't spent your time seeing human killing machines . "
Surprise gem,"My family visited Seoul in late Oct 2014. We told our private tour specialist to skip all historical museum as we are not interested in history (esp my 2 young children). On our last day tour, our TS suggest this place as it's very near to our hotel and highly recommended it (he cited real military units which my children maybe interested and also a good place to take photos). In the end we are convinced and the trip turns out to become of our most enjoyable tour in Seoul.Before the trip we do not know much about the country (it was our first trip to Seoul Korea) so we know nothing about its civil war with North Korea. The interest was raised by an introduction video on how the war was started and my family started to get interested to find out more. We ended the tour by taking many photos inside the museum as well as outside the museum with all the displayed military units. We had a great time there leaving the place with a better understanding of SK/NK war.Thanks to our TS (Jay Lee from ThisIsKorea private tour) for recommending this place and share with us the locals' feeling and emotions towards the war and current status. Highly recommended!"
Amazing exhibit,"Outdoors there are planes, submarines, tanks, and boats from past wars. You can climb on some to view interiors. Inside there are both exhibits and explanations of the many wars of Korean history. I'm usually not a big fan of this sort of thing but I found the museum very interesting. "
very informative,"My friends and i spent quite some time at there. We had a guided tour and there are 3D shows, models and videos around to engage us in the history of the war. Got some goosebumps in some of the sections about the friends, love, brotherhood bonded and displayed through materials from the past. Nice place to visit. "
Moving and educational - must visit!,"This is the best museum in Korea - very interesting to learn about the Korean war and the strategy but laid out in an easy to understand way. It also shares a very human look at the Korean people and how the war impacted their country and lives. You can easily spend hours at the museum, it's massive, so if you're looking for something to keep you busy, this place will not disappoint. Found this much more interesting than the National Museum a couple blocks away and the Folk Museum at the Gyeongbokgung Palace."
Stunning and moving,"The neighborhood itself is very nice, in between tall buildings and Namsan mountain. The sheer size of the Memorial is impressive and he garden has a nice exhibit of real rockets, military aircraft and tanks. But, the inside of the museum is absolutely exceptional. Military history enthusiastic will find an awful lot of ""toys"" to enjoy, and the museum also does a great job of telling a story about the Korean people and its hardships (very moving). Most of the exhibits are very modern (with many videos and interactive simulations), and most of the content is translated in English. I visited the museum in about 3 hours, but I hurried my way through it. Someone truly passionate about Korean history could easily spend a day there without feeling bored. Plus, it's free!"
A must do while in Seoul,"The War Memorial is both informational and entertaining. It includes a couple 4D movies and exhibits in English and several other languages. It will take a couple hours at least to see it all, but it is well worth the time and its free. Good for all the family."
Have to see,Go in connection with the DMZ tour in the afternoon from the USO base. Also there are some nice outdoor kitchen restaurant just around the corner from the museum.
Truly a sight to visit!!!!,"Well, what can you say about a war memorial? When in South Korea this should be on your list of to do things. We saw it and it puts many thoughts in your mind......Sad...but worth seeing"
Recommend for a reason,"The building and layout are well done. The free English tour was spot on. As I saw on another post, a visit tot he War Memorial before a DMZ tour is helpful."
Great display of war machines,"They have really good collection of old war machines, if you're interested in those. A good place to understand a little history."
Weirdly interesting,"Very interesting, some very sad parts and other parts of just loads of information to take in. Found it odd being around aircraft and weaponry that was used in war and seeing how it was used. Did love the ""stand here"" spots for best photos."
Great educational experience.,My dad served in the Korean War and never talked about it. What little he did I found confirmed by the wonderful exhibits. I didn't know so many countries were represented in the conflict. Very thorough and complete museum of the countries war history.
This place is huge!,"Wow, this place is HUGE! My husband and I spent almost half the day roaming around the various exhibits and taking pictures. The great thing about this museum is that its an excellent educational experience thats totally free - you heard it, you dont pay to get in. The museum is very well kept and you can learn a lot about, not only the Korean War, but also the military history of Korea. Dont forget to venture outside to see all of the amazing planes, ships, and tanks that they have on display!"
Save this for a rainy day...,"I can testify that in line with most other reviews on this, this place is interesting and worth visiting. It is probably built to remind the ordinary South Koreans of the need to defend themselves against the North ... By reminding them of what happened in the past..."
Excellent educational experience,"First of all, it's free to visit, and it is very well designed and organized. You can learn more about the Korean war and highly recommend it for students and children.It's modern graphic design and well curated displays are easy to view and overall an amazing educational experience."
A absolute Must Go,"It is free, it is big and it is a great place for both adults and children.And it is easy to get to by Metro."
Stunning review of a nation's history,Loved the statues and the Korean War gallery as it told the complete history of the conflict. Teenagers enjoyed the chance to clamber of the military vehicles and planes.
Good place to visit,It shows what happened 60 years ago in Korean. Which reflects current conflict.It was memorable experience
A large and interesting museum.,"This museum documents the many attacks on Korea by Mongols, Chinese among others. Upstairs are exhibits giving a detailed description of the Korean War. Try to catch the military band and marching parade on Fridays at 2pm. This is an awesome display of military precision."
My Favorite Museum in Seoul,"This museum takes a look at the Korean War from a Korean perspective but I found it a lot more unbiased than the Vietnam War Remnants Museum in Ho Chi Minh. It has a lot of interactive screens that you can touch and really get an entertaining and educational experience. When my brother from L.A. came to visit me in Seoul, he loved it as well. You can also see a lot of actual vehicles outside the museum such as tanks, missiles, planes, warships, etc. The best thing about this museum is that it's free. It's also not far from Itaewon if you want to get a bite to eat afterwards."
A must for visitors,A really good museum to help understand the Korean War and its impact on a people and many nations. I appreciated the displays and commemorations from the Korean people
World Class Museum,"This is a great museum with excellent displays walking you through the war history of Korea. They have many interactive exhibits. The museum offers a free smart phone app which allows you to scan a QR box at each exhibit, then listen to the audio explanation in a variety of languages. Lots of actual vehicles, weapons, planes, ships, tanks, etc on display. Plan on a half day minimum. Toss-up between weekends and week days. We went mid-week and there were a lot of school children visiting. Free admission"
Something for everyone....,"I enjoy photos, my wife loves Museums. This hit both spots. Outside are extensive memorabilia (tanks, planes etc.) and lovely, tasteful memorials to the dead. It is very photogenic. Inside is a huge multi-level museum( all free) often with areas for children. It has info. in English too! Well worth a trip.."
Interesting,"Visited okt 2014, pretty interresting. My friend and I especially liked the outside of the museum with the tanks/planes. Inside was pretty decent with items througout the history. Recommended visit for anyone interested in (war)history. "
Must visit before the DMZ/JSA Tour,"I knew very little about the history of Korea before coming here; I knew about the conflict between the two Koreas but didn't really know how/when it started. The DMZ tour did educate us tourists about the history and this War Memorial completed the whole experience. It really moved me - almost got teary eyed while watching snippets of video during the war and photos of kids crying. It's a great way to pay respect and honour these brave soldiers who helped South Korea against the North. It also has the replica display of the soldiers' uniform and some of the weapons they used during the war as well as the tanks, helicopters, amongst others.It's free admission so nothing to lose but much knowledge and experience to gain. Just take the train and get off at Samkagji station and take exit 12 - go straight and then turn left when you see the arrow sign that says""To Memorial"""
An Eye Opener!,"This is a very large facility and it could take days to see everything. It was amazing in that it provided thanks and information to the 21 countries who contributed to helping South Korea in the Korean conflict (as an Australian I learnt much about Australia's role that I did not know or properly appreciate) whilst also telling the story for Koreans that helps to underpin the nation's culture and its approach to living with their Northern neighbour.The Museum also has a large number of planes, boats, tanks and other war implements to view. My regret was that I left it until after a visit to the DMZ. If I had visiting the Museum first it would have added significant perspective to the DMZ visit."
A beautiful facility for remembering the Korean War,"The South Koreans have built a large facility in remembrance of the thousands of people who fought and died during the Korean War. The names of the dead from the 21 UN allied countries who assisted Korea in remaining free are inscribed on bronze plaques along one long wall of the interior atrium of the facility. Names are listed by country and by province or state within each country so that one might locate the following comrad. The displays inside the memorial are beautifully done and very descriptive and there are a number of static displays of tanks, aircraft and other wartime vehicles outside. Well worth a stop for any Korean War vet"
Well-done memorial,Helps to put the Korean war into context and to maybe understand a little deeper what the war meant to the country.
A must-see,"This place is incredible. If are interested in war history leave yourself up to 2 days to fully explore. If not, at least 3 hours! This was definitely the most fascinating museum in Seoul!"
A Must visit in Seoul,"As we were travelling with a kid, was not sure if this was the Place to see. But even our kid enjoyed a lot. The aeroplanes and the other war relics outside were nice for adults too. The war story is told in a great way inside museum, you live through those days. A must see in Seoul"
Must see to understand modern Korea. Highly recommended BEFORE doing a DMZ tour.,"the name is a bit misleading, as this is a full fledged historical museum with emphasis on 20th century and the North Korea-South Korea conflict. It's very informative, with a very modern presentation, and conveys the history in an interesting and compelling manner that conveys the context and importance the South Koreans take of the tension (the war that has not officially ended) with North Korea. "
Korea - a proud little Nation,"Toured the War Memorial with my Wife and Son (stationed there in the Army) and liked the experience. I was under the impression that the Memorial was about the 1950-53 Korean War, but the place is about all of the Korean Conflicts from its inception to the current political arena. It is a beautifully laid out museum and would recommend this to any visitor."
A must see if visiting Seoul,"Fantastic place. Can't believe its free, though we did give a donation. Amazing place and something there for everyone. When we visited in July they were in the process of building a separate museum for children in the grounds which will probably not be finished until 2015, but there is still loads of interest there for Adults and children alike, from the different dynasty rooms with costumes, a mini temple, a childrens play area, vintage cars and tanks, planes and even a 3D theatre. Hope to visit again in Oct when we go back to Seoul"
Best War Museum I've Ever Been to,"Lot's of 'hands on' things to see and do. Patrol boat, tanks, planes all available to explore. Interesting exhibits and moving displays."
Must See in Seoul!,"This is a must see if you visit Seoul...and it's FREE! My husband and I spent 4 hours, but could have spent double that. You could easily take 4 hours looking at the artillery and vehicles outside the museum, then another 4 looking at the exhibits inside. Very well preserved artifacts and a beautiful building. They have maps and guides in English as well as many other languages. There's a reason the War Memorial is the #1 attraction in Seoul! Take a day to see it!"
Best Museum Ever,"its super cool, its really informative, its mind blowing..i wouldn't mind spending an entire day here. staffs there were friendly, they had locker to keeps ur belongings, clean toilets & a cafe. the only thing i regretted is not spending enough time there. would definitely come again given the chance!"
An enducational and enjoyable few hours!,"Having not been taught much, if anything, about the Korean War at school I was looking forward to this visit. I wasn't let down either - the exhibits are all thoroughly translated into English and very informative. Not only do they have several exhibits revolving around the Korean War, but they also have a couple looking into other wars in Korea's past."
 Excellent war memorial,"I left the visit for one of the last days and I have to admit that I really enjoyed it. It's very well explained and organized and it was free entrance. You will learn about the Korean political history on this memorial. Outside you can see a lot of war planes, tanks and vessel. Don't miss the visit."
The best choice!,"Been here on business and had a Sunday afternoon free. Expected to go for two hours, but stayed even over 3 hours in the outdoor area, then another 3 hours inside. Absolutely interesting and rich of information about the war and relationship between North and South. As an east-Germany-born traveller I would recommend it to every foreigner - this is important history to understand. Good English descriptions, very well organized. I would definitely say this one first when somebody asks me for the best museum I have been to! Good also for geocachers!"
Amazing Tribute to the War Heroes,"Been here twice but enjoyed it tremendously both times. There was a show outside the plaza in front of the museum on my 2nd visit, and I enjoyed watching the traditional dances and listening to the lively drum beats. Its amazing that Korea managed to preserve its cultural and native traditions along with its rapid growth in becoming a highly industrialized country. The displays were very moving and I had a hard time trying to control my tears from falling. Korea has done a great job honoring their heroes and I wish that this beautiful country and it's people will no longer see another war in its future."
"Wow, best place to understand Korean and Korean nodern history. ","Wow, best place to understand Korean and Korean nodern history. There are exhibitions for Korean (1950 ~ 1953). We can understand the tragedy of war and Korean war's weapons by South Korea and North Korea. Further more, the park is beautiful itself. It looks like a peaceful common park. Why don't you enjoy history and leasure time here. "
it's a great museum,"Spent a good 2 hours viewing displays of Korean military through the ages. The War Memorial is very moving and is well-balnced by the Peace Bell. The section on the Korean War was particularly interesting as it cleared showed that the world came together to take over of South Korea. As a Canadian, I found the section on Canada informative. Military buffs will love the displays. Others should go to remind us of the impact wars have on people's lives."
"Engrossing, more museum than memorial","An easy 10 minute walk from the metro, be sure to allow plenty of time to visit as this is a lot more than a mere memorial. We spent 3.5 hours here and could have spent another hour or so at least, had it not been closing.Free entry.Start by walking in through the halls which include the names of those who died while serving in the military during the Koreans who died are also inscribed.We then went straight to the Korean War Room 1 and worked our way through all three war rooms. It's a fully engrossing walk through the history of the war and the outcomes. There is a degree of propaganda, which is interesting to hear the opposite from the communist propaganda, but needs bearing in mind.There are several 4D experience rooms - all of which are free, but which operate at certain times only and can only accommodate a certain number of people. The first was the Incheon Landings, which only takes 15 at a time, and runs for 7 minutes, but operates only every 30 minutes. I found it hard to stifle a laugh when the session started with a badly animated ""MacArthur"" who I hope bears no resemblance to the real MacArthur. The animation is like a bad disney ride, with a few jolts around while you're wearing 3D glasses. The escape from the reservoir is better, and takes 45 people at a time.Virtually all of the displays include full English translation and it's easy to become completely engrossed in the full story of the War. There's an excellent section on the third floor on the United Nations involvement country by country, not just the USA, so be sure not to miss that. On the ground floor there's an area to the right after the cafe, where there are a couple of historic limo's, planes, armored cars and jeeps, some of which you can climb into, worth heading in there for a few minutes, but the display of tanks, missiles, planes and the boat outside is just superb and will satisfy the most dedicated military historians. It's worth coming here just for this display alone - for the B52 Stratofortress to the MIG, it was like being a kid in a candy shop. It's a superb museum and memorial to the war, if you're going to take a trip to the DMZ and the JSA, then I heartily recommend coming here BEFORE you take the trip, it will clarify a great deal when you take the tour. Be sure to allow plenty of time as you won't want to rush through. My only criticisms would be that the signage isn't always clear as to which route you should take, and you might find yourself backtracking a little and that I didn't feel that there was enough coverage on ""what happened to the people"" - there was very little detail on civilians and refugees, but other than that, this is a superb museum and memorial, one of the best."
Great tribute,Well worth spending a few hours at this informative site and interesting learning about the behind scenes to the Korean war. Was surprised to learn how many other countries were involved in this war. There is also the history of Korean regional conflicts throughout the ages. 
A must see. Give yourself 3-4 hours.,The exibits were fantastic . So much history and so well displayed. The museum makes history come alive. 
Very Profound,"I must say that this was a very moving experience. The Memorial is situated right in front of the War Museum, and there is a huge exhibition of machinery outside (even a replica of a 'wounded' navy vessel moored in the artificial pond).Take your time and visit the exhibitions first, then walk around and look at the planes, tanks and guns. Feel the force of all this equipment.As a closing touch, walk over to the Memorial itself and just look at it. The feeling is indeed very deep. Only now that you have seen history behind it and fully understand what this Memorial signifies for the Koreans, your experience will be truly complete."
Best museum I've ever been to,I knew nothing about the Korean War and am not usually a history buff. Within minutes inside this brilliant museum I started to understand Korea so much more. No longer is the Korean War or Korea's military history merely something I have heard of in the TV show MASH. Experience the two 4D displays or the 3D flight simulator. Try your hand in the shooting arcade. This museum blends traditional and modern display techniques perfectly. 
Worth a visit,"The place is huge with many displays on the various battles in Korea's history. Very informative. There are also many displays in the outside area with warplanes, canons, etc. Many photo opportunities. "
Well worth a visit,"I visited the The War Memorial of Korea as a part of the Seoul Downtown City bus tour. Since, I didn't want to miss other attractions on the city bus tour, so I decided to skip some parts of this museum which, I later realised, was a terrible decision. This attraction along with the N Seoul Tower stand out from the rest and please take out minimum 2-3 hours when you decide to visit here.It features all kinds of weapons and military equipments that were used in the wars at that time. On top of that, there are some sections where they show small simulations from the wars in 4D. All this information can be obtained from the information brochure which you can take at the entrance."
A Must visit if your going to seoul,"It's free, no ques or registration, only a few minutes away on the MRT and is alot fun, even has a warship that you can walk around on."
Well done!,"Wasn't sure if my two youngest kids (12 and 9) were going to enjoy it. They LOVED it. so much to see, interactive stuff, movies, etc. We only had 2.5 hours unfortunately, but I had to drag them out to catch our plane! Recommend a minimum of 4 hours if you want to only see your main interests and some of the flight simulators..."
Museum worth a visit,"The War Memorial in Seoul is very well laid out and tells the visitors about the various details of Korean Wars.The building is very big and have number of illustrations for telling you the different aspects and stages of different wars. We hired an English guide which was very helpful in understanding of the museum. He explained the importance of weapons on display and also various video clips. The museum outer area has lot of Korean war planes, helicopters etc. The enterance of the museum has lot of stone sculptures which are very well laid out."
Amazing and a Great Memorial,I thought that this museum was laid out extremely well and was very informative. You can see the aircrafts and tanks outside (and you can actually walk on some of them) which was great for kids and the memorials inside had concise and informative information. The memorial statues outside were beautiful and very moving. The museum walks you through the conflict from beginning to end and was easy to follow. There are also many videos you can watch which were touching and well done. This is definitely highly recommended for anyone in Seoul as it is a really well done museum that provides lots of information about Korean history and war.
Korean War Memorial,I love the outdoor sculptures better than the exhibits inside. It's really a fitting tribute for those who fought and died during the Korean War.
Great place to appreciate history,"Very well documented. Free English guide who served in the war as well provided by the museum. Get to see all the vehicles up close like tanks and fighter jets. There is a historical Korean war section as well. If you plan to see the other museums like the National/Art museum, give the one in the memorial a miss. Focus more on the 20th century Korean war. After that, spend a little time in the gardens which are well managed."
A great memorial to the Korean conflict,"Had only limited time to visit, and hope to return next year for a more extensive visit. Easy to walk through with many videos to watch. Excellent memorial."
Great Synopsis of Korean History through warfare,"If you love history, you could spend HOURS here. As Americans, when we entered the area focused on the Korean War, we were greeted by a volunteer who gladly became our personal tour guide. "
Fitting tribute - Not to be missed,"An amazing, dignified and moving tribute to those who lost their lives for their country's freedom. Although I am not a history buff, I enjoyed it thoroughly. Not to be missed."
The FEARFUL MEMORY,A terrible impression when entering the main building takes us into Korean war history. The building architecture and surrounding environment clean. But unfortunately the toilet not clean and smell.
Definitely worth the visit,This place is very impressive. It's easy to get to and has a lot to see. It's free which is a great. It's very moving. I suggest visiting. There's a CU if you get hungry or thirsty!!
Very well maintained,All the battle ships and aircrafts are very well mainitained. And you can go inside and touch them. Very educational to the kids.
Amazing & Easy learning experience,It was an easy layout to get around. The preservation of articles and reading about the history really touched our hearts. 
Moving.,"This is a solid museum and there should be no reason to not visit this place when you are in Seoul. First off its free, and second it's an absolutely touching and tasteful display of the gratitude the Korean people feel towards those who sacrificed their lives for their freedoms."
Great museum,"This is an asset to South Korea and Seoul, set in a lovely setting this well kept memorial and museum is a tribute to those that gave their lives for the freedom that is South a Korea today. Lots of interesting Korean War tanks planes weapons, the older jose an Dynasty collection is also excellent, very much a good visit for those interested in military history very near samjaki tube station 2 min walk "
Hurleysue,"The War Memorial is a must see place! Not only is it a memorial to those who served, but it is a museum as well."
Do not miss.,The best tourist spot in Seoul. Very well maintained museum. Do keep a good 4-5 hours if you want to see the whole museum and the 3D/4D shows.
Korea's war story is well worth hearing,"Korea takes its history seriously, and especially its history of the Korean war -- and its presentation thereof. There are several good opportunities to experience war, including even feeling the snow of that brutal winter."
I can't believe it's free!,I'm not exactly a huge history buff but I really enjoyed it here. It's free and was great to see so many locals also learning. I spent hours here! It made me embarrassed that museums back home are of a lessor quality and charge for entry!
Great location,American sacrifice was respected here. The gift shop is nice and there is a good military shop across the street. I had a great English guide to take me through the museum. If you don't respect American Military Sacrifice this is not the place for you. 
A must visit in seoul,"Wonderful monument showing history of dynasty in Korea as well as their war specially with North Korea after their independence from Japan. A number of fighter planes, tanks and ships are on display which not only attracts children but their parents as well. The details of all Nations who joined with them under United Nations Army flag are also displayed as a token of gratitude."
The best choice!,"Been here on business and had a Sunday afternoon free. Expected to go for two hours, but stayed even over 3 hours in the outdoor area, then another 3 hours inside. Absolutely interesting and rich of information about the war and relationship between North and South. As an east-Germany-born traveller I would recommend it to every foreigner - this is important history to understand. Good English descriptions, very well organized. I would definitely say this one first when somebody asks me for the best museum I have been to! Good also for geocachers!"
One of the best military museums ever.,"It is fully interactive with electronic guided/narrated tours long before the iPhone or other PDAs were available. 26 nations sent men to fight communism including countries you would have never thought of like Ethiopia, South Africa, Thailand and Turkey. 60 years ago people truly understood the true danger of communism/totalitarianism aggression."
Interesting history,"I went on a rainy day with my Mom and Korean friend. There isn't much to do but walk around, take a few pictures and read what is within the museum. The grounds are kept really well and there were Ajjuma's outside working in the garden. I learned a lot about the history of Korea and Japan here. I was even asked to take a picture with a group of young South Korean soldiers who thought I was pretty :) I'll definitely come back here."
Tons of tanks and planes,"This is one of the biggest war museums in the world where they show different planes, tanks and ships from DPRK, US and ROK. A place where you need half a day to visit and understand the history of ROK."
Place to feel Korean history,"There is no need to read Korean history in books. In this museum, if you look around then you would feel and know the history of Korea. It has a lot of war planes, tanks, movie clips and photographic zones"
Wandering around Seoul,The Memorial is a great place to learn about the history of S. Korea. There are many displays and a museum to explore. plan on spending 3-4 hrs at this stop.
Poignant Tribute To The Korean War,"On June 18, 2014, I visited the War Memorial of Korea as part of ten week trip through Europe and Asia. This site has one of the best tributes to those who participated in the so-called Korean War. I was keen to see this as one of my Uncles participated but was fortunate to return home. A large memorial hall lists the names of those died and offers a tribute to those who survived.I walked through the museum and looked at the indoor displays as well as numerous war machines on the grounds surrounding the building. I learned that many nations supported the war effort to drive the North Koreans, supported by the Chinese, from South Korea."
"Suprisingly good. Sad, but beautifully done.","I went to this museum after looking on TripAdvisor as I had a few spare hours in Seoul. Its a bit difficult to get to if your using the subways it has a bit of a walk but its worth it. When you approach it you can almost feel all of the history immediately, the front of the museum is absolutely huge and there are some really meaningful statues at the front, particularly the one of the 2 soldiers from each side of Korea hugging, you can see the desire for peace. The walls entering the museum are inscribed with all the names of the fallen soldiers throughout the 50 odd years of war between the 2 sides. There are some truly good and informative exhibits and displays throughout the museum and the path it takes you on is done in chronological order so it allows you to encompass the whole timeline of war, I felt I had a much better understanding of the conflict after looking around. There's also really good interactive exhibits with projections, and simulations. Its really well done and worth a look around if your in Seoul. There is also a lot of commemorative displays relating to South Korea's involvement in the UN and other projects where they have provided assistance its really interesting. Make sure you go and see this!"
Fantastic,"This may be one of the best museums that I have ever been to, anywhere. The museum presented the history of Korea over the past 200 years adequately and thoughtfully and there was a large supply of exhibits and weaponry to make it interesting. All of the exhibits were also in English. This is a must see, in my opinion"
A way to fully understand Korean history,Best place for world war history buffs. The entrance fee is for free plus there's a free tour guide as well. It's not your typical museum.
Wow. Excellent museum and memorial.,"Went to this War Memorial after seeing listed on trip advisor and was very impressed. Spent over 3 hours and could have easily spent longer. They have a large area full of planes, tanks, boats, and other military equipment that you can see up close and even climb inside some of them. The indoor exhibits of the Korean War and other historical Korean wars are well done. They have english speaking tour guides (volunteers so no tip needed) and english explanations on most of the plaques. There are also several honoring and thoughtful memorials to fallen soldiers. There are several 3D or 4D films - but be aware these run basically on the hour or half hour from 9 to 5, and have limited seating, so it may be difficult to catch all of them depending how long you stay."
Oddly good museum,"Went to the memorial unsure of how it would be. Very good exhibits showing history of wars in Korea with nice mix of historical archives/analysis and big war toys like tanks and planes.Was surprisingly interesting and good for a couple hours. We didn't take one but English tours are available. One downside, very limited air conditioning adn the place gets hot in summer."
Great place to spend a few hours,"It is a very detailed museum and with alot of things to see and do. With plenty of photo opportunities on the outside and detailed galleries inside, it is worth going to. You will learn not only about the Korean war, but some early Korean history and a fair bit on the UN as well"
Museum with good insight into Korean war.,"Actually a museum, not just a memorial. Free to get in with good exhibition on the Korean war. Also outdoor exhibition of military equipment if that kind of thing floats your boat. Well worth a visit if you don't know much about the Korean war and want to learn more."
Great experience! take the free tour ,"The war memorial is so great. I learned so much about korea and the war. Its big, beautiful, very well made, and its free! Make sure to take a tour. The tour is for free, they offer it at the enterance. The tour guides are not just tour guides they are very knowledgeable and passionate. Our english tour guide was a army veteran had served for 20years. He asked us where we were from and what did we want from the tour. He personlized the tour for us gave us big picture and related canadian and indian role to the war ( since we are indo canadians). "
Interactive!,"I really liked how there were actual airplanes, helicopters, and tanks from the war. You got to sit in the seats, and imagine what it was like for the soldiers in the tanks - their field of vision and position in the machine. Great for kids and adults alike. It's just fascinating to interact with the machines. Usually, museums don't allow you to touch anything. There are rows of blocks with names of the fallen in one part of the museum. And other historical information. It cleared up the history of South Korea, North Korea, China and the US for me. I recommend you go check it out if you're interested in Korean/Asian history."
Try not to rush it,"After a long day on a DMZ tour we decided it best to take in the museum for even a short time, otherwise we may have missed the opportunity altogether. I was pleased we did. A museum more than a memorial it has something for everyone. The inside of the museum, while having quite a few cultural exhibits, mainly covers the Korean War. The interactive and multimedia exhibits are excellent and are available in English. Unfortunately we were a little late arriving to see/try many of them. My wife and I wandered around aimlessly for a couple of hours so I suggest you arrive early enough to make use of the volunteers.The outside of the museum is a boneyard of old tanks, planes, guns, boats and all manner of other war machinery. Being able to climb in and around this equipment is a delight for adults and children alike. In contrast, the statues and memorials you pass outside the museum is a poignant reminder that this is a memorial to those who served and died during this conflict.If you have time, I suggest you allow four hours to appreciate this impressive site. "
Excellent museum,"Excellent museum, well worth a visit! Give it time though, there's potentially lots to read and take in."
Great War Hero Museum That Doesn't Reconcile,"I was impressed with the well thought architecture, the meticulous effort in detail, and variety of displays of the Korean war and the informative history of the Korean warfare. I could feel a sincere homage paid to UN forces that helped defend South Korea. However, it could have been better if it also showed more about North Korean and Chinese young souls who were dragged into the war at the time of emerging Cold War era, and it should have been millions of civilian victims and divided families that must be in the center of focus in the tragedy instead of glorifying war heroes. It is more of a museum for war heroes and less of a memorial for war victims."
ENG/CZ: Absolutly amazing! Naprosto úžasné!,"ENG: Because Iam military fan most of people who are not can put out one star down. Korean was memorial is really huge, you can spend about 4 hours to cover all the atractions. After paying entry ask for a map and just walk acording to the floor and wall signs. There is whole history of Korean warfares from really old ages until the modern history. Biggest piece is about Korean war. You can see all kind of weapons, tactics, pictures and strategies from all kind of important battles. Well simply everything about army, war and history from Korea. Most of the things are double language. And then there is outside exposition of WW2 and later war machines including famous B52 BOMBER!!! Toilets, wending machines and coffee shops are on each corner so dont worry to sit a rest for a while. CZ: Pokud nejste fanoušky armády a věcí okolo dejte dolů jednu hvězdičku. Korejské muzeum války je průvodcem všech obzrojených konfliktů v celé historii Koreje. Muzeum je opravdu gigantické takže není problém v něm strávit i 4 hodiny. Po zaplacení vstupného dostanete mapku a už postupujete po šipkách na stěnách a zemi podél celé expozice, od nejstarších dochovaných zprávách o bojích na uzemí Koreje až po nejmodernější zbraně a techniku. Asi největší část je věnována Korejské válce po které Korea získala nezávislost a oddělila se od severní Koreje. Uvidíte zde zbraně, techniku, nákresy bitev, strategie a popisy nejslavnějších bitev či osobností Korejského vojenství. Obrovskou část tvoří i venkovní výstava kde je vojenská technika od 2. světové války až do současnosti a je zde také slavný B52 bombardér!! V muzeu jsou na každém rohu záchody, automaty s občerstvením či kavárny a odpočívadla, nebojte se si odpočinout protože je muzeum opravdu časově náročné."
Great free activity!,Not just about war so good for kids too - and wives!!Quite big so plenty to do and see and definitely worth a visit if your in the area and share an interest in war Korean culture. Not a lot of food options on site
Massive and eye opening,This is massive. Took us around 2 hours to fully look in every room and we only skimmed half the information that is there. Every thing is in English so you can read what it is all about. The exhibits where amazing. Really thoughtful for all the people that lost their life's helping Korea. The technology used here is brilliant. Well worth a visit!
Great Museum!,"We find something new each time we visit the museum. My kids always love it from the military planes/sub/boats outside to the multiple 4D movies inside. There is English as well as Korean on most of the displays which is very helpful. We even had an elderly Korean gentleman ask where we were from last visit and then thank us for helping them in the War. Wonderful for my kids to see. If you have an hour or longer, stop by this first rate FREE museum."
A tragic history,It is a very well organized museum depicting the history and is free and so well worth going!Would recommend to learn some about the history and current events on korea such as what is known about the north and the south.I share A useful video below. CheersNorth Korea at its best!: http://youtu.be/gm5KFnvHpfw
Educational and Interesting.,"I was in Seoul for a month on a business trip, but managed to see a few sites on the weekend. This was by far my favorite. It has something for all ages. The tanks/planes outside the museum were impressive and it was unique how up close you can get. Inside the museum was even better. The beginning of the museum focuses on Korea's early military history and the museum finishes up with a lengthy exhibit on the Korean War. Both were quite interesting. I particularly appreciated the UN exhibit at the very end, which pays homage to the many UN countries who helped defend Korea. "
Amazing Memorial,"Filled with Rich history and Culture, sure to enlighten all who come. Ranging in history from early in Korea's culture to present day. "
Worth a visit!,"It was cool to see all the tanks, planes, uniforms and footage from this war. It is well worth the trip out and can be seen in just a few hours."
one of the best places in seoul,"this is not just about the korean war, but about every war that the country of korea has been a part of. they have a huge section dedicated to the korean war, of course, with specific sections paying tribute to each of the countries that fought in it. really cool to look at the weaponry, the actual life size used war machines. its a massive facility and you know they really tried to make it as realistic and accurate as possible, while paying tribute to all countries involved"
NOT TO BE MISSED!!,GIVE IT HALF A DAY...A well made memorial paying homage to the brave soldiers with many artifacts..it is an interesting place to be in and spend a couple of hours...
Nice museum,"Nice museum with plenty to see, can easily spend 3 hrs there. A quick glimpse is also enough for those who are not into museums..It is free"
Impressive,"Impressive, emotional, good exhibits. the place captures the longing for reunification and stresses its importance"
Better to knaow about Korean History,"To knoe about he war history of Korea, the museum tellus a lot."
Plenty to do and see,"I liked all of the historical items from the chosen dynasty, but did not appreciate how little America was mentioned during the Korean conflict. I found the War Memorial replaced American troops with United Nation troops. Sure the UN was there, but American made up 90% of the UN forces and we lost many lives freeing the Korean people. Even on maps showing co-ordinating attacks, the US troops where marked under at UN flag. Disappointing."
Educating place,The museum is well planned and displays the complicated topic of war very sensitively. I enjoyed the multimedia presentations and movies that were all available in English.
Don't miss this gem,"This was one of the most detailed well laid out museums I have ever been to. A bonus was that there was a free tour led in English by Jason, a day school student, who just recently became a docent. He was so well informed and gave us so much information about the Korean War."
A museum of military history,"We came expecting a poignant memorial to the Korean war. It is not this at all and if I was reviewing it was a memorial I do not think it is very good at all. This is a museum dedicated to the Korean War.Outside the memorial there are plenty of military planes, tanks and missiles. This sums up the internal exhibits. It is a subjective look at the war. You do learn a lot about a war that was effectively a world war, one that killed millions in just 6 months and then another million in the two years of negotiations.Other exhibits include a military look at Korean History with dioramas. There are free guided tours where the volunteer can explain the Korean War in detail. We were lucky and had a History student who was able to discuss the political discourse with us.The one area that was dedicated to peace seemed very tacky to me and I felt it didn't commemorate the memory of those who died. It was a room with faux tombstones that had battles projected on to them.If you come expecting a museum of war then this is a good place to spend a few hours learning a bit about the Korean war. If you come expecting a museum of peace and commemoration then like me you will be disappointed. I do think it was a bit too brazen and glorified the fighting a too much but then most museums about war seem to.It is free and is close to the subway. You just need to walk around the American base to get here."
I learn Korean history in 3 hours,"The Brothers Statue could have depicted the world conflict. Brothers are killing each other all over the world. The horrific Conflict causes so much lives because of politics, how would Chinese and American faces the Koreans. Is Abe playing fire with neighbours? Yikes!"
Impressive!,"Tons of aircrafts, tanks and vehicles outside. Inside has a lot of great exhibits and the free english tour was amazing. Highly recommended!Walking distance from Samgakji and Namyeong subway stations."
Heaven for a history buff!,"Allow plenty of time to explore this museum, there are several floors, each with many different displays from diverse periods of history. I spent around 2 hours here, and still feel as though i had missed some of the museum."
war memorial day visit,"great displays,, but did not have enough time. We budgeted 3 hours, but would have been happy with an extra hour. recommended for a family tour."
Well Worth Visiting,"The memorial includes a huge museum building and large exterior display of ROK, U.S., and Russian military planes, tanks, and related machines, a statue display, and flag display. This is a huge facility so allow time to see it all. Check its business hours before visiting to ensure you have enough time to see it all, but the exterior display areas are open even if the museum building is closed. The museum is only a block or two from a metro stop."
Great Tribute,Certainly a place to visit. A lot of information and well worth going for an educational and historical experience. 
Great for war history / weapons enthusiasts,"Very informative with lots of awesome artifacts. I tried my luck and asked if there was any guided tour in English. The counter staff assigned a 14 year old schoolboy volunteer to bring me around. Really thankful for that. It took about 30 minutes and i found out that he was actually on school vacation, but he signed up as a English-speaking museum guide on his own. Good lad. After the tour, i went back in for a 2nd look as i wanted to take photos.Tip:1. If you have limited time, your itinerary should be 2nd floor (Korea War), then 3rd floor (U.N), then on to the 1st floor (Medieval warfare). 2. If you arrive late in the day, the outdoor display of war machines should be viewed last, as they are outside the museum. So, in the event of the museum closure, you can still venture outside among the machines. The highlight for me was the replica (I think) of a Scud missile."
Excellent and free,"As a non military buff this was a really good trip. It is free to get in and had an awesome display of all things war as they relate to Korea.The outside has planes, tanks, helicopters, boats and all sorts of military transports that you can climb all over.A great experience"
Excellent - and not very busy,"This is an excellent museum. We went on a Saturday morning, and it was not busy at all. The first floor is the history prior to 1950, which was a little dry, but the rest was about the Korean War, UN involvement in other wars, and the future weapons of war - which was all great. Be sure the check out the giant ship outside too. Very easy to get to from the metro as well and totally free. We spent almost 3 hours there."
Best War Museum Around,I have been to a lot of museums but no place compares to this museum. They take a lot of pride is showing their national history of war and remembering the people who helped keep their country free! This is a must stop while visiting Seoul!
A Comprehensive Memorial/Museum,"This museum provides a very comprehensive look at the Korean War and previous wars in which Korea took part. It has English translations throughout. If you have a smartphone you can follow a tour of the museum's highlights. Outside there are many tanks, planes, and even a ship on display. It is a very family friendly place. No admission fee is charged. It is easily accessible by subway."
"If you like history, this is great museum","This is a great museum. There are tanks and planes outside to see and monuments and sculptures. Inside is very big. If you have kids with you, there is a special place in the museum just for them. It was very interesting reading and seeing displays about the Korean War and how it was started and how the US helped. You will enjoy it if you like history. It could be a little too long a visit for those who do not."
Understanding Korean History,"I definitely recommend visiting the War Memorial and Museum. The site in itself is quite impressive with some beautiful statues and other memorials. The exhibition is very well done: it's very interactive, with various videos for example, and presents the visitors with clear, precise and detailed descriptions of the wars that Korea has been through. Although I was mostly interested in the war between North and South Korea in the 1950s, the museum covers a historical period that ranges from approximately 1100-1200 to the early 2000s. This is equally a great place to visit with children and entry is free!"
Best war memorial ever.,"I was just expecting to see a statue in a park, but it was so much more. There are two statues at the front, one depicting two brothers from different sides who meet on the battlefield. Further on there is a display of tanks, planes, rockets, even a ship. Then there is the museum, which doesn't just show recent conflicts but goes back many centuries. There are many very good displays showing ships, a castle, battle scenes, uniforms from different eras and so much more. This should not be missed."
Great place to reflect,"Fantastic if you are interested in wartime history and how it has shaped modern history. Even if you are not interested, very informative and presents heaps of information in an easy to access medium."
Great visit even if you're not into museums,"This admission free museum retells Korea’s history from a ""military"" point of view. A dedicated permanent exhibit for the Korean war gives you a very detailed view on what happened during this time. Outside the museum there's a park with some old planes, tanks and other retired military vehicles. You will definitely not finish in half a day. To get here just take the subway 4 or 6 to Samgakji. Note that it is closed on Mondays and the first of January."
Lots of fun for children and good dose of history,I went there with my two year old wondering if there would be things to do. Even though the children's museum was closed but there was lots to do. The outdoor park with retired planes parked is great fun. A little pond with fishes was rest fun too. There is a children's play area which required a ticket. It seemed like fun but last entry was at 5 pm. Nice exhibits and lots to learn
Definitely worth a visit,"This is an impressive memorial. Not only is the building itself impressive, but the outside collection of war vehicles and planes is worth a visit alone."
"Awesome museum, you need a whole day here.","In my opinion, this is the definitive museum to visit if you want to learn about the history of not just the Korean War but also its historical roots from the founding of the Korean Peninsula. A great memorial for those who died in the war. The displays are incredibly informative and there are also attractions within the museum like simulators or short films(You need to queue for these). For the kids, there are also many different fun activities littered throughout the complex. I advise visitors to follow the recommended route as it allows you to follow the proper timeline and sequence of events.Outside the main building, there is a large area dedicated to static displays of soviet and allied vehicles used in the Korean war, ranging from tanks, planes and even a warship. A great way to let civilians get up close and personal with military equipment.From my experience, you definitely need a whole day if you intend to visit The War Memorial of Korea just because it is such a huge complex. Also, if you are lucky, you may also spot a mini-parade by the US Army(I think) held at the Parade Ground in front of the Main Building. The museum closes pretty early during the low season, so I'd recommended finishing up inside before heading to the static displays which are open all day."
family tour,"If you travel to south Korea, Korean war memorial is a must, Its free entrance but full of history, You can see variety of real navy air plain, and many air force vehicles, The space is wide and when you want to rest, scattered bench to sit on,also inside the building you can see, the life of south Korea from a different wars, and how they live before. all the literature were write in the wall with frame, how they won the war and how they survived, When the improvement start and how they fight the war. The entrance of the building you must climb the stairs, in front is wide space to look for. Inside building lots to see and read, after you finished, the three story building you can go back again to familiarize your self for the history of South Korea with no cost. Their is also a rest room inside the building, you can use wheelchairs and strollers inside and outside the building, Since no entrance fee and no limit to stay you enjoy taking pictures on your own time, no canteen to buy food but a lot of vendo machine for water and drinks scattered all over the area. You can bring food and have picnic outside. War memorial is near eatewon, you ride bus or subway."
Educational,"If you are interested in Korean history or The Korean War then this place is great. Walking up to the building on the right side you will see many different army, navy, and air force vehicles. Some of which you can go inside and take a look. Once you enter the actual museum portion there are three floors filled with Korean history ranging from early weaponry used to the set up and culture of cities. Also, you can find a little information about each country that help aid Korea in the war. One of the floors is specifically dedicated to the UN and its efforts in the war too. All of the facilities are clean and easily accessible. Not to mention the memorial is free admission."
The most impressive war memorial I have visited outside Europe,"The Korean War Memorial is well worth the trip to visit. It's a war memorial, there's not a lot to say apart from that.You can get to it via the city tour bus which is a cheap way round most of the sights to see in Seoul."
Lots to see,Love this museum. Lots to see and it's free. Takes 3-4 hours to get through the whole thing. If you aren't much of a reader you can get through it much faster. All the planes and tanks outside are a must see.
Very good!,"The place is so good. Went there as one of the site visited along on my Panmunjom tour.Will go back here again in an independent trip so I can see another features of the building. This place is a must visit, especially if you are a history buff and wanted to know about the Korean War."
Maybe the best memorial I've been to,"This place is massive. It's also part museum along with being a memorial. And it's free. I was recently at the USS Arizona Memorial and while that was very personal, being from America, I thought the Korean War Memorial was much more thorough.Outside there are number of statues and memorial that are very well done. They also have one of the largest collections of war equipment (tanks, planes, artillery, etc.) that I've ever seen. Also on the outside are walls filled with names of people that died during the war. What I found unique is that not only do they have the names of Koreans but also people from other countries that served during the war.Inside they have a multi-level building with extensive information on the war and some early Korean history. There were a number of short films, some said 3D and 4D, but unfortunately I didn't have enough time to view any of them. Most of the signage was also in English which was very nice. They provide guided tours in a few different languages including English.I could have spent 4 hours here but unfortunately only had about 2.5 hours. If you're the kind of person that stops at almost every display and watches every film make sure you allow for several hours or you will end up missing a lot."
Great interactive museum,"The museum is huge and the whole area is beautifully set. There is a lot of interactive stuff like 4D cinemas, authentic radio messages, the combat experience room and photo spots. Everything is also described in English. Come early and plan a lot of time. The museum closes already at 6pm and is closed on Mondays! I recommend further reading on the Korean war as it might leave you one-sided and biased."
"Grand, and good if you are very interested","It really goes into detail, and the museum itself is beautiful. Especially the surrounding garden with sculptures. "
A must see!,"The War Memorial of Korea and museum provide a wonderful day of sightseeing in Seoul. The museum is large and has wonderful exhibits about Korea history and the wars that formed their country. First of all, the museum is free to the public. Secondly, the South Koreans honored the American soldiers with an entire floor of the museum and the names of the 33,000 soldiers who lost their lives in the war efforts. Additionally, the memorials and the outside area showing the planes, tanks, and boats were popular with not only the kids, but for the adults as well. It was certainly a high point in our trip to Korea."
Remarkable and moving,"I spent several hours here enjoying the exhibits and the chance to learn about the history of Korea. As an Australian the handling of Australia's efforts in the Korean War brought me to tears, it was so well done. The is plenty here for all ages from very young to the aged... And it's very well organised and laid out.I highly recommend visiting this."
Appreciation for the sacrifice by the soldiers,"The whole monument and the museum serves to remind us about the great service done by soldiers not only of Korea but also of various other countries. All the names are etched in the memorial and glorifies them for eternity. The museum has a lot of documents, medals, uniforms, weapons used, scale models of vehicles, ships and airplanes, and also many full size models. It is beautifully maintained and entry is free of charge. "
Very interesting,"First of all, its free of charge. The first time we came here we had very short of time, however we found it very intresting and decided to go back the next day. The museum is focused on the korean war, but also features exhibitions about Koreas earlier wars with Japan. The korean war-exhibition was really fascinating and thrilling and divided into three parts, room 1,2 and 3. I learned alot I didn't know before. "
Top attraction in Seoul?,"I find it curious that the War Memorial of Korea is the top attraction for Seoul. It is free and it does have interesting bits but top attraction for the average visitor?Anyway the War Memorial is house in a very large building within a large park. One side of the park is full of vintage tanks and aircraft. There is a patrol boat in a pond which is quite impressive in the sense that it's hard to figure out how they got the boat in a pond in the middle of Seoul. The main building has several levels. The main level is dominated by a big room dedicated to those who died in battle. The lower level has a brief military history of Korea from Paleolithic to end of the Korean Empire, told through battles which must be obscure to all but the specialists.The greatest amount of space in the rest of the building is taken up by the details of the Korean War, which must represent more than half the museum. The section on all those countries those that contributed to the UN forces was done very well. The role of the modern Korean military and the Korean defense industry wraps up the exhibition. Overall it is worth a visit and you do see some interesting stuff but on the whole the curation was not very clear and I had trouble trying to see a coherent theme. I think it must be difficult to curate a war museum designed for both locals and visitors, especially if the visitors are from nations who were how shall we say involved in those wars but now are major trading partners."
Full of history,The museum is very interesting and also really big. They have 3 floors and it is not only about the Korean war but also about the many other conflicts that they have fought.
Necessary stop to understand modern Korea,Maybe a deeper introduction on how Korea become broken in the first time socially speaking would be appreciated.
"Very moving, makes you think about war & peace.","I don't really know much about Korean war, and I am no expert in world history. However, visiting this place made me think about many things, and especially Koreans' tribute to those who sacrificed themselves was very moving. Unlike many other museums you will visit in other leading countries, in this place you will be told a war story from the other side of the view, that is Koreans' -the weaker country's view that struggled to protect their people and peace against powerful nations like Russia, China, and Japan. It really lets you to understand the costs of war in a more complete manner. There are many different things for all ages to enjoy, I can see the effort put into this memorial. Highly recommended!"
Very powerful impression,"I've read about the Korean War, and was called up for National Service but wasn’t sent there. This first class museum brought a lot of it home to me. A terrible period in Korean history but well worth visiting to see what they went through and to then marvel at how South Korea is now."
Excellent museum,"If you are interested in the history of the Korean War, this is the place to go. Huge, comprehensive, well-designed. Lots of artifacts (documents, photos, war machinery). There are some gimmicky things, like a ""4D"" motion simulator ride that is more for fun than for historical education, but overall the museum is great."
WORTH A VISIT,Certainly worth a visit as is very informative about the Korean War and other conflicts. A nice range of military artifacts too. Check it out - being free certainly helps!
"Huge, detailed collection tells the story well",This is one of the best war museums I've been to. The curators have done a great job not only collecting the items but logically displaying them to tell the story and educate you as you walk through each section. A must visit while you're in Seoul!
"Top attraction in Seoul, do not miss it.","This museum was a pleasant experience lasts approximately 3 hours. A museum very large and full of things to see. Inside there are some representations of ancient wars dating back to the last millennium, spread over 2 levels. Outside, on the other hand there is a fantastic collection of weapons ammunitions from most recent wars, including helicopters, planes and tanks. The main attraction of this incredible memorial park is a warship a 30 meters boat perfectly preserved dating back to the war of Korea, it is possible to visit the inside and are tangible signs of bullets. Experience unforgettable and absolutely free of charge."
Not my cup of tea,"The place is in my opinion too much oriented towards the ""war"" and not the ""memorial"", if you know what I mean. There are so many things to visit in Seoul, you can skip this one"
Interesting albeit sobering place,"Very interesting and informative place to visit albeit somewhat sobering. Lots of information and well-illustrated exhibits about the history of Korea and the Korean war. It is a bit out of the way and whilst it is relatively easy to get to by subway, a taxi is actually a far cheaper option."
wow it just wow,"you won't regret for this huge memorial park.Dose not matter, if interesting of war or not.Does not matter, who you trip with now.Wow it just Wow, that's what i saying ."
Must do,"Loved everything about this memorial museum - incredible art works and great use of technology to portray the war. Being from New Zealand, I was very humbled by the repeated mention and gratitude shown by the Koreans for support that NZ and the other nations gave (and continue to give). Very interesting place"
Very good museum,"We went through the wrong entrance so it was a bit hard to find for us, but once inside, it was great! It was free and huge! It includes not only information on the Korean War, but also all the conflicts they've had before. It had a 3D and 4D warfare experience theatre as well as a shooting range. Allow about 1.5 to 2 hrs for this museum. "
Visit when it's autumn,"While living in Korea for three years, my return visit with my mom was my first time here. Autumn brought in a melancholic, pretty and quiet atmosphere in the place. Part of the exhibit in the lobby was the commemorative display naming all the Cheonan ship soldiers who died in the sinking, and I thought it was sad, beautiful - considerate? I'm not sure of the right word - and fitting to include them in the museum. We were hoping to find my grandfathers' - my immediate and his cousins - name as part of the first contingent who went to Korea during the war. It was only later on that we realized only the Koreans names were included (poor research, our bad). Nonetheless, it was a good eye opener about Korea's history, the invasions, the wars - it explained a lot of what and how Korea came to be; in culture, thinking, perspectives. As we were leaving the museum, we had this wonderful surprise of the soldiers doing a presentation of sorts - I forgot the festival. My mother, as a humanities professor, enjoyed the show very much despite not understanding the narration. It was a pleasant surprise, and we enjoyed every bit of our visit in and outside the premises."
Must visit,"If you're into history, old planes do visit this imposing large and well run museum. I was impressed and learnt so much. The displays are of good quality and varied..they even allow you to do some shooting and climb up to a b52!"
Excellent exhibit,"We spend a full morning here. The museum is free, though you can spend an hour outside looking at the massive array of statues and military vehicles on display. There are a couple of food courts, one inside the main building and one around the corner (near the wedding hall).The only thing that marred this visit were the hundreds of high school students wreaking havoc all over the grounds. It looked as if the teachers just turned them loose and went to go hide somewhere for the day. They were smoking in the bathrooms, running around, putting on makeup in the POW exhibit - all kinds of crazy disrespectful stuff. Maybe time your visit after peak field trip hours or on the weekend and you will experience a very thoughtful, somber museum - as it was intended. "
A must-visit when in Seoul,"Husband and I thoroughly enjoyed this museum. The indoor museum had more than just exhibits on the Korean War. There were war exhibits from Korea’s medieval period as well. The corridors with lists of names of soldiers who died in the Korean War were well laid out and had a sense of serenity to it. The outdoor museum was where the display of military vehicles was located. You are allowed to see the displays up close and even explore the insides of some of the vehicles. Even though I am not Korean and not a war/military enthusiast I found this place thoroughly enjoyable and is an honorable tribute to the fallen soldiers. My only regret was not getting to the museum earlier. We arrived about 2 hours before closing time and had taken our time in the memorial corridor looking at the names of soldiers. Hence we were unable to cover all floors of the indoor museum before closing time. In hindsight we should have gone straight to the indoor museum and covered that first, since we were able to take our time looking at the outdoor exhibits after museum closing time."
The day the US president visited.,"We arrived at the museum,only to fine the president of the USA was already there, we saw his limo but not him,once he was done the placed reopened.And was worth the wait,free to get in like most S.Korean museums.lots to see and well laid out,first class."
A lot more to see than we thought,"A relative in Seoul took us to this memorial. It was interesting to both of us and there was a lot to see inside and outside.Try to go on a day that is not raining and not hot because there are a lot of military items to see outside and on the inside it was not particularly well air conditioned, so we felt a bit hot inside.There really was a complete history or all sorts of wars from the recent Korean War as far back as thousands of years. It's a good place to take a school kid to learn about history and there seemed to be a lot of school tours there at the time.There was not fee to enter the memorial, and only a small parking fee that was conveniently located under the memorial."
Great museum,"Very interesting! Well worth the time to get there. Lots of history, not only the Korean war. Lots of English to help understand the displays."
War overload,"My boys are ww2 fanatics and loved running around sitting on planes, tanks and ship. The museum and it's artifacts we're excellent as well"
Educational and informative.,"Housed in an amazing building, it was easy to follow the directions inside and take in all the history. It took us a couple of hours to complete our viewing and we found it very interesting."
"Very informative, good for all ages.","The War Memorial park is full of many beautiful and thoughtful pieces. Definitely recommend going. They have descriptions in English as well, which we found very helpful. The back side of the park has a variety of military planes/tanks/missile launchers and the park itself is in a very central location so you can visit this and a handful of over nearby sites (mountain, markets, church, museum, etc.)"
Worth a hour or two!,"The museum really impressed us! Excellent lay out. Takes you through Korea's history up until the war. Some rooms are more interesting than others. Really enlightening, even if it's quite biased!"
Outdoor - indoor - great exhibits,"A large complex. Walk round outside to experience actual planes, boats, bombs and tanks used during the war, and then into a museum with individual galleries dedicated to each aspect of the Korean conflicts. Well displayed and well explained - much of it in English. Lots of interactive stuff - check out the big jigsaw puzzles - loads of documentary films - many in 3D. Probably best summed up by the words of the veterans shown on video in the 3rd floor Korean war room. And of course the Statue of Brothers that dominates the entrance to the park. Can only hope that the brothers in the North & South will one day meet again. Be ready to share your experience with loads and loads and loads (!!) of school kids"
Freedom is not free,"That's what our 70 year old English guide, Mr Cho, passionately told our group on our 1 hour guided tour on the Korean War exhibits.The war memorial / museum holds a number of exhibits on the conflicts of Korea from the ancient times to the more recent Korean War, where most of the exhibits are dedicated to. The place is pretty enormous, well kept and a very informative. Pretty amazing when there’s no entrance fee.Tips : The place if huge, wear comfortable shoes.Join the guided tour. English speaking tours @ 2pm.All the 4D movies starts on the hour. Queue early.It's closed on Monday!"
Books never tell the whole story,"I love history, I have always loved history. When I was a student in elementary and high school, I always dedicated extra time to my history books; I wanted to understand why things are the way they are. While studying abroad in college, I found it fascinating that other countries tell the same story but with a different perspective. After that revelation, I have always enjoyed my history books in foreign countries and in foreign languages and learning new things about any given event. It is fascinating to read about the Spanish-American war, IN SPAIN! And it seems an alternate universe to read about the USA in any given European, Asian or Latin American country. Thus I was prepared for revelations and new information the moment we entered the facility. First, the museum is free to all visitors; second, it is a self-guided tour; you take a brochure and map and view things at your own pace. The light and sound shows are well done and not overly exaggerated which would have reduced their message. There are a couple that require a minimum of 5 people to begin. We missed a couple because we were just 4 people. A word of caution, however, this museum is about all Korean wars, not just the last one. You will spend some time in 5th century feuding kingdoms, see the play off between the Tang dynasty and Japan and the Mongol hordes over the next thousand years. What once were 3 kingdoms with double the land area eventually contracted to one kingdom near the end of the 19th century, before the Japanese invasion. And then finally, the full thrust and import to foreigners, the events leading up to and including the Korean war 1950 to 1953.We all learned as high school students that the rapid removal of American troops, and Secretary Acheson's definition of Korea as outside the American defense perimeter after World War II contributed to the boldness on the part of the north to launch the war. We didn't learn that North Korean leadership asked for permission from both the Soviet Union and China before launching their attack on the south, and other interesting facts that did not come to light until after the collapse of the Soviet Union opened all those secret archives. But the most interesting points to me were the minor one off events that became determining points in the war. What if the ROK forces had not blown up the bridges over the Han River, halting the North's Russian tank advance for 6 days, time enough for Truman to get troops to territory still held by ROK forces? What if MacArthur had not gambled on a surprise landing at Incheon, leading to the collapse of North Korean supply lines and the rapid retreat of the invasion force all the way back to the Chinese border? What if the Chinese hadn't been so worried about an American ally on its border and hadn't entered the war? What if Truman had authorized use of the A-Bomb? So many what ifs to consider, a dedicated student of history will find many such small, but highly decisive, events to ponder.I highly recommend this museum. They say history is written by the victors, and in the same way a people tell of their successes, they often gloss over their failures and their shames. I respect the Korean people immensely for coming to grips just over 10 years ago, with the infamous 1950 ""summer of terror,"" for not whitewashing what happened during that early, tragic phase of the war. Unfortunately, I did not find that reference at this museum."
Helps you finally understand why there's a North & South Korea,"Other Korean history museums seemed to gloss over the split with N. Korea. This was the one place that clearly explained it to us. My wife didn't want to go. She thought it would be a boring downer. But it turned out to be a fascinating and well-illustrated explanation. The memorial statue outside of two embracing brothers is quite moving. The place is huge, but you can certainly skip the overly detailed stuff. As long as you're interested in global politics and history, it's easily good for a 90-minute to 2-hour visit."
Worth the trip,"My mother came to visit me and is loves history. This is a place she really wanted to visit. I am so glad we did. The place is huge. Statues and old war machines are surrounding the building. Inside you get to see old war vessels, information about past wars in Korea with interesting artifacts from those time periods. Then as you go through you get to the korean war that separated North and South. It was emotional. You see countries that aided Korea and their heroes. They recently added on a new section that used all the dog tags from the fallen soldiers and they made it in to a tear drop. Its a dark room where drops of water form on the floor using projector and then the floor comes alive with tags falling with names on them. It was beautiful. There is so much to see and do in this museum that we ran out of time. I am going back soon. I want to finish exploring this beautiful museum."
Worthy,"Well worth the visit, particularly before DMZ tour. Lots to see both outside and inside. Took 3 teenage boys who don't like museums, but they were fascinated."
Absolute must - see!,Incredibly well thought out museum. Simply magnificent. I spent 4 hours there and only left because I had to be elsewhere. Should be on everyone's top 3 Seoul attractions in my opinion.
most likely more relevant for korean,it is alway good to remember the ones who fought for their contry -but htis is not mycountry so it is a bit difficult to connect
Great out door displays,"This is a big boy/little boy's delight. A quite amazing sculpture greets you as you come in the gate. Outside is an extensive display of aircraft, armored vehicles and boats. Inside there are many displays depicting Korean history, particularly Military history. It is spaciously set out so although there were many people there it didn't seem crowded. We had timed our visit for Friday as the guide book told us that every Friday afternoon at 2pm there was a military display. Unfortunately on arrival we found that this had been cancelled due to the Ferry disaster which happen two months ago! A disappointment but there was lots to see. Allow plenty of time for a visit and a bonus is that it is free."
"Humbling, Informative and Bigger than Expected","Wonderful museum and memorial, very humbling and informative. Do not miss while in Seoul. Easy to get to from the Subway and everything is also in English. "
give you an impressive history of korea,"The place is too too big to walk around, easily get tired. However, you just cannot skip this place for it is so simple and straighforward to present what happened in the past between South and North Korea and the role of USA in the history of South Korea. Informative and enlightening. "
Great Museum,"Definitely recommend. Aside from the obvious attributes of education & remembrance, this museum also has amazing art and architecture. This is a spectacular museum. A lot of thought, design, and money went into this endeavour. There is a really great space for kids, on the lower level. The planes, tanks, boats, and guns outside are all very interesting, as well; Adults and children seem to appreciate them."
The best museum in Seoul,Excellent story in each segment. Excellent statues and relics. Emotional story of the 2 brothers statue. FREE entrance wow!
Very informative museum,"Spent a great few hours here. The museum itself has an outdoor part and indoor part. Outdoors are lots of relics of wars - aircraft, boats, tanks and artillery pieces, many of which were used in the Korean and Vietnam wars.Inside the museum you can learn all about the Korean war, which was very interesting and informative.Had lunch at the cafe which was cheap and tasty. There are many water fountains in the museum and vending machines outside for drinks.The museum is free entry, but we left a voluntary donation as it was so good."
"Brilliant, relevant, moving and informative","This is a very informative place and I certainly learnt a lot about the psyche of the Korean people who, in my opinion, are among some of the nicest and friendliest people in the world. The statue of ""Brothers"" was so moving and relevant and says implicitly everything there is to be said about divided nations without words. I absolutely loved this piece and stood mesmerised by it for a long time. Well done Seoul for bringing your history alive."
"Lots of plnaes, tanks","Its a great historical place and very informative . The kids love the planes, subs & tanks outside the museum."
You are not forgotten,"This is a great memorial. In America, we tend to call this the forgotten war. Being a younger vet, member of the VFW and American Legion I want to let you know my brothers YOU ARE REMEMBERED here. If you come to Seoul you must come here."
Nice to know the history ,"Nice education trip, weather is nice in seoul and good place to know the different point of view base on a same war. Learnt a lot"
Very emotive and perfect for a rainy day,"We had a couple of rainy days during our trip to Seoul so we decided to visit the war memorial during one of them.Whilst this meant we didn't get much time to look around the aircraft and other items outside, the internal exhibits were brilliant and incredibly emotive, as someone who only had a high level knowledge of the Korean War, I found the memorial very interesting and gave me an insight in to the history and culture. A few of the interactive exhibits weren't working hence 4 stars instead of 5 but it really is worth a visit."
EXCELLENT,"Before I arrived in Seoul I planned to visit the War Memorial but never thougt I will spent more than 3 hours visiting. It's a very huge area consisting of outdoor and indoor sections. Outside there are many tanks and armoured vehicles of army, a small ship and some boats of navy and my favourate airplanes such as a huge B-52, F-5, T-33, F-84, F-86 etc. Indoors are seperated in different sections which is designed very good. There is no entry fee. There is a guided English tour at10.00-14.00 hours. Indoor galleries consist of the ones which show the wars Korea went through ( with very good show and animations) and separate sections for UN countrys which supported them. There is also a section which consists of donations of many war related items. Also an area for children is available. I plan to visit again next time I travel to Seoul ."
So interesting,"Really interesting, didn't know much about Korean history before I visited. Put aside a lot of time if you want to see it all, there is so much to see there."
Go on a sunny day for great photos,"I was skeptical about visiting the War Memorial of Korea because my previous trips to similar sites in other countries had proved a real downer. Usually, war memorials tend to be drab and lonely places that people just pass by without so much as a glance. I am happy to say the War Memorial of Korea is nothing like that. When I went in late morning, it was full of Korean teenagers dressed up for photos and plenty of tourists just enjoying the day.The memorial consists of two parts: The military equipment on display outdoors and the memorial itself with inscriptions honoring the soldiers. For me, the more interesting part is the outdoors one. There, you get to see a vast array of tanks, artillery, aircraft, missiles, and even a real patrol boat. It is every boy's (grown men's) dream come true. There were descriptive and sometimes amusing information in English for the hardware which spanned periods from World War II to more recent times. Where else can you see a North Korean spy submarine up close?The main memorial building was not that interesting to me as the inscriptions were in Korean. It had a solemn and reverent air about it to instill that sense of gravitas. I made a quick walk- through.The memorial is highly recommended not only to see the military weaponry, but also to catch a glimpse of Koreans young and old hanging out among the memorial's impressive monuments and rest areas."
Very interesting if you appreciate the history,This is a really huge place with many museums to explore and monuments to seeWell worth passing by and checking out if you get the chance
Very neat,The displays in this musuem are amazing. You must check it out if you visit Seoul. Make sure you save some time to visit this place because it takes like 3 hours just to get through all the exhibits and sculptures.
Great place especially for kids and men!!!,My kids really enjoyed this place. We spent more than half a day just exploring the whole area. We stayed until closing yet my kids still want to go back and visit..
National treasure no.1,"This is a must see of Seoul.No crowds, free entry, fantastic displays.....just the best thing the Capitol has to offer tourists....better than a trip to the DMZ."
Not what I expected (in a good way),We saw a few museums etc and thought this would be very similar and possibly a little boring. Wow were we wrong! I recommend you go to this! It was daily easy to access via the wonderful Seoul metro and was only a 5 minute walk from the station. It was free of charge which is even better if you are travelling on a budget! It was not boring and was so amazing. We were only able to view the first part of the war memorial (ran out of time) - but what we saw was so interesting and visually impressive. It was great to know a bit more information about Korea and its history. Must see!
Surprisingly good,"Visited on recommendation here, and as many others have said, I was very pleasantly surprised. The place is massive, with plenty of excellent exhibits. Prepare to spend a good part of your morning/afternoon here."
Wow!,"I went here just bcos it was on top of list must visit in Seoul. But we only visit the outer side of the museum. It took about 1 hour. It was interesting, not to mention the kids. All the displays were fascinating. You can even have a nice relaxing rest at the park in front of the museum. So, give it a try!"
all you could ever want to know about the korean war,If you see just one museum in seoul this must be it.there are 3 floors just crammed with displays about korean military history.most have an English translation.I spent nearly 3 hours in this museum and it was time we'll spent.best way xq get there is taxi.make sure the driver on the return journey knows. Where your hotel is as mine didn't.
Impressive!,"You can spend all your time on the outside of the building looking at all the sculptures, memorials, tanks, armory and aircraft. Inside the English Korean War tour was helpful. Wish we had looked for ancient Korea tour. The exhibits themselves are not as complete with information as in the US, UK, etc...gift shop needs marketing help. We still managed to do some shopping. "
Worth a visit,"I visited here while doing the city bus tour but really it deserves allocated time just to visit it. There is so much to see! Outside are heaps of war planes, tanks and other missile firing machines so if you have children with you they will love it. Inside there is a suggested route to follow which I found helpful and ensured I didn't miss anything"
What a Great stop!,Incredible war memorial. Great military equipment to see on the grounds.We knew little of Korea pre 1950. This gives a true story for the American traveller
"So interesting, will have to go back","We went to the War Memorial of Korea because we were told it was interesting. That was an understatement! it was not just interesting, it was brilliant and after many hours we had to leave after seeing only the outside and 1st Floor displays. We are definitely going back next time. Korea has a long history of internal strife and aggressive invasion by other countries . The displays reflect all aspects of it's turbulent past. "
Much better than I thought it would be.,Well worth a visit if you are in town.Ok so there is a fair bit of propaganda but there is so much other interesting material it makes up for that.The quality of the exhibitions are also first class and amongst the best I have seen.
"Nice army museum, great military displays","Former HQ of ROK army, all made for the glory of the Army and other nations during the Korean War. A little propaganda. "
A reminder for peace ;),"It's great to know how the Korean people values the help extended to them by the different nationalities who are UN members in getting peace back to Korea. It is Unfortunate , that the time for re-unification is still a dream for the time being. A great way to learn about the resilience of the Korean people in the 3 dark years of their history. "
dmz visit,"A must see for all who visit Seoul. After a video presentation, we took a short rail trip through one of the tunnels. Then viewed over the border to N Korea.Finally on the way back we stopped at Gloucester Hill memorial park. The Korean authorities are to be congratulated on their new memorial in front of the original one built by the British soldiers."
Brilliant and moving,"This came out well on trip advisor so I decided to visit and I wasn't disappointed. The museum is a stunning building and the lake, park and memorials outside give a sense of a desire for peace and unity,remembering conflict but not glorifying victory. There are any interesting outside exhibits of planes ,tanks and guns.a children's museum is also being developed which I am sure will be excellent. It's due to finish in August. Inside again there are memorials in the stunning domes and a very clear and comprehensive explanation of the Korean War with plenty of testimony from those who took part. I had no idea so many nations were involved. There also appeared to be a large play area with planes and helicopters hanging above. I did find the lay out a bit confusing and realise the war is viewed from a South Korea,UN prospective!"
Great place for learn history,"For those who love history, this is a great place to learn about Korean war. I visited this place on the last day of my South Korea trip. Im not the one who like history but I still find it very enjoyable. It is absolutely free and can take several hours explore to explore the whole museum."
Worth the Trip,It was US Memorial Day and the family decided to visit the Korean War Memorial. Unfortunately they are closed on Monday. We were able to walk the grounds. There are plenty of planes and other military hardware on display. We also walked the halls with all the names of those who gave everything for the freedom of Koreans. One hall was all Korean heroes and the other hall listed the names by United Nation's countries that contributed during the conflict. We'll go back when we can take the tour. English tours are at 10:00 and 14:00 Tuesday through Sunday.
You get a sense of the violation and sacrifice,"This memorial is comprehensive assembly of the military history of Korea and tribute to the veterans. The best parts of the museum are those devoted to the Korean war. At times I wish it had gone deeper into the history and the sequence of battles. You can spend about as long at the museum as you like if you really dig into all the stories and testimonies. That said, sometimes those testimonies are shallow and lack detail. Some knowledge of the sequence of the battles in the Korean war certainly helps one to appreciate the different displays. It is a bit disjointed in its presentation in that some parts seem to be chronologically out of sequence. You do get a real sense of the feeling of violation to be invaded by a hostile neighbor and the sacrifice that was made which at times appeared to be a losing cause (fortunately it did not end that way). In that sense, the memorial is an effective tribute. Outside it has a very extensive collection of military hardware including tanks and aircraft. This site is easily reached by subway and food is available on site."
Nice place to look into,I like that it has many interesting weapons to see. The place is also quite big so there is a wide variety of things to look at
good,had a good time there. Nice to visit with family and friends..easy to access through subway or bus...
One of Our Favorite Stops in Korea!,"You can literally spend hours in this museum. The variety of artifacts is astounding. They provide maps and information in many languages so navigating and getting background on the exhibits is very easy. We're really glad that we went on a sunny day. They have tanks, rockets, planes, boats and many other wartime transportation available to look at, some to even go into. This was one of my husband's favorite places that we visited in Seoul and it was FREE! A museum like this in the US could easily charge a $30+ admission fee, we were very pleased."
awesome place but takes a long time,"its a half day activity, if u wanna do something else in the same day be there before opening coz this museum is huuuuge ! and its freeits the best war museum that i ve seen.... maaany tanks, airplanes, weapons and much more !"
Heart of the Story,"A truly worthy experience - spend some time here getting in touch with this nation's turbulent yet hopeful history. Normally not much of a museum crawler, I felt nonetheless drawn to this place and ended up spending half the afternoon here. The displays are excellent and punctuated with short virtual reality shows. Even English speakers will find their way easily and Korean volunteers are available to tell their own stories of the war and subsequent events. These eloquent and unassuming wardens of the past give many memorable insights into the present day Korean psyche."
I felt patriotic,"I was reluctant to go at first cause I usually do not have a thing with museum. But this museum unlike others. The museum itself its a great building to look at. at area outside filled with a lot of monuments of ships, flights, people soldiers. and when you enter the museum, You will first go to a dome, where there is a light from at top, symbolising hope. I was stung with emotions. The whole experience in and outside the museum was great. I wish my country can build something like this. It is a must go place if your in Seoul."
Best Museum in a long time,"Just brilliant - so much to see, watch and listen to. Very comprehensive review of the Korean conflict. A stunning building from inside and out. Great outside array of planes and tanks. I only had 3 hours but could have speny double that. Its also free so next time I am passing thru Seoul, I'll probbaly go and finish off what I started"
Incredible insight,"Interesting insight for Americans to see the war from the Korean perspective. It is a huge museum, so plan some time to absorb it all.  "
Great place to spend half a day,"There were both indoor and outdoor exhibits.Outside the museum, there was a wide variety of tanks, airplanes etc on display.Inside we found a most vivid and comprehensive history of Korea from centuries ago to modern times. I spent a good few hours walking through the various exhibits. It was definitely eye-opening and interesting."
Class-trip,"I visited the War Memorial of Korea with my class. We had a Korean guide who explained everything related to the Korean War and Korean politics in English! Even though we just had two hours, he succeded to explain lots of stuff in just a short time. It was very interesting and me and my classmates got to learn a lot about this sad part of Korean history!"
The no.1 Seoul Attraction,This is one of the best military museums in the world. There are exhibits such as the gunboat with shell & cannon holes in the hull to several aircraft including a B52 and Mig 15 and an F4 Phantom which were being repainted. There are various missiles including a Scud from the North. The number of exhibits one can climb over is amazing! The main building has three floors all of which have interactive features and the roll of honour of all the UN countries who lost servicemen in the war with the North in the early fifties. A full day is just about long enough to see everything and it is all free!! A really great day out.
huge,Huge. It may take a couple visits to see it all. Very interesting lots to learn. Of course its told from a certain point of view.
Great Museum!,"This is an extremely well maintained museum. The entire courtyard outside is full of planes, ships, and monuments to those that died in the Korean War. The inside incudes a collection of artifacts from throughout the history of Korea (some things were from 100BC). The museum is laid out very well and child friendly! Our 4 year old niece was with us and remained entertained the whole time. There were lots of seats and vending machines so, we felt like we could take our time. The museum is free and relatively close to other attractions."
"war, tanks and weapons",ok interresting to visit so to understand korean history and korean concerns about the north. The style is the one of propaganda though. I would not trust the information given there to make myself an informed opinio about the war or about korean politics. Fun to play with big guns anyway
Great tour!,"We had the English language tour, was very helpful. Lots and lots of exhibits. The outside equipment was great for the kids. Lots and lots of photo's! Will go back again and again."
Good Place to learn about Korea,This place is awesome and just so rich about the history of North and South Korea. Definitely a must see place.!
Fanstastic!,"We had a fantastic afternoon here. We didn't realise it was going to be so big! Lots and lots of rooms with lots of information.We learned a lot about a bunch of different parts of Korea's War History all the way back to ancient times.Lots of seats and vending machines around so you can take a break if you need to.Also a small refec style cafe downstairs where you can get a sandwich if you get hungry.The highlight is the collection of planes, tanks, and missiles outside. Don't miss it!"
A Couple of Points,"With so many good reviews, I wasn’t sure I could add value with one more, but I do think there are a couple important points. First, it is not a Korean War Memorial, and by that I mean it is not just about what westerners think of as the Korean War. It is a memorial to many more battles and wars going back thousands of years. Second, the admission is free and there are free guided tours as well. When we went, there were two options for a free tour at 10 AM - the official one and one given by a volunteer from Visit Seoul Walking Tours. We chose the volunteer. At first we wondered if we made the right choice, since his English was not quite as good as the official guide, but he gave us a longer, more in-depth and quite a personal tour. If you are pressed for time, go with the official tour. If you have the time, go with the volunteer guide."
excellent,Shows had sad the civil war was..A good preview for to the DMZ going to North Korea..and the DMZ where you are a few feet inside North Korea.. Youncould spend a day here..
You must visit this Memorial,This is an extraordinary memorial and very moving. You should visit this and the museum as it is fascinating and gives a good insight into the country's history.
touching place,"a very touching place. shows the pain and suffering of war. very good and free entry for everyone. the outside are has an exhibition of ships, planes and tanks so awesome for kids and adults!"
Good Memorial,"It has a very good timeline of the war and the events surrounding it, as well as many other interesting details. Whilst it was a very informative visit I felt rather sad at the end of my visit due to the nature of the events it was immortalizing. Still worth a visit to learn about some of Korea's history."
Wow! surprised at how great it was!,"I visited this memorial on a whim after reading the reviews. I was truly surprised at how great it was particularly since I am a person who does not really care for military type exhibits. I learned a lot about the Korean War, the region, and the country from visiting the museum. I was truly touched and amazed repeatedly. The videos and presentations are very good. I've never felt a deeper respect for the people who fight and die for freedom than at this memorial. This is excellent and definitely worth seeing."
History of Korean War,"The museum is free to visit and got a lot of exhibits there about the histroy and wars in Korea, especially about the Korean War. The museum is large and so if you are serious about viewing everything then you have to leave a day there. Lots of stuff to see inside and it is quite an experience to learn the history from the local's point of view. There is also a large outdoor exhibition on those airplanes and tank and battle equipment where you can touch and climb up on. The famous two brothers statue was right at the entrance and reminds people how war has done to those families. "
excellent place with kids,"i didn't spend enough time to check out the whole site, but the war machines show outside were very exciting toy for young and old. Worth checking.outside especially if you are visiting the site as family."
very solemn,"the place gave me the chills and respect for all of the men and women who served their country in this terrible conflict.I did not fully understand this war as compared to the other WW II and Vietnam.the depiction,displays and representation feels surreal as if it takes you back in time of the actual event. "
"Excellent memorial...so tasteful, informative and larger than expected","What a well done memorial...both of my grandfathers fought in the war (1 US Navy and 1 Air Force) so this was particularly special for me to visit. The memorial is much larger than the pictures online show and it is great to see all the nations that fought together represented. Walking up to the memorial, the 2 statues out front are impactful and beautiful, one of two soldiers from opposite sites embracing and the other showing a cross-section of people impacted by the war. To the right of them, there are 30-40 planes, tanks, missiles, etc that have been retired, some used in Korea and others in Vietnam of since the war. It is really a great exhibit for Children and Adults alike and it appeared that they are also working on a Children's Museum which should be done soon. This is one place where you don't need a guide or audio as all the history and explanations are displayed in multi-lanugages. I highly recommend it for anyone visiting Seoul!!"
Good overview of the Korean War history,We did not have a lot of time. So we just visited the war history rooms. The overview of the war history was a good display. Sufficiently well explained in English such that non Korean speaker could appreciate. The sculptures on the grounds were very grand. 
Good for a very basic historical background,"Free admission with many retired military vehicles, planes and weapons outside the museum to check out. The area around the museum is an nicely organized public space also.We stopped by in advance of our DMZ tour, and the main Korean War exhibit was helpful in providing a lot of background historical information. Those looking for a more comprehensive and balanced account though will have to do their own research however. But again, the exhibits provide a good basic introduction, though some are arguably overdone while others have interesting omissions."
Highly Recommend a Visit,"My husband and I were in Seoul to visit our son and new granddaughter; we had the opportunity to visit The War Memorial of Korea while we were there in April. It is a wonderful experience and very informative. The outside exhibits of war machines such as a B52 bomber, and other equipment is interesting. The sculptures are also beautiful. I recommend if you visit Seoul you take the time to visit, it is an important part of our history with the Korean people."
A must visit,You can expect to spend a few hours here just experiencing all the different corners of the memorial. From the museum to the outdoor areas. Highly recommend it!
Memorable and moving museum,Impressively laid out - the War Memorial of Korea is a highly educational museum that everyone heading to Seoul should visit. One cannot really enjoy Seoul without understanding the reasons behind how it has developed to the current day - recognizing the sacrifices and losses that some had to make in the past.
A must see if you are interested in Korea's history and involvement in many conflicts,"If you are interested in the history of South Korea's involvement in many wars, then this is a must see! Even my kids, girls at that, enjoyed the detailed and significant amount of war artifacts and the museums overall presentation. One of the best ways to spend your vacation in South Korea, for FREE. Yes, there is NO entrance fee - just get yourself there."
Personal Meaning,"I wanted to see this memorial because my father served in the US Navy in Korea in the 1950s. If you're going by subway, take either #4 or #6 train to the Samgakji stop. You'll walk only about 2 blocks to the museum from the Metro exit. The Korean War Memorial is one of the most amazing war tributes I've ever seen. The manner in which beautiful modern art is interwoven into such a sad theme is emotionally overwhelming. I was holding back tears when I'd barely set foot on the soil. There's a sobering, larger than lifesize sculpture at the entrance entitled ""Brothers"" positioned on an orb representing Korea. The land is cracked in two segments, and a soldier on one side has collapsed into the arms of the soldier on the other side. You'll need tissue here ...On the outer yard to one side of the museum are displays of the monstrous machinery of war - from a B-52 bomber and war planes, to armored tanks, to various types of rockets. Even a PT boat is raised above a pond. The most gorgeous multi-colored azalea shrubs bloom prolifically in every direction, amidst the powerful machinery of death. An interesting display outside includes the flags of 23 allied countries who fought alongside South Korea when they were attacked from the north.There is no charge for admission to any part of the museum. Most displays have interpretations in English.Inside the museum is an astonishingly moving dedication to those who lost their lives in the country's wars. The first section reminded me of the dark, starry ceiling-ed room of the Holocaust memorial at Yad Vesham in Jerusalem. You can light a candle here in memorium. I was shocked to learn that almost 4 million civilians were killed in the Korean War. The inner room honoring those who died has an incredible water memorial, sculptured wall reliefs, and a floor sculpture representing a tomb.If interested, you can go farther into the museum and get the full history of the nation's wars, going back as far as the year 7 A.D.A little gift shop sits near the front entrance, which carries good quality souvenirs. Hubby bought a nice T-shirt for about $18 US. I highly recommend seeing this memorial."
Very touching.,Beautiful tribute to all who served their country. Interesting collection of war machines. Take a taxi or metro or you may have difficulty finding it due to the large military base in proximity. 
Exceptional Museum. A Must See.,"Beautifully laid out, it takes you on a journey through the history of the Korean military and their nation's conflicts, culminating in fascinating historical displays from the 1950's. It's a beautiful monument to the insanity of war. I wish I'd taken more Kleenex. If you're into posing with artillery and planes, the vast outside display of vintage tanks and fighters are also accessible to visitors. "
"War, What is it Good For?","Went to the War Memorial of Korea to learn more about the Korean War and for more background information before our trip to the DMZ the next day. I was blown away by how well this museum told the story of the Korean War with all the artifacts, interactive exhibits, and even special effects. Even my wife, who wasn't really looking forward to going to this museum, found it engaging, poignant, and powerful. And there's also so much more to the museum than the Korean War. The museum dedicates a substantial portion of the building to all the wars that have taken place throughout Korean history. The outside of the museum is also pretty spectacular with a large military arsenal of out of commission vehicles, ships, rockets, and planes. The courtyard in front of the building is pretty grand and we were lucky enough to see an afternoon military procession come through. Definitely give yourself at least half a day for this awesome museum, which is free!"
History of Korean War,"The War Museum is totally worth it. Free admission and beautiful memorial. After all the exhibit from the indoors, there's also many aircraft and tank display to view from the outside.Can take photo with friends. Very well worth the time to visit."
A Must See,"If you go nowhere else in Seoul; do visit the War Memorial of Korea.Over three floors, and with an outside area devoted to war machinery, it tells the, often poignant, story of the Korean conflict. It covers the political machinations which shaped the war, various important battles, the effect on the people, the involvement of the UN and much mote besides.My wife and I went twice last week and will go again when we return to Seoul next year.You need to go."
Thorough Korean War History,"Unless you were directly involved in the Korean War, you probably don't know much about how and why it came about. Even as a history buff and versed with the war itself, I learned a lot here about the conditions that led to the war -- the pre-WWII Japanese occupation, the partitioning of Korea into the Soviet and U.S. camps after the war, and the factors that led to the North Korean invasion. This is a huge place. Not wanting to spend a whole day here, I spent 2 hours in the three ""War"" rooms and felt I had gotten what I came her for. There are many other displays inside, and Korean War vintage aircraft to be seen outside. Bottom line, a very worthwhile visit for those who want (and should have!)) a better understanding of this time. (Even my wife, who is not into museums of this type, appreciated what she learned here and was glad she took the time for this.)"
A very important place to visit,A great way to spend a short time. The entire memorial can be enjoyed in an hour. Free entrance. A beautiful memorial. Well sculpted with plenty of English explanation. Many aircraft and tank displays to view from the outside. 
Amazing!!!!!,"The place is a collection of all the things S. Korea used for the war. It's amazing how big the airplanes, tanks"
Awesome place to visit,"Many exhibits on display at the memorial area. Will spend hours easily over there if you are eye of details especially on Korean war, a must go if you're keen in modern Korean history."
Essential - sobering and awesome!,"It's only once you visit the museum that you can put Seoul in context - how it rebuilt itself in 60 years.For me, the highlights were being up close and personal with a cobra attack helicopter, Phantom jet and B52 bomber. But the interactive exhibitions in the huge halls were equally interesting and informative. Many of the rooms are interactive which brings the events to life without being OTT or cheesy. Had a thoroughly enjoyable three hours here with my wife patiently taking a zillion photos of me and the planes and tanks!"
Awesome,Best war museum I've been to yet. Unbelievably large. It will take you a whole day to get through so plan accordingly. 
great overview of Korean war,Excellent history lesson easy to get to via subway and it is free. Displays in English. Highly recommend going before DMZ tour
Must Visit,One of my favorite museum visit in Seoul apart from the National Museum. It is a place not to be missed. There are so much information specially for those who want to learn more about Korea. It is accessible by Metro with just a short walk and the other good thing is its free entrance. Alot 3-4 hours for this visit. I found the visit fun and entertaining for kids and adults alike.
Eye opening,"If you are 1st time to Korea / Seoul , it is a must to visit place.Very educational and eyes opening, quite an interesting place to go as there are 4D movies and lot of real life weapons to see.Can be quite fun for kids and adult best of ALL , it's free!"
Very interesting museum,"Interesting and interactive, thanks to this museum, one can learn a lot about the War of Korea. It was one of my favourite museums in all Seoul. The entrance is free!"
Very Good Place,This museum is a huge museum and have different varities on war memorial. Very well organized. English guide is available but on specific time. Too much to cover in one day but it is possible to cover whole museum in one day. Were tired end of the day but liked this place.
Fascinating and informative,This place has some really good exhibits and is really well designed. I guess it's the first stop for most people doing the DMZ tour as it gives and intro and an insight into the war.
Super museum,"Our entire family enjoyed this sprawling museum and its grounds. They have a large outdoor space filled with tanks, planes, helicopters, and ships, most of which you can touch or climb on, which my 14 and 11 year old loved. Inside there are 3 floors of displays and movies, all have English translation. We spent 4 hours and time flew by it was so interesting!"
The Forgotten War is Memorialised Very Well,"For any traveler to South Korea, this memorial gives a great visual history of the trials and tribulations of a war many of us know very little about. It is a somber reminder of how cruel people can be, even to their own race/ethnic group."
The Parade,"Not too sure if it's a regular thing but I was there on a Fri around 2.30pm and there was this military parade. Mascots, traditional costume and modern military parade. I missed the first two but the military portion was pretty awesome on its own with flagbearers and general rifle tossing. After the parade was over, the local high school girls squealed and dashed for their dreamboats to have their photos taken. Fun and a total contrast to the sombreness within the museum.Lots of military history and there were attempts to liven up what could have been a very static experience - video installations, 3D dioramas, huge replicas (1/25) of ancient warships.Other photo opportunities abound outside the museum with the display of planes and tanks."
Very moving,"Tremendous display of wars fought in Korea. It is obviously very Korea centric, but has displays and information about Korea's allies who fought with them during the Korean War. Well worth visiting. Extensive display of tanks, artillery, helicopters, airplanes, and a B-52 bomber outside the museum. No fee for entry. Well worth the time to visit. "
Do It,"This was one of my favorite spots when we visited last fall. The museum was beautiful as the stories it holds. Its a short walk from the metro so its very accessible plus its free. Just go, you won't regret it."
Excellent Museum,"This is a very good museum for young and old. Lots of information displays using a variety of medium. There are also static displays. It covers ancient to modern Korean military history. There is English on many displays and media, but still a lot in Hangul so you miss some context. There is a show at 1400 on Fridays during certain times of the year. We saw it today and it is a very good show. I would make sure you go on a Friday to catch this show. It is stroller/wheel chair accessible. It is free. I recommend this museum."
Interesting visit,"Visited the memorial today and considered the time well spent. The grounds and the exhibits are massive and showcase a wide range of aircraft, armor and ships. I especially loved being able to view close up the Phantom and Cobra aircraft. You can also learn more about Korea's military history as well as the UN's key involvement. There are a couple of cafes or you can bring your own food and have a picnic on the grounds.The only negative was that they need a minimum of five visitors for each show, such as the F15 Eagle, but there were not to many visitors early in the morning so I had to miss out. So, if possible, go with a larger group. Do also look out for the huge statues of the two hugging brothers, who were fighting for both the North and South and who met on the battlefield."
Big place to explore!,I really like how amazing you can see all their military history of korea and it's such a big place for you to explore and learn more. Great place to go!
Crash course on Korean war history,"This comprehensive museum really helps understanding the unique history as well as the backround of the present day circumstances in Korean peninsula. While presenting the history from the South Korean point of view, the museum manages to be neutrally informative instead of giving a propagandistic view of any of the participants at any given time. We happened to visit the museum before the trip to the DMZ and I totally recommend this particular order, since you'll be equipped with so much more basic knowledge to get the most out of the DMZ visit."
A great way to spend the day,"Very interesting and informative. A great day out for people of all ages, the memorial is absolutely beautiful and extremely well put together. A must see in Seoul."
Go if you wish to understand why Korea South and North,"Very interesting and plenty of things to see.In the begining I was a bit lost because I though there was not enough English translation but as you move on, things become clear and well documented.I felt like it was really worth to go. I learned a lot. I spent there almost 3 hours including a snack break.There was no entrance free."
Don't miss it!,"I missed this last time I was in Seoul but managed to make it this time and very happy I did. This is a wonderful, respectful memorial to the many people and countries that participated in the Korean War.All displays are multilingual, English speakers will have no problems participating or reading any of the displays. I spent about two hours there but could have spent more. There are lots of exhibits and items on display, from small bullets all the way to a B-52. They have items from both sides so you get a very good idea of what the forces on both sides had available. There also displays from Korea's early history that were interesting.The entire museum, outside and inside is free and appears to be very accessible to those with special needs. Look for the elevator signs on the exterior and that will take you the main floor. Once there you will also find elevators to take you to each floor. There is ample room in the display areas if you are in a wheel chair or on crutches. It is very friendly in that sense.There is a small gift shop, mostly for kids, and cafe in the museum if you need a quick snack. If you drive, there is underground parking available.I can't forget to mention that it is a memorial and it is tastefully done. I was impressed by the panels placed in the exterior wings that honored all of the deceased allies. The names were listed by country and the US deceased were listed alphabetically by name and state. The list includes servicemen from the US commonwealths as well, so Puerto Rico, etc. Were also there. Beneath each panel there was a fresh white carnation which, I was told, is replaced everyday. Very nice touch and contributed to the solemnity of this area.Another very nice touch is the huge sign across from the memorial that says ""Thank you United Nations for your help"" and then shows the flags of every country that sent combatants and non combatants to support the South Koreans.I liked this a lot and will go again."
A must go,"The statues are majestic and the place is huge. The outdoor area consists of wide array of tanks, planes and helicopters that are once commissioned by the S.Korea military forces, they are all laid out nicely for folks to take pictures with. There is a museum indoors which covers war stories that took place on the soil of korea including the 'three kingdoms', Goguryeo, Baekje and Silla; Overall its a great place to learn and photo-taking."
Cool!,I thought I would not enjoy this place and just went for husband's sake. Did not include this place first time I visited Korea. Glad we did this time as I enjoyed learning about history a well as the actual footages taken during the war and shown as videos. I also loved the computer-assisted presentations simulating the war. Actual war plane/ chopper/ boats are also displayed at the entrance of the museum. I highly recommend including this in your itinerary.
Best I have seen in Seoul so far.,Very interesting. Didn't dislike anything. Takes several hours. Plenty to see. Lots of historical and military equipment.
a must see,"the history of war in South Korea is a sad one, the museum is full of real planes and choppers. The art depicting the war was thought provoking and interesting."
A Good Experience!,"It is a nice place for those that are interested in wartime engines, such as Aircrafts, Ships and Tankers that are being used in the Korean War. As they have almost all 1:1 figures out in the open air concept on display! Some of the tankers are also open and we can view it inside on how is it like and could also go in to experience the atmosphere. However, there is no shelter and it may be sunny at times. It was overall a great place to visit :)"
"Great displays, cool vehicles and planes","Inside there was info on those who served and lost thier lives, hisotry and memorobilia. Outside was a vast ""park"" filled with numerous tanks, large arms and very cool warplanes. There was even a ship!"
Place you wish would not exist,"This is the place you wish would not exist, not because of its standard but because of the reason behind it. Anyhow the place shows you the reality of war and how it was. It's not trying to show dramatic scenes, more like document of Korean history. Building is huge but it won't take so many hours to see what they have in there. We were lucky enough to see also military parade rehearsal with sword fights, various formations and gun handling shows."
Insightful,"I think its a must visit also for travelers - It is a great insight into the war history of Korea. The symbols used helps you understand their hope of unification and the pain of the division caused. On the other hand, my boyfriend enjoyed all the military hardware displayed which were all used during the war. "
History that is meaningful,I really enjoyed this place and the education value of it. May South Korea never forget the tragedy of war and be prepared to defend their country if needed.
review of war memorial of Korea,Best things you should not miss are 4D theater which simulates Incheon landing during korean war. 3D theatetr which gives you the feeling of flying Mig 15 fighter jet is also a wonderful experience. the way original documents of Korean war were stored is excellent. I could not find any shortcomings in this war memorial..
More than a memorial,"This memorial consists of an outdoor area with lots of military vehicles including a replica of a boat that was attacked by North Korea in 2002...very compelling. We're no experts but everyone in our party found it fascinating. Inside is a multi-story museum with exhibits on Korea's military history from ancient times to the present. It was all very well-done. Our favorite was the wing on the Korean War, though my boys also loved the top floor on modern warfare. We all learned so much. It's been said before, but give yourself plenty of time. Definitely worth the visit."
A good history of Korea,"This was a good educational experience. As an American, I learned a lot about the war in the 1950's as well as history that dated back 2500 years.As usual with these kind of museums, do not expect to leave happy. It is a museum about conflict and war and that is always depressing for me. But it is worth going and is very well laid out.The entrance was free which was an added bonus considering the cost of everything in Seoul."
Very informative,"The museum was very informative. Lots of interactive and multimedia displays. The museum is large, so give yourself ample time."
Excellent memorial - a lot learned!,"I was very impressed with the entire building and grounds, including the vehicles and other monuments from the war. The building itself has several levels - my favorite was the UN section. I never realized how many countries were involved and it prompted me to do more research when I got home.Be sure to allow plenty of time to explore, and don't rush!"
Very impressive,"The statute of brothers left a great impact on me. The museum is very well organized. There are educational sessions for elementary kids in Korean - I am impressed, it will be great if they have English sessions for kids too but It is too much to ask for. We missed the English tour for all, buy it is easy to follow the arrows which indicate the flow. You must visit this place if you haven't, strongly recommended. Free admission."
Must see,"The Korean war memorial is a deifinite visit, though it feels a little off putting knowing that it is surrounded by American military bases and the westerner district it gives you the sense that this may not really be as Korean as you might believe. The pieces are exquisite and the layering of pieces is amazing as you start at the bottom in the ancient era and ascend to the modern. The Korean war section is excellent though filled with tons of propoganda and from that point on you feel as if the museum is slowly turning into one giant recruitment strategy, but aside from this biasis nature you are in for a treat as you Korean history come to life."
Fantastic - could spend the whole day here,"I knew very little about the Korean War before visiting here, but we came one afternoon, spent well over an hour outside looking at the Memorial and all of the planes, tanks, rockets and helicopters before getting inside the museum. It is so imaginative in the way it puts the information across, and we stayed another couple of hours, beforerg returning for another morning the next day. It was fantastic and immaculate, but fun as well. I was very moved by the exhibits showing the countries that assisted South Korea in the war, and the respect that was shown towards them. It was free to enter and lots of English information. "
Takes the word Memorial to a new height,Stunning Memorial. A must see. I have a photograph of my father who fought in the Korean War as an American saluting a group of young Korean soldiers. Forever embedded in my mind the true meaning of 'Memorial'.Allow a couple of hours especially if traveling with a Veteran as this will be a very personal journey.
Most enjoyable museum in Seoul!,"The war memorial was very informative and very well structured (unlike the national museum), I recommend allowing 3 hours at least especially if you are interested in North/South Korean wars. Also the entrance is for free!"
Nice outdoor display,"i arrived late around 5.30pm, too late for the museum tour which closed at 6pm. But the outdoor display of planes, tanks, heli, cannon n missiles made the trip worthwhile. Some have stairs built-in which u can climb up for a closer view. Good for children..."
Beautiful memorial and fascinating museum,"This place definitely deserves the #1 spot on Seoul's list of attractions - it is brilliant. I had a limited amount of time, so I focused my attention on the three rooms dedicated to the Korean War. There is so much to see and do inside, and the exhibits are so high-tech! One of the things that amazed me was the amount of audio-visual material, and all of it gave you the option of watching the videos with subtitles in either English, Korean, Chinese or Japanese. One scene that I was perusing featured four soldiers filling their water bottles at a river, and when I pressed the button a holograph appeared, animating one of them!I didn't see all of the memorial, but the information provided about the Korean War was detailed and compelling, and I felt quite educated when I left! When I return to Seoul (there is no 'if' about it - the city is amazing and I can't wait to visit again!) I intend to head back to the War Memorial and see the rest of it. Considering it was a free attraction, I was amazed by how brilliant it was. Definitely not to be missed!"
Outstanding site!,We enjoyed all of the exhibits and the history; even our 4 year old was able to enjoy the old planes and tanks on display. Incredible exhibit on the Korean War. 
Amazing Stuff,"Now i know why this is ranked number 1. This memorial is more like a museum, with massive ranges of history from all around the globe. There are also amazing displays of weapons, machinery and everything you can basically think of from rockets to battleships. The outdoor part of the memorial is a football field sized area with tanks, planes, rockets and various artillery weapons. This War Memorial would probably be number 1 in the world is amazing."
understanding south korea,the memorial gave me a good sense of the path that korea had travelled to get where they are today. it is sad that such devastation could be done to a country. but a proud and disciplined and polite people you could ever meet.great displays and interactive shows
Nice Historic Museum,Nicely put together museum. An interesting hour to learn about what really happened. Very well designed and shown.
"a foreigner's must see, especially, for Americans","This place is whole lot more than a museum, rather like a historic field. lots of military planes exhibited outside the museum and above all open space before the entry,not only for those war memorial monuments and memories but also the optimum place for photo shot as well."
Good window into Korea's history,"Visiting Korea's war memorial and museum is a window into the country's modern culture and perspective. While the bottom floor is dedicated to ancient Korean history and wars, a full two floors are reserved for dissecting and documenting the Korean War of the 1950s. While the museum is incredibly patriotic, what war museum isn't? As a temporary Korean resident the museum gave me huge insights into why many Koreans maintain certain viewpoints in mainstream life. Plan to spend a good few hours in there, but it's free so you can always go back a second time."
Best museum ever!,I spent 6 hours exploring this museum (while hungover) and felt like I didn't get enough. I can't wait to go back! It's awesome checking out all the planes and tanks outside.
"Slightly militant, but good intro to Korean War","Perhaps understandably, the museum is a bit one-sided and very pro-South Korean military, but it still does a good job of describing the history of the war as well as showing it through both interactive exhibits (think cheesy 4D shows) as well as a very large collection ofmemorabilia ranging from uniforms to tanks. "
Peaceful,i like the peacefulness of the place .... if u like to know a little bit about korean history ... this is a must !!
"If you like Korean history, you must visit this museum","Outside of the museum, there is the famous statue of two men, a South Korean and a North Korean hugging one another. When you pass them, you will come across a field with many different aircraft and land vehicles. Once you enter the museum (admission is free), you can view many different exhibits that focus on weapons used, nations who provided aid and assistance, war vehicles, etc. At the end of the museum is a beautiful room used as a monument. If you are interested in Korean history, then this museum is definitely a must see."
Educational and beautifully done.,"As soon as we saw the magnificent statues out the front we knew we would like this place. They place great emphasis on the help they got from other nations during the Korean War. The displays were very interesting and we learnt heaps about Korea's history.When you leave, walk along the side that lists all those from other countries who gave their lives. The American names are listed not just by country but by state. You hear about the casualties of war but this really hits home, especially for a non American."
Great for kids,The indoor portion was informative and interactive and the outdoor sections were great because you could climb on the equipment
Worth Visiting,A well designed and fascinating museum. You cannot understand modern Korea without understanding the turmoil of the Korean War.
A Must See,This place is huge. They have nice exhibits and you will learn a lot about the Korean war. If you are an American you will be proud what we do for other countries. It is really great to be an American.
Evening we'll spent,"Visited the war memorial yesterday. It's about 20minutes downhill walk from Itaewon station. You can even hire a taxi for 3000won. But preferred to walk. The entrance was impressive with real life like statue. Fantastic. On the right side you have all the aircrafts on display. The main museum is further up and easily you will spend at least 3-4 hours of time. It's nicely divided into different sections & describes the Korean War, and also the history of Korea. On display are various artifacts, military might on display. The best part is there are different audio video sections with options to hear in English, Korean, Chinese & Japanese. It's worth visiting and should not miss it.Forgot to mention they even provide a free locker facility & have guided tours in English in the morning hours( before two)."
Great place to visit and its free,Lots to see outside including a great collection of tanks and aircraft. Inside there is enough to keep you busy and interested for several hours. 
Must see when in Seoul,"Many positive reviews already exist and I fully agree. Nice way of getting to know more about Korean war, Korean culture, ... all presented in a very nice way. Do take into account you'll need multiple hours for this visit unless you want to skip many great things."
War is revolting,I have been to this museum 2 times in the past month. I still don't feel like I've seen everything. There is so much to see there and it has history of other wars in Korea aside from the Korean war as well as other Asian wars. 
A great museum!,"This is a great place to wander and the best part is that it's free! A great way to learn about the Korean war as well as the country's military history from ancient times. The museum is pretty big and has an awesome outside site with war planes, tanks, missiles! There's also a cool replica of the turtle ship used by Admiral Yi Sun Shin in the famous Battle of Myeongnyang where he defeated the Japanese navy outnumbered 100-some ships to 13. The museum also has a cool room built like the inside of a command room of a destroyer (I think) and also shows the structure of the lead ship of the navy fleet with the Aegis combat system. There's also an exhibit focusing on the experience of the South Korean forces in the Vietnam War. All in all, the War Memorial is a great place with great visuals and exhibits to learn more about the military history of South Korea as well as to commemorate its wartime past (but technically I think it's still at 'war' with the North). Great for kids or a rainy day tourist activity as well. "
Great museum,Very interesting. Korea has a very interesting history. Was glad to see that Korea is very appreciative of Americas help during their war with the North.
The most comprehensive account of korean wars completely FREE,"This massive building offers a great piece of history about korean wars: here we had one of the most comprehensive lessons of history we've ever attend. And everything is free of charge (don't miss to put some money in the donation box at the entrance).We focused especially on 50's korean war following its progression step by step. Everywhere there are interactive installations where children can approch history in a easier way and the tribute to UN is amazing: all plaques and inscriptions remember the visitors that South Korea could not exists if UN forces wouldn't have been fighting the North Korean invasors.The ouside area is full of military airplanes, tanks and even a submarine riddles with bullet holes. Children can enjoy themselves also going up and down the tanks approching history in a quicker (and not boring at all!) way. South Korea is a very ""child-friendly"" country!"
best and very informative war museum ive ever been too.,"It was good,informative,and cheap to enter. Definatly a must see for any military historian or any army nut."
Wonderful Museum Filled with Important History,"This is a fabulous museum filled with important historical data, artifacts and stories of the Korean War. If you're a history junkie, you'll appreciate this museum. There's a lot to see within the museum so you can either visit over two days or spend upwards of four hours. We did what we could within two-plus hours. Museum is also kid-friendly with lots of interactive exhibits."
Good Memorial,"I enjoyed seeing the war from Korea's point of view instead of just reading about it in the US. MY parents came to Korea and enjoyed the memorial as well. Lots to see, good mix of historic wars as well as recent wars."
Beautifully Displayed and Very Comprehensive Museum - Full Day Stop,"The War Memorial of Korea is more than just a memorial, it is a comprehensive and very well organized history of the years of conflict that have shaped Korea into what it is today. The outside of the museum has dozens of well preserved tanks, artillery pieces, and other ground vehicles along with a dozen planes and a couple of ships. The true substance of the museum is discovered inside. There are three floors of exhibits that take the visitor on a journey from ancient Korea through the Korean War, and into their modern military era. The exhibits are all in Korean as well as English and there is a decent mix of traditional exhibits and interactive exhibits. To truly experience the museum I would recommend planning to spend at least half a day, if not more. I actually had to come back a second time because I arrived too late in the day the first time I came. If you are in Seoul, I would certainly put the War Memorial at the top of your to-do list."
Important to GO,It was important for me to know more about Japan / Korea war ..There are many interesting photos and you will see the prisons and ways that were used to kill prisoners ! ... You should visit this place
AWESOME,"My husband and I enjoyed our visit to this place. Very informative and for people like us who enjoy these kind of stuff, our visit to the War Memorial of Korea is one for the books.  The aircrafts, missiles, tanks, etc. on display outside, were very impressive. Inside we were transported back in time to a well-thought of narration of Korea and the struggles it had to endure. Now we have a better understanding of this country and how their freedom and triumph should be treasured and protected.A visit to this place is strongly recommended. We visited late in the afternoon already so this gives us more than enough reason to visit it again on our next trip to Seoul!"
Massive,Could be in there for days. Only like interactive museums and this had tonnes of it. You need to be selective what you look at - don't feel you have to do every room - some of the best stuff is at the end.
Very touching ,"We came here straight after our DMZ tour to soak in the full experience. The musuem is huge and it shows that south korea is fiercely proud of their war efforts. The musuem was free which is nit often the case in Asia. I really enjoyed the exhibits and was touched by the memoirs of the soldiers. We spent about 3 hours but did not manage to explore the whole musuem as it was nearing closing time. We were not sure if there were exhibitions for other wars in korea's history as we only managed to explore the various korean war exhibits.Great experience and i felt like I learnt a lot about the war after leaving. The musuem is also very interactive with many videos, 4d showings etc. Would definitely recommend!"
An amazing place.,"Really enjoyed my time looking around here. Its a lot bigger than you expect. The outdoor aircraft displays are in fantastic condition. Inside, the displays and exhibits give a lot of information about the history of Korea. I didn't know a lot about Koreas history before but when I left I felt I had attended an in depth course on the matter. It was a bit of an eye opener. It made the rest of my trip to South Korea all the more interesting having gained the knowledge from the museum. Probably one of the most interesting museums I have been to. It is free as well!! :)"
A must visit for War history afficionados,"I like: Interactive presentations, 3D shows. This is one of the highlights of my Seoul trip. I recommend this to anyone who's interested in the North-South Korean War history. Very informative but not boring to look at."
Interesting and informative,"Despite its name, the War Memorial of Korea is much more than a static memorial to a particular past war. The complex includes a vast wedding chapel, a large outdoor collection of recent military hardware, an atrium where operatic songs where performed, and a venue for children's exhibits on the human body and zoo animals. The war memorial portion of the complex employs numerous modern exhibits on the recent conflict. It also surveys several centuries of military history on the Korean peninsula, complete with replicas of ancient naval craft. Most of the exhibits have enough explanation in English for visitors to understand."
Brilliant and interesting museum/memorial,"Firstly there is no entrance fee, so I'd have gave a positive review even if it didn't live up to expectations. But it really did, and probably exceeded them given the size of the place and the quality of the exhibits. Given Korea's war history over the last century there was so much to see, many of which was quite sad to see but extremely interesting. Don't miss the many memorials outside the museum itself, as well as the area to the right of the museum with countless examples of war planes and tanks etc - plenty of photo opportunities!"
Interesting,This was an interesting museum and has some decent exhibits on the Korean war. The information about wars from different dynasties wasn't terribly interesting to me. The virtual shooting gallery at the end of the museum seemed a little tacky.
One of the better museums,"This museum is very well done. I easily spent about three hours looking at everything. I started on the higher floors because the more recent wars are more interesting to me than the more historical battle history of the country. If you take the time to read the exhibits, you will actually learn about war in Korea, as well as Korean history in general."
breathtaking,I very much enjoyed this monument. There is so much detail. You can actually feel what the statues are trying toconvey.
"Very Educational, Lots to See!",Even though we were living in Korea for year we didn't know much about the Korean War. The museum really helped us to understand the history of not only that war but Korea in general. I was very surprised at how large the museum was and how many things there was to see. I would definitely say this is a must see if you are visiting Seoul. Dress for the weather as there is a lot to see outside as well as inside.
Must do while in Seoul,Very informative and nice for all ages. We used the hop on/off bus to get there. It's a nice free thing to do. 
Excellent place to understand this war,I spent almost 3 hours in this place. The materials are very good on presenting the whole history about the korean war from top to bottom. There is also another floor about ancient wars in korea and also the modern korean army. This is a really good place to visit.
The War Memorial of Korea,"Gorgeous memorial. Very well curated. The War Memorial is a must-see when you're in South Korea.It's seriously the biggest, most awesome war museum I've ever seen. The giant reproduction of a turtle warship from the 1500s is probably their flagship piece, but the extensive grounds full of tanks and planes and other engines of war vie for the top spot of most awesome thing to see there. And that's not even taking into account the inside displays of all the canons and various firearms from I guess every military conflict ever to take place on the peninsula. "
Moving,"Gorgeous memorial. Very well curated. Take your time, and see every room. Don't miss this experience. "
Heartbreaking and beautifully done,"The War Memorial is a must-see when you're in South Korea. I didn't know much about the North/South Korean conflict before I visited, but all that has changed now.The War Memorial is huge, and when friends said they easily spent 3 hours there I thought I would be bored out of my mind, or the time would drag. After visiting and spending 4 hours there without even realising it, I know how wrong I was.The displays are interactive and genuinely informative without shoving the information down your throat. It's free entry, and I'm honestly sure that people of all ages will enjoy all it has to offer.I shed a few tears on the third floor (recorded interviews with people who fought) and my heart broke learning about the sacrifice and loss.Definitely recommended, even for people who aren't war/history buffs (I'm certainly not), but prepare to set aside half a day for it."
best war museum I've ever been to,"I used to work at a museum. I was a history major once. I love war. This place is completely awesome. It's seriously the biggest, most awesome war museum I've ever seen. The giant reproduction of a turtle warship from the 1500s is probably their flagship piece, but the extensive grounds full of tanks and planes and other engines of war vie for the top spot of most awesome thing to see there. And that's not even taking into account the inside displays of all the canons and various firearms from I guess every military conflict ever to take place on the peninsula. You'd probably have to spend days to completely take in all they have to offer."
Highly recommend a visit here,"You could easily spend 4 hours here. The outdoor exhibition took us about 1+ hours alone. Many airplanes, tanks, etc. to see. Inside, it's organized on a couple of levels, and actually encompasses more than only the Korean War. It's really a history of warfare in Korea as it spans back to the 1500's. Very interesting. There is no charge for admission."
A MUST!!,"It really impresses.. perfectly organised, majestic and grand. It allows you to deepen into the Korean War and feel all the pain.. The outdoor exhibition is marvellous."
Great Museum,"If you are in Seoul, make time for this. Interactive and interesting. Will go back if I get chance. Well worth the time."
Fantastic,A poignant reminder of Korea's turbulent past. Hugely interesting insight into Korean culture/customs throughout the ages too. A vast collection of weapons and armour. The museum evokes both the horror and futility of war.
Must go,This is a very nice museum with no costs. Don't miss the videos that provided details how USA involved in the war on the second floor. Subway station is five minutes away.
Informative and learned about Korean history,"We loved the War Memorial, it had a lot of good information about the history of the war and those countries that helped during the war. The best part of the place was seeing the tanks and planes outside! Wonderful place to spend an hour or two in. We stayed in Seoul on a budget so this was great as it was FREE."
WAR!,"Great place to go to find out more about the Korean war and the founding of South Korea. Also lots of interesting information about the history of Korea. Plus lots of war machines outside the museum to pose next too, there's even a mustang and mig!"
"Interesting, but not obviously the first thing to visit in Seoul","This is an interesting museum, focussed largely on the 1950-53 Korean War but with material on Korea's other wars too. It is pretty big, and rather chilling. I agree with an earlier reviewer that the Dokdo display near the entrance is inappropriate."
The War Memorial,You could spend a lot of time here. There are lots of interactive displays. Really informative and interesting. Not only does it cover the Korean War but also lots of displays about the Korean army serving abroad in Vietnam and various other peace keeping missions. 
"Huge place, and very green and pleasant","Can reach there using public transit- even if one does not know the language. It is a huge place so be prepared for long long walk. Very well made. Starts with huge door/gates and since it is bang on the main road, it may be a challenge to cross the road. Worth the visit. Very well maintained. "
Thought provoking and makes one realise value of freedom,Great way to spend a few hours walking through history from the view of the Korean people. Artifacts were nicely presented and very informative. The exhibits told a story from beginning of the Korean war to present day and had a lot of visual and audio to go along with it. Gives a sobering view of the cost of freedom and how precious it is to preserve peace and harmony.  
Historical Tour,Lot's of military machineries and historical stuff. Worth the visit. Anyone would not leave the place disappointed. Any visitor to Seoul should stop by and visit this place.
i know some story about korean war,"I like it, i can know the story about korean warAnd i can see beat 131, it's awesomeI also can see the mountain of north korea from the roof top of DMZ"
So much to learn and see,"I would definitely recommend a visit to this huge interactive museum. Best of all it's free, but closed on Mondays. Outside areas include ships, tanks, planes, etc. which you can climb on to get better perspectives. Kids will love that part! Inside the museum there is another area you can get in a jeep, motorcycle with side car, etc. to take pictures, too. Lots of areas with short film clips of not only the Korean War, but of modern day military efforts. Tons of displays, 3d experiences at certain viewing times, different floors for different eras, lots to see and read about. Many displays include translations in English."
Fabulous History,This is a marvelous museum full of fascinating history and it is free! e spent about 2.5 hours here and did not see everything. Would love to go back.
Really fascinating place,"This is a must see in Seoul, especially prior to the DMZ tour. There's a lot to do and see, also hands on exhibits out front, I dont think anyone could be disappointed."
Do not give this a miss......,"As mentioned by many other reviewers here, this attraction is very informative and educational. Very interesting displays of various machines and equipments that was used during the times of conflict. There is more than enough exhibits and displays to keep both the young and old occupied and fascinated.Considering it is free entrance, this attraction is way much better than some of the paid attractions around Seoul."
Monuments outside and exhibition on inside,"Multiple monuments on the outside of the building, honoring the nations that fought in the Korean War. Exhibitions on the inside with no entrance fee. Hallways to the entrance list those that gave their lives, for the US, they are listed by State.Within a block of the subway exit."
"Because of three men greed...A country is divided, lives shattered","I have always been interested in the Korean War ever since I had the chance to visit Washington D.C. and saw the Korean War Memorial. Since then, I tried to get hold of any books, film documentary about this war.When we visited the museum, we immediately went to the Korean War room and my wife suddenly realized the full impact of this war to the people of Korea and to the men of countries that helped that gave up their lives for a people they did not know or the country called Korea.We saw also the memorial for the fallen soldiers and seeing all the names who died in this war, we can't help but wonder when would mankind learn that war is not the solution of a conflict. Outside we saw an array of tanks, jets, artillery, ship and even a B52. Sad really, to see these tools of mass destructions.When given the chance to visit South Korea again, I will surely spend a day here and will bring my grandson to see that war is not to be glorified."
great exhibition,"Well worth a few hours of your time. There are good displays in English, even a 4D movie experience! And it's free!"
"Very informative, well worth seeing",We only had a few hours to spend at the museum but it was a very interesting and informative display of the history of the Korean War. I recommend that you take one of the free tours as you will learn so much more. Thank you Charlie for giving up your time.
Must visit destination,"It's free. Very infornative, the South Korean view of the Korean War is interesting. Great indoor and outdoor exhibits. Outdoor exhibits include fighter jets, aircrafts, tanks, helicopters, Navy ship, etc. Most exhibits/films are in English or has English subtitles. A moving experience for me and sadden by the senseless loss of lives."
"Amazing, moving experience","I have visited the museum twice as I am interested in the Korean war due to the fact that my grandfather fought in it and there is very little taught about it in schools etc. The museum mostly deals with the korean civil war but there is also information about other wars Korea has been involved in (not every exhibit has information in english), and is generally very informative. There is a flight simulator theatre in the museum which was very fun, something to keep younger (and older!) people amused amongst the exhibits."
Amazing,"The museum is huge, both outdoor and indoor. It is clearly well maintained. Very informative. Amazingly, it's free."
Nice!,"I really enjoyed this, its very nice and a great way to learn more about the war! Worth going for a look"
Our experience,"We love the Snow festival which is just outside the memorial, especially my kids. We took a free English guided tour on Korean War. The tour is very good and informative. Our tour guide is only 16 years old, his name is Mr J. Extremely professional and he even gave us a name card !! The 3D fighter Jet stimulation and The shooting range were a little disappointing . The chair in the Jet stimulation was not even working. We spent the whole day in the Memorial ."
Must see for anyone interested in history,"Fantastic museum, especially considering the admission fee (there is none!) I spent a few hours here and felt that wasn't enough. A lot of information and very well organized. Can easily spend the whole day here. There's some interesting stuff for kids as well. The outside of the museum is great: alot of ships and planes used during the war. A must see."
could spend the enire day easily,"my first time to seoul and korea so i wasnt sure what to expect. free entrance fee. covers all military events of korea starting way back in time, 600ad maybe?. displays of ancient armour and swords were cool. display rooms are large and models are very detailed. outside displays has many tanks, jets and helicopters. i dont know alot about the korean war but this makes me want to do some reading for sure. check out the museum, well worth it."
a big parking lot of tanks,"And there was this ship with holes on the sides of the ship. I've been to a lot of War Memorial Museums, and basically they all look the same. Difference in here is that they have a big parking lot containing the different kinds of tanks used during the war."
Really not overrated,"I couldn't believe, that a museum would get such a rating. Had to see it myself, went there, spent three hours outside looking at and inside planes, jets, helicopters, tanks, battleship that actually has been attacked. Amazing to see and lots to learn there - especially about the relationship. It was very well worth spending whole Sunday afternoon there."
"Impressive grounds, very informative display","Very informative display about the Korean War. The grounds itself is beautiful. There are lots of statues, and lots of tankers, planes, etc displayed on the ground."
War Memorial and Museum in Itaewon,"A big outdoor collection of planes, tanks, missiles, helicopters, boats from Korean War and more recent times defending the country from outside threats. Unlike similar exhibits in other countries you can get next to, on, and sometimes in armored personnel carriers and naval war vessels. A reminder to all the ""Freedom is not free"". A tribute to the courage and sacrifices of the armed forces of South Korea and allies."
A great overview!,My kids and I love this museum and can go back ten times and never get bored! So much history presented in an easy and fascinating way...I'm not a lover of museums but I love this one!
Historical site,Amazing static display of warships and aircrafts. An must-see if you are on a serious cultural discovery journey in korea
"Beautiful tribute, lots to see, kids enjoyed","We really enjoyed the interior memorial to those fallen In the Korean War. It was a beautiful memorial. Outside and inside there are tanks, vehicles and aircraft some of which are open for you to go inside and sit or look inside. Our kids (ages 4 & 6) really enjoyed this part. There is a lot to see here. It is conveniently located within walking distance of the Dragon Hill Lodge."
a must go if you have kids! ,"almost gave this attraction a miss because of the cold weather, am so glad we didn't! the kids loved the impressive display of tankers, airplanes and warships. they climbed up all sorts of machines, took pictures willingly and had a really good time. there's an outdoor military performance at 2pm every Friday, it's v v good but I believed we watched the last one scheduled for this year. there is a winter break. seriously, don't miss this if you have kids, they would love it, and the museum is easily accessible by subway! GO! "
Educational and Fun!,Loved the exhibits and the videos. A great place for kids 7 and above. Not so appropriate for toddlers as they may not understand the exhibits.An opportunity to learn about the Korean War and and South Korea's allies.
Korean War Memorial,Very informative with great displays. too much to take in in one day..be sure to go back...Impressive
Gives A New Understanding To The Losses,Had a very brief stop at the Memorial. The multiple name listings gives a better understanding of the losses suffered. A very nicely maintained tribute. 
Very interesting!!!,"There was no entrance fee which is amazing...!!! Very good to reach by Subway. And very very good and interesting museum... Loved the set-up of it... A must see when in Seoul, I think..?!?"
Nice way to spend half a day,If you like military gadgets this place is great. Also a lot of information regarding the Korean war. 
"Excellent, for those who are interested in history/war history","I've been to South Korea as part of a business trip. I had 2 days to explore Seoul, and after taking a look at the palaces and other central locations, I found this gem. If you like history like I do, you will greatly enjoy this museum. All places have ""English buttons"" that tell about what you see, though you might feel a bit awkward, as generally you will be the only foreign person, and the Koreans will patiently wait till you hear it out. I liked the ancient boat especially. Don't use the cafeteria, it is a total disaster - better to bring your own food."
Very cool,Really beautiful memorial to the soldiers and Korean War. On the day that we went there was military and historical presentations. Enjoyed walking around the outdoor plane and tank museum on the same grounds.
Unbelieveable,We loved this Memorial. Every type of military vehicle a person can imagine appears to be here. There was a traditional Korean wedding at the facility while we were there. We will never forget the beauty of this wedding.
The place which you learn that freedom is priceless,"Learn about the different dynasties of the Korean Peninsula. Most importantly, you will know about the Korean War."
Impressing,Many Turkish soldiers fight and died in Korea during Korean War. For that reason I wanted to visit War Memorial. It was huge and impressing. There were many children there with their teachers to learn the history of South Korea.
Boeing B-29 Superfortress HELP!,"I was a visitor to the United Nations Korean War Museum at Youido, Seoul in the 1980's. I no longer remember the manager of the Museum. I had a ride around the Museum grounds in Kim Il Sung's automobile that was a part of the exhibit.I am with a group here in the United States that is restoring a Boeing B-29 to flight status. In order to complete this amazing restoration project we need a part for our airplane. We would like to know if we could obtain this part from the Boeing B-29 that was in the Museum on Youido back in the 1980's?Would you please bo so kind as to notify me if this request might be possible and, if so, to whom may I communicate with.With best regards,Richard Shaeffer for,The United States Aviation Museume-mail: maxmainliner@att.net"
Rainy day visit,"We decided to visit The War Memorial museum prior to our visit to the North Korean border. It was a rainy day - but still have to say that the outdoor part were all the planes and tanks are on view were the more interesting part. It is quite big inside, and we did not get to see it all - all in all we were all quite pleased with the museum."
Learnt about the Korean War,"The museum teaches you about the Korean war. They have lots of the planes and tanks that they used during the war there. Inside is where they have the whole story of the war which is really interesting and informative. The only snag is that about 80% is in Korean, but the English translations are adequate."
Very Educational,"I liked this museum a lot that I went twice. The first time I went was part of the Panmunjom tour. And because I enjoyed looking at the exhibits and wasn't able to see all floors because of the limited time, I went back the following day and it took me almost 3 hours to see all rooms. It was very educational and if you're a history buff, this museum shouldn't be missed. I also visited another museum near Gyeongbuk Palace but I enjoyed this more."
must do,One of the best memorials ever! All free for all to see and experience with very moving and entertaining displays. Ride on vehicles.What a great way to honor their past to share freely with all.
Go. It's Free!!!,"Arrived at the museum a few hours before closing time so we had some sttractions all by ourselves. We all thought the museum iss all about the North and South Korean divide but most of the memorabilia we saw were of the Vietnam War. Very informative indeed. There was a section where you can take pictures in officer's uniform and send the photos to your email where we lingered. It was getting dark when we went out but we managed to get beautiful pictures with all the outside displays which were awesome... big tanks, fighter planes and c130..."
Enlightening,"It is accessible, interesting and really telling on events that are not very far away and we need to continue thinking about."
A History Of Korean War,"Its difficult to make such a subject as war a tourist attract but the museum has done this very well the building is attractive, with external displays that are very good and very spacious interesting displays in side. Certainly worth a visit if its a rainy day. Its even possible to get married there Korean style."
Everyone should visit once,"This is both a memorial and museum, and something that everyone visiting seoul should visit to learn about the war and how their home countries contributed or were effected. There are plaques for every state in the USA and every country that was involved. It is a very moving memorial. Outside the building there are airplanes, tanks, artillery, and a war ship. Inside the museum you can learn a lot and see some interesting documents and artifacts. Allow at least 2-3 hours and go in nice weather as much of the memorial and restored airplanes are outdoors."
Interesting. Informative.,A good insight into Korean history as seen through its almost continuous wars. A well laid out museum with lots of decommissioned military hardware outside to keep the young people interested as well... Best go on a dry day.
Awe Inspiring,Well worth the time to visit. Inspiring and thought provoking and well put together. I recommend it.
"Free, informative & entertaining",We were pleasantly surprised by the War Museum. It is a few minutes' walk from the Samgakji subway station. There is an English tour or you can wander around by yourself if you prefer. If you have time try the 3-D rides! We were short on time and only spent 1 hour there but we could have easily spent 2-3 hours. This is a great indoor activity if weather is poor for adults and children alike.
Historic Journey,Anyone living in or stationed in Korea needs to see this museum and memorial. It will take you down a historic journey of the history of Korea and the Korean War. 
Excellent museum!,"The statue outside is amazing. The museum is very impressing. The ""Drop"" exhibit is very good.You will need at least two hours to cover all the exhibits inside the museum and another hour if you would like see all the tanks and airplanes outside."
I've been many places and this is the best tribute I've ever seen,"This is an amazing tribute to the Korean military and a really grateful tribute to their US, UK, Canadian, Australian, Etc. Allies who helped them in their time of need against the north. The museum inside is a detailed chronicle of korean military history with a strong focus (naturally) on the Korean War. I must say the detail and depth that they put into this is just amazing. I spent 2+ hours here and even though I like history, I'm usually a read and go kind of person. You need to see this if you're in seoul."
A definetely must in Seoul,"Amazing place, even for those who are not war buffs like myself. I was moved and can understand better the korean culture now. "
Interesting but...,It is worth the visit but leave for a day when you want to be escaping the heat. The cool inside helps you to enjoy the exhibits more.A little tricky to find if you are a novice map reader but subway is a good simple option.
Breathtaking...you have to see to believe the caliber of this place...as a thank you to americans!,"The best memorial ever. Very moving. This tells you a lot about the Korean war and all of the countries that contributed to help South Korea. Over 4 million casualties by the end of the war. This was built on land that was donated back to South Korea from our military at the end of the war. They decided to build this monstrocity which is hard to believe the size until you are there. A lot of time and money in this place with ships, planes, jets, tanks, bronze statues...you name it, they have it and the quality of the memorial is second to nothing else that I have ever seen. We have a friend that is stationed there for 3 years and he met us there and toured us around. You need to visit this memorial while you are in South Korea."
"Best ""Memorial"" ever!",Pretty cool museum! Lots of multimedia/interactive displays. Classic and contemporary art pieces dedicated to the men and women who fought for their country's freedom.What an awesome memorial to their soldiers and the soldiers of the countries who've helped them. The building complex itself is very grand and impressive. This would especially be an awesome place to bring a Korean war veteran. And kids too!No wonder Korean people have such love for their country. I'm Filipino and just seeing our flag their makes me proud. :)
Very good,"So, the Palace is very big and well built. The historical documents are accurate enough to learn how things went if you don't know the history of the war with North Korea. Look out for the free English guided tours. Even more interesting is the outside. They have a huge number of planes and tanks on display. And even a ship!! There's also a freaking B52 in all its mighty glory! How cool is that! !! The only negative thing are the ""battle reconstruction"" shown. They're supposed to give you the idea of how hard these were. But to western standards they're extremely kitsch camp-style displays of grindhouse style cgi explosions. "
A must do if you are staying in Seoul,An excellent museum well laid out you need to allow at least a couple of hours if you want to do it properly. It gives you a good insight into koreas war torn past and the suffering of the people. It's free to get in and outside there is plenty of war machinery for kids young and old to climb over.
A Must See For Anyone Interested In An Depth Look Of The Korean War,"While there are other exhibits in this museum, the bulk of it deals with the Korean War. Obviously, this was a huge event for Korea and you won't find a more in depth presentation than its home country. Of particular note are the various displays of the countries that helped S.Korea repel the N.Korean invasion as well as various dioramas and exhibits detailing the weaponry, battles, and equipment. To get to the memorial, I believe you get off at Itaewon and look for the exit for the War Memorial. Once you pass a Korean military facility, you're on the right track. Admission is free and I really think this is a must see for anyone interested in military history."
educational,"The real war tanks, missiles, helicopters and larger-than-life soldier statues were such a sight to behold!"
Enriching,Free admission. Spacious. Organized and interesting exhibits. Even my teens enjoyed walking around the War Memorial. 
Lotsa fun for those who like war history,"Highly recommended for those who like replicate warplanes, weapons and ship.The museum exhibits are good with simple explanation on the Korean war."
Beautiful and very moving museum,"I had the pleasure of visiting this museum during my two-year tour to Korea. This museum is phenomenal! I cannot tell you how many times I was moved to tears by this place. The history here is rich and very sad. One country, torn in two by foreign entities, and forced to fight each other, brother on brother. Families were ripped from each others arms, cities were leveled, and peace was never achieved. The stories that come out of this museum are powerful, especially the story of the two brothers. Anyone who visits Korea MUST visit this museum. It is located in Yongsan, it is quite easy to reach by train and cab."
Best museum I've ever been to!,"I'm not really a 'museum person,' but this museum is incredible! Every exhibit is so well-crafted that even the most unenthusiastic visitor will be interested. There are interactive exhibits, videos, walk-through life-size reenactment rooms (with flashing lights and explosion sounds!), and even 4D 'rides'! Every exhibit, video, and experience has perfect, informative English--none of that shortened Engrish we see so often in other museums. The 4D experiences were my favorite part of the museum, and very kid-friendly. In addition to being immensely entertaining, they were also surprisingly informative. The 'Operation Chromite' experience is the most fun, explaining the Battle of Incheon. There's another experience (not 4D) where viewers watch a short film about the harsh winter marches while the room gets cold and fake snow falls. (Bring a jacket!) Even with all the interesting and fun bits, the museum still manages to impart the somber and sometimes horrified feelings of the Korean War. That said, some parts do seem very propaganda-y, so don't be surprised if your kids walk out saying they want to join the South Korean army."
Great museum - very informational...,"I found the war memorial very informational, with pictures, documents, artifacts, scaled models, etc. It has a large section on the Korean war, but also many of the wars that happened before that. You could spend hours going through the exhibits and learn a lot about the history of Korea.I would highly recommend anyone who visits South Korea to visit the war memorial."
One of the best military museums in the world.,"Part Korean military history, part thank you to the world, this venue is not to be missed. The memorial of the Korean conflict on our own National Mall is an embarrassment compared to this impressive building. Set aside a morning and learn of this nation's pain and hope."
Sombre reflection of past while superbly presented with honour,"My wife & I visited the Korean war memorial & the first thing that you see is the monument dedicated to the soldiers of the conflict. To either side of that monument is two statues reflecting some scenes of the conflict. I found the place very quiet which is a chance to remind yourself how destructive & futile wars are on both sides. Once you walk across the large courtyard into the building, there is several options inside to visit. As you enter the building, the main Korean War section is on your left & that is very well documented & gives a concise explanation on how the conflict evolved.  There are several other exhibitions at the War Memorial & if you have the time it is well worth having a look at them. Entrance is free. As you exit the main complex, there is a exhibition of helicopters, airplanes, tanks & boats/ships used in the conflict. They are in good order & whilst I'm not a fan of war machinery, I do like aircraft & you can get up close & check out the cockpits & workings of the aircraft. A bit like the PIMA museum at Tucson, Arizona. You can use the city tour bus to get there or use the public transport & get of at Samgakji."
"Beautiful, comprehensive museum","Impressive memorial and museum. Exhibits inside and out were all well taken care of and obviously cherished. Spent a few hours wandering around enjoying the historical descriptions and memorabilia. I wouldn't wait too long to enjoy the ""4D"" movies as they're a little hokey."
A most impressive memorial and worthy inclusion for must-see attractions when in Seoul,"Recently visited the War Memorial of Korea and came away mightily impressed with everything that was put up here. This is easily a top attraction in Seoul and highly recommendable, not just for military buffs but also for those interested to know more about the separation of the North and South Koreas. It is also a very child-friendly attraction. Of course, the outdoor exhibition area with the warship, aircraft and armored vehicles, etc. should not be missed but there is also plenty to appreciate in the exhibition halls that require a good investment of time.Visited on a Saturday and thought the crowds were manageable. It was quite bustling, with a music concert in the Peace Plaza (front of the building) as well as a small classical concert in the Memorial Hall. There is so much to love about this attraction which not only gives a touching tribute to those who lost their lives for Korea but also succeeds to inform visitors about the country's military history. There are poignant monuments about which are worth seeing. The entrance through the side galleries have walls inscribed with names of the fallen, while there are other various symbolic works inside the exhibition area. The historical information and war memorabilia seem comprehensive and not only covers the war between the Koreas, but also wars dating back to the dynasties. Displays are well-spaced and the route is marked and has a nice flow, and there are a variety of historical items, paintings, dioramas, and interactive media to keep one moving while the captions are kept short but substantial. Occasionally there were points that were repetitive but this only served to reinforce the information presented.Some tips:- How to get there: Samgakji Station, Line 4 or Line 6, Exit 12 - The memorial is open from 9am to 6pm, and closed on Mondays except public holiday, and closed the day after a Monday public holiday.- Admission is free. This attraction runs on donations, and visitors are welcome to use the donation boxes for this purpose. - Be sure to grab a brochure at the entrance which has summaries of each section and all you need to explore the Memorial.- Free baby carriage/wheel chair for use.- Photography is allowed in most areas save for the 3D/4D presentations. - The 3D/4D presentations run every 30minutes and tend to be popular but have limited seats, which could be a problem during weekend visits.- The website has a good amount of information and could help prepare for a visit here, such as targeting items or areas of interest. The War Memorial of Korea is truly worth at least 3 hours but you could easily spend more if you have the time. Its grand scale reflects the importance of wars in the history of this country while befitting the great significance placed on those who died to make the Republic of Korea what it is today."
Very Impressive Memorial,"I almost didn't make it to this memorial (was pressed for time) but I am so glad that I did. There was so much information, I was really impressed. It was very interactive and captured the history of Korea's military activities from way back to the present. I arrived there at 5, so I only had an hour to spare because the museum closes at 6. I will definitely be coming back here on my next trip as there was so much that I didn't get to see. One could easily spend 2-3 hours here as there is so much on display. Admission is free but they accept donations (which I happily gave because they deserve it). One of the highlights of my trip."
War Memorial Seoul Sth Korea,"Only visited the outside exhibits so cannot share much more. Displays of aircraft, ships used during the war were great to see amd impressive.The grounds and monuments were very good and well maintained."
A small piece of the 20th century history,The War Memorial of Korea was one of the most interresting memorials i had the pleasure of visiting. Great displays and facinating models of military vehicles. the tales of the war - told by dioramas and movies- are also astonishing. The memorial was the highlight of my trip to Seul. Highly recommended.
Large memorial on Korean War,"I spent some time at the memorial in preparation for my trip to the DMZ. While the building and the displays were impressive, the loud and rowdy school kids on their field trip made the experience less enjoyable. Seriously, where were the adults supervising the students? They were running around, knocking things over, and talking during the movie presentations. While I understand that they are kids, this place is also a memorial to the soldiers of the Korean War. The staff should enforce more decorum among its visitors out of respect. The English tour guide was friendly, but his English was difficult to understand, so I left the tour group half way through and just explored on my own. Overall, a nice memorial and museum and I learned a lot about the war. I would suggest maybe going on a weekend when there won't be so many students."
As good as an aircraft carier in New York,"Wherever I go I always go to the War Memorial or War museum: Canberra, Ottawa, Warsaw ect. This one in Seoul I would rank as one of the best one. If you like history or have kids do not miss it. I went there with my son and we send more than 4 hours. (time was flying and we had to rush to see other things in Seoul) We could spend the whole day there. There is a lot of history of dividing a nation which wants to be together and human suffering as well as military equipment to satisfy anyone who likes these things."
A Memorial Like No Other,"Our family visited the War Memorial of Korea and the trip was way above our expectations. This memorial has to be one of the best we've ever visited. There is so much to see and do, inside and out. The staff is very courteous, arrows on the floor throughout the museum guiding you through every floor, every exhibit. Best part? All of the vehicles, airplanes, boats, ship, etc. were hands on! If you've visited a museum in the US, most wont let you get ten feet near the displays, but here the kids can play on the motorcycles, cars, tanks, you name it! The WM of K also has a very nice café inside, bathrooms throughout every floor, and vending machines (priced the same as in the subway or anywhere else), throughout the museum. We spent a few hours there but easily could have brought or bought a lunch and spent the better part of a day. The highlight? Being able to climb, sit, steer, and touch all of the military vehicles, etc. The cost is free. Definitely worth the visit."
one of the best in the world,the military history of Korea goes back many centuries and this museum captures it all up to the modern era. 
In Touch With History,"Having a late uncle who spent significant time in Korea during the war years, this war memorial had special significance for me. A most serene setting that encompasses the essence of the war between the North and the South - no shortage of old military equipment. If you have had a family member take part in this war or if you are a war history buff, then do yourself a favour, take an hour or two and spend some time here. PS, it's worthwhile taking your camera ... lots of opportunities for some great shots!"
Not just a memorial!,"Perhaps it is because, technically the country is still at war with the North that the museum seems so alive and pertinent. Lots of planes and tanks to climb over, or into, which provide interest for those of an academic bent or for kids enjoying the thrill of getting close up to big machinery.Inside the exhibits offer a sense of a long history served in an entertaining manner with lots of audio visual displays.A real surprise and a suitable day trip for the family"
Must go to if you appreciate Korean/Asian history,"I think I make time to stop by here whenever I visit Seoul. If you are interested in Korean history, this is a must-see place (along with the National Museum in Seoul).There are nice sculptures around the premises and the facilities are well maintained and clean. They even have lockers near the inside entrance across from the bookstore and cafe (I think the lockers were free). Admission is usually free as well. If you're the type who likes to read and soak in everything, you will need a good 2-3 hours to see most of the displays. It will benefit you if you can read Korean though as most of the exhibits have little English descriptions (a few didn't have any English). The film rooms were interesting with informative documentaries (again, most are in only spoken Korean though). It will definitely give you a better understanding of why Koreans think the way they do when you see how the country has frequently been war-torn throughout its 5,000+ years of history."
impressive,"this was about 30 min cab ride from downtown Seoul (gangham area) and it was worth the ride. first, it was free admission running on donations. The amount of items here is just mind boggling. It was really great to see planes such as B52, tanks and helicopters that were used in the war. I spent a good 4 hours here, and left satisfied. You could easily spend all day here. If you had family that passed in the war, there is nice memorial in the front of all members KIA from all countries.The amount of information given, really put the war in perspective."
A must visit,Very moving and informative experience. The installations are fantastic and really sets the tone. Go here.
Amazing,"This place is wonderfull .. its worth to visit .. the museum is BIG, organized and free .. I recommend 100%"
Accompany my extended parents,go to here because of accompany my extended parents! i just know them when i got bump in kitchen on my hostel! then me and my sister decided to accompany them..awesome place.. it's free addmision but you can see the museum are manage so well.. clean and not scary at all.. the collection is really awesome.. i like diorama and their audiovisual thing! really interesting! 
A really eye opening experience!,"Had a great time at The War Memorial of Korea. Lots to see and discover. Also lots of interactive exibits too. The entry price is very cheap considering how much there is to see. My favourite was the collection of vehicles they have outside which includes tanks, helecopters and even a B52 Bomber! There is a war ship that you can climb aboard to and check out!Over all a great day amd experience. Highly recommended!"
Excellent! Nothing more needed.,Great fun. Nothing more needed here! Took a couple of hours to get round. Everything has been translated into English. Go on a noce day fir some great photos with Namsan Tower in the background!
"Free, very informative and a must for military buffs","Huge museum that you could spend hours in and its free. Outside you also have dozens and dozens of actual planes, tanks and artillery used in war. The displays inside are in English and are very informative. It's separated into floors and the 2nd floor just deals with the Korean war while the 1st floor deals with warfare before the Korean war and the 3rd floor deals with modern war. This is a must visit for military history buffs"
Patriotism exemplifies,"Free.. Nice scenery, war memorabilia well kept.. There was a 3d or 4d presentation which we liked most.."
Astounding exhibit,"This memorial is very well done, honoring those who lost their lives in support of South Korea. The videos are very informative, providing quite a bit of detail surrounding the Korean War. The collection of military equipment outside (Korean, American, Russian, Chinese, Canadian, etc.) is impressive. You should allow at least 3 hours to tour this memorial."
Reminds you that it is still a war zone...,"Date of Visit: 2013-09-21I visited the War Memorial with my two young boys and the family of a friend.My boys loved looking at and crawling over the ship, planes and tanks.I found the hall where all of the names of the fallen to be quite moving.The number of fallen were much larger than I thought and a poignant reminder that, technically, this is still a war zone.I would recommend a visit, if for no other reason than to understand what has shaped modern Sth Korea."
symbol of gratitude,"Termed the biggest War memorial in the World, the complex reeks of gratitude to all such Nations that helped South Korea at the time of their need. The 21 flags that flutter in the courtyard bear ample testimony. The statue of Two brothers embracing each other at the Plaza, the elder one a South Korean soldier and the younger one North Korean soldier is very touching. The open-air museum with hundreds of military equipments used in the War by US and Soviets mutely tells stories of misery. The split Obelisk tied together symbolises Korean strong will and their hope for unification. A must see attraction for all lovers of History."
Free history and 4D experience,"This is a great way to spend an afternoon soaking up history. Very close to a subway station and great coffee too in the caeteria at only 3000 won a cup, the cheapest yet I have found.The best parts are the 4D shows about certain battles and a veteran's experience. Don't miss these, they are on the half hour. The military aircraft is impressive and if you haven't experinced the electronic toilet seat/bidet/hairdryer, they have some in one of the toilets here! Aside from that the exhibits and the information are excellent. Highly recommended."
Chills,"As a citizen of a Korean War participant country, it was definitely more than i expected. We ended up crying in the United Nations hall. It is an amazing memorial, which shows respect and apretiation for the participant country. Definitely should be seen!"
Just wall paper,They not allow u in to see anything juz walk out side same like u see in Korean movie you can See more than real one
One of a kind museum!,I have lived in Korea for 5 years and this place is one of the best museums and sights that I have seen. It gives a really interesting and visual account of Korea's conflicts both recent and historic. The outside of the museum is amazing and I spent hours there literally going inside of all the old planes and tanks. I can't believe it's free as they could easily charge money. Highly recommended!
Very educational tour,"It was most educational and brought awareness to us about the generations of wars that South Korean had gone through. very touching and meaning concepts by how all the monuments and statues represent.also very educational on the different missiles, planes and all the weapons that was used in the different wars"
great entertainment for any military fanatic!,"I had a blast at this museum, it truly has all the military toys you can imagine. Rockets, high explosives, tanks, nukes, planes, boats, helicopters. Its quite an amazing display of equipment.It also includes historical expositions of old wars fought in Korea between the Koreans and the Mongolians for instance.I highly recommend this place on a rainy day in Korea since most of it is indoors.Check out my walk-through video: http://www.reformatt.com/blog/war-memorial-korea"
Well curated museum about korean history,"War Memorial Museum is a big museum with several indoor areas divided in other thematic eras of the korean history and an outdoor area filled with gigantic war machines including a full scale american B52 bomber!! Best of all it is free to get in except any temporary exhibit that might be happening there too.I liked very much the whole place and left there with a new understanding in a South Korean point of view about the various wars that Korean has been in, their warrior and pride of identity and for sure an everlong will to be reunited with the North.A must do when in town!"
Worth the trip,It was an impressive display of items. I learned somethings about America's history with Korea while I was there. That in itself made the trip worth it. 
Very moving,There is so much to see here. And so powerful and moving. It really shows how strong willed South Korean people are. And how grateful they are to everyone one who had helped in there time of need. 
Fantastic experience,For a swede with little knowledge of the Korean War it was a really educating and strong experience. The museum exhibit a huge amount of weapons from both the North Korea and from the South Korea. It take a while to see everything but it is well spend time. No entrance fee wish is nice too.
Informative Experience,"As an American who knew very little about the Korean War, this was a very educational experience. The museum talks about all of the wars on the Korean peninsula over the past several centuries, but has a much larger focus on the Korean War of the early 1950's. The museum is well laid out and gives a good overview of the wars. There was even a 3D motion simulator movie showing you what it would be like in a fighter plane of the time. Outside of the museum, there is a large collection of airplanes, helicopters, tanks and other military equipment used in the Korean War. I learned a lot about the war here and I'm very happy I took the time out of my vacation to visit."
Outstanding museum,"Provides great review of Korea and the wars they fought since the bronze era. Lots of displays, in many different languages. Can spend many hours at the displays both in the museum and on the grounds."
Better than expected,I'm not really into war museums in general though this was very informative and not too 'manly'. I learned a lot about the history of the wars in Korea including the ongoing Korean War with North Korea. The museum is well laid out and has some interesting '4D' experiences. Most exhibits and movies were also available in English . Great value. Audio guide was great.
Don’t miss out on it …,"Very large and interesting museum. It gives an overview of the military history of Korea and focuses specifically on the Korean war of the 50’s.The suggested visiting time of 1-2 h as stated in Tripadvisor is far from sufficient in my opinion. If you want also to experience the 4D movies and interactive parts of the museum you will need much more time as all these things are on the same time schedule at 30 minutes interval. Therefore you will need several hours just for those parts.Tips:- if you’re low on time, start with the movies and interactive parts as soon as you get in- Take note of the fact that the interactive parts are not available from 12h00 till 13h30- Do not forget the outside, it is not on the map"
"Very Solemn, well presented!","I am so glad we went here. This is the equivalent of the Vietnam, Korea, and WWII memorial in D.C, mixed in with a military armament museum. The plaques for the fallen, listed by nationality and even States in the case with the US; seeing all those lost souls names inscribed under the UN banner really makes you appreciate what the world can do right when we come together. Those brave men and women, gave their lives for something greater than themselves or their nation. Wow, just amazing. The statues and memorials are well done and give you the feeling of how hard Korea has had it. They trace the history of this war torn country and walk you through today. The building itself is an appropriate tribute, but then they added so much military hardware, you can spend days looking at this equipment. One of my favorite parts was the north Korean equipment provided by Russia and China. Makes you realize that when there is war, there is usually only 2 sides; but in reality, the sides fighting are usually a proxy for those countries supplying the arms. Much of the information presented is in English. If in Seoul, and you have any interest in how Korea came to be; this is a must see! "
Informatively Fascinating,"The huge ground displays statues, boats, airplanes and helicopters which look very captivating. Utilizes their grounds well as they provide outdoor and indoor exhibits. Landscape of the place is well kept. Benches, seating areas are provided in the grounds. Vending machine is visible outdoor.Admission to this place is free. English tour is provided. Devout couple of hours to tour the place as it is interesting and informative utilizing multimedia: short films of 5-10 minutes, display of war remains with English translation, pictures, and life size statues.Recommending this as one of the place to visit when in Seoul for all ages."
Divided feelings,"I'm still not sure how i should think about it. It is a giant building, which is even of architectural views interesting. Also there is an impressive collection of planes and tanks, as well as a ship. But in the end it is about war and i really missed the part where they tell how much the people suffer in the war. Dead and shortages are big part they left away and it seems that this glorifies the war. "
worth visiting but...,"This is an essential place to visit to understand Korea's history of warfare, including but not limited to the Korean War. However while everything is here (somewhere), it it poorly laid out and signposted. We struggled to find the 3rd floor ""Combat Room"" which claims to offer some sort of lifelike experience, but this 5 minute experience was underwhelming to say the least - particularly when you think about how special effects are used today in cinema and games - and the same general criticism can be levelled at many of the exhibits which seem rather dated. Best is the contemporary footage from the Korean war. Our visit was not helped by Seoul Council's decision to turn off the a/c in its public buildings to save electricity - this just made the place even more stifling inside than it was outside."
MUST go!,"If you are minimally interested in History, particularly post-WWII history, this place is a must! It houses an amazing collection of items from the Korean War (maybe one of the only moments were the 'cold' war actually went pretty hot), and also has a quite interactive way of telling its story. Everything is at least bilingual (Korean/English), though most of the exhibits also have Chinese and Japanese versions. There are a couple of 4D cinemas; and displays of actual tanks, airplanes, missiles and other war crafts, which make the visitors feel the war much more realistically. And all of this for free (though make sure to buy some little souvenir or donate some money. These guys work hard and provide an amazing service!)"
Must stop place!,"My goal was to spend two hours here. I ended up staying four and could have absolutely done more. The english speaking tour was one of the most impressive and informative tours I have ever been on. Humor, insight, and it was obvious how much this man cared about this country. Even if you don't get a chance to go into the musuem, the outside planes and statues are worth the stop. Do not miss this."
I only saw the outdoor exhibits,"I unfortunately could only get to the memorial on a Monday, when the museum is closed. I did see the exterior exhibits, I found the display unordered, with only very basic English explanations. The Korean could have been more detailed. The exhibition includes quite a few aircraft, tanks, some missiles and AA guns, and some other heavy military equipment. unfortunately the exhibits look deteriorated and dirty. I did enjoy some of the impressive statues. In short if you have the time and enjoy this kind of attraction you should put the memorial somewhere on your list of sites to see in Seoul."
A great tribute to a nation still at war,Really pleased that we went to visit this national memorial. It was a great tribute to the Korean people and was very balanced in presenting the South Korean perspective of a divisive war.Certainly worth a visit if you are in the area.
Interesting military history.,"You will learn more about the war that isn't taught nor told in America as it really was and still is. The memorial documents that it was an acted out conflict between the US and Russia and Korea was split without their say or input. After 3 years of war, South Koreans were dissatisfied with the division and wanted to go all the way as to, ""ride it out,"" to keeping the country, ""One."" Other interesting exhibits are uniforms from foreign officers who ended up in Korea during the late 19th century. Knowing from visiting, HaemiEupsa, that Catholicism was brought to Korea in the late 19th century, this correlated with military history of Britian, America, Spain, and a few other Western countries visiting Korea proposing trade relations. There are also really cool medieval times exhibits that give you a sense that Korea and most of the world were at the same level of technology which still is. The only differences are food, language, and customs as well as military and political situations. "
MUST SEE and spend a whole day!,"If you love history this place is amazing. Great displays, easy to read, very logical order to the displays. The 4D presentations are really good. Wish i had more time to spend here!"
Truly a stop for your itinerary,"Like many of the other reviews mention this is a free museum, other than some seasonal special exhibits,as but you can give a donation when you enter. Outside there way quite a collection of military vehicles including tanks, helicopters, large aircraft and more.The inside of the museum was equally as interesting and certainly added a new or rather deeper vantage point than any textbook from school I remember. There are tonnes of displays with accompanying English descriptions. All very well organised and enjoyable to walk through.There are several free short 3d films that can be watched, each lasting about 10 minutes or so. As well as some other activities to participate in and photo spots.I only spent about two hours there, which really isn't enough time to absorb everything. If you're really understood in history then it could easily eat up a majority of your day."
Must do excellent,"I visited here with my son and husband today, it was super interesting. We enjoyed the whole thing. There are planes and tanks outside and a lot of war memorabilia inside. This is a must. Plan to spend 4 hours. There is no fee. This place is well designed and is very modern."
Definitely Worth It!,This is so worth seeing & ITS FREE! Now they do have places to put in a donation if you wish (& you should) but its your choice what you desire to put in so there is no official admission fee. This place is huge & there is something for everyone of all ages to enjoy here.
Very Nice- Must see spot,"The area has a lot of military equipment..tanks, fighter jets, navy boats to climb on and get some great pictures while learning more of the Korean military challenges. You can hop the Seoul city tour for 10,000 wons and get there."
HUGE,"I loved the outside, its the biggest collection of aircraft, tanks and artillery that I have seen. All from the Korean War, even a B-52 and a ship! To see it all you need a day.Special place for those interested in history and Korean history."
National War Memorial,Great place about South Korean involvement although full of pro South Korean text against the North. Great number of exhibits on display that is great for school children.
Pretty cool and informative,"I love studying the history of war and would recommend this for people who are interested in Korea's history. Korea was involved in a lot of war (mostly being attacked) and you learn a lot about their involvement in wars and not just the Korean War. I'd say if you have time and like history , be sure to hit this place up when you are in Seoul."
Interesting War Memorial,"In order to remember the Korean War and commemorate the war heroes, the War Memorial of Korea was established. It is a museum that houses various records of the war. It also serves as lessons from the war to stimulate patriotism and military spirit amongst the Korean.The museum consists of both indoor and outdoor exhibition areas. The indoor ones provide visitors a glimpse into the activities during the Korean War, while the outdoor ones have memorial statues and military vehicles.More on blog post: http://www.kenwooi.com/2013/07/war-memorial-of-korea.html"
good if you can read Korean,"So, off the bat the outdoor display of military hardware is most impressive and would Wow! any little boys or grown men who are into that stuff. We spent a little while perusing the tanks, planes, missiles etc. Then we moved inside. Huge building. The huge open space in front of the building devoid of any greenery reminds me of the grounds of the palaces we had visited the previous days. I think Koreans just seem to love that grand, sweeping open space to show case the main act -- the building itself. Hence, no trees, shrubberies, or flowers in the immediate front of the building to distract one's eyes. The museum have exhibits of Korean military history that goes back very far .... like to 900 AD or maybe even further back. As far as they have records of I guess. Of course back that far it wasn't ""Korea"" as we know it today. The land mass that is modern day N & S Korea hosted various kingdoms and fiefdoms whose borders fluctuated and changed many times. You also get the sense that the official narrative wants to put a very proud and positive spin on Korean military achievement. As with the various other museums we went into prior to this one, the Koreans are not so great with putting any of the accompanying texts displayed in English. Which is frustrating and perplexing since one would think that they would jump at the chance to educate visitors on their rich history & culture. Instead one is left feeling very blah about whatever potentially interesting things we might be viewing since we have no idea what it is or it's significance. The English (when there is any) would be like 2 sentences long and then the Korean part would be whole paragraphs long .... erm, I think they're saying way more than the English translation here! Surely they can hire someone who can translate this stuff! Anyway this might have been 5 stars if it wasn't for the lack of English in the exhibits. Same goes for all the museums in Seoul that we went to."
impressive,the museum is massive! It has great stuff to look at and massive displays.... All free one of my favourite things in Seoul!
Great place to see alot of things about Korea history...,Spend time at the war memorial and it was great to see inside the hotel and at the same time there were so many things to see outside with military airplanes and tanks and alot more.. I didnt know much about Korean Military history so this was a great place to read and catch up.. Its a big place so bring your walking shoes...
Korean history at its best,"very large exhibit, wear good walking shoes. English speaking tours available, or you can walk it at your leisure. lots to see and very interesting, also lists the names by state and country of the fallen on the left of the main entrance. on the right is the outdoor exhibit. lots of kids, teens, ROK soldiers visiting and talking notes, also everyone shows great respect to the soldiers that fought in the war."
Heart touching,This is the first war memorial I have ever seen and this was an excellent experience. This museum offered a good balance of war time information along with interesting tidbits and artifacts from the war time. I could only spend about 2 hours in the museum and I will have to revisit there again to see this completely. Nice audio visual effects of the war time videos. I can easily spend an entire day over there.
Breathtaking,"After coming from Australia and seeing our war memorial, I thought it would be hard to beat. But the Korean war memorial had it all. A very well set out interior with interesting exhibits, plus an amazing outdoor area with full size ships, aircraft, and armored vehicles. This place is a must visit in Seoul. "
A must not only for historians and military people,The Korean War has been the most important event for the two Koreas in the 20th Century. The War Memorial is an outstanding museum to display these terrible and tragic events. It is particularly also easy accessible for the younger generation as there is a lot of audiovisual stuff and 4D-movies.
Absolutely fascinating.,"Behind the war memorial there is a huge museum and outside are many old aircraft, tanks and gunships recovered after the Korean War. If you're into military history, this must be the biggest and best free museum in the world? "
much better than expected,"The museum is rather big, and there are several levels in the building. The coverage of the Korean War is rather unique and comprehensive. Equally important and interesting are the exhibits on wars in Korean history. You need at least half a day there. If you want to learn more, a whole day is recommended. By the way, most museums in Seoul are free. Sometimes school children were led by their teachers to visit them."
Great museum,"I had no idea that it was such a large museum. Great statues, and great display of war planes, tanks, etc. outside the museum. Inside, there is a very informative display regarding the history of the Korean War, the wars during the ancient history of Korea, and also Korea's involve in other wars like the Vietnam War. Definitely a place that warrants at least half your day."
The Korea War and More,"The memorial and the museum was very large and covered all of the Korea conflicts all the way back before and after the Korean War. The outside and the vast majority of the inside is free to the public, with donation boxes found at the entrance. They do have paid exhibits. We could not make it through the entire museum the first time there was so much to see. "
Great trip,Had a great visit. Lots to see and numerous interactive exhibits. Would be better if the AC was working.
Very informative,"This is one museum that you really should visit. It has a lot of excellent detail about the Korean War, and gives the visitor a truly in-depth understanding of the torture that is war."
My son loves it!,"We spend almost one hour walking around checking out our the remains from the Korean War, and we took so many photos of my son ""in action"" with the war remains. He really really loves it!"
My Favorite museum to visit.,This was the neatest museum I have ever visited. There is so much to see and do at this museum. They have both indoor and outdoor exhibits. It also shows the wars that shaped both North and South Korea as they are now today. It even shows what has gone on after the 36 parallel was reestablished and how the DMZ was created. This is a museum worth seeing if you are coming for a short visit. I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes history or the TV show MASH. 
Worth a visit,"This place is a memorial to war. Although the place reminds us of a typical military project, there are many things to see. The outdoor exhibit has many military vehicles and aircraft. "
Great Museum about Korean War,You can spend a whole day here. There are many great things to see. There is also an outdoor exhibit which has lots of military tanks and planes. The dislike was that there was no air-conditioning inside of the building.
4D simulation of the Incheon descent,"You'll have to wait 30 min or more for a 7-minute movie, which is the most ridiculous thing in the world. You're not waiting because there are many people ahead, but because they need to clean and sterilize the 4D glasses after each showing (at least that's what it seemed to us)... Despite this ridiculousness, the simulator is worth the wait! It feels as if you were there in one of the planes. Won't say more because I don't want to spoil it. Bottom line is, it's worth it and you should do it! Museum is completely free, no entry fee."
Very sad and very interesting,This is a very sad and very interesting place in Korea. I think all Japanese people must come here to see it when they are in Seoul.
Remembering the Past,"Remembering how difficult the past has been, the lives of those that sacrificied to give us peace... worth a trip"
Nice Museum,"The museum was divided into sections - 3 for the Korean War and 1 for earlier military history. At the time of my visit, the 3rd section of the Korean War exhibit was under renovation. THe static display outside the museum was nice."
More than expected,"I almost missed this museum because of its low rank in Trip Advisor. But when I saw the huge sculptural ensemble at the entrance, I fell overwhelmed and decided to hop off the Sightseeing bus. It's not only a collection os weapons, it's a History museum of war as a memorial for peace, with a meditation place that feels like a shrine.Kids will be amazed to get in the planes and ships, though I think the field trip scholars in diapers I saw at the museum were much to small for such a visit."
The best museum I've ever been to,"Definitely the best museum I've ever been to. Lots of interactive exhibits, 4d theatres and much much more.Check it out, Korea has some wars to actually display"
great place to visit,"It's free and convenient to get to by subway. There are a lot to see inside but the outside exhibits are great for boys who love toys. Big toys! Like tanks, missiles, submarine, the famed B-52 bomber, and an assortment of airplanes. Completely worth spending an afternoon here!"
Interesting and Informative,The dioramas of the Korean war were very creative and informative.We found it interesting and learned loads about Korea. The displays of the different war vehicles outside was fun to see as well :) Definitely worth visiting to appreciate this country's history.
Wonderful tribute to allied forces that saved Korea,"Beautiful building and great exhibition of the history of wars in Korea with particular emphasis on the Korean War. We really liked the exhibit of planes, tanks and helicopters. "
Come here to shelter from outside heat and learn more about Korea's troubled history,"Decided to come here on a stinking hot day with a friend to escape outside heat and as usual with these types of places, I underestimated the size of the place and spent a good few hours running around the various exhibitions exhausted.Its totally free which is always a plus and has three floors all of which are completely packed with all sorts of war things, videos, touch screens etc.. I have sort of forgotten what exactly the exhibits were but almost all of the museum is dedicated to the Korean war. There is a little bit dedicated to subsequent world wars such as Vietnam and iraq etc.. but expect to mostly see stuff about the korean war here and be prepared to take it all in and learn about what really happened in Seoul and Korea.Some of the highlights from my four or so hours at this great venue are as follows:1) the 4d cinema which tells the story of Korea evacuating at the time Seoul was about to fall to northern Korean soldiers2) The various interactive screens that allow you to take photos and email them to yourself, 3) the outside display of aircraft such as B52, f4 phantom, helicopters,4) A display that to ok place in the main courtyard of the museum which had at least 100 performers. It was quite amazing as the 30 minute show started with a sword fight between soldiers dressed in those colourful and famous Korean military outfits. The display then moved through the years and ended up with maching bands, gunshots and a all the forces represented in a fun display, At the end of the display they spent a good 30 minutes posing for photos with anyone who wanted! Overall, it was an interesting experience that taught me alot about Korea and the show at the end was a highlight although I dont think the show happens every day so if you see it make sure you watch the whole thing!Plenty of bathrooms and water fountains about as well as 2 cafes that had reasonably priced food."
Interesting,"No entrance fee. Very accessible from subway station. The exterior of the lawns has this display of old war planes and tanks and you can walk inside the planes. Kids will enjoy this. Inside, they offer a free english guide. The history sounds interesting, but we could hardly hear the guide. He had a soft voice plus you can hear the other groups too. I think it would be better to read some of the history of the korean war, then join the english tour as a supplement for one to better appreciate the museum."
"Free, Nice and grand","A imposing monument to a sad but necesary war, is far from touristic routes and near to restaurant area"
A Must See,"This is a must see in Seoul, great information, you really learn the history of this great country! Very interactive and a great day out for all the family!"
Great Place!,"The War Memorial of Korea was an excellent place to visit. We went right after their Memorial Day so we got to see some of the special event materials set up and everything. The museum as a whole was amazing to take in. The set up of all the tanks, air planes and other war vehicles was really cool to see. It was a great way to learn about Korea's history and why they are where they are today."
Interesting place to see,We went there on a Sunday morning. We were very fortunate not to have many fellow travellers at that time and could move around freely. It was very interesting for us and provided a good background on Korea's previous battles.
Best museum I've been to!,"After living and sightseeing around Seoul for over a year, I can honestly say this museum is one of my favorite things in the whole city. I expected it to be just a regular museum where you look at artifacts behind glass and that's it but this was so much more. My husband and I spent hours at the museum and walked away with so much more knowledge about the Korean war and other Korean history as well. The inside of the museum is displayed in a very creative and interesting way as you wonder through different eras of time or parts of the war. We even got our own free, private English tour guide (who was a Korean war refugee as a child) to give us an hour long tour and learned even more (some it first hand!) about the war time. The outside of the museum is just as interesting as the inside with so many planes, helicopters, boats, tanks, etc. set up, several of which you can climb inside of. I definitely recommend this museum!"
Incredibly done,I learned more in four hours here than in any class I have ever taken. The museum was extremely well layed out and maintained and the displays were creative and informative.
Very nice museum,"The War Memorial of Korea is a very large museum located off of the Samgakji subway station (line 4 or line 6). Take exit 12 and walk straight a couple of minutes. There are a lot of statues, tanks, planes and other memorials on the grounds.The museum is free and provides a great perspective on various topics (not just the Korean War). It was a great place to learn and reflect on Korean history."
You can soend a day here!,"Loads to see. Beautifull films in various spots in theaters. 3D, also called 4D as things move. Loads also in English."
Amazing place for historian and military buff,"This place is simply amazing and this is not because it is free admission. From the look of the building (it looks a bit like Capitol Hill or some advanced government building) to the real life examples of various military equipment located in the lawn (including real life-sized planes, tanks and artiliary of both the US and Korean military), one could spend at least one full day here if you care to look at all the exhibit both inside and outside. One will definately be more appreciative of the deep military ties between US and South Korea and the Korean War. We also saw school children visiting the place, which is probably part of their school programme to learn more about the history of the country. Definately worth the visit and you can take as many pictures as you want. Note that the memorial is not located near any other mainstream tourist attractions and it is about a 5 minute walk from the subway station."
On a par with London's Imperial War Museum,"Actual war machines and aircraft. Larger than life statutes. Massive displays of artillery and shells. A real vault for history. Thousands of years recounted. In the recent history, it reflects same sense of isolation for South Korea as the UK during 'The Blitz'. Keeps today's tension between North and South palpable. Reinforces all the days since Chosin Reservoir."
Great place for kids,"Reasons why I recommend this attractions:1. FOC attraction2. Lots of fighter planes, guns, bullets and trucks for picture taking3. Learn a part of Korean History through war weapons and equipments4. Kids could try gun shooting games on the highest floor5. 3D Show on fighter planes available but limited slots. We needed to ""chomp"" our seats by literally sitting at the waiting area as the seats indicate the exact seats available in the theatre. A short 5 mins ride but the wait can be for 20mins.6. Free access to locker services. We parked all our heavy stuff and had a great time since we managed to offload alot of the weight from our bag.7. Prepare to walk alot before you reach the museum. Once arrived, our legs were so ""tired"" that we rested our feet in the cafe. But the cafe was crowded with people and it was very warm! The whole musuem was also very warm throughout our visit. Not sure why.After alighting from the MRT, just keep walking along the street even though you cannot see the museum. After walking 5mins with heavy traffic on your right, you will see the musuem. Have fun!"
Excellent FREE museum with interactive exhibits,"I went here based on good reviews and was surprisingly impressed! I only had a couple of hours before it closed, but I could have spent much more time here. It is not the typical war museums with only hands-off exhibits. There are plenty of tanks, aircraft, ship, and other war transports outside the museum. Inside, the brochure/guide leads you through well laid out, hands on exhibits. My favorites included 3D and 4D films (think snow, wind, and 3D glasses) about what it was like to be in camps and evacuated, practice gun shoots, audio recordings, large movie screen video clips, and an interactive photo booth where you can take pics of yourself in military uniforms, outside the museum and then e-mail them to yourself right there (all for free)! This place is amazing and best of all it's free. Definitely worth a visit."
Very quiet,"You can take pictures with the tanks, fighter planes outside. The place is so quiet when we went there. "
Hands on Exhibits,I was pleasantly surprised by the number of exhibits displayed outdoors. Upon further examination almost all can be touched and entered. Many Korean war era aircraft are on hand as well as their nemesis the Scud missle. 
Free and Excellent Museum,"My Visit Seoul tour guide, which is a free service provided by the city of Seoul, offered to take me to The War Memorial after our 3.5 hour tour. I'm very happy he did; this place is laid out nicely and is FREE to visit. In addition to an Outdoor Exhibition Area, there are six indoor exhibition rooms: (1) The Memorial Hall, (2) The War History Room, (3) The Korean War Room, (4) The Expeditionary Forces Room, (5) The ROK Armed Forces Room and (6) The Large & Defense Industries Equipment Room. There are multiple theatres which are free as well. Whether it is raining or sunshine, this is a must place to visit."
Must See!,It is easy to reach this place by subway and I was impressed by the first sight of the place when I arrived. The flow of the exhibits was well thought through and well organized.
Interesting and free!,"The War memorial closes on Monday, which unfortunately, is the day that I went! Nevertheless, all the tanks, planes, 1 war ship and many other weapons used by the US, Koreans, Chinese etc were on display OUTSIDE the museum. Overall, it was an eye-opener and I enjoyed myself thoroughy. "
You could spend days here,"It is the history of Korean warfare since the beginning of Korean warfare. Very thorough with some weapons and machines my father, who is quite the war historian, had never seen in-person before. It's also a very moving experience to walk past the bronze plaques filled with names of the fallen. It is well worth a visit. It helps one to understand not only Korea's past but where we are now as well."
A must when visiting Seoul,I learnt more about Korea in this Museum than I could have possibly ever imagined. It's free too. Allow at least four or five hours in order to appreciate what it has to offer. 
You can peak into a B-52 pilot's cabin.,"Informative museum covering various aspects of the Korean war (but also a long history of warfare on the Korean peninsula), a short ""4D experience"" of Incheon landings (3D movie representing a soldier's POV, supported with realistically shaking seats)... and there is a B-52 outside of the building!"
Very Interesting!,"Very glad we made it there. What attracted us at first were all the military aircraft on display outside. You can even enter some of them. There were tanks, aircrafts, missiles, a ship and helicopters. We were surprised it was free admission. The displays were great, some interactive. My favorite was a memorial within the museum (forgot the name) where the water falls into a beautiful pond like area."
Not to be missed,"Regardless of whether you have a few days or a few weeks in South Korea you really must visit this museum. Its not only a fascinating insight into the Korean War but also an amazingly well thought out and presented museum with lots of interactive opportunities. There are lots of touch screens so you can view confidential documents or listen to interviews with soldiers from the war or watch videos about certain periods of the war.When you enter the museum the first area on the left is the main attraction and for us was the most interesting. The 4D simulation (bit Disney World like) and the upstairs section on modern war weren't so interesting.There are lockers and a cafe, plus its free to enter!Its one of the best museums that we have visited in Asia, if not the world."
A nice morning spent.,"We went there on a cold winter's morning. It took us awhile to finish looking at the memorials outside and displays of all the military vehicles. Almost all of these were centered around the Korean War. It was nice to see inside had many different areas. Starting with ancient times and ancient warfare, through the dealings of Korea with various different world powers through history.Japanese occupation, and of course the Korean War were big focus point. I already knew a great deal about this history, but even if I didnt, the exhibits are set up in a way which introduces the history and events of the war step by step. Even if you knew nothing about the history, it is all there for you in movies, pictures, exhibits and reading.They also have sections dedicated to the peacekeeping missions of the Korean military, a section on the Vietnam war, and some exhibits about the future.I saw a LOT of Korean soldiers on a field trip around. Countless groups of about 20 students following around their instructor. In one point I scampered to get out of their way, and the sergeant addressed me in English, asking me to come feel the vibration of a simulator. I felt awfully singled out!! There wasnt much for sale inside the museum, but on the grounds is a souvenier shop, a convenience store and a food place. I bought my dad a souvenir, piece of barbed wire from the DMZ, thinking it would be cheaper than AT the DMZ, it was perhaps 25,000 won. I found it the next day for 15,000 won.. wasnt pleased!!"
Remembering the War of Korea,This a huge place and ideal for students and those who are interested in learning about the war that korea went through.They managed to preserve the relics of Korean wars. there is also a display of the type of weapons used by korean and their artilleries.
A War Museum that compares with the best of them,"This museum is enormous, and doesn't just focus on South Korean efforts; there are displays for every country that has been part of the conflicts on the peninsula (and some that haven't) over the last century.The different areas and approaches to a Museum of War have to be seen, if you are in any way interested in history and conflict. It can get a little busy (but not packed) in peak times so if you go on a weekday (when the weather is pleasant) you should escape the worst of the crowds."
Excellent,"I enjoyed the War Memorial much more than I expected. As you walk to the entrance, you see the names of the fallen memorialized in the walls. It's always a solemn and sobering thing to remember how violent the human race can be. Then you step inside and find yourself among the various exhibits chronicling Korean history. The displays turned out to be quite fascinating and very detailed. Even if you just spend an hour or so (as we did), you can come away with a full appreciation for the beauty and the ugliness that has shaped the country into what it is now."
Inspirting,"This is a museum and memorial to the korea wars. There is a hall of all US soldiers who died in the Korean war. There are three floors, starting with the wars of Korea in the distant past all the way to the recent threats by North Korea. THe exhibits are in chronological order, with an amazing hall of remembrance for both the foreign soldiers who fought and died for/with korea and a hall for the korean soldiers. Inside is an amazing collection of uniforms, equipment and scenes from wars dating back to the bronze age all the way to the bombs and weaponry of today. Outside are planes, tanks, helicopters....all of this free. It worth the 3 or more hours to take it all in. They also have a live exhibit with a traditional korean wedding. It is a very interesting, peaceful, reflective place to spend the afternoon. "
A must see!!,"An excellent over view of the Korean war, and Korea's military history. Well worth a visit. Very nice modern museum."
"Great, but Many Exhibits Were Under Construction","This museum is powerful for those unfamiliar with the war and military history of Korea. They do have a lot of interactive exhibits, but all but two of them were closed during our visit. There's a lot of reading to do, so it might be good to go on two different occasions while on your way to other things. Walking through the battleship outside and walking up on the castle walls on the inside were my two favourite things."
Great Place to Understand a bit of the War History,"I was mainly attracted to the large number of tanks and aircraft including a shot up boat (!) they have sitting outside the memorial.But the inside we equally impressive and if you are a war buff then you could easily spend a day here. We didn't do the DMZ tour so this was the compromise. Much to our surprise and delight they had a show in the main square of the memorial with ancient fighters and changing of the guard for modern military. At the end of it they had photo ops with everyone. You could tell they were really focusing on tourists which was great. Even some mascots there for the kids.If you go here it is about 1 bus stop from Itaewon the foreigner area of Seoul, so definitely on the tourist track. "
Wonderful Museum,"Even if you don't particularly like museums, this one is not to be missed. It was so interactive and fun! There is so much to learn and see here. Also, kids will enjoy it, too! I have been to a lot of museums, but this one is by far the nicest, most well designed I have ever stepped foot in. Do not miss this great attraction and learning experience!"
Do NOT Miss This Museum!,"Prepare for your visit by reflecting that Korea always been threatened on the west by China and on the east by Japan (""a shrimp between two whales"" is an ancient Korean metaphor). Thus much of Korean history has to do with warfare with one or both of these powers. If you already are familiar with the basics of Korean history, you know something of Admiral Yi Sun Shin who, in the 1590s, stymied Japanese invasions led by Hideyoshi, in part by his revival and redesign of Korea's ""turtle boats"", the world's first armored warships. There is a scale model of a turtle boat in the museum for your contemplation. Even aside from his use of turtle boats, though, Yi, a brilliant admiral by any standard (he's been compared favorably to Nelson) is the preeminent naval hero of Korea. But my point here is this: Korea's military history is represented chronologically by statues of her heroes, beginning in a circular room with statuary surrounding a huge fountain under a skylight (easily the most beautiful fountain I've ever seen)--a shrine, really, so take off your hat and allow it to work its mood on you. Now notice that Yi Sun Shin, of the 16th Century, is not even included in this inner sanctum, but is relegated to the rows of statues outside, leading to it. This is deep history, folks; about 4000 years worth of a single culture coming together out of separate and warring kingdoms. You've seen downtown Seoul, Myongdong, Itaewon, the palaces, Nam San. Now devote an afternoon, just a few hours, to experience the roots of this magnificent country and people."
Very interesting.,Go outside first. The old war planes are the coolest part. English speaking tour guides are available.
Wedding Hall?,"This has a wedding hall as a part of the grounds which I found a bit odd....Moving past that it is a great memorial as it lists everyone who died in the Korean War and also had a museum for past wars and an area to look at, touch and get in old airplanes and such."
Excellent museum,"If you're in Seoul, you have to stop at this museum. My concierge originally had no idea what I was talking about, so I'm not sure how frequent of a stop it is for many tourists. But, it's worth a visit.The museum is set up very well and the designated walking path guides you through the history of war in Korea, from pre-historic times to present. The exhibits were informative and interesting. Free entry, too. "
This place is just amazing,"If you have any curiosity about Korean culture/the history of Korean war, etc. this is a must see place. The museum is HUGE, has an amazing display of weapons, tanks, planes, etc. and you will enjoy every moment of it. I find the statue outside with a South Korean soldier holding a dying North Korean one quite poignant, see the attached picture. Overall, I think it's a must visit if you have a few extra hours in Seoul to yourself, or if you visit with kids."
Must-see for any history buff,"I walked to the museum (10-15 minutes) from the Namyeong station, passing the USO along the way. (Useful to know if you plan on doing the DMZ tour) The first thing you notice are the monuments and statues outside - they really set the tone for some of the sad and poignant stories you read about inside.As an English speaker, I was concerned that I would become disinterested due to the lack of translation. On the contrary, the visitor guide outlined all the exhibits in a very clear and concise manner - with English translations, though brief, accompanying most artifacts. The outdoor display of equipment, which allows you to get up close and personal, is a great way to end the tour. All in all, a tremendous museum and a must-see for anyone remotely interested in (military) history. As good as any museum you'll find in London - yes, i'm referring to you Imperial War Museum!"
Highly recommended,"I visited the memorial with a colleague on a recent business trip. As others have commented the museum is spread across the different wars that have impacted South Korea. The museum is well laid out, with many displays and artefacts, lots of English descriptions! Outside there are planes, ships and other large memorabilia. The museum is free and great for both adults and kids alike. If you have a spare 2-3 hours then I highly recommend this!"
Very informative,"If you have an interest in the development of South Korea as a nation- visit this museum. The museum is divided into historic wars, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, more recent efforts (Gulf War, Afghanistan, Iraq, and Peace Keeping missions as part of the UN), relations with North Korea, and tools/equipment used by the armed forces. The highlight for me were the exhibits on the Korean War- teaching me more about the War than I had known. "
Eye Opener to Vehicles used during the War.,Its FOC. Huge area and nice design to lay out all the machinery. You can also get up close and personal with them which brings the wow factor up an extra notch! Best war memorial Ive been to in Asia!
Great day out!,We spent the whole day here and didn't find a dull moment. It was so interesting and even fun with the tanks and planes displayed outside of the museum. Highly recommended for any age.
A Part of Korean History.,"I spent a more than three hours at this museum, clearly not enough because I just had time to take a quick look at the outdoor displays where you find fighters, tanks, boats and even a real B-52 Stratofortress!First, this museum is easy to find and free of charge. You can get an pamphlet in English at the entrance. In case you need energy before long walking hours or a break during or after the visit, you can find sanwiches and drinks in a small cafeteria. The gift shop is a disappointment, small and almost no books in English, not even one on the Korean War.The inside exhibits are well organized, easy to follow. The Korean War takes a big section of two floors with key points in English, photos, artefacts, dioramas and so on. There are also an 3D movie and a shooting game which make up the fun part of the visit.Too bad that I could not take a guided tour. However, I was lucky to come on a Friday in May where there was a marching parade which was just awesome.If you come to visit Seoul, don't miss the War Memorial Museum."
Fantastic Feature,this is my favorite place when i was in Korea. technology was so nice.. good stuffs to visit. it's free admission.. so far away from so spooky museum.. kinda cool museum. even nicest than national museum of korea.
Peace for Korea,The highlight of my trip in Seoul. I was deeply moved and impressed with what I saw in the museum. Worth your time. Tip: Go on a weekday. ^_^
Why can't all museums be like this?,Visitors would need a full 4 hours to completely appreciate this museum. The interactive exhibits and displays are all worth the try. This museum completely explains in detail the story of the Korean War. This one comes in as highly-recommended...
My favorite spot in Seoul,Ever since I first came to the War Museum I always try to come back here every time I visit Seoul. It's a very special park and museum. Definitely try to go there if you're in Seoul.
Educational,"We really enjoyed visiting the War Memorial. We felt like we learned a lot about the history and culture of Korea through the Memorial. I normally am not a big history museum fan, but this one is well put together and has English translations at all of the exhibits. It is a long exhibit to walk through, so small children may get bored or tired before the end of it. There are also old military planes outside which the kids enjoyed. "
Excellent outdoors and indoors,"Took my 10yr old S&M. Great planes, tanks, missiles outside and good exhibitions inside. Do the 4D experience of cold fighting."
"Big and comprehensive, take part in some simulations",The main floor is about the Korean war 1950-53. It will illustrate so many aspects of it.... Do go to some of the Experience rooms. Please Note they usually seems to start every 30 min with a break from 1130-1300.
Amazing museum and free!,"Everyone should visit this museum while in Seoul. Even if you are not very interested in war you will enjoy the history. Best of all it is free and has many interactive displays, movies etc. There are also planes and tanks outside; set aside a few hours as you will need time to see everything."
A must see,"Especially for people that complained about the US bullying the world, you will understand why it is necessary after visiting this and reading the book Second World War from Churchill."
"Awesome time, recommended!","Had a great time visiting The War Memorial of Korea. There are plenty of things to see and some of the exhibits are truly inspiring. Entrance is cheap and you will leave with a great insight into the Korean war and how it has effected so many people, and continues to do so. Highly recommended!"
Excellent Museum,"I went here with my husband the same day I visited the National Museum of Korea. The bottom floor has an overview of early battles Korea was involved in, with the top 2 floors focused on the Korean War. Even though we had already spent 3 hours at the National Museum of Korea and were a little tired, the War Memorial of Korea was able to keep our attention for 3 more hours, and the only reason we left as soon as we did was because the museum was closing. I hadn't expected the museum itself to be so extensive, and it gave a really great background of the history of Korea and helped me understand Korea's relationship with North Korea today. The English translations were great and the museum was arranged in a way that made it easy to follow and learn. And it was free!"
Worth visiting!,"I am not a person who is interested in all these military and war stuff but I am hooked by this museum! Entrance is free and be prepared to spend at least 2 - 3 hours as the museum is relatively huge! They have real tanks, battleship, and planes which I am really amazed at. You can climb up to the battleship and explore inside. There is also free 3D shows on the battleship which we missed it. We get to learn more about all the previous wars which Koreans have involved in, the weapons they used, and the Generals and Soldiers who sacrificed during the war. It is actually quite scary to imagine how would a real war be by looking at all the weapons, guns, tanks, etc at massive scale. Don't miss the free cultural performance at 2:00 p.m. every Friday from April 12 till June at the Plaza in front of the museum. They have military musical performance, traditional martial arts, and women honour guard marching which are worth watching! Do go early to get a good seat!"
"Powerful and Moving, Good Way to Start your Seoul Searching","From the airport, I head straight to this place. I don't have a map, thus it took me a few minutes to locate the place. It should be easy to find, I just walked in the opposite direction initially.The monument immediately caught my attention. I was moved. I saw a number of fighting planes and other mode of transportation for combat. When you go inside, you will learn a lot about their history, the war, and how they managed to survive. This is a definitely must-not-miss place when you visit Seoul. It is just a few minutes from Seoul station and there is no entrance fee. This will give you a better appreciation of the country, the people, and how the rest of the world helps one another during war."
Must see,"The museum is excellent. With free entrance, is extremely well fitted and tells the history of wars involving Korea over the centuries. Shows weapons, clothes, military vehicles, maps, secrets documents, etc. On the main entrance stair a impact phrase is written: freedom and peace are not free. Outside there is the famous statue of two brothers who find themselves in battle defending opposite sides, plus a big and interesting display of ships, rockets, airplanes (including one B52!) and helicopters of the last war with North Korea! ! Have at least four hours to have a good visit to the museum."
Fantastic place for boys who love planes and guns and for adults with an interest in the Korean Hostilities,"Went to the war memorial as a place to escape a rainy day but was very pleasantly surprised. We decided to go due to some very positive reviews on trip advisor and we weren't disappointed. If you have young boys (and those young at heart) who are into guns, tanks, planes, helicopters etc they will have a fantastic time and a great place to spend the day with the kids. It is also a very Informative place for those wanting to learn more about the various Korean conflicts, starting back from ancient times to current time North and South Korea's conflicts, which was very topical during the time of our visit. They have free storage locker facilities as well.Well worth the visit and I would recommend it as a top 10 attraction in Seoul."
Not really attractive.,Definitily not the most interesting to discover Korean culture.I would say the same about many war memorials of course.
"powerful. a tribute to the lost from ""The Forgotten War""","it recently got a makeover for its Korean War exhibits. very very well done. although the locals don't go here, it's still a powerful reminder of the Korean War and its impact on the country. the event was the country's most important event in its modern history and this place stands as a reminder to never forget such a tragic event (3 million civilians out of 30 million died)"
Impressive place,"This is a must see for anyone with any interest in Korea's history. It is huge and very well designed, you can see the effort and expense that went into building it. You can walk around it in a couple of hours but would need at least a day if you wanted to really look at everything in depth. The planes and war machinery outside are very cool."
so much history,"The war museum is fascinating as there are decommissioned planes, tanks and rockets located outside. Inside the museum there is a detailed breakdown of the Korean war as well as the wars South Korea has been involved in.Was worth the visit especially since it's free"
Fantastic for military equipment fans,"This is a great half-day out. To the right of the museum (facing it) is a massive park full of planes, tanks and boats. The museum itself is good too, but it is the park outside that made it for me."
What a war museum should be,"A very comprehensive museum. It's not just the Korean War of the 1950s but other wars from the past. However, as expected, the Korean War is significant. In fact, the essence of the Korean War was captured by the sculpture at the entrance of two brothers - on opposing sides - embracing on the battlefield. This is a must visit for anyone interested in Korea. It's sad, but somehow offers hope. It gives one a little more understanding what the Korean people have gone through in the past."
Touching,I live and work across the street from the Memorial. There is a lot of good and interesting information at this site. In America we were never taught in detail about the Korean War (at least I wasn't). Very touching and you will find plenty of people to talk to there that were part of the War itself. This is a must see.
This is a place that you really should visit.,"There is a lot to be said for a country when you see what type of War Memorial it has, and the Seoul one is most impressive. From the memorials out the front to the ship, planes, tanks and other weapons on the side just a walk outside is worthwhile. Inside there is three floors of well presented displays and exhibits, some are 3 or 4D. You can easily spend several hours here."
Outstanding! One of the best we have ever seen.,"This was a super surprise to us. We left this as a ""Fill In"" museum for when we got bored and had some extra time. It turned out to be one of the highlights of the trip. They have an AMAZING array of miliraty weaponry, vehicles, tanks, aircraft, missiles, guns, jeeps, boats, etc. Most of which you can let the kids climb on and in for photos and to get out some energy. Great photo ops inside and out.The inside themed displays were better than any museum we have seen short of the Smithsonian. Hands on displays, video players and short clip videos nearly everywhere telling small stories of the era being displayed most with actual footage and extremely well done graphics. Three stories of outstanding displays. a MUST SEE. And it is all 100% free!They have QR codes to scan all over the museum to hear the narrative about each section or item, but unfortunately the narrative is only in Korean. Take the time to find out when an english tour is happening and join them. It will be well worth it!The inside exhibits are not geared toward small children, but the outside displays are prefect for all ages!"
Nice statues outside and picture opportunities,We visited the war memorial during our 2012 trip and had an interesting time. Check out the huge statues of soldiers outside and the exhibition is a good place to start if you want to learn about the conflict between North and South Korea.
History of Korea past. Fantastic.,"This should be mandatory for all to visit.It's a huge indoor- outdoor multi level museum for all ages.I would say that too do this museum right make a day of it, you won't be disappointed. wear some good walking shoe's and pace yourself.Enjoy the History of Korea.Ion Berry"
Very interesting museum,"This is a very interesting and well executed memorial and museum. You will get a full perspective on the events that have led up to the current situation on the Korean peninsula. If you are an English speaker I highly recommend taking a guided tour. Our tour guide was personally impacted and had many interesting stories to share. He really brought the exhibits, timeline and history to life in a way you would miss out on just walking through. Additionally, he was able to show the connections between various events and the impact on the people. A must see in Seoul!"
Good internal & external exhibition,Whilst some think of Korean war as abridged season 2 of WW II or even spin-off. It was a short yet intense war that cause as much emotional and physical damage. This museum is collection and reminder from these wars(and also from older days). Exhibition is well made and external exhibition is also pretty good which includes B-52(albeit older model). You cannot go inside the plane however. 
Get a guided Tour,"Exhibits are well done and the area to see the tanks/war planes is also very neat, but the best way to do this museum is getting a guided tour to learn the history and hear a perspective on current events between N. Korea and S. Korea. A MUST in Seoul."
Amazing amount of history,"We had a 12 hour layover in Seoul so we took a fast train from the airport into the city and spent the day at the museum. WOW! They had Korean war history from stone age days to present. Then, just when you think you've seen it all, there is an outdoor display of planes, tanks, vehicles, boats,...etc. This is a very well done museum and a must see. The train from airport was around $30, fast, reliable and well-worth it."
Loved it! Combo memorial and museum.,"What a great place to visit! This memorial is a combination of a memorial and a history museum. Outside the building there are a variety of powerful statues and tributes to those who took part in the Korean War. There is also a range of military planes and ships on display [great for kids to look at!]. The museum itself is extremely informative and very tastefully done. We ended up arriving right in time for a free tour in English, and our guide (Roy) was knowledgeable and friendly. I walked out feeling like I had learned far more about the Korean War than I would have gleaned from any history book."
Worth a visit,"Well worth a visit! The place is basically divided up in to two. The planes, tanks and artillery outside and the displays inside. Outside has the following and much more; include a B 52, an F 4, a cobra helo and a Type 59 tank (Tiananmen Sq. if you're curious as to what it must have felt like to stand in front of one!)The exhibits inside are much more sober as it details, amongst other events, the Korean War which was quite intense. Overall outside is great for kids (both big and small!) and inside is very informative if you want to learn more about what shaped the country in its present state)."
Korean War Memorial,"I spent the best part if a full day here. Admission is free and they have English guides. There was some much it's hard to list but if you are in Seoul don't miss out.The exhibits are very well displayed and have English descriptions. Children would particularly enjoyed the planes, tanks etc and not forgetting the rifle range which they would really enjoy. This memorial is very educational.I loved the speaker banks that were placed in the demilitarized zone to broadcast into North Korea."
Excellent museum,This was an incredible museum with the history of not just war in Korea but in many other places as well. The displays were excellent and very informative. I would definitely like to visit this museum again at some point.
"Incredible Museum, Highly Recommended, Full day trip!","We went to the Memorial just to see what all the hype was about and we were not disappointed, it is definitely a full day trip. There were 4-D movies that either moved the platform you were viewing from or rumbled your seats and sprayed water. I loved how the exhibits followed a set course so you could see the entire museum. We spent a few hours in the museum and saw so much but it's definitely a full day trip. It's interesting to see how a country so riddled with war has such hope for reunification of Korea. There is definitely a lot of emotion surrounding the attacks on South Korea, but what I found incredible was the memorial aspect, they don't call it a war museum, they call it a memorial.Go there, but don't forget to be respectful, there are many memorial aspects to the location."
Beautiful Museum with Free Entry,"Went to this place because i saw airplanes and tanks in the outside. So curious at the beginning and amazed when look inside. Indoor and outdoor museum. So regret because i went the when autumn, was rain that time, so can't spend much time in the outdoor one.. But, i can say this is one of the best museum i ever visited."
one of the best museum in the world,"We've been to many museums all over the world, but this place is top 3 on our lists. It was amazing. It's free, and there are so much to see and learn. You realize you know a little about this war until you come here. I completely understand they want to honor korean military because this museum is in korea, but it'll be nice if they can honor non korean military who died for this war too, they could not have done without these guys. Anyway, you can spend all day here. It's very educational and easy to understand. Their displays were amazing we thought it was done by disney. I recommend to take DMZ tour before and you'll understand more what happened. This is a must see if you're in seoul!!"
A great museum!,"It is a great museum to tell you about the Korean War. It was a great prelude to our visit to the Joint Security Area at Panmunjom the next day. They have a huge outdoor display area with planes and tanks from the war, which got my son all excited. An attraction not to be missed!"
Need 3-4 hours but a must see!!,"One of the best museums I have ever been to, and I have traveled all of the world! Amazing 4d experiences, clean, well done and it is FREEThe history of the peninsula is so intense and I never realized how many wars have taken place here.You will need to block off at least 3-4 hours to see everything! Outside planes and tanks we pretty interesting as well. Should be interesting enough for teenagers..."
A little too one sided,"Very impressive displays but a little too pro-military and not as much pro-peace. Yes, it was a war memorial but it would be nice to have a little more about the horror of war instead of only the glory of it."
Neat to go inside the tanks,"When I went here I had a great time looking around at all the helicopters, planes and tanks. Even though I'm female, and not particularly interested in these things, I still found it fun to go inside the old machines. After looking around (which is all free) we went into the Bodyworld Exhibit. I don't think it's there anymore- this was last year, however, they do have travelling exhibits that show in the same space. These aren't free though, but I think the price was 26,000 won but was a great experience. I think boys would really love this site!"
Boys loved it.,Clean and well organized. Interesting stories and displays of Korea's colourful war history. I expected to spend 1-2 hrs here but my boys 7 and 11 wanted to spend the whole day! We ended up here for about 4 hours. Free admission was a bonus.
Favorite Attraction,"Free, well done museum that has many interactive displays. The museum also does a good job of explaining the Korean conflicts. The cafe makes delicious coffee for a break from the exhibits. "
The war memorial of Korea,Great experience. One of the best museum I ever been. Displays were set up very interesting and easy to learn about Korean war.Recommended !!!
War Memorial,"Brilliant day out ,so much to see both outdoors and in the museum . Memorials breathtaking , Exibhits throughout the museum well presented "
One of my favourite museums in Seoul,"This museum is one of my favourites! Not only does it have the typical museum stuff like art, old books, historical tools, etc, but it also has great statues/memorials, a Turtle Ship, tanks, jets, etc. It really is a great place to look at history. Though the tone of it is obviously subdued overall, this museum is really a great way to spend a morning."
cool military stuff,"lots of tanks, airplanes and boats. Awesome monuments to the remembrance of the war. Close to the touristic district and to the financial center."
Korean War History,"Definitely worth the visit. Apart from many war vehicles, there is a list of name of thousands of people who died in the Korean war; free guide in english; super high-tech; and if you are lucky you can see a korean wedding outside."
Well done and interesting,I enjoyed learning more about the Korean War. We had a free guide who spoke English well. Could have spent more time there..
War Memorial Of Korea,"This was one of the finest war museums which I have ever visited. It had dioramas of the Korean War that clearly showed what the war was like for civilians as well as the military. It let the visitor experience what the war was like. It was well laid out. The outside also had an exhibit of planes, missiles, tanks, and other Korean War artifacts, We went there in December and it was bitterly cold outside with a covering of snow but it was definitely worth a visit despite the weather."
Good place to get a idea of old things,"It consists of two parts - one is museum - which is mostly like any other museum and contains some boring stuff (mostly for display... product from stone age, paintings and things like that). Fun begins at the 2nd part which consists of real tanks, fighter planes for display. This place is really awesome and you get to see these things in real. They are, however, very old but still real. Very nice place to spend time."
Who wants a war?,"not just okay, it was very great, but bwho wants a war anyway? the museum is rich and when you remember that lives are lost unnaccessarily, you lost the fervour of the visit."
very informative,"All of the displays are in both Korean and English. Lots of information, from historical times to modern day. We tried to focus on modern day exhibits, as there was just TOO much to see!"
Not entirely about the Korean War,"Probably on of the best museums you'll find about the Korean War, with some caveats. First, it's helpful to know something about the Korean War before you visit. Second: however it may have started out, this Museum is no longer completely about the Korean conflict of 1950-53. Third: the help South Korea got from the U.S. and the U.N is somewhat understated, and the focus seems to be on South Korean suffering and heroes. The multimedia presentations are most all in Korean, but at least they usually have subtitles. The outdoor displays are excellent, but again, include weapons that did not play in the Korean War. A major disappointment for me was the Dokdo display, highlighting an ongoing territorial dispute with Japan. Not surprising from the ultra-nationalistic Koreans, but totally inappropriate in what should be a memorial for the thousands who sacrificed for their freedom. Save your grudges for a booth at the airport, Adashi!A whole section seems to be devoted to promoting the modern Korean Arms Industry. Didn't detract from the visit, my guests enjoyed it, but Really?!Do NOT expect to get a comprehensive knowledge of the Korean War from this museum. Pluses: admission is free, easily accessible by subway (Samgakchi Station)"
"Interesting museum, well worth a visit",The War Memorial Museum makes for an excellent visit and is quite thought provoking. There were a lot of Korean soldiers walking around which gave it an interesting atmosphere. 
best museum i visited,at the entrance a 13y old pupil asked me if he could show me around ... very nice they volunteer to learn english and in exchange you get a young enthusiastic tour guide for free :)
Good Work, War Memorial serves as an inspiration for South Koreans. Hard work and determination for freedom can be felt from the different movie clips that were installed all over the place. Congratulations South Koreans for having such a memorial.
Imposing building,"Some great displays, and great use of technology to help tell the story. The turtle ship is pretty awe-inspiring, and the whole building itself is quite imposing. Only thing is that the dioramas are not as good quality as those you find in the Australian War Memorial. Still, well worth the visit."
Great place if you enjoy military history.,My wife and I just came back from the Korean War Memorial. The museum was closed but we were able to walk around and view the outdoor display of war machines on hand. It was really good even though we were not able to enter all the exhibits so I can imagine it would be wonderful if you go and they are open.
Fantastic museum,"This museum is great. Free. Informative. Well laid out. Helpful attendants. Nice cafe on top floor with great view of Seoul Tower and Itaewon. As the Korean War is so important in the shaping of the country, it is a must for any visitor. "
Learned about more than just the Korean War,While the main thrust of the museum is the Korean War there is much here about many conflicts Korea has been in from the distant past through the modern day. I definitly got a feel for how tragic the Korean War was on the Korean pennisula and how it echoes into today. I missed the English guided tour but it looks like they are planning to add self-guided audio tours in the future. This will be a nice addition. If you are interested in the martial history of Korea this is a place to go. Towards the end when I found myself getting hungry I found a cafe on the top floor which served some food and the proces were quite resonable.
Very Interesting and FREE!,"We visited the War Memorial/Museum twice during our stay as there was a lot to take in. Just around the corner from the American military base and with 1:1 replicas of recent naval skirmishes with the north, the War Memorial drives home the reality of what South Koreans are living with every day.The displays have plenty of english information and cover south korean military history back to feudal times. There are tanks, ships and planes outside to walk around and photograph. Understandably the main displays are on the Korean war, which is presented well with interesting insights, diplomatic cables, personal stories and plenty of memorabilia. Other displays include South Korea's involvement in the Vietnam war and more recent peacekeeping missions."
set aside lots time,"Really interesting memorial combining artifacts, ineractive exhibitions ad information on the background and history of Korean War. Would recommend to anyone interested in history of modern Korea."
Could have spent hours here!,"Started out by looking at the planes, tanks, and ships outside. Though it was freezing, spent two hours it was so interesting. Then went inside for another few hours until it closed and still did not get to see everything. Shared a lot of information about the Korean War with a lot of interactive displays and videos, most of which we did not get to watch. There are English speaking guides who are more than happy to share with you LOTS of information about the Korean War. Also, all the information we saw was displayed in English and Korean, including movies and displays.An excellent stop for anyone who would like to learn more about the Korean War."
tears of the sun !!!,the war that never ends....people on edge ...thats what is displayed here....the tears of people ...and the spirit that never dies...two cousin ...apart...
Excellent way to start off a trip,"Really great museum! it details Korean wars, and especially the war with the North. Really a good way to start off your trip to Seoul, especially for those that are not so well acquainted with Korean history."
Great place to visit,"This museum is a must do. The setting is serene and beautiful, it is easily accessible, and the museum displays are both interactive and highly informative. In April on the anniversary of the invasion of S Korea by the North Koreans, there is a ceremony honoring those who lived through combat, and those that died. Many American GIs come to Korea for this event."
Great place to visit,"I do not find war type stuff very interesting, however this museum was definitely worth a visit. There is a variety of displays that keep a visitor interested. There are tanks and airplanes for people to climb on outside the museum. Children should find this part great. There were wonderful sculptures to see and plenty of audio visual displays to view. I learned a lot about Korea's past here. I am glad I visited this museum!"
Excellent,"I really recommend this place, I think it is the best War Memorial in the world. I spent 3 hours there and I couldn't do everything beside it is also free. it also give you all the information you need about the history of the country, If you are in Seoul don't miss it.. "
"Interesting, with a kids playground inside!","Good background of the details of not only the Korean War, but also other conflicts the Korean Peninsula has been involved in, including Japanese occupation. Interactive displays. Very popular with Korean families on the weekend as there is an indoor kids playground with jumping castles etc! You can also climb on the outdoor displays of old planes, trucks, armoured vehicles etc. Use the metro to get there."
Fitting Museum for Seoul after a Traumatic 20th Century,"It is perhaps easy to forget walking the streets of Seoul, that for much of the 20th century, Seoul had been occupied by a foreign power and occasionally a battlefield. From 1910-1945 Seoul was the headquarters of the Japanese colonial government. From 1950-53 during the Korean War, Seoul exchanged hands several times. Incredible what a difference we see today 60 years later.The War Memorial of Korea comemorates both tragedies mentioned above, but also focuses on conflicts centuries ago. I enjoyed browsing the exhibits as well as the monuments outside the museum. For visitors interested in military history, this museum is a must. The museum is primarily focused on the Jurchen War, Imjin War, Manchu Inavasion, Colonial Period, and the Korean War."
Thought-provoking,We went mostly to view the listing of names and find that of a relative killed in the Korean war. We found the displays thought-provoking and sobering.
One of the best museums I have been to,"This museum is huge, so allow plenty of time to look around. It is also highly interactive - a lot of displays have video or re-created scenes. Kids will love it! There is so much here that you'll probably want to visit it over a couple of days, with a few hours each day. Highlights were the display of military hardware outside the museum (which can be accessed even if the museum is closed), and the section explaining the history and progress of the Korean War, which was an eye-opener.One tip - don't bother with the target shooting game, it wasn't worth the wait!"
Great place to visit next time you're in Seoul,"This is a great place to visit to learn about the Korean war and how it was split into two. The exhibits are on multiple levels and they are both in English and Korean. We mostly enjoyed the planes, tanks and rockets outside which you can climb in and touch and inside there is a large turtle ship which you can admire."
Beautifully Curated inside and out,"Cool outside area with tons of planes, helicopters and tanks on display - we thought this was the only part open while we were here and spend 30-40 minutes here alone. Lots to see and read!Inside is beautifully put together - had to be expensive to build and yet is free! touch screens everywhere with tons of info on them. Interesting settings for walk through life size dioramas. Creative areas for videos.I came along for my husband and really enjoyed it!"
Lots of airplanes.,Lots of airplanes outside that you can climb into and a very good exhibit inside telling about the war history. I was very impressed by the large building too. 
multi media tribute to soldiers and Korean history,"With 4D movies and many special effects displays, it is easy to understand and be moved by the Korean history at this museum. Has all exhibits in English and Korean and special events in the lower level. Worth the trip!"
Peace & Memories,"thousands of soldiers from worldwide died in this war, they lied under the stone with their names on it, that we could never forget the brought by war, and heros who sacrificed themselves for freedom. "
Brave Korean People,"The real-life crisis of a country divided in two by outside parties, waging war back and forth across their tiny country over five years with the only outcome being a highly divided country - a tragedy at all levels but a testament to human revolve."
"A great, great museum","I have been to the memorial several times and still enjoy it. It looks like Cecil B. Demill (sic) would create. A gigantic beautiful building that looks somewhat like it was in the movie Cleopatra, houses many items, big and small. One of the two beautiful open wings have the names of the Korean soldiers killed and the other wing, has the names of the Allied countries souldiers killed in action during the Korean War. It is especially impressive as they have broken down the U.S. soldiers by their their states. The admission fee is very small. Everything from a U.S. B-52 and a captured Northern Korean submarine are outside in the surrounding grounds. Many captured weapon systems, planes, large guns and electronics are also there. It is hard to believe a P-51 is sitting outside in the weather. Inside the building, the place is packed and the use of different lighting is outstanding. The recreated battle scenes in miniature are the best I have seen. I could go on and on but I would be using the same positive words to describe this great museum. Trust me on this one, it is well worth a visit."
Great museum with interactive attractions for kids,"Exceptional display of tanks, aircraft and rockets outside. Inside the museum offers enormous displays about the Korean war, but also about theirinvolvement in Vietnam which serves propaganda purposes. Movies available. The war experience is more for Koreans in view of the language."
tear jerking,"and defintely eye opening! War Memorials always hit home hard, but this one in particular! It leaves you understanding what and why the Koreans and the Japanese don't see eye to eye and the attrocities carried out on the Korean people!"
Great museum,We really enjoyed our visit to the War Memorial.Free entrance and a lot to see and to discover.There is a coffee shop too at the entrance too.
Interesting display of arms..,"I really loved the exhibits there! My eyes are wide open to experience the army tanks, ships, planes and etc at close range! "
So much history!,"The War Memorial of Korea is a fantastic place to learn about some of the darkest moments in the history of Korea. What I loved about the museum is that entry is free, plus there are loads of things that will keep everyone occupied, even those who are not normally fans of museums. For example I really enjoyed the 4D war fighter experience as well as the outside area where you will find loads of tanks, heavy artillery, choppers and planes including a B52 Bomber that you can climb up! All in all a fun day and very memorable!"
Why is this great museum FREE?!,"The War Memorial of Korea is easy to find by exiting Exits 11 or 12 at the Samgakji subway stop. You can't miss it with its imposing architecture and a large statue of a South Korean soldier hugging his adversary.This is an amazing place, made more amazing because it's free. The grounds outside the Memorial is beautifully landscaped. I felt very small as I approached the building, with it towering ominously over me. Inside, not only does the Memorial teach about the Korean War, they also did a fantastic job humanizing the conflict. Never did I felt they glorified war. This Memorial kept me thoroughly entertained for 3 to 4 hours.During my trip, there were many young Korean soldiers there on what was apparently a company field trip.My only (slight) disappointment was that a wing of the museum was off-limits under renovation.When leaving, I put a few thousand wons in the donation box. There's no way I can leave without paying anything for my many well-spent hours there."
Korean Military History,"We mistakenly thought this would be focused on the ""Korean War"" but found ourselves immersed in the entire, complex military history of Korea. I am far from a history buff and often a victim of museum burn-out, but still found the to be extremely engaging and educational. Well worth the visit."
Overwhelmed,"Till today, South Korea tributes, respect and commerate its war heroes and also the UN forces who died during the Korean War. A tinge of sadness washes over me as I walk pass the statue of brothers, where the Koreans wish for national peace, reconcilation and reunification is still not within reach."
Good look at history,"Great exhibits, easy to walk around and explore without a guide. Check out the planes and tanks outside of the museum for some history "
Interesting Tourist Landmark.,The War Memorial of Korea is a good place to visit to learn about the Korean War conflict. It has a lot to offer and has many displays. If history and war is your thing then this is the place for you. 
Best free attraction in Seoul,"Fantastic (admittedly biased) museum of military history. Planes and tanks aplenty, and interesting displays inside with plenty of signage in English. And even an electronic rifle range to practice your sharpshooting. Moving memorials to the Korean War dead too. At certain points in the year they also do military precision drill displays on a Friday afternoon so I'll be back for that for sure..."
It would take 3-day to see it all,This is an amazing place. Outside has planes and tanks from WW II thru Korean War to Viet Nam and today.
WOW - Seoul Favorite,"I can't say enough wonderful things about this exhibit. When we arrived, we fully expected to pay. When we approached the ""English"" desk, she gave us a brochure and told us it was FREE. Can you imagine??? All the written explanations are in Korean and English. Our 6-year old son was busy in a museum for hours and hours! This a the most WELL DONE museum I have been to. Hands down a must do in Seoul!"
The history of armed conflict in Korea,"Before I came to the museum, I thought it was about the Korean War, but it's actually about any conflict that has involved Korean people, ever. There's lots of displays, from stone daggers, to a mockup of a fortress, to a mockup turtle ship, to Korean war items and a Korean war theatre and Korean war diarama experience.I spent about 4 hours there, and I can't read Korean (so I wasn't stopping to read all the displays, just to look at everything). They have loads of vehicles used in the Korean War on display outside, as well as some cool statues at the front of the museum. The English language pamphlet was pretty helpful and informative. I would go again."
Another must visit in Korea.,"There is a lot to see in the war memorial of Korea. I definitely learned a lot about Koreans and their dedication towards their country on my visit here. Its worth scrutinizing all the War Vehicles and Aircraft's, don't be surprised if you find yourself on the midst of War yourself."
Korean war artifacts,If yue are interested in military technologynand late 20 century military eventsbamust see. Quite interestingbartifactsband memorablia. Museum shop needs a bit more interesting gift ideas. Korean war ration for example?
Fantastic exhibits,"Lovely collection of old fighter planes, tanks, helicopters and missiles! Even witnessed a wedding ceremony there. A very odd but interesting venue."
worth a trip,"Spent a sunday afternoon here, not too busy and the place is large so you can spread out from others and wander.The museum is free and has grounds to walk around with numerous interesting sculptures as well as an impressive collection of decommissioned tanks, planes, boats that you can wander between and even get into some. As someone who doesn't know much about the Korean war or the history of the relationships between Japan, China and Korea I found the museum very informative. The displays on the Korean war are modern featuring videos and touch screens that allow you to pick from about 4 languages including english. All mounted displays have information in Korean and English. There is a 4-D theatre ( didnt have a chance to get into this), coffee shop and little gift shop. Glad I went and would recommend it for a rainy day."
you know seoulmate?,"Seoulmate provide FREE SEOUL TOUR. They have 11 tour courses, and this War Memorial of Korea is one of the tour courses. If you will go with seoul mate, you can feel real seoul."
Good attraction to visit,"Lots of old planes, ship, guns, tanks,etc... on display to see and to take pics. Museum has lots to see and read on the history of the Korean war."
Closed because of fashion week!,We went to the War memorial of Korea but found to our disappointment that it was closed because of fashion week. This wasn't even announced on their website. We were really excited to go there and the more the disappointment because of fashion week. How could we know this since it wasn't on their website; what are they thinking. The attaction itself is probably worth all 5 stars.
the best museum ever,"It hits you!I really enjoyed it.I never seen anything like it,great monuments and war equipment from little guns to massive bombers.!Everyone who is into Army shoud defo visit!"
Seoul Fashion Week,Great venue for this event and continued to see plenty of tourists visit the museum whilst i was there for 7 days!
worth seeing,"deep depiction of the korean war through the korean's eyes. a must if you're a military buff. also a large ""park"" full of tanks, choppers, planes...etc"
For the,"This museum is very big so you can easily spend an most of your day here if you want to. The 4D-cinema is a bit tacky and can be skipped, but the rest is interesting. Please bear in mind that the musem has a strong South Korean perspective of the 1953-war."
Nice Place to visit,The War Memorial of Korea is quite interesting place to visit which has to be visited it you are a tourist to South Korea . Well while visiting this place at one time a felt afraid of the sound of cry and all those destruction . Its just real . 
Lovely monument,"The museum is beautifully done. The monuments to fallen soldiers inside and outside the museum is touching. Especially enjoyed the interviews of soldiers & documents (containing war operation orders).There's a large amount of military tanks, jets, helicopters, firearms on show; if that kind of thing floats your boat."
Colorful and informative and FREE!,This museum features a series of exhibits showing the history of Korea and their involvement in various wars through history including the internal wars between different Korean dynasties in old times as well as wars between Korea and Japan and China in ancient times. There are also displays of contemporary conflicts. The museum is so clean and the front desk speaks good English. The displays are all in at least two languages--Korean and English-- and many also are written in Mandarin. Detailed exhibits and many films are all for free and very informative. There is also a very clean and reasonably priced restaurant with some nice food next to the museum if you get hungry.Many guide books do not even mention this exciting museum but it is well worth a visit.
Interesting,This was a good morning visit. Very informative and well organised. Good value for money. Would go there again.
Intresting visit,"I like visiting the Memorial, but the museum felt kind of empty. There is a lot of stuff to see, in a very big space. "
Detailed portrail of the Korean War,"(Closed on Mondays.)Although the museum contains many fascinating historical pieces from the stone age onward, the main attraction is definitely the displays related to the Korean War. This is shown through pictures, weapons, movies, official documents, interactive screens, miniature recreations, and full-scale war machines. The fountain at the end of the ground floor is also worth a visit: it reminds of Indiana Jones."
not just about the korean war,this museum surprisingly has a very good collection of artifacts.has wonderful displays about the korean war for those who like modern history.also has a display for the spring 2011 tragedy South Korea lost a number of sailors from alleged North Korea torpedo attack.one of the better war museum i visited.
Moving memorial,The War memorial was amazing and the extent of information was surprising. The grounds and the building were extremely well kept.
"fantastic, best museum ive been to","amazing place, free to get in and we got a free english speaking guide who took us round, they even have a 4d cinema which you ride in, definately worth a trip, very near the big n tower, we did both in an afternoon. Now have a better understanding of the korean war and its history"
"Beautiful, calming atmosphere","the building is large, and has a lot to show.the Hall entrance is well designed, with lighting etc. and the hall itself has a very beautiful and touching picture.On the outside, there's a striking sculpture, and the overall panorama is very good and the atmosphere is very calming and really shows appreciation to South Korean heroes.The only thing lacking for me is the variation of food with economic price."
Educational visit but got bored,"The sanctuary of National Defense or the war memorial of Korea is located in the heart of the city. We reached the by a subway. This museum contains various records of the war and soldiers including remains of their forefathers who devoted their lives for their country.The war museum consists of 6 indoor exhibition rooms (the memorial hall, the war history room, the Korean was room, the expeditionary forces room, the ROK armed forces room, the large & defense equipment room) and an outdoor exhibition area of military equipment.Honestly, I got bored after a while though dont get me wrong, the items are well kept and an audio guide is available for better understanding of the exhibit (rental fee is 2,000 won or approx. $2). I guess too much information and seeing a lot of war items can be overwhelming but it is worth a visit.admission is free. closed on mondays. 09:00-18:00"
"Get educated on the ""Forgotten War""","The Koreans are very serious about their struggle with North Korea. If you don't know much about the situation, do yourself a favor and go to the multiple war memorials in and around Seoul. "
Wasn't much to see,"It is a nice monument, but we got bored after looking at about a floor and a half. However, it does have the coolest kids area I've ever seen. There are bounce castles that are bigger than rooms, and many of them!"
"kids friendly, but doesn't explain the reasons of the Korean war at all","Pro; Very kids friendly. Con: didn't explain the reasons of the Korean war at all, I was so curious. But I think it could be because it's such a political issue that you don't want the visitors from the 'other' side of the war countries feel unwelcomed or hated. But I still think there should be at least some basic objective tellings."
Impressive,"This museum is definitely worth a visit if you have an interest in military history or Korean history in general. I was, however, disappointed in the lack of information on the Korean War. The lower level deals w/the military history of Korea going back to their warring states period. Then the upper floor deals w/modern warfare. I was hoping to get more information of the war between what would become N.&S. Korea. Unfortunately, it was very sparse. Just the U.N. decision for America to help defend what would be S.Korea. Overall, very nice."
Informative and Enjoyable,"With an 8hr stop over in Seoul I hopped on the train at Incheon and off to see the memorial. It was well worth it and I could have stayed longer than the 3hrs I was there. It was very interesting reading about the long history of conflicts in which the Koreans have been involved, either actively or as peace keepers and especially the history of the more recent Nth K/Sth K stand off. I would have enjoyed more time looking at the outside exhibits of the planes, tanks, and artillery but ran out of time. If time for you has a a limit I suggest perhaps starting outside first then 'following the arrows' inside where you can pick and choose what to spend more time reading about and skip past the things that interest you less. They've done a great job putting it together and this is well recommended."
Awesome Your Guides - For FREE,My dad and I went and first of all the museum is free. Second we got a free tour guide who was born and raised in the DMZ. pretty cool and awesome!
History overview,"The war memorial gives a good overview of Korean history. The three floors show how the country was rebuild after the war, as well as early history. Outside a number of war relics (tanks, vehicles, planes) displayed."
Nice,"An interesting place to visit if you are into military history. Has some pretty touching parts (the busts of Korean war heroes) and some fun parts as well. You can walk around the outside and see many different kinds of military equipment on display, everything from tanks to trucks to planes. Even some Naval stuff."
Interesting and informative,"This museum is full of hands on exhibits and large reproductions. The turtle boats used to fight off the Japanese fleets are especially interesting,"
A regular place I bring my pal.,The War Museum is a place where I bring all of my friends that are new to the area or that are here visiting for the first time. There are often traveling exhibits here as well. 
Surprisingly honest,"I'll be the first to admit that I'm probably not the one who's been to most museums, but that's mostly because most museums I've been at have failed to catch my true interest and attention. When it first occurred to me Seoul had the War Memorial of Korea, I thought to myself that it must at least be very informative when looking at Korea's huge history with war. And boy it didn't disappoint. It's easy to see it's very influenced by USA, let's ignore that and just appreciate the depth this museum has. Not only is the museum huge, it covers the older wars with their neighbors but also Vietnam (it even had an exhibition about the Danish contribution to the Korean wars, even though it wasn't a lot.. IN DANISH!) and whatever military struggle Korea's been in, and there's a lot. A lot of the displays are incredibly well made and most of it is in English so you don't have to be an expert in Hangul to appreciate it. At the back of the museum they've filled the yard with military vehicles, tanks, cannons, helicopters and planes. Impressive museum. And free!"
Interesting and informative!,"Really big, need a few hours (maybe 3 or 4?) to really see the whole thing.Loads of things to see inside, as well as outside.Gift shop and lockers (I think free?) if you don't want to carry around your stuff!It's a really nice memorial, very moving and informative.I have been here a few times and will probably go there again. Must do in Seoul. Do it!"
Turtle Ship and Korea War were my favorite displays,"My favorite display was the full size ""Turtle Ship"". We have a model of this ship in Newport News Virginia at the Mariner's Museum, so I found it fascinating. I found the Korean War displays to be extremely well prepared and laid out."
Emotionally Evocative,"The War Memorial of Korea is proof that, though we may call it the ""Forgotten War"" in the US, it is not forgotten in Korea. It was moving to see everything it had to offer and the gratitude of the people for the assistance of the UN forces during the conflict. "
Good place to visit,Nice location.. heart of city where you find lot of calmness and decent time to spent. You can read the stories of war leaders and spend good time there.. I do not say must visit place in Korea.. but good place to see in center of city...
Fascinating place to visit,"It's a great way to spend a few hours and learn the history of the Korean War. It was free when I went the last couple times. They've greatly improved the area that talks about the Korean War in the museum since I first visited the museum in the 90s. There is a ""4D"" movie experience that shows how General MacArthur led ""Operation Chromite"", and it's free; the drawback is that it is fairly short (about 8 minutes) and only 15 people can see it at a time. Be prepared for a wait if you really want to see it. You're not really missing out if you don't see it. Also there's a little shooting gallery that runs every so often, and takes six people at a time. You get 20 shots, then they shoo you off. "
They do a great chronology of events,"Overall this was a very good museum. I was more interested in learning about the Japanese occupation of Korea. This is not that so much as it is about the aftermath of Japan's defeat in WWII. Still, there was a fun little 3D movie with motion seats in which Gen. MacArthur was revealed as a brilliant strategist. I never knew that, but given the outcome, I do thank him as do the people of South Korea. I did not realize that the Korean war was ground zero at the time of the fight between communists and capitalism. Very well done overall. On the lower level, there are minor displays of the many other invasions of Korea over the centuries with some beautiful costumes of the day. Worth seeing."
Moving and fascinating memorial.,An amazing place. A little trouble to get to but well worth the visit. Incredible amount of war machines but little exact mention of recent history.
A good place to spend half a day,"An excellent museum to visit, especially on a hot day when you don't feel like walking outside. A detailed look at how warfare evolved in Korea. Although some sections involving the Korean War may be a tad biased, it is very educational. Excellent value, considering it is a free admission."
Really Interesting,"Of course tells you all about the Korean War but what was really interesting was all the planes, tanks and assorted other war vehicles which were on display."
"Impressive, Free entrance","The bottom floor covers the pre-Korean war period. Then there are two floors that we liked best which cover the Korean war and the period between 1953 and now. They are very interesting and it will take you several hours to see them. There are several short 2D, 3D and 4D movies (4D = 3D + some movement). We loved the 7 minute 4D movie about Operation Chromite (general MacArthur's sea landing at Incheon).Start with the planes and tanks parked outside, to the right, and make sure you don't miss the Soviet T-34 and USA Sherman tanks parked next to each other. Until now I always thought the T-34s were much bulkier than the Shermans."
Epic,While the scale of the war museum is large and invokes awe in its scale you do get stuck with the feeling that most of it is geared towards the Korean public. I did though enjoy the historic artifacts of war. There was also two new displays at the museum.
History abounds,It is easy to spend a whole day here looking around. The museum is very well put together and very thoughtful. It tells the story of just not the most recent Korean war but all the conflicts that have played out on the Korean peninsula for the last centuries. The signage is all bilingual in Korean and English (maybe even French too) Video footage is also subtitled or voice overed in English tearing down all language barriers. Admission fee very reasonable to gain so much insight into Asian history. Easy access by Samgakji subway or by taxi from Yongsan/Itaewon area.
Good place to spend an hour or two,"I was surprised to find that the ""war history"" at this museum dates all the way back to ancient times. I was just expecting a Korean war memorial museum when I entered. I felt the best parts of the museum were the ancient war artifacts on display, the replica ""turtle ship"" on the lower floor and the collection of modern aircraft/ships positioned outside. The good-it was free for foreigners to enter. It is an impressive building and is very clean and well maintained. The gift shop was reasonably priced and had souvenirs I haven't found anywhere else in Korea. Nice gifts for vets especially. The ""not great""-In the summer heat it was incredibly hot in this museum. I don't think they had a/c on, or if they did, it was not effective in such a large place. Also the day we went there was a large protest going on directly in front of the entrance. We weren't threatened or harrased, but it made touring the outside displays unpleasant. I'm told this is a common place to protest. "
Memorable place,"Visiting this place you understand how peace is fragile. There are many units of military techniques (tanks, fighters e.a.) for observation."
Good place to learn about history,"I spent a couple of hours here watching the movies (good but maybe would have liked English subtitles). There are a lot of things to see, including finding out all of the places South Korea has sent their military out across the world. The Korean War exhibit was very good."
Chilling yet satisfying,One of the most poignant places in Korea to visit. Best to go with someone who has a profound knowledge of the Korean War. 
Nicely Done.,The War Memorial does a nice job explaining the history of war in Korea. A very nice memorial on the 1st floor for people who lost their lives during the Korea War. 
A moving experience,A testiment to the local and international efforts and sacrifices of persons and families only 50 odd or so years ago. An artistic and emotional tribute to the best and worst we are.
dedicate a day to visit,"This was an incredible place to visit, with three stories of displays, and a full armament of tanks, boats and planes outdoors. I particularly liked the display dedicated to the Korean War. Give yourself at least half a day to visit though, as the place is huge. The convenient cafeteria outside the building (Food Mart sign) has great meals for KRW 6000"
Very Interesting,"This museum is very interesting in its coverage of all wars involving Korea going back to the dynasties of the seventh century or so. My particular interest, however, were the WWII and Korean War eras. These were indeed covered very thoroughly in a very engaging manner. The displays were very informative and I learned quite a lot. It is interesting to get the Korean perspective on these events. I recommend this museum if you have any interest at all in this subject matter."
Korean War Memorial,"Very well organized and well presented. large collection of military hardware from Korean war to the present, everything from a captured North Korean T 34 to a B 52 bomber. Also Korean patrol boat shot up by North Koreans and mini subs for infiltration. Well worth your time."
Cool,Got to touch great old war planes. Didn't liked the fact it was too close to post.
Excellent museum,"A very large war museum, with extensive displays both inside and out, not entirely confined to the Korean war. Worth a stop (on the Seoul City Bus Tour, the hop on - hop off bus), although perhaps a quick stop for those not especially interested in military things. The evocative statue at the front of the museum is worth the visit itself."
A complete history of the Korean war,This place is definitely worth visiting if you're in Seoul. It offers insight into the sad history of Korean war
An excellent place to learn about the Korean War,"I spend a whole day at the War Memorial, Seoul. Much time is devoted to the three Korean War rooms without neglecting the other parts of the museum, going thru each item and exhibition in detail, watching and reflecting. It is an excellent venue to learn the South Korean version of the Korean War (1950 to 1953). I have experienced the 3-D exhibition of the North Korean attack, gone thru the 4-D Incheon Amphibious Landing Operation Experience, and tried the 3-D F16 flight simulation. Multilingual (English, Japanese, Chinese and Korean) volunteer guides are at the reception desk ready to help those in need. This museum boasts an impressive array of heavy military weapons and equipment in the outdoor exhibition area, including a B-52 strategic bomber, which was not born at the time of the Korean War but was extensively used some 15 year later in the Vietnam War. Nevertheless, not even in the Vietnam War Museum in Hu Chi Min City could I find one when I was traveling there. By the way, the Korean War actually set a world record and was registered at the Guinness World Records Book on Sept 3, 2010. The Guinness book states: the most countries to support an ally in war is 67 and was achieved by nations supporting the Republic of Korea during the Korean War of 1950-1953."
View the wastes of war.,"Visiting this museum, keep in mind what the money spent on war could do for humanity if we didn't wage war"
goog war museum,very big war museum. very well done. gives you a god perspective of what happened during the Korean War. lots of references to General MacArthur.
Better than London Imperial War Museum,It was raining and we decided to go to the museum - great choice. You could learn lot of from history and see even modern Korean weapons. Majority of texts are translated to English.
Good family activity,"we have two teenagers and one four-year old boy, and we all loved it ! for different reasons - history (very detailed and good for build up knowledge to understand Korea); the arm display, the 3D movie experience, etc. Highly recommended for all ages !"
worth visiting,"i like the war machines displayed, and also is accessible by subway"
Somewhat overrated and militaristic,"This is far from the #1 place in Seoul that some people say (visit the National Museum of Korea well before this, in other words!). I was in Seoul for two weeks and only got there on my last day and edited the time down to one hour. The encyclopaedic coverage on level 3 of every conflict that the ROK has been involved in means it was rather militaristic from my point of view - explains why so many armed forces personnel were on visits there I guess. Level 2, which deals with the Korean war, is obviously the most important, as earlier Korean military history receives similar but not as detailed coverage in other Korean museums. Given the 60 year stand off with the North and the virtual ""on alert"" status since then of the armed forces you can begin to understand how ingrained in the Korean mind potential(if not perhaps imminent) conflict is."
good experience,"you can know about Korean history.Im very interested in history.So if you are interested in history,must go."
Incredible!,If you like history this is the place to be. It outlines Korean war history from ancient man to modern times. The artifacts are incredible. There are English speaking translators if you need help. A very educational and family friendly experience. 
Fantastic museum - MUST GO!,"Probably the #1 place I visited while in Seoul, even better than the DMZ and all of the shopping we did. The first thing you see when you step onto their grounds is all of the amazing, grandiose war statues and fighter planes that are bigger than life. Before we even got into the museum, we were treated to an unexpected show of one of the special army groups practicing their formation routine. The museum is just so interesting and educational, and our time there really flew by. We spent about 2-3 hours there, which is about right unless you are a huge history buff.Highly recommend!! The free admission was just icing on top!"
Here's What Shapes the Korean Mindset,"The building is imposing, along with dramatic bronze sculptures outside and acres of tanks, planes, ships, and all the equipment of war. I learned enough about the Korean conflict of the 1950's to appreciate its complexity (along with now understanding the U.S. role in how the country was divided to begin with following WWII). You leave with a sense of the war's ongoing presence, one section is dedicated to North Korean incursions into the South over the last 50 years. This war is not yet over. I was also struck with the LONG history of military conflict that goes back hundreds and hundreds of years. War has shaped the Korean understanding and impacted its cultural expression for more than a thousand years. We were there along with scores of school children on field trips and that moved us along a little faster than I would have liked. An early morning visit would be advised. There's a nice snack bar to the right as you enter. There was also a free locker to leave coats or extra items you don't want to carry through the building."
Fantastic museum,"Kinda creepy that they have a ""how to don a gas mask"" area for kids, but probably necessary. Great exhibits."
Very interesting 1/2 day out,Liked - It was so well laid out and informativeDosliked - nothing
A must see in Seoul,"The sculpture park in the museum grounds is fascinating and the exhibits are very moving. There is a large display of American and Korean aircraft, tanks and missiles, and a Korean Naval vessel too. Inside the museum, the displays are very informative and everything is in both Korean and English. Other languages are represented by information leaflets and guides. The exhibits are a mixture of historical artifacts, wax model displays and video documentaries. The museum can be a little disorientating at times, and the actual War Memorial section is on the upper floor (as you enter) with other floors representing other time periods in Korean history. In the central atrium area there is a large boat which was rather fun I thought. It was a very educational day afternoon. "
sobering reminiscence,"The Korean War Memorial museum was an expansive and well-done grounds with 4-D experience of Incheon landing.I think this war needs to be remembered and would have appreciated a little more about real people's experience. It is heavily military, but as a military history experience is it good.I was there on a day with many elderly Koreans - and some of the men were looking at the large equipment, going over every detail, laughing while shaking their heads in reminiscence of what they had survived. And many did not survive this horrible period of Korean history. I wanted more of their story - not just weaponry."
"NICE TOUCH, BUT SPARSE","Touching visit.....as you walk through the corridors, one can feel the massive sacrifices of men and women from all sides. Once again, war is ravaging and meaningless. The countless battles and the final stalemate at the 38th parallel - is still plain for all to see today. The exhibits are well presented - but the massive size of the hall makes the exhibits seem sparse and unconnected. Perhaps, I could not read Korean....and the English notices were few and did not delve deep enough to give a foreign visitor a deeper appreciation of the stories left untold. One hour and I was out.....unlike the Imperial War Museum in London or the museums in the USA."
very moving experience,part of tour busy lots of visitors crowded friendly people
"Massive museum, moving experience","Large static display of military vehicles and aircraft, Well done museum and memorial. I would call it a ""must see"" for vistiors to Seoul, especially if you are a history buff."
a great insight into Korean history,"We had a brilliant day at the War Memorial - one of the highlights of our visit to Seoul. The aircraft and tanks out the front of the museum are fascinating (although take a hat!) so make sure you allow time to walk through everything here. Inside the museum is huge so give yourself a couple of hours to see everything. The museum starts with the prehistoric history of Korea, moving through the Shilla history and then has a large section on the Korean War which is done very well with replica villages to walk through, various videos and footage from the time. It then moves on the the UN and what is being done today. Lockers are available on the right at the entrance to the museum. The only disappointment was the cafe was very basic and only served coffee and cake where as we really wanted lunch meaning that we had to leave the museum earlier than we would have liked in search of food."
Very boring,"Sorry, it was not we had been looking for. Boring screens, tanks, helicopters. Not living memory Of The nation"
A moving afternoon,"I spent a reflective afternoon at the War Memorial and was impressed by the collection of aircraft, tanks and other memorabilia that were located outside of the main building. There was also a traditional Korean wedding ceremony occurring during my visit and it was a memorable contrast from the armaments. This is not only a memorial of the war, inside the main building there is a well organized and informative cross section of Korean history. Well worth the visit!"
must visit,"get there on the subway but allow a couple of hours at the memorial as it covers korean history over the centuries,"
Very Informative,"Historical and informative. Well done, spacious and chronicles historical military significance back to the Turtle Ship replica in the basement."
Sobering Place and worth visiting,"The memorial is a very sobering place considering Korea's history. A great collection of military hardware, planes,helicopters, a boat and tanks,etc. There is one tank where you insert a 500 won coin and the tank starts to move - a great laugh and brings the kids running "
Excellent,Great museum. The planes and tanks they have outside are worth the visit alone
Very cool. Love the outside displays.,Outside displays very cool but was surprised to find it closed on a Monday.
Great Museum for adults and for kids,"I was a bit concerned going here, but it is truly impressive and I would recommend it to travelers that are looking for something to do on a hot or rainy day. There are a number of planes and tanks outside that my kids spent about 30 minutes playing around. The exhibits are well made inside as well. I think some of the rooms could use some light, but overall really spectacular."
Piece of Korean HIstory,Come for a better understanding of the consequences of war ad to pay tribute to those that have fallen
Ant warfare,"A little bit outdated, expect have some more advanced warfare mechanic dispayed"
Just increased my rating of this place,"I just visited this museum again and am increasing my rating of it. Last time, I stated that I was disappointed because it did not have more information about the Korean War. However, after visiting again yesterday, I just realized that the wing with all of the Korean War history was closed for renovation on my first visit.Yesterday, I showed up with my family, and a school girl saw us and offered to give us a free tour (she is volunteering for community service hours). She took us through the Korean War history wing first (it just re-opened in March). Then I took my family through the rest of the museum. This place is really great; some of the best things are outside where they have actual tanks, artillery, aircraft, and even a boat that the military has used over the years.One more thing - it is free! Even free parking!Well worth seeing and a must-see attraction in Seoul!"
Sobering,"An excellent museum with free access, we could have spent a day there. The only disappointment was the amount of schoolchildren visiting. They were noisy and disrespectful"
"If you like hardware, you will love this place","Every kind of military hardware used in the Korean War or by Korean forces in subsequent conflicts is on display here. Row upon row of tanks, planes, helicopters, etc. There is even a B-52! The museum also contains historic materials on the Korean War, walls of names of those who fell defending South Korea, etc. It's a moving and slightly strange place. The South Korean patrol boat that was shot up by the North in 2010 or 2011 is there (the Norther attackers were sunk). All the shell holes from the North's attack are outlined in red paint. There are also some very interesting statues on the grounds. When I was there in 2010, by chance on the anniversary of the end of the Korean War, we witnessed a bizarre interpretive dance. Good cheap food in the cafeteria. Lots of little kids on school field trips drawing bloody battle scenes for class credit. Go see it for yourself. "
Really impressive,"WE were advised by a friend to visit this museum and did so on our first day in Seoul. This was really impressive. I am a bit of a history enthusiast so for me it was a given but even my wife was hugely impressed. I had read up on Korean history and the Korean War but she had not and it was a crash course for her. Partly indoors, partly outdoors, exhibits of tanks, rocket launchers, bombers, and jets - even a patrol/torpedo boat. But exhibits inside were the best. The exhibits took one through the Koean War with great displays and films, selectable in Korean, English, Japanese or Chinese. And the basement was dedicate to exhibits, maps covering period 500 to about 1800AD.THere were a lot of schoolchildren around and it was impressive the respect they showed towards the exhibits, the war period, and those that died.You will need almost a day to give this justice"
"Awesome museum, very educational!","This place is well worth a visit. The exhibits are amazing and quite comprehensive. You will learn a lot about Korean history if you take your time to appreciate all that is presented. The exterior naval and aviation exhibits are particularly interesting to explore, especially if you have kids. "
An inseparable part of Korean history.,"It is a very moving memorial, and Koreans come from great distances to pay their respects to their martyrs. It is usually crowded. Pay at least a brief visit"
Worth your time,"If you are interested, it is a great place.If you are not, you will be after visiting.But taking better care of the airplanes outside is necessary otherwise they will just rot there!"
Old war tanks and fighter planes outside,"The exterior exhibition showcasing war ships, fighter jets, tanks and destroyers was the highlight. We spend close to an hour outside taking photos, reading up on the Korean war, and enjoying the beautiful sunny morning. Located not too far from the US army base in Yong San, this war memorial is a must-see. Great for the kids as well."
Cool memorial,"Walked around there with a friend. Wasn't overwhelmed, but enjoyed it. Cool replicas of ships, planes, etc."
What is written in English is interesting.,"A nice half day trip, especially if it's sunny. The first 2 exhibition halls are interesting to read and learn about the wars. Not many ""interactive"" installments etc."
very informative,"if you want to know more about the korean war, this is the place to go. a great place to walk around with kids too, with the abundance of old aeroplanes and war vehicles they can try on :)"
Interesting account of the war,"It was a busy day when I visited but I would still probably bet I was the only person in the museum that had also visited the North Korean equivalent - The Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum in Pyongyang.It was interesting comparing the two, and of course the Seoul version provides a much more rounded and historially accurate account. However it's possible to see propaganda from the South too - eg there are war crimes by the North documented here, but the terrible atrocities committed by the South at the time are absent.Outside there are some large sculptures and quite an extensive display of military hardware from both sides, as well as two of the massive loudspeaker systems used at the DMZ for psychological warfare until the operation was halted in 2004."
Best War Museum,This museum was so descriptive and extensive in their information that you get to know every little detail about it. everything you wanted to know was available in English. Also it was not biased towards the Koreans. it was simply the best Museum (and im not a big fan of Museums). i would truly recommend this to anyone going to korea
A great place to learn about Korean history,"The place is huge. The outdoors had all the modern and old military vehicles and planes including a B-52 bomber and then inside has various rooms explaing about the Korean history and the Korean war. It has a restaurant which works a bit like a school canteen, it was cheap but average food. The place is very popular with school kids coming for excursions. When we were there, at 2pm Friday, they performed military shows with sword battles, military bands, parades etc aimed for the school kids."
Really interesting,Definitely worth it to go. Has a scary list of the amount of people who died in the war.
Nice place if you are into military machinery,"Lots of aircraft, tanks, missile launchers etc on display"
Guided Tour,"I took a guided tour proved in English by the museum. Our guide was an older gentleman that shared his wealth of knowledge about each item in the museum. As with most of Korea, there is an English translation next to every item. If you enjoy history and have a few hours to spare I recommend one of the tours at the War Memorial. "
War Memorial & Museum,"very nice place! informative and educational. best of all, free entrance!"
Educational,"I;m one that is not into warfare or anything related, so this place was a bit depressing for me. But my husband loved it. It was very... educational for me. I learned the reason why there's a north and south korea.I learned how twisted North Koreans are.There's a display of armory which I think guys will like."
Awesome Display of Armory!,"For a tourist coming from the Philippines, we were in awe and amazed with the vast war memorabilia and the great display of military equipment since our own military has yet to implement their modernization program. Head statues of the war heroes were displayed at the center of the building. We took a photo of the rockets displayed outside since we don't have one here in our country. A war ship is also on display with varied sizes of bullet dents from the enemy. A big statue of brothers is at the side entrance and i think it's touching to depict two brothers from two Koreas (North and South) meeting in a battlefield and expressing reconciliation, love, and forgiveness."
"Very touching, excellent museum to visit","Very touching, excellent museum to visit. I put this right up there with the ones in Washington, DC. So many lost there lives which I am so grateful for, the museum had no charge to the public, it was free."
Fascinating,The museum is very large and we didn't have chance to see all of it. The quality of the displays is excellent with a variety of methods used to convey the history. Recommended.
A great museum. A great learning opportunity.,"I was really impressed with the quality of this museum. The admission was free, which is always nice. Most of the museum focuses on the Korean War, but there are also other sections explains Korea's involvement in other wars such at the Vietnam War and the Persian Gulf War. The Korean War is especially interesting to learn about because it involved so many different countries who allied with South Korea. The Korean War actually holds the Guinness Record for having the most allies in a single war (67 allies). If you like learning about recent wars, this is a definite place to visit"
Proabably more objective than the Pyongyang version,The Korean War sections are a little jingoistic at times but that is to be expected given the current geography and lasting memories of those terrible times 60 years ago. Most of the displays are multilingual and some nice effort has gone into the AV presentations. There's more than enough millitary hardware around to keep the average 12 yr od boy (or 42 yrold man in my case) happy for hours and the outdoor memorials are both impressive and poignant and worth spending time viewing so wrap up warm on a cold day as it's a bit exposed out there.
Must See,I took all my friends who vist Korea first time and I have never seen such a big and beautiful museum in my lifebigger and neat then compare with others in india
Definetly worth seeing,"Well done, very respectfull place with a great deal of history and information. I would recomend aprox 8 year old children and up for both enjoyment as well as educational value. It may be a bit too advanced for the little one's, however parents who know how to see an attraction on the fastrack before it becomes too tiresome for the wee ones could get through this inside of a couple of hrs if need be. Not far from central Seoul, could easily be combined with other downtown sites... Free attraction, well worth taking a look, you will not be disappointed."
A Tribute to the Korean War Effort,Had to visit the Korean War Memorial Museum as my dad fought in the Korean War. Many bits of Korean War History as well as history of the the Korean War with N Korea. Great displays and the 'Hall of Memorials' to Fallen Soldiers very moving.
My teenage son can't get enough of this place.,"If you like video games you'll love this place. Actual missiles, rockets, tanks, warship, all kinds of ww2 airplanes, helicopters and more."
A great laydown of the Korean War,"It's a great location to go see what brought this great nation from it's humble beginnings to the powerhouse it is today. First the good. It's not expensive and most weekends it's absolutely free. Tours are offered in English and other languages ... if they can get volunteers. The Koreans sincerely appreciated the UN help for the defense of their country and they will tell you that repeatedly. The museum is laid out on the timeline pre-war to post-war with a display of current weaponary the Korean Army uses today. Now the bad, there really isn't any downside to the museum. It's located between 3 different metro lines, the US base, and the Korean Army HQ. I-Park mall is about a 10 minute walk or you can go to Itaewon 10 minutes the other direction. "
A fascinating insight...,....into Korea's history. A well maintained and presented museum with a lovely cafe inside. 
Beautiful place to spend some hours,"I loved this place, after review the information here I decided to go and visit, very interesting to visit and was free to visit."
Not to be missed!,Don't miss this place its amazing. This place really moves you emotionally.
STOP. MUST SEE.,My husband was really impressed with this place. I'm glad we made time to see it. 
Worth a visit but other attractions may be higher priority,"Impressive and moving wall of names of fallen soldiers from every country that fought to defend South Korea in the Korean War. Nice lifesized dioramas of Vietnam and Korean War era involvements; left me hungry for more on the Korean War. The mueum has a broad scope of Korean wartime history, from ancient times to present. If you want Korean culture, the most interesting and informative is the Folk Museum; Korean history is in the equally fantastic National Museum; and there are specialty museums (all free) about King Sejong, the proponent of the Hangul alphabet, and about Admiral Yi, who thrashed Japanese invaders with his turtle boats. The war memorial is huge and has a mix of displays for all ages."
Worth a look,"as the war is part of what defines Korea, the museum is central and easy to navigate! There's even a wedding hall attached, where some friends of mine married. . . making it just that little bit of weird many of us know as ""only in Korea""."
Impressive. A great learning experience,"Free entry, beautiful and great for history lovers. This museum takes about 5 hours to get through. The highlight is the impressive outdoor display of artillery, tanks, battleship and aircraft. Although most displays did not have English translation, it was a very moving experience."
Very Nice & Informative,The Memorial is very informative and laid out well... It's especially nice to be able to find the names of your relatives that fought in the war. 
Interesting exhibitions,Well worth a visit. Shows you how difficult life has been for Koreans in the past.
Worth more than one visit.,"I am not a history or military buff but I have visited this museum several times and always enjoy it. Korean history is very long and filled with fascinating wars and military actions. This museum gives a wonderful overview of it all. Most of the signs are in English and there are English docents nearby to help you find your way around. It is very easy to navigate through the War Museum and it never feels crowded. It is vast so start early if you want to try to see it all. There is usually a revolving exhibit space that shows new exhibits that are not military based if you need a break from the wars. However, you must pay a nominal fee for these. In addition, there are all manner of military machines outside for viewing. Don't miss the gift shop, it has some very unique and fairly priced items. Several are open to exploration and the kids love that! This museum is very easy to get to using the 4 or 6 subway line at Samgakji Station or the 110 bus. You can walk to it from Iteawon as well."
Very Nice,"OK, so I am partial to military museums because I was in the Air Force for 20 years. But this one is pretty nice. I was disappointed that they did not have more informaiton and history about the Korean War (at least not in English), but the amount of displays in the museum is really pretty good! They have everything from bullets to aircraft - tanks, a few boats, etc. Certainly worth doing. Most of the museum is inside, but there are some aircraft, missiles, and vehicles outside - so you can do this on either a nice day or a rainy day."
A moving experience,"A lot of the museum is great, some is mediocre, but there are plenty of different aspects of the Memorial that make it very much worth a visit. As an American, there is a deeper emotional attachment to the displays and information from the Korean War."
Interesting,"Too big to see all of it in one short trip via the City Bus Tour, well worth a second visit."
Nice museum but could do much better,I was hoping to learn in depth about the Korean war and ongoing cold (hot?) war with North Korea. There were good exhibits but could have been organized better. There are many videos but it feels scattered and you are only absorbing the fragments of the history. Also there is not much exhibits on the current status with the North. I had a good time but at the same time a little disappointed.
Fascinating History,This country had an unique history that can best be understood here. View people realize how close the Korean war was to another world war and how many countries assisted.
Great turtle ship,"The turtle ships were instrumental in defeating the Japanese during the Japanese invasions of Korea in the 16th century. The scale replica of an actual turtle ship helps one to understand how they were so imprenetrable. The tanks, etc outside are very impressive as well."
Impressive,"My favorite part was exploring the planes, boats and tanks outside. The indoor exhibits were very interesting as well, but all that walking on the marble floors got to me after a while."
Great Museum,"This was an interesting 1/2 day out. Kids should love the outside exhibts, lots of planes, tanks, helicpoters, some of which you can climb on. I was surprised at the free entry, also when I visited Gunther von Hagen's Bodyworks was there (extra cost) this I really enjoyed though my husband was less keen i think the bisected head freaked him out a little, though the local kids seem to take it all in their stride. If you like history this should be high on your agenda as there were lots of uniforms and wepons to see, and a whole section devoted to both the korean and vietnam wars."
Must Go and See,"the memorial is big and well set up with all information. the most exciting part is the outdoor area with many military tan, fir force and marine there that you can spent more than hours to enjoy."
War Machine inside the city,"Jaw dropping to see many tanks, artillery, aircraft and even battleship!!"
History!,"Learned a lot about the history of South Korea against the North, and China. It's relationship with the US and the wars of Vietnam, Korean War and current involvement."
excellent,Will take a few hours to see everything. Bring your camera! I took a picture of all the war vets from my state.
Interesting attraction!,"If you're new to the country, this beautiful memorial is a must! We spent a couple hours here over the summer and it was very moving to learn more about the history of Korea. Sadly, not all signs are in English - which takes away a little bit from the experience. But still - the statues outside, busts, turtle-back-ship, etc. are out of this world. I highly recommend!"
A must-see in Seoul,"This museum tells the story of Korea from the perspective of wars and invasions. Given how many there have been in Korean history, that's pretty much all of it. The parts about ancient Korean history and the warring kingdoms of mediaeval times gets a bit wearing for the foreigner; but the two top floors, which are devoted to the Korean War, are must-sees, as are the aircraft, guns and tanks on display outside the museum. As this is also the site of the Korean War Memorial, the complex takes its name from that statue, which is also a necessary part of any visit. Allow at least a couple of hours."
Beautiful place for learning and reflecting.,"I recommend stopping by this place for at least an hour or two. There is a quiet somberness that is reflected, just like certain monuments in Washington, D.C. There is a lot to look at while walking, both inside and out. There is a big display of static aircraft and artillery with English translations as well. Lots of statues, and a large, quiet hall with the names of lost Korean soldiers engraved on pillars. While you are in Korea, I really recommend taking a moment to reflect and learn more about what happened there, especially since this is the most defining moment of modern Korean history."
very impressed!,"Good innovation of the museum, very impressed, suitable for people who are not into history and perfect for those who are into it. A good place to visit with free admissions."
Interesting place to learn Korean war history,"We didn't plan to visit this museum on the first place, but while reading its review here, I gave it a shot on one of my free day in Seoul.I like this place more than other museum in Seoul, and they have real plane and ship on display.The museum is located not far from the subway station, only 5 min walking distant.We planned to spend just couple hours here, turned out we spent almost 4 hours as there are so much things to see. It is a must-visit if you come to Seoul.One more thing, the museum also provide free lockers!"
A must-see in Seoul,"This place explains so much of Korea's past, both old and recent and helps any first-timer get a good understanding of why Korea is the way it is. Even if military history isn't your bag it is worth turning up in the morning to see the guard-changing display with twirling rifles and co-ordinated marching! But the explanation of the Korean War, the very sombre plaques listing all of the dead and the mind-boggling display of military hardware outside really make it a great place to spend half a day on your sight-seeing agenda."
REALLY comprehensive -- More a museum than a memorial,"We only had allocated an hour thinking this was a ""Memorial"" -- it is much more of a museum. LOTS of hands on exhibits both inside and out. Outside had all SORTS of boats, tanks, planes, etc on exhibit for exploring. Inside several floors of really excellent exhibits. Very comprehensive and made a good attempt to provided a balanced and unbiased perspective. Many varied exhibits, well laid out and good descriptions. Negative: LOTS of screaming, yelling, running, & pushing kids (I wanted to SLAP a couple and I am usually pretty happy to see kids in a museum learning). The overwhelming NOISE drove us out of a number of rooms. Seemed most were unsupervised and just running wild. Not sure if it was a school holiday or something, but it was too much for us. "
Very interesting for those who enjoy military history through the ages,"The memorial has marble slabs and bronze slabs with names of the fallen...important to remember. Enjoyed seeing the early war implements...stone axes, arrows heads, etc...transition thru the ages to use of metal...later, machines of war-cannons, etc. When you grow up in the western world, teachings of Asian history are limited...thus, it was interesting to see the small displays of western military excursions into Korea. Also, interesting to learn a little about Korea's military struggles with her neighbors-China & Japan thru-out the centuries. Information and displays provided are brief, but interesting. The visit is definitely worthwhile."
memorable and interesting,Interesting and want to revisit again as there is some renovation done on the compound of the museum. Understand that Korea people pay high price to get the peace and learn to apprieciate peace enviroment without war. Salute to all the Korean Heros.
War memorial with korean point of view,large museum with many stands to discover war in korea history. Korean point of view showing there are good guy what ever type of wars.
Amazing place,Definitely worth a visit for the history and the beautiful building.
So glad we didn't miss it!,"This museum was not on our list but we happened to pass it while on a tour. We came back in the afternoon and we were not disappointing. We spent several hours outside and didn't even have time to see the inside. The art is exceptional and you get to see planes, boats, trucks, tanks, and more up close. It is very easy to get to from the subway."
Very moving museum and memorial,"The Korean War Museum and Memorial focuses primarily on the Korean War, but covers all conflicts. There is an inside museum as well as a large area on the outside that consists of a memorial - very beautiful and moving sculptures - as well a large display of war vehicles from tanks and trucks to airplanes and ships. The inside displays include exhibits that show the impact of the Korean War on civilians, as well as military. It is not just for folks interested in military history, it is really a moving experience. There are also some exhibits geared towards children."
A good stop to understand the reality of the Korean peninsula,"WIth all the fun shopping, eating and culture in Seoul, it may be hard to find the time in a trip to work in a War Museum. You should. I'd encourage people to visit this Memorial/Museum to learn a bit about the Korean War (which is the primary focus) but also about recent history - there is an exhibit on the 2010 torpedo attack on the South Korean boat - they ahd the actual torpedo parts that they salvaged from the wreck. The oustide static displays are REALLY complete - how DID they get the B-52 into downtown Seoul??? - and cover land, sea and air. Do a quick walk-through (it's free) or stop, watch all the videos (most are available in Korean, English and Japanese) and browse for 3-4 hours - but do your self a afavor a make time for this museum. The Memorial Hall is also a beautiful bit of architecture - one of the nicer memorials I've been to around the world.It's closed on Mondays. The website has an Englsih section for more details."
Strongly Recommended,"I wish this place was more publicized because I think a lot of visitors to Seoul will end up missing it. In my opinion, there isn't much history in South Korea that will appeal to tourists who have visited ancient sites in places like China, Greece, or Egypt. For this reason, I think the 20th century history of South Korea is its niche. This museum is a great place to start as it is loaded with old tanks, planes, and war artifacts. While it's not limited to just the Korean War, that was the largest and most fascinating part to me. All of the exhibits were tastefully done, and the chronology of the war was well explained. There is also a great section saluting each nation who came to South Korea's aid during the war.It does lack more extensive English at times, but there were free English tours led by US military volunteers on the day we went. I read conflicting things about the price, but it ended up being free- not sure if this is the norm though. Regardless, the published price is usually between 2,000-4,000 won which is definitely worth it.The website has pretty good directions of how to get there... BUT I would recommend NOT walking from the Line 1 station, but the closer one (can't recall which line). Even if that means having to transfer from Line 1, the transfer will be a shorter walk underground than the walk to the museum from the Line 1 exit. Go there!"
"Superior military museum, but a bit limited for English-only","For those interested in military history, this is a must-see. Fifth star is missing as those reliant on English only will miss out on some of the descriptors. Took me three hours to go through the entire building at a leisurely pace."
An amazing place for people interested in military history,"The Korean War Memorial is an absolutely amazing place. The name ""war memorial"" is a bit misleading for Americans, who think of a memorial as a static display similar to the Vietnam Wall or the WWII Memorial in Washington, DC. ""War Museum of Korea"" would be a better title for this place.The facility is absolutely huge. Outside are several statues and monuments, including a tremendously moving piece showing two brothers, divided by the war, reunited on the battlefield. There are over 100 pieces of military equipment on display outside, ranging from the Korean War-era to modern.Another moving section outside is the honor roll, the names of every Soldier / sailor / pilot from every country that fought on the UN side. That's true gratitude, and truly amazing as we don't even have a legitimate Korean War memorial in the US.Inside I expected to find a brief history of the Korean War 1950-1953. The museum actually covers the military history of Korea from ancient times through modern day. The Korean War is covered in great detail and is traveler-friendly; most of the maps and video clips of the war are narrated in multiple languages.I spent over 4 hours at the museum and was only about 75% done when I had to leave. I look forward to returning and finishing my visit!If you have any interest in military history, this museum is a must-see."
